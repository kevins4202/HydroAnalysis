20115,quantifying the spatiotemporal variation of water scarcity is critical for identifying strategies to support sustainable management of water resources and associated food energy systems to this end several assessments have attempted to provide a global mapping of water scarcity with a number of underlying methodological choices scarcity metrics vary in their definitions and thresholds for scarce conditions to prevail we review these methodologies in the context of the biophysical and socio economic setting of india we suggest four avenues for improving metric assessments to increase policy relevance incorporation of surface water groundwater interactions along with non renewable groundwater resources accounting for minimum environmental flows consideration of deep uncertainties and addressing underlying socio economic disparities in metric assessment keywords water scarcity india metrics blue water green water population 1 introduction water crisis continues to be a threat to india s sustainable development goals increasing population and water intensive lifestyles coupled with deeply uncertain future climate change are likely to create significant uncertainty regarding future water availability across india as of 2017 the total renewable water resources per capita in india is estimated at 1080 m3 year which is lower than the global average of 5732 m3 person year 14 several assessments identify india as a water scarcity hot spot 3 19 29 44 53 a recent study estimated nearly 1 billion people living under water scarcity in india 34 recent analyses considering the impact of changing climate and increasing population on india s future water availability also suggest increases in water scarcity as we transition from a 1 5 c warmer world to a 2 0 c warmer world 47 despite a large number of studies that attempt to map the spatiotemporal extent of india s water scarcity relatively few examples can be found of their use in policy making we could identify a few issues that lead to this beginning with the proliferation of available scarcity metrics 23 32 52 58 some focus on per capita water availability while others estimate the ratio of demand to supply of water 32 the definition of available water also varies across studies along with the spatiotemporal resolution of underlying observational or modeled datasets used to arrive at estimates 32 overall this leads to large variations in the estimated population under risk of water scarcity second scarcity assessments often assume critical thresholds of water scarcity metrics to identify vulnerable populations while there is some evidence to show that commonly used thresholds such as 1700 m3 year for per capita water availability are probably linked with the sufficiency of locally renewable water resources there can be regional disparities in critical thresholds that need further investigation hanasaki et al 2018 third most studies focus on certain future periods such as mid century or end of century the specific trajectory of socioeconomic development tied closely to climate change signals undertaken by a region is therefore not considered this issue is crucial for india where median projections for river runoff are greater for end of century than mid century under different projected scenarios indicating that regions are likely to undergo greater water scarcity in near future than far future 47 fourth uncertainties due to climate and population change are included by identifying various scenarios of change 21 44 however further studies are needed to discern how such uncertainties should eventually guide policy making see e g 38 and finally extremes such as droughts and floods are not generally considered except a few very recent studies that show that when considering extremes much more population can be at risk 1 27 in a recent analysis singh and kumar 47 assessed the relative importance of population and climate changes on determining future water availability across india the analysis identified regional differences in dominant factors driving water scarcity indicating that policy approaches may have to differ depending upon the main driver of scarcity for example in regions where physical water scarcity is likely the main driver behind classifying a region as water scarce augmenting supplies and reducing demands would be required on the other hand in regions with plentiful water resources such as north eastern india the rapid urbanization is likely to drive water scarcity in the future in such conditions capacity building and focusing on infrastructure development would be the key to cope with water scarcity while this analysis provided interesting insights further studies that explore such connections between climate and demographic changes are needed to realistically model the time evolving nature of water scarcity in india the goal of this article is to understand the likely causes that stigmatize the quick adoption of existing scarcity quantification in decision making related to water resources we discuss two main issues in this article the issue of multiple metrics and the quantification of underlying uncertainty thereafter we showcase the likely difference in perceptions of water scarcity that arise due to different methodological choices of water scarcity metrics we conclude by discussing possible improvements in data collection or methodologies considering the requirement of planning agencies section 2 presents an overview of water scarcity metrics for global water scarcity assessments used in recent literature this is followed by section 3 that provides a summary of uncertainty quantification methods section 4 presents a comparative analysis of the metrics for india section 5 synthesizes these concepts in the context of india 2 water scarcity metrics a review of global studies mapping the spatiotemporal variation of global water scarcity in line with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development target 6 4 2 has become fundamental to identify strategies for sustainable management of global water resources and associated water food energy nexus 12 several attempts have been made in the past three decades to assess the spatio temporal variations of global water scarcity table 1 these assessments have led to an evolving picture of water scarcity and its relation to human water use while our understanding of water scarcity grew so did the methodological choices in quantifying this metric resulting in a proliferation of indicators with different approaches to estimate water scarcity 32 2 1 methodological choices in quantification of water scarcity metrics methodological choices related to quantifying water available in a region range from using river discharge blue water including surface water and near surface shallow groundwater storages mined deeper groundwater blue water green water soil moisture fed by direct precipitation or a combination of these estimates of river discharge can be naturalized or impacted depending on whether human impacts are accounted for or not human impacts are diverse ranging from direct interventions like building of dams and reservoirs to groundwater abstractions for meeting water demands like domestic use or growing foods irrigation 59 60 the latter has led to unsustainable depletion of groundwater across several regions throughout the globe 7 10 11 13 18 40 41 54 blue water is not the only available water to humans a significant portion of incoming precipitation may be used for evapotranspiration by food crops either directly from precipitation as soil moisture or interception supplemented by irrigation with surface or shallow ground water sources this green water over agricultural lands is eventually embedded in food 10 24 thus inter regional trade of water can also alter the water availability in a region food grain export out of a region indicates loss of available water resources as virtual water and vice versa green water stress can emerge in agriculture areas where less water is available due to historically low rainfalls when high proportion of precipitation is lost as blue water or irrigation facilities are poorly developed thus considerations of water quality grey water interactions between blue green water sources and virtual water trade impacts water available in a region 10 45 51 52 scarcity metrics have similar methodological choices regarding their definitions and thresholds for scarce conditions to prevail scarcity can be due to the tension between available water and water requirements for various uses in a region including human and environmental needs 52 in this interpretation it is quantified by combining information on available water and consumption or withdrawal patterns alternatively scarcity can be also quantified using water shortage indicators that estimate water available per person sometimes after discounting for environmental needs typically minimum environmental flows mefs requirements are not explicitly considered in the quantification of water scarcity metrics when the metric value falls below a selected threshold it indicates a possibility of conflicts between human and environmental needs some analyses however assume mef requirements and deducted the same from natural runoff prior to calculation of water availability for example mekonnen and hoekstra 34 allocate 80 of natural runoff as mefs leaving only 20 of runoff for human use which is considered as blue water available the choice of spatio temporal dimensions also affects the perception of scarcity assessments range from grid scale to basin scale and from daily to decadal scales the most common approach is to conduct a grid level analysis for long term water availability from which results can be aggregated to coarser spatial resolution mekonnen and hoekstra 34 has shown that the temporal resolution of analysis can significantly alter the estimates of population living under water stressed conditions similarly coarser spatial resolution may mask the underlying spatial disparities in water availability finally the social dimensions of water availability are rarely explored in model driven studies often modelling studies provide an estimate of physical water scarcity but the prevailing socio political context truly determines the availability of water at the scale of households 33 56 for example while the coastal city of mumbai india falls in a region of plentiful water resources a high percentage of slum population have limited access to clean drinking water 43 this indicates that gross level analysis needs to be complemented by associated socio economic analysis that quantifies level of access similar challenges for basin wide planning of water resources have been highlighted by akhter 2 2 2 role of uncertainties in future climatic and socio economic conditions the seminal study by vorosmarty et al 53 provides one of the first global maps of water scarcity focusing on likely impacts of long term climate and population changes since then incorporating changing socio economic and climate conditions has been a part of water scarcity assessments recent studies include many possible socio economic change pathways so that potential uncertainties in exposed population living under water scarcity can be highlighted however climate change projections especially for precipitation remain highly uncertain 26 similarly evolution of the coupled human natural system places limitations on our ability to project prevailing socio economic conditions decades into the future the challenge is that many natural and human systems can exhibit threshold based behaviour transitioning to new stable regimes within a short period of time 48 such uncertainties regarding the system when experts cannot agree on the system model or its characterizing parameterizations are termed as deep uncertainties 8 planning under deep uncertainties requires a paradigm shift in modelling philosophy instead of focusing on likely changes in a variable of interest the safe limits of operation of a policy need to be explored there is a growing body of literature in this area addressing the issue of deep uncertainties in management of ecological and hydrological systems 38 49 however these studies are generally carried out for specific study regions it may be prudent to explore the utility of these approaches in estimating the safe operating climates and socio economic conditions from the perspective of water security at varying spatial scales this approach is likely to shift the focus from projection specific insights to system level insights 3 comparative analysis for india we quantify a commonly used water scarcity metric water available per person using various water availability definitions although we test a limited number of possibilities our goal here is to highlight the critical role of these methodological choices in estimates of the number of people exposed to water scarce conditions across india water availability is quantified using a probabilistic budyko framework box 1 we consider different combinations of blue water green water in addition to accounting for inter regional trade of water and minimum environmental flow requirements the six definitions of water availability that emerge from these are i blue water only ii blue water after accounting for minimum environmental flows iii green water iv green water after accounting for virtual water embedded in food products v sum of blue green water resources estimated from i and iii and vi sum of blue green water resources estimated from ii and iv thus including considerations of minimum environmental flows and virtual water trade the resulting estimates of per capita water availability across india for 1983 2000 using the six definitions present interesting patterns fig 1 a f when only blue water is considered as in many previous analyses 3 5 44 28 53 large parts of the indo gangetic plains and southern india emerge as extremely water scarce per capita water availability 500 m3 year on further accounting for instream environmental requirements regions under extreme water scarcity increases from 16 to 31 and the number of people under extreme water scarcity increase from 209 to 397 million fig 1b instream environmental requirements combined with more conservative stress thresholds increase the number of people under water stress from 481 million to 615 million for a threshold of 1000 m3 year person overall if only blue water is considered water scarcity hotspots emerge in an alarmingly large part of northern and southern india note that the employed framework estimates blue after accounting for the evapotranspiration losses from agricultural and non agricultural land thus the blue water estimates include human abstractions and cannot be considered as naturalized values on considering green water as a proxy for water availability we find low per capita water availability in the indo gangetic plains southern coastal districts and parts of mid western india fig 1b e also note the change in patterns of water scarcity hotspots particularly the emergence of mid western districts as water stressed 1000 m 3 person year farmers in these districts have historically witnessed significant crises 35 but considering blue water alone does not highlight them as highly water stressed regions the population under low green water availability 500 m3 year in northern india increases from 28 to 99 million after accounting for the virtual water trade across india fig 1e thus surprisingly the trade of virtual water trade may increase green water stress in some areas this may happen as regions become centers of agricultural production and export water embedded in products at the cost of local green water stress we demonstrate that the choice of water scarcity thresholds and methodological definitions can have large uncertainty in perception of water scarcity and the resulting exposed population across india fig 1g overall anywhere between 46 million to 778 million people across india may be classified as under water stress based on choice of definitions and stress thresholds both sources of uncertainties i e choice of definitions and thresholds impart similar uncertainties to the output estimates of people under stress on an average across definitions of water availability the number of people across india under water stress are 191 434 and 636 million for thresholds of 500 1000 and 1700 m3 year person respectively on the other hand across different stress thresholds the mean number of people under water stress are 447 492 194 597 504 288 for definitions i to vi respectively to put these numbers into perspective of projected climate scenarios we also estimated the uncertainty in per capita water availability using projections of future climate and population and found that the uncertainties due to future changes in climate alone are smaller than those arising out of varying definitions of water availability fig 2 box 1 a probabilistic budyo framework to estimate water scarcity metrics we estimate long term water availability using only observed long term climate precipitation and temperature data and satellite based actual evapotranspiration using the budyko function 47 the function relates a climate indicator the aridity index ratio of long term potential evapotranspiration to long term precipitation to a water availability indicator the evaporation ratio ratio of long term actual evapotranspiration to long term precipitation we employ a form of the budyko curve with a firm physical basis 15 aet p 1 pet p 1 pet p ω 1 ω where aet is the long term actual evapotranspiration p is the long term precipitation pet is the long term potential evapotranspiration estimated from temperature data 22 and ω is a parameter inferred using historical data a probabilistic approach groups ω inferred from smaller regions to obtain uncertainty ranges for larger regions 20 regions are defined based on earlier virtual water analysis kampman 2008 blue water is estimated as the difference between long term precipitation and actual evapotranspiration assuming changes in storage over multi decadal time scales are zero for green water aet ag estimation we overlay satellite based aet data with the land use map of india extracted from the global land cover dataset for the year 2000 6 aet estimates from cropland areas are considered as green water embedded in crops the analysis was carried out at district level which are fine scale political divisions in india an earlier analysis quantified inter regional trade of virtual water embedded in crops by dividing india into four main zones and estimating the water transferred between these zones by employing data on water budget and crop imports exports see supplementary material for more details to estimate per capita water availability 2001 census of india s district wise population data is used remote sensing based monthly aet product with a spatial resolution of 0 073 8 km available from 1983 2006 is used 57 monthly precipitation data from 1901 2000 for each district is obtained from the indian meteorological department pune india daily maximum and minimum temperature data at a spatial resolution of 1 1 for the period 1951 2000 is available from the same source an overlapping period of 1983 2000 was used to derive the long term estimates of climatic variables districts with less than ten years of overlapping data or in violation of the physical constrains of atmospheric water supply aet p and demand aet pet were removed from the analysis we use a least squares fit to obtain ω 4 enhancing scarcity metrics for policy relevance due to its complex socio economic setting and large variability in physio climatic characteristics the driving forces behind water scarcity are complex and evolving in india considerable resources are being allocated to prepare water budgets at a fine spatial resolution examples of advances include the launch of a national level information portal for water resources information wris https indiawris gov in wris and the continuation of national hydrology project http mowr gov in schemes projects programmes schemes national hydrology project concurrently efforts to understand and mitigate the impact of climate change are also underway https cckpindia nic in similarly groundwater departments exist at central and state level to monitor and manage groundwater resources http cgwb gov in gwresource html an integrated assessment of water scarcity would require synthesis of information across these resources while the commonly available water scarcity metrics provide useful information their adoption by policy makers may be strengthened by further improving in the following aspects 1 integrating surface and groundwater estimates according to recent reports and published research nearly 23 of administrative units in india have already exhausted their groundwater resources as pumping exceeds natural recharge rates 9 11 40 41 54 in these regions non renewable groundwater resources are being pumped to supply irrigation water 10 however a majority of regions are still classified as safe in terms of groundwater resource development 9 thus avenues for conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources exist and may ease the pressure on surface sources however this is challenging given the heterogeneity of the aquifer systems in india that result in varied stream aquifer interactions as well as responses to pumping few studies have proposed ways manage the regional aquifer systems underlying the gangetic plains 25 62 estimating water scarcity by considering these aspects would provide a better picture for policy makers but would require inclusion of recent advancements in global scale surface groundwater modeling to regional assessments 55 several scarcity metrics consider shallow groundwater which interacts with river discharge new perspectives are needed to ascertain whether a combined metric that considers both renewable and non renewable water resources are needed to gain a clearer picture of water scarcity in such regions the main issue is that inclusion of non renewable groundwater in water availability estimates would present a false picture of water sufficiency in principle such resources should be omitted from availability calculations and included only in water use estimates with a greater penalty when compared to renewable sources however no clear guideline has emerged from literature on this critical issue in addition such resources are also hard to quantify for example the unique setting of hard rock aquifers in southern india necessitates development of local models and integration with existing surface water estimates 2 explicit consideration of mefs satisfying human needs often comes into direct conflict with maintenance of aquatic ecosystems this is particularly relevant for india where freshwater resources are already over committed 50 future water scarcity assessments can become more policy relevant if they explicitly account for impact on mefs it would be useful to explore different approaches for mef estimation 36 and evaluate the impact of choices around mefs on resultant scarcity estimates a few studies provide global assessments of mefs or their impacts on water and food availability 17 36 37 for example showed that considering aquatic ecosystem needs resulted in lower boundaries for planetary freshwater consumption for humans more recently paster et al 36 in their study on extensively agriculture dominated areas have shown that maintenance of mefs would require substantial reduction in irrigated areas with a concurrent increase in rain fed regions to meet global food requirements these studies provide a way forward to include mefs in water scarcity assessments though the uncertainty in these estimates warrant further investigations 3 expanding observational networks and improving uncertainty estimation methods almost all the global studies reviewed used a grid with spatial resolution of 0 5 x0 5 or used large river basins for computation of water scarcity indicators table 1 at this resolution river routing processes may not be adequately represented and could introduce errors in runoff computations a more critical issue is that gridded runoff estimates are generally based on water balance models and their parametrization is often based on observed runoff data the density of runoff gages varies considerably in poorly gauged and ungauged parts of the globe the simplification of extrapolating model parametrizations from gauged to ungauged locations results in high degree of uncertainties in runoff simulations ruhi et al 42 show that gage density across the globe has in fact declined in the last decade finally many future estimates of water scarcity ultimately rest on our ability to project the impact of climate change on water availability this procedure is itself fraught with uncertainties arising from different sources including climate model parametrizations and specification of emission scenarios as well as the choice of downscaling and bias correction approaches singh and biswal 46 provide a comprehensive review of available approaches and challenges overall these issues point towards the need for expansion of existing runoff gage networks in india and elsewhere as well as the need for better characterization of uncertainty in contemporary and future runoff simulations focused approaches like prioritizing regions with sensitive ecosystems may help balance economic considerations with prediction accuracy 42 4 consideration of deep uncertainties often estimates of water scarcity are employed for long term water resources planning for example large scale public investments such as inter basin water transfers require an understanding of time evolution of water scarcity in participating basins deep uncertainties regarding the nature of coupled human natural systems implies that policy makers would need a paradigm shift away from scenario specific information instead the robustness of various policy options should be tested against a large number of possible future scenarios 31 38 49 although robustness has gained traction in long term policy analysis in regional water resources management national to global scale analyses still heavily rely on scenario specific projections greve et al 61 provide an assessment of uncertainty in global water scarcity estimate and indicate the need for robust decision making in regions that are likely to witness large uncertainties in future estimates of the metric this promising analysis illustrates the essential need to quantify uncertainties in metric values our quantitative analysis indicates a similarly high uncertainty in assessment of population under water stress across india in regions where water scarcity is hard to quantify either due to disparities emerging from methodological choices or due to deeply uncertain futures decision makers should resort to robust decision making frameworks to design management strategies in lieu of cost benefit analyses 30 38 5 translating water scarcity metrics for a diverse socio economic group the water scarcity metrics aggregated at any spatial resolution city or state or national would always fail to capture the reality that some individuals or communities are inherently more exposed to water risks due to their socio economic disposition only a philosophical transformation in the understanding of water scarcity would address this issue scarcity metrics need to undergo a bottom up transformation water scarcity for whom the possibility to provide a distribution of water scarcity for a spatial unit instead of a single deterministic estimate needs to be explored some regions are likely to show a great variance in water scarcity exposure due to underlying socio economic gaps such regions are likely to need much different policy structures than those where a fairly uniform sharing of scarcity risk is envisioned 5 concluding remarks our analysis highlights the value of uncertainty communication and presents various interpretations of water scarcity indicators that are crucial for the 2030 sustainable development target 6 4 2 of water scarcity despite not considering other dimensions of water scarcity such as water quality temporal variability of water availability climate uncertainties demographic changes etc we still find a very large uncertainty in estimated number of people under water stress in india varying somewhere between 5 and 74 of the country s population the large uncertainties in estimates of the number of people exposed to water scarcity indicates that analyses of water stress should aim to present each of these multiple dimensions of water scarcity to provide policy relevant information in addition we suggest three important ways in which scarcity metrics can be tailored to provide decision relevant information 1 consideration of surface water groundwater interactions and mefs water scarcity metrics should explicitly consider the contribution of surface water and groundwater resources to blue water assessment they also need to account for ecosystem water needs by adjusting blue water estimates based on mefs 2 accounting for deep uncertainties in metric assessment long term planning is fraught with deep uncertainties regarding the future trajectories of the coupled human natural systems thus scarcity metrics and associated quantifications of people under stress need to be re designed to suggest whether the estimates are robust against the various underlying choices in metric assessment 3 physical water scarcity vs socio economic water scarcity metrics need to consider the underlying heterogeneities in access to water resources especially in countries with large economic disparities these assessments would require active collaboration of social scientists with water resource managers to provide novel and reliable metric definitions funding this research received no

threshold of 1000 m3 year person overall if only blue water is considered water scarcity hotspots emerge in an alarmingly large part of northern and southern india note that the employed framework estimates blue after accounting for the evapotranspiration losses from agricultural and non agricultural land thus the blue water estimates include human abstractions and cannot be considered as naturalized values on considering green water as a proxy for water availability we find low per capita water availability in the indo gangetic plains southern coastal districts and parts of mid western india fig 1b e also note the change in patterns of water scarcity hotspots particularly the emergence of mid western districts as water stressed 1000 m 3 person year farmers in these districts have historically witnessed significant crises 35 but considering blue water alone does not highlight them as highly water stressed regions the population under low green water availability 500 m3 year in northern india increases from 28 to 99 million after accounting for the virtual water trade across india fig 1e thus surprisingly the trade of virtual water trade may increase green water stress in some areas this may happen as regions become centers of agricultural production and export water embedded in products at the cost of local green water stress we demonstrate that the choice of water scarcity thresholds and methodological definitions can have large uncertainty in perception of water scarcity and the resulting exposed population across india fig 1g overall anywhere between 46 million to 778 million people across india may be classified as under water stress based on choice of definitions and stress thresholds both sources of uncertainties i e choice of definitions and thresholds impart similar uncertainties to the output estimates of people under stress on an average across definitions of water availability the number of people across india under water stress are 191 434 and 636 million for thresholds of 500 1000 and 1700 m3 year person respectively on the other hand across different stress thresholds the mean number of people under water stress are 447 492 194 597 504 288 for definitions i to vi respectively to put these numbers into perspective of projected climate scenarios we also estimated the uncertainty in per capita water availability using projections of future climate and population and found that the uncertainties due to future changes in climate alone are smaller than those arising out of varying definitions of water availability fig 2 box 1 a probabilistic budyo framework to estimate water scarcity metrics we estimate long term water availability using only observed long term climate precipitation and temperature data and satellite based actual evapotranspiration using the budyko function 47 the function relates a climate indicator the aridity index ratio of long term potential evapotranspiration to long term precipitation to a water availability indicator the evaporation ratio ratio of long term actual evapotranspiration to long term precipitation we employ a form of the budyko curve with a firm physical basis 15 aet p 1 pet p 1 pet p ω 1 ω where aet is the long term actual evapotranspiration p is the long term precipitation pet is the long term potential evapotranspiration estimated from temperature

on earlier virtual water analysis kampman 2008 blue water is estimated as the difference between long term precipitation and actual evapotranspiration assuming changes in storage over multi decadal time scales are zero for green water aet ag estimation we overlay satellite based aet data with the land use map of india extracted from the global land cover dataset for the year 2000 6 aet estimates from cropland areas are considered as green water embedded in crops the analysis was carried out at district level which are fine scale political divisions in india an earlier analysis quantified inter regional trade of virtual water embedded in crops by dividing india into four main zones and estimating the water transferred between these zones by employing data on water budget and crop imports exports see supplementary material for more details to estimate per capita water availability 2001 census of india s district wise population data is used remote sensing based monthly aet

were removed from the analysis we use a least squares fit to obtain ω 4 enhancing scarcity metrics for policy relevance due to its complex socio economic setting and large variability in physio climatic characteristics the driving forces behind water scarcity are complex and evolving in india considerable resources are being allocated to prepare water budgets at a fine spatial resolution examples of advances include the launch of a national level information portal for water resources information wris https indiawris gov in wris and the continuation of national hydrology project http mowr gov in schemes projects programmes schemes national hydrology project concurrently efforts to understand and mitigate the impact of climate change are also underway https cckpindia nic in similarly groundwater departments exist at central and state level to monitor and manage groundwater resources http cgwb gov in gwresource html an integrated assessment of water scarcity would require synthesis of information across these resources while the commonly available water scarcity metrics provide useful information their adoption by policy makers may be strengthened by further improving in the following aspects 1 integrating surface and groundwater estimates according to recent reports and published research nearly 23 of administrative units in india have already exhausted their groundwater resources as pumping exceeds natural recharge rates 9 11 40 41 54 in these regions non renewable groundwater resources are being pumped to supply irrigation water 10 however a majority of regions are still classified as safe in terms of groundwater resource development 9 thus avenues for conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources exist and may ease the pressure on surface sources however this is challenging given the heterogeneity of the aquifer systems in india that result in varied stream aquifer interactions as well as responses to pumping few studies have proposed ways manage the regional aquifer systems underlying the gangetic plains 25 62 estimating water scarcity by considering these aspects would provide a better picture for policy makers but would require inclusion of recent advancements in global scale surface groundwater modeling to regional assessments 55 several scarcity metrics consider shallow groundwater which interacts with river discharge new perspectives are needed to ascertain whether a combined metric that considers both renewable and non renewable water resources are needed to gain a clearer picture of water scarcity in such regions the main issue is that inclusion of non renewable groundwater in water availability estimates would present a false picture of water sufficiency in principle such resources should be omitted from availability calculations and included only in water use estimates with a greater penalty when compared to renewable sources however no clear guideline has emerged from literature on this critical issue in addition such resources are also hard to quantify for example the unique setting of hard rock aquifers in southern india necessitates development of local models and integration with existing surface water estimates 2 explicit consideration of mefs satisfying human needs often comes into direct conflict with maintenance of aquatic ecosystems this is particularly relevant for india where freshwater resources are already over committed 50 future water scarcity assessments can become more policy relevant if they explicitly account for impact on mefs it would be useful to explore different approaches for mef estimation 36 and evaluate the impact of choices around mefs on resultant scarcity estimates a few studies provide global assessments of mefs or their impacts on water and food availability 17 36 37 for example showed that considering aquatic ecosystem needs resulted in lower boundaries for planetary freshwater consumption for humans more recently paster et al 36 in their study on extensively agriculture dominated areas have shown that maintenance of mefs would require substantial reduction in irrigated areas with a concurrent increase in rain fed regions to meet global food requirements these studies provide a way forward to include mefs in water scarcity assessments though the uncertainty in these estimates warrant further investigations 3 expanding observational networks and improving uncertainty estimation methods almost all the global studies reviewed used a grid with spatial resolution of 0 5 x0 5 or used large river basins for computation of water scarcity indicators table 1 at this resolution river routing processes may not be adequately represented and could introduce errors in runoff computations a more critical issue is that gridded runoff estimates are generally based on water balance models and their parametrization is often based on observed runoff data the density of runoff gages varies considerably in poorly gauged and ungauged parts of the globe the simplification of extrapolating model parametrizations from gauged to ungauged locations results in high degree of uncertainties in runoff simulations ruhi et al 42 show that gage density across the globe has in fact declined in the last decade finally many future estimates of water scarcity ultimately rest on our ability to project the impact of climate change on water availability this procedure is itself fraught with uncertainties arising from different sources including climate model parametrizations and specification of emission scenarios as well as the choice of downscaling and bias correction approaches singh and biswal 46 provide a comprehensive review of available approaches and challenges overall these issues point towards the need for expansion of existing runoff gage networks in india and elsewhere as well as the need for better characterization of uncertainty in contemporary and future runoff simulations focused approaches like prioritizing regions with sensitive ecosystems may help balance economic considerations with prediction accuracy 42 4 consideration of deep uncertainties often estimates of water scarcity are employed for long term water resources planning for example large scale public investments such as inter basin water transfers require an understanding of time evolution of water scarcity in participating basins deep uncertainties regarding the nature of coupled human natural systems implies that policy makers would need a paradigm shift away from scenario specific information instead the robustness of various policy options should be tested against a large number of possible future scenarios 31 38 49 although robustness has gained traction in long term policy analysis in regional water resources management national to global scale analyses still heavily rely on scenario specific projections greve et al 61 provide an assessment of uncertainty in global water scarcity estimate and indicate the need for robust decision making in regions that are likely to witness large uncertainties in future estimates of the metric this promising analysis illustrates the essential need to quantify uncertainties in metric values our quantitative analysis indicates a similarly high uncertainty in assessment of population under water stress across india in regions where water scarcity is hard to quantify either due to disparities emerging from methodological choices or due to deeply uncertain futures decision makers should resort to robust decision making frameworks to design management strategies in lieu of cost benefit analyses 30 38 5 translating water scarcity metrics for a diverse socio economic group the water scarcity metrics aggregated at any spatial resolution city or state or national would always fail to capture the reality that some individuals or communities are inherently more exposed to water risks due to their socio economic disposition only a philosophical transformation in the understanding of water scarcity would address this issue scarcity metrics need to undergo a bottom up transformation water scarcity for whom the possibility to provide a distribution of water scarcity for a spatial unit instead of a single deterministic estimate needs to be explored some regions are likely to show a great variance in water scarcity exposure due to underlying socio economic gaps such regions are likely to need much different policy structures than those where a fairly uniform sharing of scarcity risk is envisioned 5 concluding remarks our analysis highlights the value of uncertainty communication and presents various interpretations of water scarcity indicators that are crucial for the 2030 sustainable development target 6 4 2 of water scarcity despite not considering other dimensions of water scarcity such as water quality temporal variability of water availability climate uncertainties demographic changes etc we still find a very large uncertainty in estimated number of people under water stress in india varying somewhere between 5 and 74 of the country s population the large uncertainties in estimates of the number of people exposed to water scarcity indicates that analyses of water stress should aim to present each of these multiple dimensions of water scarcity to provide policy relevant information in addition we suggest three important ways in which scarcity metrics can be tailored to provide decision relevant information 1 consideration of surface water groundwater interactions and mefs water scarcity metrics should explicitly consider the contribution of surface water and groundwater resources to blue water assessment they also need to account for ecosystem water needs by adjusting blue water estimates based on mefs 2 accounting for deep uncertainties in metric assessment long term planning is fraught with deep uncertainties regarding the future trajectories of the coupled human natural systems thus scarcity metrics and associated quantifications of people under stress need to be re designed to suggest whether the estimates are robust against the various underlying choices in metric assessment 3 physical water scarcity vs socio economic water scarcity metrics need to consider the underlying heterogeneities in access to water resources especially in countries with large economic disparities these assessments would require active collaboration of social scientists with water resource managers to provide novel and reliable metric definitions funding this research received no

20116,terrestrial water storage tws accounts for the largest temporal variation in earth s gravity field on contemporary time scale the time variable gravity observations for from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission have been extensively used to estimate tws variations and supplement the sparse in situ hydrological observations we use multivariate statistical tools over gridded time series of monthly tws for an assessment of dominant regional variability and to identify seasonal inter annual and linear trends of tws over india the analyses recognize seasonal variability of tws corresponding to rainfall over india and detect two contrasting positive and negative regional trends which are compared with hydro climatic variables for attributing underlying potential causes these analyses suggest the probable causes of tws variations over the different regions of india like role of reservoirs in central and southern india for increase of tws and groundwater pumping in northern india for tws decline keywords grace eof gw depletion anthropogenic component 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws which integrates surface water sw groundwater gw soil moisture sm snow water storage sns and water in biomass plays a critical role in the earth s water energy and biogeochemical cycles ever increasing demand of water and global climate change which is inducing increased anthropogenic influence on water resources are posing a great challenge for sustainable availability of water thus it is imperative to understand the spatial and temporal variation in tws to meet the future water demands and ensure food security globally this is more pertinent for india as about two third of its huge population depends on agriculture and related sectors that are directly associated to water availability the estimation of tws and its variability are constrained due to lack of sufficient in situ measurements now the availability of time variable gravity observations from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission since 2002 20 has greatly facilitated the assessment of tws over india 21 18 15 2 as well as in other parts of the world 7 though at regional spatial scale the inherent diversity of soil climate and topography in india requires substantial representative in situ data to precisely manage its water resources and it is time consuming and expensive to generate them thus it would be worthwhile to have a synoptic view of spatio temporal variability utilizing grace data in this backdrop utilization of the grace based groundwater storage gws anomalies to identify the large scale groundwater depletion over the northern india is noteworthy 21 however there is a need to harness grace s utility at the basin to regional scale the recent grace data products are processed with advanced tools to correct the inherent bias and leakage error and have been found effective at basin scales 5 19 and provide the scope to extend its applications in this study we use the multivariate empirical orthogonal function eof technique to examine the spatiotemporal variability in tws during 2002 2016 since the time varying gravity fields are spatially correlated the eof method and its extension have been used to decompose the grace tws anomalies into space and time components 8 6 9 asoka et al 2 employed the eof method to grace gws to explain the anthropogenic effect of groundwater irrigation over india we extend the analyses further using both tws and available water aw combination of gws and surface water to illustrate the respective dominant signal of groundwater and surface water in tws further results obtained using grace data are validated with in situ groundwater and surface water storage observations 2 data the time variable gravity measurements of gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite grace are inverted to estimate mass changes at different time scale the grace mission operated by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa of the united states and the german aerospace centre dlr have been providing temporal gravity data since 2002 20 the monthly gravity field solutions processed by csr gfz jpl are available as spherical harmonics and gravity anomalies in equivalent water height ewh cm we use the recent grace mascon solution version rl05 processed by csr at 0 50 0 50 grids of monthly interval from 2002 to 2016 this mascon gridded data is found effective for tws estimates at basin scale 5 19 and characterized by better signal to noise ratio as it has prior constraints while processing along with the application of advances in destriping and gaussian filters in india tws is mainly comprised of surface water sw groundwater gw and soil moisture sm the contribution of snow water storage sns is negligible barring some patches of the northern himalaya catchment in this study we also analysed available water aw consisting mainly of surface and groundwater storage we obtained aw by isolating the soil moisture component of tws since in situ soil moisture in not available at the spatio temporal scale matching with that of tws we use the simulated soil moisture of nasa s global land data assimilation system gldas 17 the simulated data are generated through four models such as the community land model clm noah mosaic variable infiltration capacity vic model these models have used the bias corrected ecmwf reanalysis data noaa cmap gdas atmospheric analysis fields and argmet and provide output in three hourly and monthly time scales at 0 250 and 10 spatial grids since 1979 we use the monthly soil moisture at 0 250 0 250 grid spacing of the gldas noah lsm model and re gridded it using the bi linear interpolation to obtain aw from tws thus in regions where surface water resources are scarce the changes in aw is obviously modulated by groundwater storage gws rainfall is the primary contributor of both surface and groundwater resources and thus modulates the spatio temporal variation of tws to understand the contribution and correspondence we use the rainfall data of trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b43 v7 this modelled rainfall rate for each month is based on 3 hour averages derived from the satellite data of trmm and ground truth data from cams global gridded rain gauge data and global rain gauge product of global precipitation climatology centre gpcc http disc sci gsfc nasa gov precipitation documentation this monthly rainfall product at the 0 250 0 250 spatial grid tmpa 3b43 v7 compares well with the in situ data with the minimum least squared errors 4 we converted the original rainfall rate to accumulated rainfall in cm per grid to make it consistent with that of grace tws and also normalized before analysis it has also been noticed that there is a time difference of about two months in the highest values of rainfall between observed rainfall and accumulated rainfall used in this study the surface water sw is comprised of the reservoir water storage billion cubic meter bcm whereas the in situ groundwater levels meter below ground level mbgl records are from the monitoring networks of the central ground water board cgwb these data were obtained from the publicly available water resources information system wris http www india wris nrsc gov in particularly we use continuous records of water level monitoring wells and reservoir storage of individual reservoirs from 2005 to 2017 the water level depths in the wells are converted to groundwater storage δs according to cgwb gec 2015 guidelines and then converted to ewh format henceforth gw and normalized regarding normalization of all the datasets a uniform procedure is followed i e data mean standard deviation for ease in comparison specific yield is determined according to the aquifer geology reservoir storage is normalised for further analysis and is called sw hence forth for this study we have used data of specific areas rather than that of entire india the areas used are described in the appropriate sections reservoir data is used only for narmada basin and gw data is used only of a specific area in the ganga basin the locations are discussed in detail in the results and discussion 3 methods time dependent change in surface processes is reflected in time variable gravity often more than one process contributes to this change and temporal gravity represents the sum total of these changes behaviour of each of these processes especially pertaining to hydrology of india across space and time is studied the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis is a well known technique for understanding the statistical pattern of spatio temporal data 23 12 which was introduced to earth sciences by lorenz 10 this methodology has recently been used to decompose the spatio temporal variability of tws at the regional and global scales 8 6 2 9 the basic principle is the decomposition of a centred stochastic process into a combination of linear orthogonal functions also called basis functions that are infinite for the continuous case and finite and dimensionality bound for the discrete case data are first arranged as a spatio temporal matrix centred and detrended following the algorithm developed by toumazou and creteaux 23 then they are decomposed into their constituent basis function representing the spatio temporal pattern as follows 1 d d λ ϕ t where d is the pre processed data matrix i e an m dimensional vector of time series n and is centred then the eofs are calculated as 2 x ek μ k e k o r d λ ϕ t k μ k λ θ e k t where μ is the eof explaining variation along the spatial dimension and e the principal component pc explains variation along the temporal dimension the eigen value of each eigenvector is the proportion of explained variance these basis functions and occur in associated pairs each such pair is called a mode physical interpretation of each of these modes in terms of hydrological geophysical processes is possible 8 in this study singular value decomposition svd algorithm of matlab is employed for calculating the eof this is defined as 3 s v d d λ ϕ t μ k ψ e k where ψ is the vector containing eigen values of each mode and k represents the number of total basis functions k min n m mutually uncorrelated orthogonal modes are possible only for a gaussian process 23 since the gravitational fields represent the multivariate gaussian structure eof is appropriate to identify the independent modes 3 1 rainfall statistics monthly average rainfall from trmm and its statistical derivatives accumulated precipitation and standardized precipitation index spi are used in this study spi is calculated following the 11 algorithm i e as the z score of the gamma distribution of precipitation g x x 0 g x w h e r e g x 1 β α τ α x α 1 e x β x is precipitation α and β are scale factor and shape parameter 5 τ α i s t h e g a m m a f u n c t i o n z score of g x is calculated using the approximations given by abramowitz and stegun 1 throughout the paper the term rainfall implies direct rainfall from trmm and accumulated precipitation is mention whenever used the terms are not interchangeable 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatio temporal variations in tws terrestrial water storage tws is the vertically integrated water volume of any grid block comprising all the water in different sub surface and surface layer s water i e moisture sm and groundwater gw surface water sw including snow and ice storage sns 3 6 δ t w s δ g w δ s w δ s m δ s w e sns component in tws for study area is neglected as the himalaya part of the catchment containing snow and ice are not a part of the analysis tws definition is thus 7 δ t w s δ g w δ s w δ s m magnitude of water storage and its sequestration in the sub surface depends on rainfall intensity and the local hydro geological conditions hence indirect calculation of tws from rainfall requires the rainfall hydrogeology empirical relations to be properly defined and modelled as such to calculate tws indirectly from rainfall which is the most extensively available climatological variable a detailed study of the hydro geological characteristics of the study area is necessary further the river basins in india are subject to extensive anthropogenic alteration due to the dam structures across the river courses for different purposes so as rainfall patterns shift under the influence of warming trends added to deeper abstraction and the new specific yield is yet to be determined 15 failing which the existing models of indirect tws determination do falter grace on the other hand provides a direct tws estimate as such using grace tws opens the possibility to eliminate errors related to non availability of knowledge base the spatial depiction of tws trends reflects a broad bipolar distribution of contrasting anomalies fig 1 that is the storage depletion over northern india and gain over south central india however a critical inspection suggests a kind of stripping within these two dominant features within northern india the hot spot region of storage loss centred around new delhi consisting of punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh is consistent with previous studies e g 21 the other dominant signal is the tws declines in the high rainfall regions of north east india and the adjacent trans boundary parts similarly in south central india the water storage gain is centred around the narmada basin encircled the eof analysis of monthly tws that follows a 12 month cycle indicates the first mode to have captured about 52 of the total variability fig 2 a the temporal variation of the normalized first mode the principal component 1 pc1 resonates the monthly rainfall variations it is noticed from time series that the lowest values are in the month of may and highest values are in the month of october its spatial pattern i e eof1 broadly corresponds to the rainfall pattern of the country the high rainfall regions of north eastern and eastern parts the low rainfall regions of northern jammu and kashmir western deserts and southern arid parts the amplitude of tws varies between 10 and 40 cm of ewh and does not linearly relate to rainfall due to the differences in the hydrogeological setting a high correlation coefficient is also found between tws pc1 and accumulated rainfall 0 9 at zero lag as displayed in the correlogram plot fig 2b the oscillating behaviour of the correlogram is also indicative of the direct contribution of rainfall to tws variability fig 3 a presents eof mode 1 of deseasonalized tws it is interesting to note that the pc1 accounts a large proportion 84 of the total variation the corresponding spatial pattern eof mode1 resembles the distribution of tws trends in fig 1 the long term variability of tws primarily consists of two contrasting anomalies a declining trend over delhi region and rising trend over the narmada basin which stand out clearly compared to other basins of southern india as observed in previous studies 22 the storage rise encompasses the indira sagar reservoir on the narmada river and also other major reservoirs such as sardar sarovar ukai and upper tapi marked in black dots as well as areas outside of the reservoirs these anomalies depletion of the ganga and rise of narmada river basins are probably caused due to the anthropogenic interferences we therefore focus on these two hotspots to understand different drivers to explain the tws changes normalized time series of soil moisture rainfall gw sw time series averaged over the anomaly areas are compared fig 3b c reservoir levels of the reservoirs mentioned above and gw well data of the wells located inside the ganga basin anomaly area marked are used the normalized time series of hydro climatic variables indicates that in the hotspot of ganga basin rainfall the primary contributor of tws has been consistently decreasing since 2013 particularly the biennial drought of 2014 and 2015 13 seems to have accelerated further the already declining tws and in situ groundwater gw storage the soil moisture anomalies also follow the rainfall pattern characterized by a stable variability until the 2009 drought and then a cycle of rise and fall note that despite the prominent episode of excess rainfall during 2010 2012 water storage continued to deplete this is indicative of the complex interactions of climate and anthropogenic factors on aquifer 16 which has led to groundwater pumping at the rate far more that the replenishment or recharge rate yet surprisingly the in situ groundwater storage experiences a stable pattern in last few years fig 3b this may be due to the response of shallow water tables to extreme rainfalls or due to unavailability of groundwater to pursue the current level of agricultural intensification and thus a reduction of cropping practices in contrast tws has distinctly increased following the 2008 and 2009 droughts in the narmada river basin which can be attributed to surface water storage practices it is notable that despite rainfall failures and drastic reduction in soil moisture in 2014 and 2015 tws continued to be stable while anthropogenic pressure in terms of groundwater pumping is insignificant in the narmada river basin the major role played here is that of the non climatic factor i e reservoirs consistently surface water sw stored in reservoirs shows steady increases and thus explains the tws increases particularly following the 2009 drought further under ideal conditions this reservoir storage can contribute to local soil moisture and groundwater thereby contributing to a total increase in tws in the area beyond the reservoirs boundaries 4 2 spatio temporal variations in available water aw we also employed the eof analyses over available water aw gridded data in order to distinguish and compare with that of tws fig 4 the first eof mode i e pc1 of aw explains a relatively lower percentage of variation 67 compared to the deseasonalized tws but its spatial distribution is unlike tws the negative values are spread over the northern region and a strong positive anomaly is located over south central region the causes of these variabilities are varied the major cause of decreasing trend in the norther region is over exploitation of groundwater whereas the interannual variability of rainfall recharging the groundwater sources is main cause in the central southern region munagapati phd thesis 2019 the second eof mode of aw that accounts 28 of the total variation fig 5 largely shows the decline around delhi as brought out in the first mode of the deseasonalized tws plotting of major reservoirs with capacity of more than 0 1 million bcm suggests that the observed tws rises spread over in the peninsular river basins of the country are likely due to the high concentration of reservoirs fig 5b in contrast the negative loading over north india is reflecting the depletion associated with groundwater pumping thus it appears that aw anomalies in fig 5b are the reflection of anthropogenic causes the north and south bipolar tws pattern is largely controlled by groundwater and surface water hydrology respectively consistently aw over the hotspot of north india fig 5b is highly correlated with groundwater storage whereas aw in south india is mainly comprised of water stored in reservoirs increased storage in central india is the most prominent feature in the third mode fig 6 a accounting for 2 of the variation this storage anomaly has inter annual variability and a general increasing trend rainfall anomaly i e spi averaged over the high storage area marked in fig 6a and grace aw time series over the same area are shown in fig 6b a visual correlation between rainfall anomaly and aw anomaly for this area is established and is implied that this anomaly pertains to the anomalous rainfall in this area the year 2009 has the lowest spi for this region and spatial distribution of rainfall anomaly for the monsoon month of the year 2009 is also low yet for that year tws in the anomaly region is still higher than rest of india effect of rainfall anomaly in monsoon on aw is seen more prominently in the following year as there is a lag of about six months between rainfall anomaly and aw anomaly overall the hydroclimatic factors associated with the bipolar tws trends are explored in this study using the eof analysis it is well known that rainfall influences both groundwater and surface water resources of the country and therefore supposed to influence the tws variability but trends of rainfall may not match absolutely to that with tws in spatial context as we observe stronger signals of depletion and rises in tws but the first mode of monthly tws shows very similar spatiotemporal pattern of rainfall thus supporting influence of rainfall by deseasonalizing the tws and carrying out the eof analysis we could partly ascribe the physical mechanisms associated with the bipolar pattern of tws nevertheless a high concentration of reservoirs in south india may have contributed significantly to the observed tws rises and thus helped to ensure water security the consequent geomorphological and ecological risks due to reductions of sediment flux to ocean 14 needs to be investigated in the future the initial analysis of tws trend across india yielded dominant bi polar anomaly pattern this pattern however was not consistent with rainfall trend spatial distribution of the bi polar mass change pattern has changed after soil moisture is removed from tws as seen from the major eofs of aw fig 4 it agrees with the pattern reported by 2 also decreasing storage in ganga basin as seen in tws modes has lesser impact on the total variance of aw fig 5a b an important feature i e the storage change in the central part of india is revealed after soil moisture is removed from tws fig 6a this decreasing storage is a result of increasing rainfall in this region for the study period although pc of the mode suggests cyclic interannual signal general trend for the time period is increasing in the deccan province however seasonal accumulation is spatially variable for seasonal data rainfall is the biggest contributor to mass variance however at interannual scale hydrological variables i e surface water and ground water influence a major part of the variance as reported earlier 21 2 5 conclusions grace tws modes over india are analysed to understand the evolution of tws across space and time and the causative physical factors for them the tws over india is characterised by diverse hydro geological conditions as such the evolution of water storage with time is not uniform each of the eof modes comprise a pair of spatial and temporal distributions pertaining to a single variance causing factor a major finding of the analysis is the bi polar pattern of tws variation as depicted by the eofs fig 2 fig 3 at seasonal scale a major part of the tws variation occurs in response to seasonal rainfall as depicted by the first mode of seasonal eof fig 2 time of peak rainfall varies across the country as does the time of maximum storage which is captured well in the eofs of seasonal time series for the seasonal removed time series non climatic factors play a major role in tws and aw variabilities the decrease around delhi in the ganga basin is a consistent feature occurring in seasonal removed tws and aw eofs the inter annual and liner trends are primarily dominated by anthropogenic sources such as excessive withdrawal of groundwater in the northern india and surface water storage changes in the central and southern india it is also noted that inter annual variability of rainfall influences considerably on the aw and tws in the central and southern the higher storage seen in the central india corresponds to the higher rainfall and cumulative reservoir storage i e surface water storage the high seasonal accumulation during the good monsoon year translates to a spatially varying inter annual long term storage in the deccan region the 2009 drought is also well reflected in the eof analyses however there appears to be lag of about a year in the aw or groundwater from the meteorological drought the analyses clearly show that the largest variables impacting mass change at seasonal and interannual scales i e monsoon at seasonal scales and anthropogenic at interannual scales and highlights the positive and negative impacts of anthropogenic storage management into a single frame this will help in better understanding the dynamics between climatic and anthropogenic impacts on water storage and would be a step forward to resolving the natural vs anthropogenic driven change debate 6 discloser statement given his role as guest editor dr virendra tiwari had no involvement in

potential causes these analyses suggest the probable causes of tws variations over the different regions of india like role of reservoirs in central and southern india for increase of tws and groundwater pumping in northern india for tws decline keywords grace eof gw depletion anthropogenic component 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws which integrates surface water sw groundwater gw soil moisture sm snow water storage sns and water in biomass plays a critical role in the earth s water energy and biogeochemical cycles ever increasing demand of water and global climate change which is inducing increased anthropogenic influence on water resources are posing a great challenge for sustainable availability of water thus it is imperative to understand the spatial and temporal variation in tws to meet the future water demands and ensure food security globally this is more pertinent for india as about two third of its huge population depends on agriculture and related sectors that are directly associated to water availability the estimation of tws and its variability are constrained due to lack of sufficient in situ measurements now the availability of time variable gravity observations from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission since 2002 20 has greatly facilitated the assessment of tws over india 21 18 15 2 as well as in other parts of the world 7 though at regional spatial scale the inherent diversity of soil climate and topography in india requires substantial representative in situ data to precisely manage its water resources and it is time consuming and expensive to generate them thus it would be worthwhile to have a synoptic view of spatio temporal variability utilizing grace data in this backdrop utilization of the grace based groundwater storage gws anomalies to identify the large scale groundwater depletion over the northern india is noteworthy 21 however there is a need to harness grace s utility at the basin to regional scale the recent grace data products are processed with advanced tools to correct the inherent bias and leakage error and have been found effective at basin scales 5 19 and provide the scope to extend its applications in this study we use the multivariate empirical orthogonal function eof technique to examine the spatiotemporal variability in tws during 2002 2016 since the time varying gravity fields are spatially correlated the eof method and its extension have been used to decompose the grace tws anomalies into space and time components 8 6 9 asoka et al 2 employed the eof method to grace gws to explain the anthropogenic effect of groundwater irrigation over india we extend the analyses further using both tws and available water aw combination of gws and surface water to illustrate the respective dominant signal of groundwater and surface water in tws further results obtained using grace data are validated with in situ groundwater and surface water storage observations 2 data the time variable gravity measurements of gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite grace are inverted to estimate mass changes at different time scale the grace mission operated by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa of the united states and the german aerospace centre dlr have been providing temporal gravity data since 2002 20 the monthly gravity field solutions processed by csr gfz jpl are available as spherical harmonics and gravity anomalies in equivalent water height ewh cm we use the recent grace mascon solution version rl05 processed by csr at 0 50 0 50 grids of monthly interval from 2002 to 2016 this mascon gridded data is found effective for tws estimates at basin scale 5 19 and characterized by better signal to noise ratio as it has prior constraints while processing along with the application of advances in destriping and gaussian filters in india tws is mainly comprised of surface water sw groundwater gw and soil moisture sm the contribution of snow water storage sns is negligible barring some patches of the northern himalaya catchment in this study we also analysed available water aw consisting mainly of surface and groundwater storage we obtained aw by isolating the soil moisture component of tws since in situ soil moisture in not available at the spatio temporal scale matching with that of tws we use the simulated soil moisture of nasa s global land data assimilation system gldas 17 the simulated data are generated through four models such as the community land model clm noah mosaic variable infiltration capacity vic model these models have used the bias corrected ecmwf reanalysis data noaa cmap gdas atmospheric analysis fields and argmet and provide output in three hourly and monthly time scales at 0 250 and 10 spatial grids since 1979 we use the monthly soil moisture at 0 250 0 250 grid spacing of the gldas noah lsm model and re gridded it using the bi linear interpolation to obtain aw from tws thus in regions where surface water resources are scarce the changes in aw is obviously modulated by groundwater storage gws rainfall is the primary contributor of both surface and groundwater resources and thus modulates the spatio temporal variation of tws to understand the contribution and correspondence we use the rainfall data of trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b43 v7 this modelled rainfall rate for each month is based on 3 hour averages derived from the satellite data of trmm and ground truth data from cams global gridded rain gauge data and global rain gauge product of global precipitation climatology centre gpcc http disc sci gsfc nasa gov precipitation documentation this monthly rainfall product at the 0 250 0 250 spatial grid tmpa 3b43 v7 compares well with the in situ data with the minimum least squared errors 4 we converted the original rainfall rate to accumulated rainfall in cm per grid to make it consistent with that of grace tws and also normalized before analysis it has also been noticed that there is a time difference of about two months in the highest values of rainfall between observed rainfall and accumulated rainfall used in this study the surface water sw is comprised of the reservoir water storage billion cubic meter bcm whereas the in situ groundwater levels meter below ground level mbgl records are from the monitoring networks of the central ground water board cgwb these data were obtained from the publicly available water resources information system wris http www india wris nrsc gov in particularly we use continuous records of water level monitoring wells and reservoir storage of individual reservoirs from 2005 to 2017 the water level depths in the wells are converted to groundwater storage δs according to cgwb gec 2015 guidelines and then converted to ewh format henceforth gw and normalized regarding normalization of all the datasets a uniform procedure is followed i e data mean standard deviation for ease in comparison specific yield is determined according to the aquifer geology reservoir storage is normalised for further analysis and is called sw hence forth for this study we have used data of specific areas rather than that of entire india the areas used are described in the appropriate sections reservoir data is used only for narmada basin and gw data is used only of a specific area in the ganga basin the locations are discussed in detail in the results and discussion 3 methods time dependent change in surface processes is reflected in time variable gravity often more than one process contributes to this change and temporal gravity represents the sum total of these changes behaviour of each of these processes especially pertaining to hydrology of india across space and time is studied the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis is a well known technique for understanding the statistical pattern of spatio temporal data 23 12 which was introduced to earth sciences by lorenz 10 this methodology has recently been used to decompose the spatio temporal variability of tws at the regional and global scales 8 6 2 9 the basic principle is the decomposition of a centred stochastic process into a combination of linear orthogonal functions also called basis functions that are infinite for the continuous case and finite and dimensionality bound for the discrete case data are first arranged as a spatio temporal matrix centred and detrended following the algorithm developed by toumazou and creteaux 23 then they are decomposed into their constituent basis function representing the spatio temporal pattern as follows 1 d d λ ϕ t where d is the pre processed data matrix i e an m dimensional vector of time series n and is centred then the eofs are calculated as 2 x ek μ k e k o r d λ ϕ t k μ k λ θ e k t where μ is the eof explaining variation along the spatial dimension and e the principal component pc explains variation along the temporal dimension the eigen value of each eigenvector is the proportion of explained variance these basis functions and occur in associated pairs each such pair is called a mode physical interpretation of each of these modes in terms of hydrological geophysical processes is possible 8 in this study singular value decomposition svd algorithm of matlab is employed for calculating the eof this is defined as 3 s v d d λ ϕ t μ k ψ e k where ψ is the vector containing eigen values of each mode and k represents the number of total basis functions k min n m mutually uncorrelated orthogonal modes are possible only for a gaussian process 23 since the gravitational fields represent the multivariate gaussian structure eof is appropriate to identify the independent modes 3 1 rainfall statistics monthly average rainfall from trmm and its statistical derivatives accumulated precipitation and standardized precipitation index spi are used in this study spi is calculated following the 11 algorithm i e as the z score of the gamma distribution of precipitation g x x 0 g x w h e r e g x 1 β α τ α x α 1 e x β x is precipitation α and β are scale factor and shape parameter 5 τ α i s t h e g a m m a f u n c t i o n z score of g x is calculated using the approximations given by abramowitz and stegun 1 throughout the paper the term rainfall implies direct rainfall from trmm and accumulated precipitation is mention whenever used the terms are not interchangeable 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatio temporal variations in tws terrestrial water storage tws is the vertically integrated water volume of any grid block comprising all the water in different sub surface and surface layer s water i e moisture sm and groundwater gw surface water sw including snow and ice storage sns 3 6 δ t w s δ g w δ s w δ s m δ s w e sns component in tws for study area is neglected as the himalaya part of the catchment containing snow and ice are not a part of the analysis tws definition is thus 7 δ t w s δ g w δ s w δ s m magnitude of water storage and its sequestration in the sub surface depends on rainfall intensity and the local hydro geological conditions hence indirect calculation of tws from rainfall requires the rainfall hydrogeology empirical relations to be properly defined and modelled as such to calculate tws indirectly from rainfall which is the most extensively available climatological variable a detailed study of the hydro geological characteristics of the study area is necessary further the river basins in india are subject to extensive anthropogenic alteration due to the dam structures across the river courses for different purposes so as rainfall patterns shift under the influence of warming trends added to deeper abstraction and the new specific yield is yet to be determined 15 failing which the existing models of indirect tws determination do falter grace on the other hand provides a direct tws estimate as such using grace tws opens the possibility to eliminate errors related to non availability of knowledge base the spatial depiction of tws trends reflects a broad bipolar distribution of contrasting anomalies fig 1 that is the storage depletion over northern india and gain over south central india however a critical inspection suggests a kind of stripping within these two dominant features within northern india the hot spot region of storage loss centred around new delhi consisting of punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh is consistent with previous studies e g 21 the other dominant signal is the tws declines in the high rainfall regions of north east india and the adjacent trans boundary parts similarly in south central india the water storage gain is centred around the narmada basin encircled the eof analysis of monthly tws that follows a 12 month cycle indicates the first mode to have captured about 52 of the total variability fig 2 a the temporal variation of the normalized first mode the principal component 1 pc1 resonates the monthly rainfall variations it is noticed from time series that the lowest values are in the month of may and highest values are in the month of october its spatial pattern i e eof1 broadly corresponds to the rainfall pattern of the country the high rainfall regions of north eastern and eastern parts the low rainfall regions of northern jammu and kashmir western deserts and southern arid parts the amplitude of tws varies between 10 and 40 cm of ewh and does not linearly relate to rainfall due to the differences in the hydrogeological setting a high correlation coefficient is also found between tws pc1 and accumulated rainfall 0 9 at zero lag as displayed in the correlogram plot fig 2b the oscillating behaviour of the correlogram is also indicative of the direct contribution of rainfall to tws variability fig 3 a presents eof mode 1 of deseasonalized tws it is interesting to note that the pc1 accounts a large proportion 84 of the total variation the corresponding spatial pattern eof mode1 resembles the distribution of tws trends in fig 1 the long term variability of tws primarily consists of two contrasting anomalies a declining trend over delhi region and rising trend over the narmada basin which stand out clearly compared to other basins of southern india as observed in previous studies 22 the storage rise encompasses the indira sagar reservoir on the narmada river and also other major reservoirs such as sardar sarovar ukai and upper tapi marked in black dots as well as areas outside of the reservoirs these anomalies depletion of the ganga and rise of narmada river basins are probably caused due to the anthropogenic interferences we therefore focus on these two hotspots to understand different drivers to explain the tws changes normalized time series of soil moisture rainfall gw sw time series averaged over the anomaly areas are compared fig 3b c reservoir levels of the reservoirs mentioned above and gw well data of the wells located inside the ganga basin anomaly area marked are used the normalized time series of hydro climatic variables indicates that in the hotspot of ganga basin rainfall the primary contributor of tws has been consistently decreasing since 2013 particularly the biennial drought of 2014 and 2015 13 seems to have accelerated further the already declining tws and in situ groundwater gw storage the soil moisture anomalies also follow the rainfall pattern characterized by a stable variability until the 2009 drought and then a cycle of rise and fall note that despite the prominent episode of excess rainfall during 2010 2012 water storage continued to deplete this is indicative of the complex interactions of climate and anthropogenic factors on aquifer 16 which has led to groundwater pumping at the rate far more that the replenishment or recharge rate yet surprisingly the in situ groundwater storage experiences a stable pattern in last few years fig 3b this may be due to the response of shallow water tables to extreme rainfalls or due to unavailability of groundwater to pursue the current level of agricultural intensification and thus a reduction of cropping practices in contrast tws has distinctly increased following the 2008 and 2009 droughts in the narmada river basin which can be attributed to surface water storage practices it is notable that despite rainfall failures and drastic reduction in soil moisture in 2014 and 2015 tws continued to be stable while anthropogenic pressure in terms of groundwater pumping is insignificant in the narmada river basin the major role played here is that of the non climatic factor i e reservoirs consistently surface water sw stored in reservoirs shows steady increases and thus explains the tws increases particularly following the 2009 drought further under ideal conditions this reservoir storage can contribute to local soil moisture and groundwater thereby contributing to a total increase in tws in the area beyond the reservoirs boundaries 4 2 spatio temporal variations in available water aw we also employed the eof analyses over available water aw gridded data in order to distinguish and compare with that of tws fig 4 the first eof mode i e pc1 of aw explains a relatively lower percentage of variation 67 compared to the deseasonalized tws but its spatial distribution is unlike tws the negative values are spread over the northern region and a strong positive anomaly is located over south central region the causes of these variabilities are varied the major cause of decreasing trend in the norther region is over exploitation of groundwater whereas the interannual variability of rainfall recharging the groundwater sources is main cause in the central southern region munagapati phd thesis 2019 the second eof mode of aw that accounts 28 of the total variation fig 5 largely shows the decline around delhi as brought out in the first mode of the deseasonalized tws plotting of major reservoirs with capacity of more than 0 1 million bcm suggests that the observed tws rises spread over in the peninsular river basins of the country are likely due to the high concentration of reservoirs fig 5b in contrast the negative loading over north india is reflecting the depletion associated with groundwater pumping thus it appears that aw anomalies in fig 5b are the reflection of anthropogenic causes the north and south bipolar tws pattern is largely controlled by groundwater and surface water hydrology respectively consistently aw over the hotspot of north india fig 5b is highly correlated with groundwater storage whereas aw in south india is mainly comprised of water stored in reservoirs increased storage in central india is the most prominent feature in the third mode fig 6 a accounting for 2 of the variation this storage anomaly has inter annual variability and a general increasing trend rainfall anomaly i e spi averaged over the high storage area marked in fig 6a and grace aw time series over the same area are shown in fig 6b a visual correlation between rainfall anomaly and aw anomaly for this area is established and is implied that this anomaly pertains to the anomalous rainfall in this area the year 2009 has the lowest spi for this region and spatial distribution of rainfall anomaly for the monsoon month of the year 2009 is also low yet for that year tws in the anomaly region is still higher than rest of india effect of rainfall anomaly in monsoon on aw is seen more prominently in the following year as there is a lag of about six months between rainfall anomaly and aw anomaly overall the hydroclimatic factors associated with the bipolar tws trends are explored in this study using the eof analysis it is well known that rainfall influences both groundwater and surface water resources of the country and therefore supposed to influence the tws variability but trends of rainfall may not match absolutely to that with tws in spatial context as we observe stronger signals of depletion and rises in tws but the first mode of monthly tws shows very similar spatiotemporal pattern of rainfall thus supporting influence of rainfall by deseasonalizing the tws and carrying out the eof analysis we could partly ascribe the physical mechanisms associated with the bipolar pattern of tws nevertheless a high concentration of reservoirs in south india may have contributed significantly to the observed tws rises and thus helped to ensure water security the consequent geomorphological and ecological risks due to reductions of sediment flux to ocean 14 needs to be investigated in the future the initial analysis of tws trend across india yielded dominant bi polar anomaly pattern this pattern however was not consistent with rainfall trend spatial distribution of the bi polar mass change pattern has changed after soil moisture is removed from tws as seen from the major eofs of aw fig 4 it agrees with the pattern reported by 2 also decreasing storage in ganga basin as seen in tws modes has lesser impact on the total variance of aw fig 5a b an important feature i e the storage change in the central part of india is revealed after soil moisture is removed from tws fig 6a this decreasing storage is a result of increasing rainfall in this region for the study period although pc of the mode suggests cyclic interannual signal general trend for the time period is increasing in the deccan province however seasonal accumulation is spatially variable for seasonal data rainfall is the biggest contributor to mass variance however at interannual scale hydrological variables i e surface water and ground water influence a major part of the variance as reported earlier 21 2 5 conclusions grace tws modes over india are analysed to understand the evolution of tws across space and time and the causative physical factors for them the tws over india is characterised by diverse hydro geological conditions as such the evolution of water storage with time is not uniform each of the eof modes comprise a pair of spatial and temporal distributions pertaining to a single variance causing factor a major finding of the analysis is the bi polar pattern of tws variation as depicted by the eofs fig 2 fig 3 at seasonal scale a major part of the tws variation occurs in response to seasonal rainfall as depicted by the first mode of seasonal eof fig 2 time of peak rainfall varies across the country as does the time of maximum storage which is captured well in the eofs of seasonal time series for the seasonal removed time series non climatic factors play a major role in tws and aw variabilities the decrease around delhi in the ganga basin is a consistent feature occurring in seasonal removed tws and aw eofs the inter annual and liner trends are primarily dominated by anthropogenic sources such as excessive withdrawal of groundwater in the northern india and surface water storage changes in the central and southern india it is also noted that inter annual variability of rainfall influences considerably on the aw and tws in the central and southern the higher storage seen in the central india corresponds to the higher rainfall and cumulative reservoir storage i e surface water storage the high seasonal accumulation during the good monsoon year translates to a spatially varying inter annual long term storage in the deccan region the 2009 drought is also well reflected in the eof analyses however there appears to be lag of about a year in the aw or groundwater from the meteorological drought the analyses clearly show that the largest variables impacting mass change at seasonal and interannual scales i e monsoon at seasonal scales and anthropogenic at interannual scales and highlights the positive and negative impacts of anthropogenic storage management into a single frame this will help in better understanding the dynamics between climatic and anthropogenic impacts on water storage and would be a step forward to resolving the natural vs anthropogenic driven change debate 6 discloser statement given his role as guest editor dr virendra tiwari had no involvement in

20117,the himalayan region has a large concentration of glaciers and seasonal snow recent advances in remote sensing technologies have made it possible to study previously unexplored himalayan cryosphere these studies are essential to understand the water security of a large population living in indo gangetic plains we compile the work carried out by the scientific community to develop a state of art understanding of the himalayan cryosphere and discuss potential implications on water security this paper covers the cryosphere s various aspects like snow and glacier extent glacier stored water loss in glacier area and length long term trend in glacier mass loss and potential future changes due to climate change the changes in the cryospheric resources are likely to bring changes in the magnitude and seasonality of runoff components especially in the basins with high meltwater contributions such as indus these changes in the basins water resources need to be studied in context with the spatio temporal heterogeneity in the climate change impacts along with socio economic dynamics for safeguarding water security and planning holistic water management adaptations keywords indus ganga brahmaputra retreat river climate change 1 introduction the hindukush karakoram himalayan hkh region is known as the water tower of asia for its significant snow and ice reserves which play an essential role in sustaining water availability 28 major rivers such as indus ganga and brahmaputra originate in the high altitudes of the hkh region and provide freshwater to 800 million people living in the mountains and the indo gangetic plains fig 1 the rivers are sustained primarily by snowmelt glacier melt rainfall runoff and groundwater 1 33 41 47 65 70 the indus ganga and brahmaputra basins comprise six mountain ranges extending from the hindukush range in afghanistan karakoram in northern pakistan and india and the himalayas in india nepal and bhutan gangdise shan and nyainqentalgha ranges in southern tibet to hengduan shan mountains in china this region is characterised by extreme topography and climatic conditions western disturbances influence the precipitation regime in the western himalaya and karakoram from november to may the indian summer monsoon provides precipitation in central and eastern himalaya from june to september 1 8 12 among the himalayan karakoram range the eastern himalayan range receives the highest annual precipitation 2800 mm most of the precipitation is received in the form of rainfall 89 from june to september in contrast the karakoram range has a winter accumulation regime it receives a total annual precipitation of 584 mm most precipitation is received in the form of snowfall 81 1 further due to the orographic barrier strong north south gradients of temperatures and precipitation are observed the elevation higher than 2000 m is considered as upper basin 29 glaciers and seasonal snow reserves are located in the upper basins whereas most of the population lives and socio economic activities occur in the lower basins table 1 the hkh region is one of the climate change hotspots showing a greater degree of warming than the global average due to the elevation dependent warming phenomenon 45 58 eastern karakoram has shown an overall increase of 0 54 c in mean temperature in a short span from 1985 to 2015 49 while global temperature has shown a rise of 0 85 c in mean temperature from 1880 to 2012 30 in response to warming climate glaciers have shown significant retreat and mass loss in the past few decades 7 37 considering the sensitivity of the cryospheric resources future climate change is expected to affect the himalayan rivers water availability 29 41 indo gangetic plains are densely populated where rapid growth in population and economic development will cause an increase in water demand 28 74 indus river supports around 96 of crop production in pakistan and 26 of india s crop production whereas approximately 37 of india s agriculture is sustained by ganga river 32 55 about 129 million farmers in indus and ganga basins depend on snow and glacier melt for their livelihood in the indus basin snowmelt is the major contributor in the pre monsoon season and around 60 of irrigation withdrawal occurs from meltwater 6 thus climate sensitive water resources in the upper basins and water stress from the dense population extensive irrigation and socio economic developments in the downstream region make these river basins more vulnerable to climate change 28 therefore for robust water resources management comprehensive knowledge about the himalayan cryosphere is necessary therefore we compile the studies on the cryosphere in the indus ganga and brahmaputra basins published up to june 2020 and provide a complete database we present the updated records of snout fluctuation glacier area loss glaciological mass balance measurements ground penetrating radar gpr measurements and volume area v a scaling equations in line with the previously published reviews 2 7 we also add the studies estimating future changes in glacier mass and snow and glacier melt contribution in various catchments in the hkh and discuss the potential implications on water security 2 variability in snow cover snow during winter covers a large area 1 59 0 15 million km2 in the hkh region 20 snow cover area sca in upper parts of indus ganga and brahmaputra basins ranges from 85 in the winter to approximately 10 in the summer 69 fig 2 the large spatial and temporal variability of snow cover is influenced by precipitation regimes topography and seasons 21 54 monitoring of winter precipitation in northwest himalaya suggests an increase in total rainfall but a decrease in snowfall predominantly observed at high altitudes 48 however snow depth reduction is not reflected in snow cover variability especially if the entire himalaya is considered possibly due to sizeable inter annual variability 20 54 although no significant mean sca trend for the entire himalaya is reported however in jhelum kosi gandaki manas and chandra river basins decreasing trend with a statistically significant negative correlation with temperature is observed 21 59 moreover high and low altitude basins show variation in the accumulation and ablation patterns of snow in the low altitude ravi basin sca depleted from 90 to 55 in mid winter whereas in high altitude bhaga basin no snow depletion was observed until april 38 these investigations suggest that trend in snow cover changes is difficult to obtain due to the short duration of observations large annual and inter annual variability lack of data on snow depth and cloud cover 3 glacier retreat and area loss glacier inventories were carried out using topographical maps aerial photographs and field visits before satellite images in the past few decades the advancement in remote sensing datasets and geographical information systems has enabled mapping glacier areas accurately using multi spectral satellite images at an individual glacier basin region or entire mountain range scale basin wise distribution of glacier area suggests that indus basin has the maximum number of glaciers and the largest glaciated area whereas ganga basin has the least table s1 indus basin s average glaciated area is 26253 3746 km2 whereas the same in ganga and brahmaputra basins is 11110 4038 km2 14399 3782 km2 respectively table s1 the large discrepancy in the areal extent provided by different inventories could be due to differences in the area covered time scale a methodology of mapping and the various definitions of a glacier itself 37 furthermore comparing recent satellite data with historical inventories has also enabled us to understand the retreat and area loss of glaciers we compile the records of snout fluctuations of 285 glaciers and two regional means spanning 17 decades from the 1850s table s2 most of the himalayan glaciers are retreating and the retreat rates have accelerated in the past few decades but the observed tendencies are not regionally uniform the length change varies across the entire himalaya ranging from 60 to 88 m a the mean retreat rate of hkh glaciers is 14 9 15 1 m a which varies from 12 7 13 2 m a in indus 15 5 14 4 m a in ganga and 20 2 19 7 m a in brahmaputra basins fig 3 a moreover glaciers in the karakoram region have shown comparatively minor length change 1 37 22 8 m a indicating the stable condition or surging 2 we also present a compilation of 149 studies estimating glacier area changes ranging from a single glacier to vast regions table s3 most studies utilise the topographic maps of the survey of india from the 1960s and recent satellite images 2 while most of the glacier area in indus and ganga basins is mapped in 63 and 66 studies respectively brahmaputra basin is less explored with only 19 studies the unweighted mean area change rate of the glaciers in the hkh is 0 36 0 38 a which matches a similar analysis in azam et al 2 it is close to 0 4 a estimated for entire high mountain asia in 11 the area change rate varies from 0 30 0 25 a in indus 0 33 0 27 a in ganga and 0 66 0 72 a in brahmaputra basins fig 3b we also observed the close to zero 0 03 0 07 a area change rate of karakoram glaciers based on seven studies the large variability in retreat and area loss is linked with topography glacier extent debris cover and climatic drivers 13 63 4 glacier volume glacier depth is a critical parameter to assess the amount of stored water ice thickness measurements are available on a limited number of glaciers in the himalaya due to challenges in applying radar and other field methods due to rugged terrain crevasses and debris cover at present ice thickness measurements using gpr are available on only 12 glaciers in indus and ganga basins table s4 therefore numerous modelling techniques such as v a scaling slope dependent and laminar flow methods have been developed which are validated using gpr measurements we estimate basin wide glacier mass using the convenient and easy v a scaling approach utilising glacier area from rgi6 0 and various scaling methods table s5 it suggests the mass of glacier stored water in himalaya ranging from 2377 to 6586 gigaton gt with the largest ice mass stored in indus basin 2855 1027 gt followed by brahmaputra 706 221 gt and ganga 509 159 gt fig 4 we also observe that globally developed v a scaling relationships may over under estimate ice volume whereas regional scaling equations help in acquiring more reliable basin wide estimates methods such as the laminar flow 16 glabtop 40 and volumetric ice flux and mass balance 25 used to estimate the spatial distribution of ice thickness which provide better estimates of glacier volume 15 moreover the volume derived using these methods can be further used to obtain regional v a scaling equations and estimate basin wide glacier stored water through a systematic approach the combination of laminar flow and scaling method is used to estimate glacier stored water in the satluj basin as 62 3 10 8 gt and karakoram region as 1473 17 gt 52 68 5 glacier mass balance glacier mass balance has been estimated using glaciological geodetic gravimetric equilibrium line altitude ela and accumulation area ratio aar methods mass balance estimates using glaciological methods are available for 32 glaciers in the indus ganga and brahmaputra basins table s6 out of these 27 glaciers are spread across the entire himalayan mountain range and five are situated in the nyainqentalgha and henguduan shan mountain ranges in the brahmaputra basin glaciological mass balance data is often not continuously available for an extended period in the himalaya there is a significant gap in the field measurements for the 1990s fig 5 however a few continuous mass balance series chhota shigri hamtah shaune garang and mera glaciers are available from the early 21st century the annual mass balance of these glaciers shows an overall negative trend fig 5 since 1975 out of the 185 measurements only 19 positive mass balance records are observed mass balance estimates show a sudden drop after 2000 however the number of studies in this period are less to make a significant conclusion overall the decadal trend in field mass balance indicates a negative trend varying from 0 31 m w e a 1 in the 1970s to 0 77 m w e a 1 2000s fig 5 the geodetic method is used routinely to estimate mass balance in the hkh region it utilises surface elevation data to estimate mass balance on large spatial and temporal domains 24 a mass loss rate of 0 19 0 03 m w e a 1 is estimated over the hkh during 2000 2018 64 at regional scale it varies between 0 41 0 11 m w e a 1 in the eastern 43 0 58 0 01 m w e a 1 in the central 3 0 55 0 37 m w e a 1 in the western himalaya 73 and 0 10 0 07 m w e a 1 in karakoram region 49 in the last decade at the basin scale brahmaputra showed the highest mass loss 4 9 1 gt yr followed by indus 3 5 1 gt yr and ganga 3 2 0 6 gt yr which results in the 18 29 of excess in the annual glacier melt runoff 64 the near stable condition of glaciers in the central karakoram and pamir ranges have been reported by many studies and is referred to as karakoram anomaly 9 17 23 64 it is also visible in the comparatively lesser area loss rate and stable advancing fronts of karakoram glaciers supplementary tables s2 and s3 the glaciers in this region are located at higher altitudes compared to himalayan glaciers and are fed by heavy winter snowfalls which aid in near balanced mass balance conditions despite the similar warming trend as the himalayan range 49 66 however recent studies have suggested the beginning of mass loss after 2015 in the karakoram and pamir regions 5 24 further mass balance estimated using the improved aar method in chandra and satluj basins has shown a loss of 11 1 gt and 16 4 gt respectively from 1985 to 2013 52 71 these studies have also highlighted the susceptibility of small and low altitude glaciers to warming as they exhibit higher mass loss than large glaciers 35 6 future changes in the glacier area and mass the observed glacier mass loss is used to assess future changes in the glacier area volume and runoff depending on various global climate models and representative concentration pathways rcp around 60 70 of the glacier mass in the hkh region is projected to be lost until the end of the century if present day emission of greenhouse gases continue 34 future changes in glacier area estimated for satluj basin indicate that glaciers will lose 53 and 81 of the area by the end of the century under the rcp8 5 scenario in cnrm cm5 and gfdl cm3 respectively 52 fig 6 in chandra basin area loss of 48 50 rcp4 5 and 55 60 rcp8 5 was estimated by the end of the century it would result in a 66 74 volume loss under the rcp8 5 scenario 72 7 contribution of snow and glacier melt in annual runoff seasonal snow and glacier melt contribute significantly to the runoff of rivers that originated in the hkh water stored in seasonal snow and ice during winter is partially released during summer when temperatures are higher than freezing providing a seasonality to the streamflow overall the streamflow is contributed by rainfall snowmelt glacier melt and baseflow groundwater snow and glacier melt contribution peaks in summer and monsoon seasons 41 we have compiled 137 studies at 89 locations that estimate snow and glacier melt contribution to the annual discharge using hydrological models and isotopic analysis table s7 indus basin has a higher dependence on snow and glacier melt 44 7 followed by brahmaputra 15 and ganga 13 4 basins 33 fig 7 glaciated area is higher in indus compared to ganga and brahmaputra basins further ganga and brahmaputra receive relatively more rainfall from the indian summer monsoon than indus influenced by western disturbances 8 the contribution of snow and glacier melt increases with higher altitudes and the vicinity of glaciers it is greater than 75 in the high altitude and glacierised hunza basin in the karakoram table s7 the contribution of rainfall runoff also increases downstream in lower altitudes moreover glacier melt contribution increases in the drought years when monsoon precipitation and snow cover are less exhibiting the buffering response of glacier stored water 53 the changes in the cryospheric resources in the past few decades are likely to affect the water cycle of hkh rivers analysis of stream runoff in the upper indus basin from 1960 to 1998 suggests decreased discharge in high elevation glacierised hunza and shyok basins and increased in low elevation catchments 62 moreover glacier melt is observed to be decreasing whereas snowmelt runoff have increased due to increasing precipitation and temperature but stable glacier mass balance 47 if all the himalayan glaciers were to disappear the annual mean flow will reduce by 33 in the western himalayan catchment and by 4 18 in the eastern catchment suggesting the higher dependence of indus basin on snow and glacier melt 56 the future projections indicate that glacier melt contribution will increase at first as the glacier mass loss accelerates followed by a decrease resulting from a significant reduction in the glacier volumes 26 in indus ganga and brahmaputra basins this glacier melt peak is expected to come by the middle of the century 2040 2070 before reducing 26 52 however the meltwater peak may arrive earlier or there would be no significant peak in smaller watersheds indicating the differing response of small meltwater streams to changing climate compared to large rivers 14 65 however changing climate also indicates more precipitation in the form of rainfall instead of snowfall thus decreased streamflow due to reduced glacier volume and snowfall will be compensated by increasing rainfall contribution 29 41 in general the warming climate will lead to the increasing contribution of rainfall runoff long term decrease in snowmelt and ice melt and early melting seasonal snow which will alter the trend and timing of the hydrological regime of himalayan rivers 27 33 39 41 65 overall there would be spatio temporal heterogeneity in changes in water availability based on regional climatic regime and response of glaciers but runoff of highly glacierised catchments where snow and glacier melt are significant will be substantially affected 8 glacier lakes and glacier lake outburst flood glof the retreating glaciers have led to the formation and expansion of glacier lakes in the past decades these lakes can burst and cause a catastrophic flood in the downstream region numerous remote sensing techniques are extensively used for monitoring glacier lakes 4 22 75 and identification of future lake sites and prediction of maximum expansion of present and future glacier lakes 42 51 57 studies of glacier lakes in himalaya have shown substantial expansion in their area and volume over the last four decades 22 75 further a technique called himalayan glacier thickness mapper higthim was developed to estimate the volume and expansion of present and future glacier lakes based on dem surface velocity and moraines 36 using this technique the current south lhonak lake volume in sikkim is estimated as 60 10 8 million m3 increasing up to 90 16 2 million m3 57 the glacier lake volume combined with shallow water approximation is used to understand the hydrodynamic behaviour of glof and the downstream region s susceptibility to a potential flood event 31 60 61 glof at south lhonak lake in sikkim himalaya can reach up to chungthang town situated 63 km downstream and inundate 0 06 km2 of the settlement 60 similar studies estimating potential glof at lakes in central himalaya suggest the potential damage to infrastructure such as roads bridges and hydropower projects 61 9 discussion and conclusion 9 1 current status and way forward the international scientific community studies the himalayan cryosphere due to the massive concentration of glaciers and seasonal snow and the large population dependent on its water although recent advances in remote sensing technologies have made it possible to study previously unexplored himalayan glaciers comprehensive knowledge needs to be developed moreover studies in the himalayan region often focus on the more accessible area with a significant gap in the eastern himalayan and karakoram region further less explored aspects of the cryosphere such as snow depth albedo debris cover effect of aerosols and permafrost need to be studied in conjunction with their influence on the glacier dynamics high altitude meteorological stations would aid in better understanding of the climatic regime and its effect on the cryosphere although a small number of studies at the regional level indicate the decreasing trend in snow cover glaciers in almost all himalayan regions are retreating and losing mass at varying rate a significant increase in mass wastage is observed after 2000 these trends are synonymous with increasing temperature trends 4 58 59 67 usage of remote sensing data in various models to estimate mass balance thickness runoff modelling of snow and glacier fed streams and glof has improved our understanding of the himalayan cryosphere the mass balance models utilising satellite datasets and validated with field data can be forced with future climate variables to estimate future changes in glacier area and mass applications of such methods on a basin scale can help understand climate change impact on glacier water availability further models generating a spatial distribution of ice thickness can be used on a basin scale providing insights into the threat of expanding lakes and glof to the downstream region 9 2 spatio temporal heterogeneity in the climate change impacts most of the glaciers in the himalayan region are experiencing negative mass loss except in karakoram therefore indus basin is experiencing heterogeneity in glacier mass loss depending upon spatial distribution of the basin and other hydrometeorological parameters the glaciers located in pir panjal or south of great himalayan mountaing ranges are experiencing higher mass loss compared to karakram mountain ranges 18 this can sigficantly influence future water availability in indus basin for example the peak discharge from glacier melt is expected in 2050 in the satluj basin 52 but it could be different for karakoram region therefore further investigation is needed to assess heterogeneity of water availabity in indus basin in addition the glacier mass loss is also different within individual basins for example small glaciers located in lower latitude are experiencing higher mass loss in chandra basin 71 as mountain communities are located at a lower altitude they can influence water and food security 9 3 implications from socio economic developments in the hkh river basins future socio economic changes can significantly affect water security and influence the water energy food nexus 44 the influence on nexus also depends on hydrological characteristics the importance of the source population growth and governance structure therefore indus basin is considered as a critical water tower 28 as it depends more on snow and glaciers melt than ganga and brahmaputra increasing population industrial and energy requirements and tourist influx may change water withdrawal norms fig 8 therefore further studies are needed to understand changing socio economic scenarios and their influence on water and food security 46 further studies are also required to understand future hydropower production future power production depends on catement size glaciers health and snow and glaciers contribution to runoff recent investigations have shown that the changes in runoff and design will influence long term power generation of small hydropower projects 65 9 4 adaptations at local and regional scale the mountain communities often live at the lower altitudes of himalaya where the weather is conducive and are sustained by small meltwater streams and springs they grow various kharif and rabi crops such as barley wheat apples almond and buckwheat using stream and spring water in the irrigation system fig 9 shows the buckwheat farms in rakcham in baspa basin and hillslope farming in nako village in spiti himachal pradesh the depletion of cryosphere harsh biophysical conditions and susceptibility to changing climatic conditions have created unique challenges for these mountain communities as existing infrastructure is not resilient enough to meet new challenges in zanskar valley s dry and arid climate kumik village relied on the meltwater stream called kumikthu originating from a small glacier however as the glaciers in this region have receded substantially kumik started facing severe water shortages and was forced to relocate 19 as the local water resources are declining in warming climate many villages in the hkh may face similar consequences in the future at a local scale mountain communities have started adapting to climate change induced changes in water availability most of the baspa and spiti basins villages showed consensus in the reports of drying of springs and decreased snowfall locals in rakcham and chitkul villages in baspa basin have started drawing water from high altitude meltwater stream using pipes and utilising water of baspa river for irrigation as the springs have partially dried farmers in the spiti basin have built temporary water storage and diversion structures using stones fig 9 in this context one of the significant efforts by local communities and government is ice stupa http icestupa org the technique is developed in ladakh where unseasonal snowmelt is conserved during winter eventually melts in april may and provides water during these crucial months india s government supported the creation of ice stupas at 26 villages and arranged programs to train 250 local stakeholders during 2020 it led to 75 million litres of water conservation during winter 50 further new ice stupas are proposed at 50 more locations throughout ladakh the innovation of ice stupa has addressed the issue of water shortage in the mountain villages and checked the youth migration relocation and created livelihood opportunities 50 the retreating glaciers have also increased the threat of glof influencing the vulnerability of mountain communities therefore mitigation strategy is adopted at south lhonak lake where siphoning technique was used to reduce the volume of the lake similar investigations are needed at numerous newly formed potentially hazardous lakes in the himalaya on a larger scale water availability changes from the hkh rivers would induce complex water and food security challenges and socio economic development in the riparian countries some regions are likely to experience more significant changes than others depending upon terrains glaciological and climatic parameters creating new challenges to hydro diplomacy water stress governance hydro political tension and future climatic and socio economic changes would make climate adaptive solutions more challenging to execute thus these challenges would call for innovative solutions and resources management in the hkh region focusing on region specific needs and vulnerability due to the transboundary nature of indus ganga and brahmaputra rivers a robust mechanism for data collection and sharing between the riparian countries and the international community is required to make informed decisions thus systematic efforts on regional and global scale are needed to strengthen and update the knowledge of the cryosphere in indus ganga and brahmaputra basins

20117,the himalayan region has a large concentration of glaciers and seasonal snow recent advances in remote sensing technologies have made it possible to study previously unexplored himalayan cryosphere these studies are essential to understand the water security of a large population living in indo gangetic plains we compile the work carried out by the scientific community to develop a state of art understanding of the himalayan cryosphere and discuss potential implications on water security this paper covers the cryosphere s various aspects like snow and glacier extent glacier stored water loss in glacier area and length long term trend in glacier mass loss and potential future changes due to climate change the changes in the cryospheric resources are likely to bring changes in the magnitude and seasonality of runoff components especially in the basins with high meltwater contributions such as indus these changes in the basins water resources need to be studied in context with the spatio temporal heterogeneity in the climate change impacts along with socio economic dynamics for safeguarding water security and planning holistic water management adaptations keywords indus ganga brahmaputra retreat river climate change 1 introduction the hindukush karakoram himalayan hkh region is known as the water tower of asia for its significant snow and ice reserves which play an essential role in sustaining water availability 28 major rivers such as indus ganga and brahmaputra originate in the high altitudes of the hkh region and provide freshwater to 800 million people living in the mountains and the indo gangetic plains fig 1 the rivers are sustained primarily by snowmelt glacier melt rainfall runoff and groundwater 1 33 41 47 65 70 the indus ganga and brahmaputra basins comprise six mountain ranges extending from the hindukush range in afghanistan karakoram in northern pakistan and india and the himalayas in india nepal and bhutan gangdise shan and nyainqentalgha ranges in southern tibet to hengduan shan mountains in china this region is characterised by extreme topography and climatic conditions western disturbances influence the precipitation regime in the western himalaya and karakoram from november to may the indian summer monsoon provides precipitation in central and eastern himalaya from june to september 1 8 12 among the himalayan karakoram range the eastern himalayan range receives the highest annual precipitation 2800 mm most of the precipitation is received in the form of rainfall 89 from june to september in contrast the karakoram range has a winter accumulation regime it receives a total annual precipitation of 584 mm most precipitation is received in the form of snowfall 81 1 further due to the orographic barrier strong north south gradients of temperatures and precipitation are observed the elevation higher than 2000 m is considered as upper basin 29 glaciers and seasonal snow reserves are located in the upper basins whereas most of the population lives and socio economic activities occur in the lower basins table 1 the hkh region is one of the climate change hotspots showing a greater degree of warming than the global average due to the elevation dependent warming phenomenon 45 58 eastern karakoram has shown an overall increase of 0 54 c in mean temperature in a short span from 1985 to 2015 49 while global temperature has shown a rise of 0 85 c in mean temperature from 1880 to 2012 30 in response to warming climate glaciers have shown significant retreat and mass loss in the past few decades 7 37 considering the sensitivity of the cryospheric resources future climate change is expected to affect the himalayan rivers water availability 29 41 indo gangetic plains are densely populated where rapid growth in population and economic development will cause an increase in water demand 28 74 indus river supports around 96 of crop production in pakistan and 26 of india s crop production whereas approximately 37 of india s agriculture is sustained by ganga river 32 55 about 129 million farmers in indus and ganga basins depend on snow and glacier melt for their livelihood in the indus basin snowmelt is the major contributor in the pre monsoon season and around 60 of irrigation withdrawal occurs from meltwater 6 thus climate sensitive water resources in the upper basins and water stress from the dense population extensive irrigation and socio economic developments in the downstream region make these river basins more vulnerable to climate change 28 therefore for robust water resources management comprehensive knowledge about the himalayan cryosphere is necessary therefore we compile the studies on the cryosphere in the indus ganga and brahmaputra basins published up to june 2020 and provide a complete database we present the updated records of snout fluctuation glacier area loss glaciological mass balance measurements ground penetrating radar gpr measurements and volume area v a scaling equations in line with the previously published reviews 2 7 we also add the studies estimating future changes in glacier mass and snow and glacier melt contribution in various catchments in the hkh and discuss the potential implications on water security 2 variability in snow cover snow during winter covers a large area 1 59 0 15 million km2 in the hkh region 20 snow cover area sca in upper parts of indus ganga and brahmaputra basins ranges from 85 in the winter to approximately 10 in the summer 69 fig 2 the large spatial and temporal variability of snow cover is influenced by precipitation regimes topography and seasons 21 54 monitoring of winter precipitation in northwest himalaya suggests an increase in total rainfall but a decrease in snowfall predominantly observed at high altitudes 48 however snow depth reduction is not reflected in snow cover variability especially if the entire himalaya is considered possibly due to sizeable inter annual variability 20 54 although no significant mean sca trend for the entire himalaya is reported however in jhelum kosi gandaki manas and chandra river basins decreasing trend with a statistically significant negative correlation with temperature is observed 21 59 moreover high and low altitude basins show variation in the accumulation and ablation patterns of snow in the low altitude ravi basin sca depleted from 90 to 55 in mid winter whereas in high altitude bhaga basin no snow depletion was observed until april 38 these investigations suggest that trend in snow cover changes is difficult to obtain due to the short duration of observations large annual and inter annual variability lack of data on snow depth and cloud cover 3 glacier retreat and area loss glacier inventories were carried out using topographical maps aerial photographs and field visits before satellite images in the past few decades the advancement in remote sensing datasets and geographical information systems has enabled mapping glacier areas accurately using multi spectral satellite images at an individual glacier basin region or entire mountain range scale basin wise distribution of glacier area suggests that indus basin has the maximum number of glaciers and the largest glaciated area whereas ganga basin has the least table s1 indus basin s average glaciated area is 26253 3746 km2 whereas the same in ganga and brahmaputra basins is 11110 4038 km2 14399 3782 km2 respectively table s1 the large discrepancy in the areal extent provided by different inventories could be due to differences in the area covered time scale a methodology of mapping and the various definitions of a glacier itself 37 furthermore comparing recent satellite data with historical inventories has also enabled us to understand the retreat and area loss of glaciers we compile the records of snout fluctuations of 285 glaciers and two regional means spanning 17 decades from the 1850s table s2 most of the himalayan glaciers are retreating and the retreat rates have accelerated in the past few decades but the observed tendencies are not regionally uniform the length change varies across the entire himalaya ranging from 60 to 88 m a the mean retreat rate of hkh glaciers is 14 9 15 1 m a which varies from 12 7 13 2 m a in indus 15 5 14 4 m a in ganga and 20 2 19 7 m a in brahmaputra basins fig 3 a moreover glaciers in the karakoram region have shown comparatively minor length change 1 37 22 8 m a indicating the stable condition or surging 2 we also present a compilation of 149 studies estimating glacier area changes ranging from a single glacier to vast regions table s3 most studies utilise the topographic maps of the survey of india from the 1960s and recent satellite images 2 while most of the glacier area in indus and ganga basins is mapped in 63 and 66 studies respectively brahmaputra basin is less explored with only 19 studies the unweighted mean area change rate of the glaciers in the hkh is 0 36 0 38 a which matches a similar analysis in azam et al 2 it is close to 0 4 a estimated for entire high mountain asia in 11 the area change rate varies from 0 30 0 25 a in indus 0 33 0 27 a in ganga and 0 66 0 72 a in brahmaputra basins fig 3b we also observed the close to zero 0 03 0 07 a area change rate of karakoram glaciers based on seven studies the large variability in retreat and area loss is linked with topography glacier extent debris cover and climatic drivers 13 63 4 glacier volume glacier depth is a critical parameter to assess the amount of stored water ice thickness measurements are available on a limited number of glaciers in the himalaya due to challenges in applying radar and other field methods due to rugged terrain crevasses and debris cover at present ice thickness measurements using gpr are available on only 12 glaciers in indus and ganga basins table s4 therefore numerous modelling techniques such as v a scaling slope dependent and laminar flow methods have been developed which are validated using gpr measurements we estimate basin wide glacier mass using the convenient and easy v a scaling approach utilising glacier area from rgi6 0 and various scaling methods table s5 it suggests the mass of glacier stored water in himalaya ranging from 2377 to 6586 gigaton gt with the largest ice mass stored in indus basin 2855 1027 gt followed by brahmaputra 706 221 gt and ganga 509 159 gt fig 4 we also observe that globally developed v a scaling relationships may over under estimate ice volume whereas regional scaling equations help in acquiring more reliable basin wide estimates methods such as the laminar flow 16 glabtop 40 and volumetric ice flux and mass balance 25 used to estimate the spatial distribution of ice thickness which provide better estimates of glacier volume 15 moreover the volume derived using these methods can be further used to obtain regional v a scaling equations and estimate basin wide glacier stored water through a systematic approach the combination of laminar flow and scaling method is used to estimate glacier stored water in the satluj basin as 62 3 10 8 gt and karakoram region as 1473 17 gt 52 68 5 glacier mass balance glacier mass balance has been estimated using glaciological geodetic gravimetric equilibrium line altitude ela and accumulation area ratio aar methods mass balance estimates using glaciological methods are available for 32 glaciers in the indus ganga and brahmaputra basins table s6 out of these 27 glaciers are spread across the entire himalayan mountain range and five are situated in the nyainqentalgha and henguduan shan mountain ranges in the brahmaputra basin glaciological mass balance data is often not continuously available for an extended period in the himalaya there is a significant gap in the field measurements for the 1990s fig 5 however a few continuous mass balance series chhota shigri hamtah shaune garang and mera glaciers are available from the early 21st century the annual mass balance of these glaciers shows an overall negative trend fig 5 since 1975 out of the 185 measurements only 19 positive mass balance records are observed mass balance estimates show a sudden drop after 2000 however the number of studies in this period are less to make a significant conclusion overall the decadal trend in field mass balance indicates a negative trend varying from 0 31 m w e a 1 in the 1970s to 0 77 m w e a 1 2000s fig 5 the geodetic method is used routinely to estimate mass balance in the hkh region it utilises surface elevation data to estimate mass balance on large spatial and temporal domains 24 a mass loss rate of 0 19 0 03 m w e a 1 is estimated over the hkh during 2000 2018 64 at regional scale it varies between 0 41 0 11 m w e a 1 in the eastern 43 0 58 0 01 m w e a 1 in the central 3 0 55 0 37 m w e a 1 in the western himalaya 73 and 0 10 0 07 m w e a 1 in karakoram region 49 in the last decade at the basin scale brahmaputra showed the highest mass loss 4 9 1 gt yr followed by indus 3 5 1 gt yr and ganga 3 2 0 6 gt yr which results in the 18 29 of excess in the annual glacier melt runoff 64 the near stable condition of glaciers in the central karakoram and pamir ranges have been reported by many studies and is referred to as karakoram anomaly 9 17 23 64 it is also visible in the comparatively lesser area loss rate and stable advancing fronts of karakoram glaciers supplementary tables s2 and s3 the glaciers in this region are located at higher altitudes compared to himalayan glaciers and are fed by heavy winter snowfalls which aid in near balanced mass balance conditions despite the similar warming trend as the himalayan range 49 66 however recent studies have suggested the beginning of mass loss after 2015 in the karakoram and pamir regions 5 24 further mass balance estimated using the improved aar method in chandra and satluj basins has shown a loss of 11 1 gt and 16 4 gt respectively from 1985 to 2013 52 71 these studies have also highlighted the susceptibility of small and low altitude glaciers to warming as they exhibit higher mass loss than large glaciers 35 6 future changes in the glacier area and mass the observed glacier mass loss is used to assess future changes in the glacier area volume and runoff depending on various global climate models and representative concentration pathways rcp around 60 70 of the glacier mass in the hkh region is projected to be lost until the end of the century if present day emission of greenhouse gases continue 34 future changes in glacier area estimated for satluj basin indicate that glaciers will lose 53 and 81 of the area by the end of the century under the rcp8 5 scenario in cnrm cm5 and gfdl cm3 respectively 52 fig 6 in chandra basin area loss of 48 50 rcp4 5 and 55 60 rcp8 5 was estimated by the end of the century it would result in a 66 74 volume loss under the rcp8 5 scenario 72 7 contribution of snow and glacier melt in annual runoff seasonal snow and glacier melt contribute significantly to the runoff of rivers that originated in the hkh water stored in seasonal snow and ice during winter is partially released during summer when temperatures are higher than freezing providing a seasonality to the streamflow overall the streamflow is contributed by rainfall

ganga 13 4 basins 33 fig 7 glaciated area is higher in indus compared to ganga and brahmaputra basins further ganga and brahmaputra receive relatively more rainfall from the indian summer monsoon than indus influenced by western disturbances 8 the contribution of snow and glacier melt increases with higher altitudes and the vicinity of glaciers it is greater than 75 in the high altitude and glacierised hunza basin in the karakoram table s7 the contribution of rainfall runoff also increases downstream in lower altitudes moreover glacier melt contribution increases in the drought years

the water cycle of hkh rivers analysis of stream runoff in the upper indus basin from 1960 to 1998 suggests decreased discharge in high elevation glacierised hunza and shyok basins and increased in low elevation catchments 62 moreover glacier melt is observed to be decreasing whereas snowmelt runoff have increased due to increasing precipitation and temperature but stable glacier mass balance 47 if all the himalayan glaciers were to disappear the annual mean flow will reduce by 33 in the western himalayan catchment and by 4 18 in the eastern catchment suggesting the higher dependence of indus basin on snow and glacier melt 56 the future projections indicate that glacier melt contribution will increase at first as the glacier mass loss accelerates followed by a decrease resulting from a significant reduction in the glacier volumes 26 in indus ganga and brahmaputra basins this glacier melt peak is expected to come by the middle of the century 2040 2070 before reducing 26 52 however the meltwater peak may arrive earlier or there would be no significant peak in smaller watersheds indicating the differing response of small meltwater streams to changing climate compared to large rivers 14 65 however changing climate also indicates more precipitation in the form of rainfall instead of snowfall thus decreased streamflow due to reduced glacier volume and snowfall will be compensated by increasing rainfall contribution 29 41 in general the warming climate will lead to the increasing contribution of rainfall runoff long term decrease in snowmelt and ice melt and early melting seasonal snow which will alter the trend and timing of the hydrological regime of himalayan rivers 27 33 39 41 65 overall there would be spatio temporal heterogeneity in changes in water availability based on regional climatic regime and response of glaciers but runoff of highly glacierised catchments where snow and glacier melt are significant will be substantially affected 8 glacier

therefore indus basin is considered as a critical water tower 28 as it depends more on snow and glaciers melt than ganga and brahmaputra increasing population industrial and energy requirements and tourist influx may change water withdrawal norms fig 8 therefore further studies are needed to understand changing socio economic scenarios and their influence on water and food security 46 further studies are also required to understand future hydropower production future power production depends on catement size glaciers health and snow and glaciers contribution to runoff recent investigations have shown that the changes in runoff and design will influence long term power generation of small hydropower projects 65 9 4 adaptations at local and regional scale the mountain communities often live at the lower altitudes of himalaya where the weather is conducive and are sustained by small meltwater streams and springs they grow various kharif and rabi crops such as barley wheat apples almond and buckwheat using stream and spring water in the irrigation system fig 9 shows the buckwheat farms in rakcham in baspa basin and hillslope farming in nako village in spiti himachal pradesh the depletion of cryosphere harsh biophysical conditions and susceptibility to changing climatic conditions have created unique challenges for these mountain communities as existing infrastructure is not resilient enough to meet new challenges in zanskar valley s dry and arid climate kumik village relied on the meltwater stream called kumikthu originating from a small glacier however as the glaciers in this region have receded substantially kumik started facing severe water shortages and was forced to relocate 19 as the local water resources are declining in warming climate many villages in the hkh may face similar consequences in the future at a local scale mountain communities have started adapting to climate change induced changes in water availability most of the baspa and spiti basins villages showed consensus in the reports of drying of springs and decreased snowfall locals in rakcham and chitkul villages in baspa basin have started drawing water from high altitude meltwater stream using pipes and utilising water of baspa river for irrigation as the springs have partially dried farmers in the spiti basin have built temporary water storage and diversion structures using stones fig 9 in this context one of the significant efforts by local communities and government is ice stupa http icestupa org the technique is developed in ladakh where unseasonal snowmelt is conserved during winter eventually melts in april may and provides water during these crucial months india s government supported the creation of ice stupas at 26 villages and arranged programs to train 250 local stakeholders during 2020 it led to 75 million litres of water conservation during winter 50 further new ice stupas are proposed at 50 more locations throughout ladakh the innovation of ice stupa has addressed the issue of water shortage in the mountain villages and checked the youth migration relocation and created livelihood opportunities 50 the retreating glaciers have also increased the threat of glof influencing the vulnerability of mountain communities therefore mitigation strategy is adopted at south lhonak lake where siphoning technique was used to reduce the volume of the lake similar investigations are needed at numerous newly formed potentially hazardous lakes in the himalaya on a larger scale water availability changes from the hkh rivers would induce complex water and food security challenges and socio economic development in the riparian countries some regions are likely to experience more significant changes than others depending upon terrains glaciological and climatic parameters creating new challenges to hydro diplomacy water stress governance hydro political tension and future climatic and socio economic changes would make climate adaptive solutions more challenging to execute thus these challenges would call for innovative solutions and resources management in the hkh region focusing on region specific needs and vulnerability due to the transboundary nature of indus ganga and brahmaputra rivers a robust mechanism for data collection and sharing between the riparian countries and the international community is required to make informed decisions thus systematic efforts on regional and global scale are needed to strengthen and update the knowledge of the cryosphere in indus ganga and brahmaputra basins

different components of the water cycle pose immense challenge to water security at the catchment scale this paper provides a comprehensive overview and a quantitative assessment of the long term availability of water resources in the cauvery river basin a major river basin in peninsular india the cauvery has been a contentious river for decades regarding water sharing among its riparian states of karnataka and tamil nadu moreover the river basin is characterized by extensive regional variability in both surface water and groundwater distributions and has faced acute water management

signatures to understand the dynamics of hydrological processes at catchment scale with an objective of providing insights for effective planning and allocation of water resources and judicious management of water demands keywords long term water availability time scales water balance components trend analysis human interventions cauvery river basin 1 introduction india s water resources are characterized by huge variability in their temporal and spatial distribution regional mismatch between the water availability and water demands has been a perpetual problem in india which has resulted in unsustainable utilization of surface water and groundwater resources 1 as the economy of the country and livelihood of a majority of its population is still largely dependent on agriculture variability in rainfall and availability of water resources directly impact its social progress and economic development increasing trends in growth of human population climate change and climate variability increasing frequency of floods and droughts contamination of resources and irregular distribution of monsoon rainfall exacerbate the water scarcity in many parts of the country the situation gets worsened by the conflicting interest of water users and stakeholders resulting in a number of unplanned anthropogenic activities to extract maximum water from the available sources water insecurity has severe consequences in the mental physical nutritional and socio economic well being of humans especially under alarming situations like the current threat of a global pandemic 2 to tackle the issues related to water scarcity it is important to carry out accurate assessments of the available water resources and riverine systems within the country to develop a sustainable policy framework this paper focusses on providing a comprehensive review on the quantitative assessment of the long term availability of water resources in the cauvery river basin a major river basin in peninsular india the cauvery river is a major east flowing river in peninsular india and the river basin has long presented water management challenges at the local and basin scales in many parts of the basin there is a rapid decline of surface water and groundwater resources over recent decades which results in increasing concerns about drinking water food and livelihood security of its inhabitants demographic changes and economic development urbanization and large scale transformation in irrigation practices have resulted in increased stress on the available water resources with the rise in global as well as local mean temperature and increased human interventions the hydrology of the basin is affected causing floods and droughts and inhibiting the natural functioning of the ecosystem the cauvery river basin is considered to have severe water stress and the current water abstraction is estimated to exceed the water resources within the basin 3 therefore it is of importance to evaluate the long term water availability in the basin and the impact of anthropogenic activities changing land use and climate patterns the major outstanding challenges faced by the cauvery river basin can be grouped under issues related to water availability and water demand in the context of inter state water dispute between the states of karnataka and tamil nadu water availability is governed by the basin s hydroclimate which is controlled by the western ghats monsoon systems and land surface characteristics a reduction in the annual runoff 4 is projected in future due to increase in evapotranspiration in response to higher temperature despite of an increase in the monsoonal rainfall 5 this can lead to longer drought periods in the eastern part of the basin affecting the agricultural productivity livelihood and economy of this region for the past few decades anthropogenic modifications to the system are posing greater challenges to the already stressed water demand sectors annual per capita water demand has increased significantly due to a notable rise in population of this region the scenario gets worsened during dry years when water demands escalate for domestic as well agricultural purposes agricultural sector is the largest stakeholder of water demands in the basin 6 almost 40 of the paddy cultivation of tamil nadu relies on the water resources of cauvery basin 7 and the semi arid climatic conditions of this region lead to higher water requirements in the eastern part of the basin on the other hand karnataka has major investments on irrigation projects which further fuel the ongoing inter state dispute with tamil nadu on rights over cauvery water a holistic policy framework driven by hydrological and social research is needed to attenuate the water stress and assure sustainable utilization of water resources over these regions the objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview and synthesis on the water availability and water demands of the cauvery river basin decadal changes in land use land cover lulc for the years 1985 1995 and 2005 are analysed long term hydro climatology of the basin is analysed using hydrological modelling approaches combined with statistical tools to evaluate trends long term extreme hydro climatology seasonal flow behaviour at various locations within the basin and the impact of interventions on the natural flow regime of the river are also assessed this paper attempts to provide insights on the water scarcity issues of the cauvery river basin to help in deriving technical solutions towards sustainable management of water resources in the basin the paper is divided into five main sections section 2 provides a brief description of the cauvery river basin followed by an overview on its major sources of water availability and water demands along with the decadal lulc change analysis section 3 describes the materials and methods adopted for evaluating the long term availability of water resources in the basin using statistical tools as well as a physically based hydrological modelling approach section 4 presents the detailed discussion of the results and section 5 includes the summary and major conclusions obtained from the study 2 overview of the cauvery river basin water availability and water demands the cauvery river basin is the fourth largest river basin in peninsular india extending over the states of tamil nadu karnataka kerala and union territory of puducherry the basin is believed to have formed due to fragmentation of the gondwanaland during the drifting of india sri lanka landmass system away from east antarctica 8 it has a drainage area of about 85 600 square kilometres which covers nearly 2 7 percent of the geographical area of india the salient features of the cauvery river basin are detailed in the india wris cauvery basin report 9 the cauvery river originates from the western ghats at an elevation of about 1341 m and outfalls into the bay of bengal forming a large delta at the mouth the basin has a tropical to sub tropical climate with a mean monthly temperature varying from 22 98 0c to 28 48 0c the annual average rainfall varies from 500 mm to 3000 mm signifying the immense regional variability in the basin s climatology black red lateritic and alluvial soils are the predominant soil types in the basin and a wide variety of their combinations are present across the basin metamorphic and igneous rocks largely constitute the basin s geology and it has two topographic domains namely the elevated low relief mysore plateau and fluvio deltaic tamil nadu plains 10 within the basin more than 60 of the population resides in rural areas and agriculture is their means of livelihood 11 with monsoons being the principal source of rainfall in the basin agricultural land is the most dominant land use land cover lulc class followed by forests the cauvery river delta also known as the thanjavur delta located at the mouth of the river in tamil nadu was formed by the erosion and deposition of sedimentary rocks for thousands of years it is the most important agricultural belt within the basin and serves as the main source of paddy for the country 12 the upper cauvery catchment also has large tracts of agricultural land and during the 19th and 20th centuries appreciable amount of work was carried out by the regional administrations in the restoration of tanks and minor irrigation schemes 13 many major and minor reservoirs were constructed during the 20th century at several pivotal locations across the basin for irrigation flood control and hydroelectric power generation 9 the cauvery being an inter state river has been contentious for decades for the claim of rights over river water historical political and socio economic factors have played a crucial role in aggravating the interstate water dispute between the riparian states 7 while tamil nadu solely relies on cauvery water for irrigation the rapid urban population explosion in the major cities like bengaluru located on the north eastern ridge of the cauvery river basin in karnataka over the last twenty years has led to the additional load on the natural water resources of the basin which resulted in exacerbation of the interstate dispute 14 although the governments of karnataka and tamil nadu were engaged in many bilateral conversations to dissolve the long standing disputes none of them were effective in obtaining amicable solutions consequently based on the directive by the supreme court of india the central government constituted the cauvery water disputes tribunal cwdt and its final verdict was announced in the year 2007 after a series of rebuttals by the riparian states the supreme court virtually endorsed the tribunal award with minor modifications in 2018 15 the efficacy of cwdt awards and the issue of cauvery water sharing have been subjected to several studies 6 15 17 aiming judicious allocation of water resources and for providing adequate policy frameworks to resolve the transboundary water disputes fig 1 shows the geographical extent of the cauvery river basin state boundaries streamflow network central water commission cwc streamflow gauge locations major dams major cities and the elevation in metres the elevation data is obtained from the digital elevation model dem provided by shuttle radar topography mission srtm at 30 m spatial resolution and the streamflow network is delineated based on the dem 2 1 surface water availability cauvery river and its tributaries serve as the main source of surface water for the agriculture dependent population within the basin it also provides water for household consumption and hydropower generation there are about 96 dams within the basin out of which more than 70 percent of them serving irrigation purposes about 20 percent feeding hydroelectric projects and about 3 percent providing water supply to the residents 9 the western and the eastern sides of the basin receives maximum rainfall from south west monsoon june to september and north east monsoon october to january respectively 11 the average annual precipitation ranges from 1700 mm to 3800 mm in the western ghats region whereas in tamil nadu the values drop down to the range of 500 mm 1000 mm 9 the details of long term trends in annual and seasonal rainfall are provided in section 4 1 the cauvery river water is extensively used for intensive agricultural practices and serves as a major source for drinking water in the urban areas within the basin 11 in the cauvery delta there are about 1000 irrigation tanks supplied with water from cauvery river through canal systems 18 there has been an increasing trend in the surface temperature of the basin which results in higher evapotranspiration 7 leading to an increased stress on the surface water availability the total irrigated area of upper cauvery basin has increased considerably and urban population explosion has escalated the agricultural and per capita water demand respectively which eventually results in the over utilization of cauvery river water 19 2 2 groundwater availability the occurrence of groundwater is influenced by topographic hydro climatic geologic as well as degree of human activities related to pumping and other water uses in addition to these factors the complex network of unconsolidated fractures crystalline and sedimentary rocks help in movement of groundwater in the basin the groundwater yield of weathered gneiss is around 400 m3 day whereas the amount is around 40 m3 day for unweathered and charnockite formations 10 in majority of the basin the groundwater level fluctuates between 5 and 10 m with shallow water level in deltaic and upper reaches of the basin 11 the interannual monsoon rainfall variability controls the trend of groundwater level it is observed that groundwater levels are shallower during and after south west monsoon 20 based on depth to groundwater depth data from 192 observation wells during 1996 2014 the upper and middle cauvery basin shows decline in groundwater level whereas an increasing trend is observed in the lower cauvery basin 11 this increasing trend is attributed to irrigation practices and presence of numerous distributaries of cauvery draining to bay of bengal 2 3 changing climate land use and anthropogenic activities the availability of water resources greatly depends on the effective planning and management of the land use practices especially under the changing climatic conditions the urban water demand is directly influenced by the changes in urban population whereas agricultural water demand is dependent on the changes in land use and irrigation patterns the cauvery basin has been subjected to large scale changes in urban population irrigation patterns and land use in the past few decades for instance bengaluru city in karnataka has witnessed a population growth from 4 7 million 2001 to 8 5 million 2011 and cauvery river water along with the uncertain level of groundwater supply are utilized to satisfy the resulting increased water demand 19 the average annual and seasonal temperatures are observed to have an increasing trend in all parts of the basin see supplementary information section s 3 the summer and winter monsoon precipitation in the basin are likely to increase under future climate scenarios 4 however under warmer and wetter climates there is an anticipated increase in evapotranspiration 21 and the average runoff in the basin is expected to decrease by 2 in 2050 5 7 these factors clearly signify the plausible stress on the availability of water resources within the basin anthropogenic activities like the construction of small and large scale intervention structures for water supply and irrigation schemes significantly disturb the natural flow regime of river massive modification of the land use land cover lulc like deforestation unplanned construction activities and shifts in cropping patterns to fulfil the enhanced demand of growing population and development activities have critical impacts on the hydrological processes and water availability to evaluate the changes in lulc in the last few decades the lulc maps of the cauvery river basin for the years 1985 1995 and 2005 are analysed fig 2 the lulc maps are extracted for the cauvery from the decadal lulc database of india 22 provided by ornl daac oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center fig 3 shows the percentage of each lulc class in the cauvery basin for three decades to examine the changes in lulc classes among different years transition matrices are formulated transition matrix provides the land use transformation in percentage from one year to another detailed in supplementary information section s 1 fig 4 shows the transition matrix values in percentage of the lulc classes from 1985 to 2005 transition matrices for 1985 1995 and 1995 2005 are provided in supplementary information supplementary fig s1 1 and fig s1 2 fig 2 shows notable increase of urban built up area around major urban pockets such as bengaluru mysore coimbatore and thiruchirappalli locations specified in fig 1 cropland forms the major class of lulc in the basin followed by fallow land plantations and forests from fig 2 and fig 3 it can be inferred that there has been a decline in the percentage of natural forests substantial increase in the percentage of fallow lands and decrease in area under cropland and plantation classes fig 4 shows that the basin has been subjected to large scale conversions of various lulc classes from one class to another over the last three decades the percentage of conversions of lulc classes have significant increase during 1995 2005 when compared to the transitions from 1985 to 1995 supplementary fig s1 1 and fig s1 2 this could be attributed to the resultant changes in the land use patterns due to the prominent boom in urban population from the lulc change analysis it can be inferred that there have been significant changes in the land use land cover during the past decades especially in the conversion of croplands to fallow lands conversion of forest cover to plantations reduction in the percentage area of cropland and increase in the percentage of urban built up this analysis clearly indicates that there have been massive changes in the lulc due to human induced alterations such lulc changes can significantly create huge additional demand on the available water resources and have potential impacts on the water availability within the basin 2 4 agricultural water demand the high proportion of arable land more than 50 in cauvery basin fosters the growth of agriculture which is the major livelihood of the people the major crops grown in the basin are paddy sugarcane jowar and ragi 10 irrigation is the most important water demand sector in the basin as most of the basin lies within semi arid region around 60 2 of surface area of tamil nadu s cauvery river delta is under cultivation engaging 73 of the people in agriculture 12 rice cultivation is intensively practiced in this region which accounts for 40 of tamil nadu s rice production 7 the water management for this monsoon dependent region experiences water shortages during summer and submerging conditions in monsoons a strong link between el niño southern oscillation enso and rainfall is established for this region during summer monsoon rainfall below normal is observed during el nino years and above normal during la nina years however during north east monsoon rainfall above normal is observed during el nino years and below normal during la nina years 23 due to this situation increase in mean rice production is observed during normal and el nino years than la nino years 24 the cauvery river delta is experiencing warming across all seasons making it vulnerable due to climate change this increased warming may add immense water stress with implications to crop cultivation and water allocation 12 2 5 increasing risks of droughts floods and droughts pose severe threat to agricultural productivity and can have cascading impact on economic activities related to laborer employment and wage rates decline of market and food security 25 unlike other peninsular basins cauvery basin is more prone to droughts 26 28 in cauvery basin the frequency of droughts during 1971 2010 has increased mostly in the downstream region it is found that potential evapotranspiration and temperature play an important role during drought situations in 1975 and 2002 2004 29 in the entire basin an extreme drought cycle of 3 5 7 years is observed with extreme droughts during 2000 2003 the link between sea surface temperature and drought index is observed which modulates the drought by altering rainfall and temperature characteristics 29 the severity of droughts may be increased by decreasing terrestrial water storage anomalies which is supported by declining groundwater levels in the basin 26 2 6 water quality riverine ecology and environmental flows surface water and groundwater quality is an important variable for agricultural industrial activities and society it also affects the riverine ecosystem carbon flux and bacterial community structure 30 in cauvery basin industries related to cement chemical textile and dyeing extensive irrigation for rice and coffee development of urban centers with increasing population density sea water intrusion due to intensive pumping and sewage discharge are causing alteration in surface water and groundwater quality 30 32 based on concentration of sodium and sodium carbonate river water is found to be suitable for irrigation whereas the use of groundwater is doubtful groundwater quality near to coast confluence of tributaries and industrial region is poor for drinking and irrigation purpose 31 the concentration of total dissolved solids is found more than the permissible limit for groundwater samples however it is below the permissible limit for river water samples 30 the riverine ecology and environment are severely impacted by heavy metal concentration the runoff generated from agricultural fields and storm water networks is identified as one of the important non point sources for heavy metal contamination at various stretch of river the downstream gauging stations exhibit higher metal concentration than upstream stations moreover the human activities such as sand dredging at downstream section is found to be responsible for transportation and seasonal fluctuation of heavy metal concentration 33 the untreated effluents from urban centers and hospitals are introducing toxic substances posing severe threat to human health as well as aquatic ecosystem higher concentrations of metals cr zn hg are found in hospital outlets than the sediments from cauvery basin 34 the concentrations of these metals largely exceed the permissible limits for aquatic ecosystem it is necessary to analyze the basin s long term availability of water resources and its hydro climatology as the cauvery river continues to be under inter state dispute for decades and the basin being overburdened by large scale shifts in land use patterns and increased water stress due to anthropogenic interventions section 3 discusses the relevant materials and methods adopted for the analyses in this study and section 4 provides a detailed discussion on the assessment of cauvery s long term hydrology 3 materials and methods in this study a combination of hydrological modelling approaches and statistical analysis of hydro climatology is employed for the estimation of long term water availability in the cauvery river basin for the time period 1951 2016 the long term water balance is simulated using a macro scale grid based hydrological model namely the variable infiltration capacity vic model apart from the estimation of annual average water balance the long term extreme climatology seasonal flow behaviour and impact of human activities on the streamflow are also assessed a drought duration analysis at monthly scale is carried out to evaluate significant trends in rainfall runoff and soil moisture drought durations statistical trends of hydro climatic variables and surface fluxes are evaluated at annual and seasonal scales using non parametric mann kendall m k test and sen s slope estimation 35 36 at 5 significance level the impact of dam construction human activities on streamflow variability is assessed through flow duration curves permutation entropy is used to evaluate the changes in the predictability of streamflow due to dam construction these methodological details are discussed in sections 3 1 to 3 3 for the analyses precipitation and temperature datasets at a spatial resolution of 0 250 0 250 and 10 10 respectively are obtained from the india meteorological department 37 38 and extracted for cauvery basin extent the daily streamflow data for various gauge locations in the cauvery basin fig 1 are obtained from india wris database www india wris nrsc gov in for the implementation of the vic model several additional datasets such as reservoir flows windspeed elevation soil characteristics which comprise of soil composition and bulk density and vegetation properties such as land use type leaf area index lai albedo and crop characteristics the details of which are provided in supplementary information section s 2 it may be noted that the cauvery delta is excluded in the analysis due to the unavailability of climate datasets 3 1 trend analysis the non parametric mann kendall test 36 has applications over various domains and it is widely used for trend detection in hydro climatology 39 42 statistic s can be obtained by 1 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x k where n is the length of the sample xk and xj are from k 1 2 n 1 and j k 1 n if n is bigger than 8 statistic s approximates to normal distribution the mean of s is 0 and the variance of s can be obtained as follows 2 var s n n 1 2 n 5 18 test statistic z is defined as follows 3 z s 1 var s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 var s i f s 0 z 0 indicates an increasing trend z 0 indicates absence of trends and z 0 indicates decreasing trends for a confidence interval α the sequential data would be supposed to experience statistically significajt trend if z z 1 α 2 where z 1 α 2 following the standard normal distribution the confidence interval α used in this analysis is 0 05 95 significance level the magnitude of the trend is quantified using sen s slope 43 estimation the magnitude of trend β is calculated as 4 β median x j x i j i j i β 0 indicates a positive upward trend in the time series and vice versa 3 2 entropy measures permutation entropy 44 is a model free tool to detect changes in the predictability of a variable it is based on the principle of shannon entropy the procedure to compute permutation entropy is as follows with a permutation order d the time series x t t 1 t d 1 can be organized into overlapping segments x t x t x t 1 x t d 1 of length d for each segment the values are sorted in increasing order to get the index r 0 r 1 r d 1 such that x t r 0 x t r 1 x t r d 1 the corresponding combinations π r 0 r 1 r d 1 are symbolic representatives of the original segments and can assume any of the d possible permutations of the set 0 1 d 1 the permutation entropy of order greater than 2 can be defined as 5 h d π p π log p π where π denotes summation over all the d possible permutations of order d and p π is the relative frequency of each permutation π the maximum value of the permutation entropy with order d is log d therefore the normalized permutation entropy h d n used in this study is formulated as 6 h d n h d l o g d for a fixed d higher the value of h d n lower will be the predictability of the variable in this study the integers 2 3 4 and 5 are used as order of permutation 3 3 vic hydrological model the variable infiltration capacity vic model 45 46 is a macroscale grid based land atmosphere transfer model that can solve water balance at a given time step for spatially distributed grid cells the model represents surface and subsurface hydrological processes and considers sub grid vegetation heterogeneity non linear baseflow computation and facilitates the inclusion of multiple soil layers with variable infiltration the model can be implemented for a wide range of spatial resolutions varying from 1 80 to 20 latitude by longitude at hourly to daily time step both water balance and energy balance modes can be executed in the model to compute the surface atmosphere fluxes the vic model has been extensively used worldwide to address several challenges related to water resources assessment and management 47 the model has proven to perform fairly well in many indian river basins in the assessment of impact of land use estimation of runoff potential and flood and drought monitoring 40 48 50 in this study the vic model is set up for cauvery river basin excluding the river delta due to the unavailability of meteorological data at 0 25 grid resolution and the surface fluxes are computed at a daily time scale for the years 1951 2016 the water balance mode is adopted to compute the surface fluxes at a daily time step such as grid wise surface runoff evapotranspiration soil moisture at three distinct soil layers and baseflow the output fluxes are fed into a routing model 51 which uses linear transfer functions for grid cells to estimate streamflow at specific locations meteorological forcings required to run the model include precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature and windspeed at daily scale the datasets used for setting up the vic model for cauvery river basin are provided in supplementary information table s2 1 the vic model is calibrated with respect to observed monthly streamflow at various gauge locations within the basin for those gauge locations at which the effects of reservoirs are considered the monthly change in the upstream reservoir storage δs monthly inflow monthly outflow is added to the observed gauged flow qobs to obtain an equivalent estimate of the naturalized flow qn obs the flow values thus obtained qn obs are compared with the model simulated flows qsim for the corresponding gauge stations for model calibration and validation a brief description of the model parameters and calibration and validation details provided in supplementary information section s 2 the calibrated vic model is then employed for the entire cauvery river basin to obtain grid wise hydrological fluxes total surface runoff evapotranspiration and baseflow at annual and seasonal time scales to evaluate the long term water balance in the basin 3 4 separating the influence of climate change and human activities on streamflow in this paper a hydrological modelling approach is employed to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow variability based on 52 the streamflow time series is divided into two parts a streamflow before construction of dam and b streamflow after construction of dam the variation of streamflow after dam construction is influenced by both climate change and human activities the following equations are used to identify the contribution of climate change and human activity dam construction on streamflow variation 7 q t q n q l 8 q c q m q n 9 q h q t q c the relative contributions of climate change η c and human activities η h are given by 10 η c q c q t 100 11 η h q h q t 100 where q t is the total streamflow variation given by difference between average annual streamflow q n before construction of dam reference period and average annual streamflow q l after dam construction impacted period q c is streamflow variation due to climate change given by difference between model simulated natural flow during impacted period q m and q n q h is the streamflow variation induced due to human activities section 4 provides the detailed discussion on the assessment of long term hydro climatology and availability of water resources at seasonal and annual scales across the entire river basin 4 assessment of long term availability of water resources 4 1 seasonal rainfall hydro climatology the quantification of water availability at seasonal time scales is of immense importance for water allocation and management in agriculture riverine ecosystem and allied ecological services and human water consumption alteration in amount and timing of rainfall at seasonal scales has significant cascading impact on agriculture economy and food security therefore investigation of seasonal hydro climatology of cauvery river basin is vital as it experiences dominant south west and north east monsoons the long term mean annual and seasonal rainfall characteristics for the period 1951 2016 are shown in fig 5 the south west monsoon jjas rainfall rainfall covers the northern and north western regions of the catchment whereas north east monsoon ond rainfall covers the southern and south eastern regions of the basin fig 5 top panel a gradient of rainfall pattern is observed for both seasonal rainfall fig 5 jjas and ond rainfall most of the grids in the northern and north western part of the basin shows significantly increasing trend during jjas rainfall fig 5 middle and lower panel however the southern and south eastern part of the basin exhibits a mixed trend direction during north east monsoon fig 5 middle panel at seasonal time scale the northern part of the basin is significantly wetter than southern part fig 5 middle panel seasonally wet regions of the basin need to be better managed by proper planning and policy for water allocation to different demand sectors the timing and magnitude of different percentiles of annual rainfall receipt affect the partitioning of rainfall into runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration thus controlling the water availability for different demand sectors at seasonal time scales in cauvery basin significant changes in the distribution of rainfall timing at different percentiles of annual rainfall and their corresponding rainfall amount are observed fig 6 around 10 of grids have shown significant changes in the distribution of timing of rainfall during 1984 2016 relative to 1951 1983 similarly higher number of grids 15 30 exhibit changes in the receipt of rainfall amount at different percentiles of annual rainfall this may have implications to many demand sectors for example in rainfall dependent agricultural activities changes in timing and amount of rainfall will have impact on growth of paddy and its transplantation to field and subsequent water availability to meet crop water requirements this will affect overall crop yield crop market and livelihood of the people 4 2 seasonal flow behaviour using regime curves like rainfall patterns spatial variability of streamflow patterns is significant as it informs about the quantum of water availability across different seasons different hydro climatic and catchment characteristics like phase relationship between rainfall and evapotranspiration catchment wetness and storage land use and land cover aridity index are important drivers of streamflow regimes the knowledge about the seasonal patterns of streamflow across the river is vital for managing water resources in rainfall dependent agricultural and allied activities the signature of the influence of south west monsoon and north east monsoon is exhibited in the regime curves of streamflow moreover the combined influence of these monsoons is noted where the sub catchment experience both seasons the northern and north western gauging stations m h halli t narasipur kollegal and muthankera locations 2 5 6 and 4 respectively in fig 1 shows strong seasonality in streamflow which corresponds to the timing of the south west monsoon fig 7 the gauges savandapur thengumarahada and musiri locations 9 10 and 12 respectively in fig 1 at the central part of the basin exhibit bi modal regime curves indicating the dominance of south west and north east monsoon seasons the impact of north east monsoon season is dominant in the flow regimes of south eastern gauging stations exhibiting significant flows during winter months understanding the components of water balance and their variability across annual and seasonal scales is key to perceive hydrological functioning of a system in context of cauvery basin the regime curves portray seasonal flow characteristics as the basin experiences both south west and north east monsoons bimodal variability of flows is observed in central portion of the basin however higher summer seasonal flow and moderate winter flow patterns are observed in the north western and southern part of the basin policy planners need to use the seasonal flow variability across space to frame a sustainable water use policy in the basin 4 3 influence of human activities on streamflow variability in addition to climate variability construction of water retention structures has immense potential to alter the short and long term temporal variability of streamflow thus affecting the periods of high and low flows sedimentation and streamflow predictability at downstream section flow duration curve fdc and permutation entropy pe are used to understand the changes in streamflow variability and predictability respectively due to human activities in addition an analysis is performed to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities impact of dams on mean annual streamflow due to the construction of dams at t narasipur and kollegal gauge stations locations shown in fig 1 the impact of kabini dam location shown in fig 1 on streamflow variability at two different locations can have different patterns a similar change in the streamflow variability from fdc is observed fig 8 b and fig 8d after the construction of kabini dam at two gauging sites however the predictability of streamflow decreased at kollegal fig 8c increased post dam pe and increased at t narasipur this type of change can be attributed to difference in runoff generation at two contributing catchments and rainfall gradient another effect of dam is noted on increased low flows fig 8b and fig 8d reflecting the storage characteristics of dam it is observed that the mean annual streamflow has decreased at t narasipur gauge station after the construction of kabini dam overall an estimated 66 5 and 33 5 decrease in streamflow is observed at t narasipur due to the contributions of climate change and the construction of dam respectively however the contribution of climate change and dam construction on the decrease in mean annual streamflow at kollegal gauge station is 37 and 63 respectively the operation of a large number of dams apart from two major dams kabini and krishnaraja sagara in kollegal catchment is responsible for significantly higher contribution of dams in the reduction of streamflow the flow dynamics at gauging stations downstream of a dam behave differently the rainfall runoff transformation processes occurring within the landscape downstream of dam contributing to streamflow at these stations may superimpose the influence of dam modified flows this may alter the regularity patterns of streamflow affecting the water use scenarios at the downstream of a dam 4 4 long term extreme hydro climatology the period of prolong dry or wet days impact the soil moisture and subsequently affect the partitioning of water and energy at basin scale understanding the dynamics of the extreme spells is crucial in reservoir operation policy choice of agricultural crops and cropping patterns functioning of riverine ecosystem and downstream water quality and quantity the north western part of the basin exhibits higher number of wet days fig 9 a greater than 70 on an average than rest of the basin however the contribution of extreme rainfall to annual rainfall in this region is around 60 fig 9d however the central and southern part of the basin experience moderately lesser number of wet days around 60 days with more extreme rainfall more than 80 of annual rainfall due to extreme rainfall than rest of the basin therefore southern region receives high rainfall in lesser number of days which may induce flood like situation and therefore need a different approach to manage and hold water than rest of the basin the northern part of the basin receives moderate to high rainfall in higher number of wet days relative to the southern counterpart most of the central and southern part of the basin exhibit decrease in wet days with increase in the fraction of annual rainfall due to extreme rain fig 9b and e however the northern part of the basin exhibits increasing wet days with decreasing fraction of annual rainfall due to extreme rain the period of extreme dry and wet spells is of immense important to understand the resilience of the basin during shortage and excess of water availability the northern part of the basin is experiencing decreasing trend in extreme dry spell length while the southern part exhibits increasing trend in the dry spell period fig 10 b these changes are found to be significant more in the northern part than the southern part of the basin fig 10c however the duration of extreme wet spell is fairly uniformly distributed across the basin with higher duration in the north western and western part of the basin fig 10d which also exhibit decrease trend fig 10e 4 5 long term water balance assessment of the long term water budget provides insightful inferences about the water availability in a catchment to this end the vic model is employed to estimate the long term water balance in the cauvery basin and significant trends are identified the statistical analysis for rainfall is provided in detail in section 4 1 fig 11 fig 12 and fig 13 show the long term mean annual and seasonal jjas and ond water balance simulated for the years 1951 2016 the total surface runoff simulations indicate that the western part of the basin has increased runoff potential at the annual scale fig 11a and during south west monsoon jjas season fig 12a whereas the eastern part of the basin is found to have an increased runoff potential during the north eastern monsoon season fig 13a this could be attributed to the seasonal variations in rainfall distributions however most of the grids show a declining trend in the availability of total runoff at both seasonal and annual scales the north west and the north western part of the basin has significantly increasing trends in total surface runoff potential and evapotranspiration during jjas fig 11 the eastern part of the basin exhibits higher values of evapotranspiration which could be attributed to the impact of large scale paddy cultivation in the deltaic regions from fig 2 and fig 11 it can be observed that the higher evapotranspiration values are in alignment with the agricultural and forested areas in the basin evapotranspiration in the northern part of the basin seems to have a significant decrease which could be attributed to the increase in built up area regions near bengaluru city in karnataka which can be observed from fig 2 baseflow is the critical component of the water balance which supplies water to the river network during non rainy period of the year therefore significant changes in baseflow can have implications to agriculture riverine ecology and water quality the north western part of the basin shows comparatively high baseflow which can be attributed to the influence of topography due to the presence of western ghats for majority of the grids baseflow contribution is observed to have an increasing trend during ond and for jjas and annual scale it manifests mixed trends fig 12 fig 13 the water balance components are observed to exhibit similar patterns in significance of trends as that of the rainfall during jjas and ond seasons fig 14 shows the annual average water balance for cauvery river basin for the period 1951 2016 the major component of the water balance is evapotranspiration followed by total surface runoff and baseflow the large tracts of agricultural land followed by plantations and forests could be the potential contributors of high evapotranspiration in the basin the analysis shows that there is a decline in the availability for water resources with increasing demand in the basin due to expansion of urban population and large scale shifts in land use patterns 4 6 drought duration analysis drought is a complex and slow process which develops over time in conjunction with precipitation and temperature it occurs over range of time scales and affects agricultural productivity water availability and economy of a region drought duration one of the important characteristics of drought can be utilized to understand the spatial patterns of drought time scales and its implications the vic simulated surface runoff and soil moisture along with observed rainfall are used to investigate the spatial trends in long term drought durations of these variables a similarity in spatial patterns of the trends is observed in rainfall and runoff drought durations across the cauvery basin fig 15 the central and southern portion of the basin exhibit relatively shorter drought durations whereas it is larger in northern and south eastern deltaic region the mean annual rainfall in central and southern portion of the basin is high due to contribution of south west monsoon rainfall however annual rainfall in southern deltaic region is low due to relatively less amount of rainfall during north east monsoon similar spatial trends in runoff drought durations are also observed revealing the association with rainfall anomalies higher soil moisture drought durations are observed in southern and south eastern deltaic regions which can be attributed to high inter annual rainfall variability this poses serious challenges to the paddy cultivation in this region due to limited water availability a vital component to frame sustainable water use policy is to understand the dynamics long term hydroclimatic variables at multiple time scales the long term seasonal and annual variability of rainfall and associated extreme characteristics reveal the temporal evolution of water availability in the basin the hydrological signatures based on regime curves provided the information on seasonal water availability indicating the role of monsoons and its spatial variation this understanding of regional variability in seasonal water availability should be harnessed for policy framing of water allocation the water availability is found to be affected by human activities which modifies the streamflow dynamics it is observed that the predictability and the temporal variability of streamflow has changed significantly after the construction of dams this may affect the downstream water use and riverine ecosystem where both timing and adequate water quantity plays a major role the assessment of long term water balance components and hydro climatology shows significant trends in the hydrological behaviour of cauvery river basin the analysis shows that the hydrology of the basin is greatly influenced by the changes in land use patterns analysis at the annual scale shows significantly increasing trends in the evapotranspiration and decline in the total runoff potential evapotranspiration comprises the major losses in the basin which can be attributed to the prevalent lulc classes being cropland plantations and forests the annual and seasonal water balance studies signify that there are pronounced seasonal variations in the availability of water within the basin seasonally wet and dry regions in the basin are identified in the study and such regions require adequate attention during water allocation and development of a sustainable policy framework 5 summary and conclusions this paper provides a descriptive overview of the availability of water resources in the cauvery river basin which is facing major challenges in water resources management in the recent decades the evaluation of the long term trends in hydro climatology and water balance have provided significant insights on the distribution and availability of water resources within the basin the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources are found to be highly uneven and the variations in water balance components align with the changes in land use land cover patterns across the basin under the scenario of decreasing availability of global water resources it becomes extremely important to prioritize the need of efficient management of available resources few plausible solutions to tackle the problem of water crisis can be integrated water resources management concise assessment of water availability and demand sustainable agricultural practices like rationalizing cropping patterns adequate management of frequent floods and droughts like conservation of flood flows and inter basin water transfers it is also important to look at the interconnectivity between the surface water and groundwater and have micro level information about the recharging properties of aquifers to consider the potential and applicability of artificial recharge water resources development plans should be devised for the river basins with more focus on the recycling and reusing of the available resources there should be continuous monitoring on the riverine ecosystems and stringent policies should be adopted to prevent the constant loading of rivers with hazardous micropollutants and bio accumulation of toxic substances this paper attempts to provide vital insights on the water availability within the cauvery river basin which could be beneficial in framing improved water management policies to ensure enhanced water security in the anthropocene the availability of water resources in the future greatly depends on the planning and management of river basins in the changing environment therefore there is a great necessity to build synergies between research and policy for the sustainable conservation of water resources credit authorship contribution statement r gowri

20118,the past few decades have witnessed massive shifts in land use patterns land management practices and water demand in the river basins of peninsular india changes in hydrologic regimes of different components of the water cycle pose immense challenge to water security at the catchment scale this paper provides a comprehensive overview and a quantitative assessment of the long term availability of water resources in the cauvery river basin a major river basin in peninsular india the cauvery has been a contentious river for decades regarding water sharing among its riparian states of karnataka and tamil nadu moreover the river basin is characterized by extensive regional variability in both surface water and groundwater distributions and has faced acute water management challenges at multiple space and time scales a descriptive overview of the major water security challenges faced by the basin is presented along with a detailed synthesis of hydrological modelling approaches and statistical methods to assess the basin s long term water availability the variable infiltration capacity vic model is implemented to evaluate the long term water balance components at the catchment scale for the period 1951 2016 decadal land use land cover lulc in the basin for the years 1985 1995 and 2005 are analysed the statistical trends in hydrometeorology and extreme climatology of the basin are evaluated at seasonal and annual scales seasonal flow behaviour and influence of climate and human activities on streamflow are also assessed a drought duration analysis is performed to infer about the implications of spatial distribution of water availability across the basin the results show significant trends in the water balance components and the basin s hydro climatology the lulc analysis shows notable changes in land use patterns due to human activities alterations in the predictability and temporal variability of streamflow are observed after the construction of dams which may affect the downstream water availability this research highlights the importance of comprehensive synthesis of hydrological modelling approaches with hydrological signatures to understand the dynamics of hydrological processes at catchment scale with an objective of providing insights for effective planning and allocation of water resources and judicious management of water demands keywords long term water availability time scales water balance components trend analysis human interventions cauvery river basin 1 introduction india s water resources are characterized by huge variability in their temporal and spatial distribution regional mismatch between the water availability and water demands has been a perpetual problem in india which has resulted in unsustainable utilization of surface water and groundwater resources 1 as the economy of the country and livelihood of a majority of its population is still largely dependent on agriculture variability in rainfall and availability of water resources directly impact its social progress and economic development increasing trends in growth of human population climate change and climate variability increasing frequency of floods and droughts contamination of resources and irregular distribution of monsoon rainfall exacerbate the water scarcity in many parts of the country the situation gets worsened by the conflicting interest of water users and stakeholders resulting in a number of unplanned anthropogenic activities to extract maximum water from the available sources water insecurity has severe consequences in the mental physical nutritional and socio economic well being of humans especially under alarming situations like the current threat of a global pandemic 2 to tackle the issues related to water scarcity it is important to carry out accurate assessments of the available water resources and riverine systems within the country to develop a sustainable policy framework this paper focusses on providing a comprehensive review on the quantitative assessment of the long term availability of water resources in the cauvery river basin a major river basin in peninsular india the cauvery river is a major east flowing river in peninsular india and the river basin has long presented water management challenges at the local and basin scales in many parts of the basin there is a rapid decline of surface water and groundwater resources over recent decades which results in increasing concerns about drinking water food and livelihood security of its inhabitants demographic changes and economic development urbanization and large scale transformation in irrigation practices have resulted in increased stress on the available water resources with the rise in global as well as local mean temperature and increased human interventions the hydrology of the basin is affected causing floods and droughts and inhibiting the natural functioning of the ecosystem the cauvery river basin is considered to have severe water stress and the current water abstraction is estimated to exceed the water resources within the basin 3 therefore it is of importance to evaluate the long term water availability in the basin and the impact of anthropogenic activities changing land use and climate patterns the major outstanding challenges faced by the cauvery river basin can be grouped under issues related to water availability and water demand in the context of inter state water dispute between the states of karnataka and tamil nadu water availability is governed by the basin s hydroclimate which is controlled by the western ghats monsoon systems and land surface characteristics a reduction in the annual runoff 4 is projected in future due to increase in evapotranspiration in response to higher temperature despite of an increase in the monsoonal rainfall 5 this can lead to longer drought periods in the eastern part of the basin affecting the agricultural productivity livelihood and economy of this region for the past few decades anthropogenic modifications to the system are posing greater challenges to the already stressed water demand sectors annual per capita water demand has increased significantly due to a notable rise in population of this region the scenario gets worsened during dry years when water demands escalate for domestic as well agricultural purposes agricultural sector is the largest stakeholder of water demands in the basin 6 almost 40 of the paddy cultivation of tamil nadu relies on the water resources of cauvery basin 7 and the semi arid climatic conditions of this region lead to higher water requirements in the eastern part of the basin on the other hand karnataka has major investments on irrigation projects which further fuel the ongoing inter state dispute with tamil nadu on rights over cauvery water a holistic policy framework driven by hydrological and social research is needed to attenuate the water stress and assure sustainable utilization of water resources over these regions the objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview and synthesis on the water availability and water demands of the cauvery river basin decadal changes in land use land cover lulc for the years 1985 1995 and 2005 are analysed long term hydro climatology of the basin is analysed using hydrological modelling approaches combined with statistical tools to evaluate trends long term extreme hydro climatology seasonal flow behaviour at various locations within the basin and the impact of interventions on the natural flow regime of the river are also assessed this paper attempts to provide insights on the water scarcity issues of the cauvery river basin to help in deriving technical solutions towards sustainable management of water resources in the basin the paper is divided into five main sections section 2 provides a brief description of the cauvery river basin followed by an overview on its major sources of water availability and water demands along with the decadal lulc change analysis section 3 describes the materials and methods adopted for evaluating the long term availability of water resources in the basin using statistical tools as well as a physically based hydrological modelling approach section 4 presents the detailed discussion of the results and section 5 includes the summary and major conclusions obtained from the study 2 overview of the cauvery river basin water availability and water demands the cauvery river basin is the fourth largest river basin in peninsular india extending over the states of tamil nadu karnataka kerala and union territory of puducherry the basin is believed to have formed due to fragmentation of the gondwanaland during the drifting of india sri lanka landmass system away from east antarctica 8 it has a drainage area of about 85 600 square kilometres which covers nearly 2 7 percent of the geographical area of india the salient features of the cauvery river basin are detailed in the india wris cauvery basin report 9 the cauvery river originates from the western ghats at an elevation of about 1341 m and outfalls into the bay of bengal forming a large delta at the mouth the basin has a tropical to sub tropical climate with a mean monthly temperature varying from 22 98 0c to 28 48 0c the annual average rainfall varies from 500 mm to 3000 mm signifying the immense regional variability in the basin s climatology black red lateritic and alluvial soils are the predominant soil types in the basin and a wide variety of their combinations are present across the basin metamorphic and igneous rocks largely constitute the basin s geology and it has two topographic domains namely the elevated low relief mysore plateau and fluvio deltaic tamil nadu plains 10 within the basin more than 60 of the population resides in rural areas and agriculture is their means of livelihood 11 with monsoons being the principal source of rainfall in the basin agricultural land is the most dominant land use land cover lulc class followed by forests the cauvery river delta also known as the thanjavur delta located at the mouth of the river in tamil nadu was formed by the erosion and deposition of sedimentary rocks for thousands of years it is the most important agricultural belt within the basin and serves as the main source of paddy for the country 12 the upper cauvery catchment also has large tracts of agricultural land and during the 19th and 20th centuries appreciable amount of work was carried out by the regional administrations in the restoration of tanks and minor irrigation schemes 13 many major and minor reservoirs were constructed during the 20th century at several pivotal locations across the basin for irrigation flood control and hydroelectric power generation 9 the cauvery being an inter state river has been contentious for decades for the claim of rights over river water historical political and socio economic factors have played a crucial role in aggravating the interstate water dispute between the riparian states 7 while tamil nadu solely relies on cauvery water for irrigation the rapid urban population explosion in the major cities like bengaluru located on the north eastern ridge of the cauvery river basin in karnataka over the last twenty years has led to the additional load on the natural water resources of the basin which resulted in exacerbation of the interstate dispute 14 although the governments of karnataka and tamil nadu were engaged in many bilateral conversations to dissolve the long standing disputes none of them were effective in obtaining amicable solutions consequently based on the directive by the supreme court of india the central government constituted the cauvery water disputes tribunal cwdt and its final verdict was announced in the year 2007 after a series of rebuttals by the riparian states the supreme court virtually endorsed the tribunal award with minor modifications in 2018 15 the efficacy of cwdt awards and the issue of cauvery water sharing have been subjected to several studies 6 15 17 aiming judicious allocation of water resources and for providing adequate policy frameworks to resolve the transboundary water disputes fig 1 shows the geographical extent of the cauvery river basin state

model dem provided by shuttle radar topography mission srtm at 30 m spatial resolution and the streamflow network is delineated based on the dem 2 1 surface water availability cauvery river and its tributaries serve as the main source of surface water for the agriculture dependent population within the basin it also provides water for household consumption and hydropower generation there are about 96 dams within the basin out of which more than 70 percent of them serving irrigation purposes about 20 percent feeding hydroelectric projects and about 3 percent providing water supply to the residents 9 the western and the eastern sides of the basin receives maximum rainfall from south west monsoon june to september and north east monsoon october to january respectively 11 the average annual precipitation ranges from 1700 mm to 3800 mm in the western ghats region whereas in tamil nadu the values drop down to the range of 500 mm 1000 mm 9 the details of long term trends in annual and seasonal rainfall are provided in section 4 1 the cauvery river water is extensively used for intensive agricultural practices and serves as a major source for drinking water in the urban areas within the basin 11 in the cauvery delta there are about 1000 irrigation tanks supplied with water from cauvery river through canal systems 18 there has been an increasing trend in the surface temperature of the basin which results in higher evapotranspiration 7 leading to an increased stress on the surface water availability the total irrigated area of upper cauvery basin has increased considerably and urban population explosion has escalated the agricultural and per capita water demand respectively which eventually results in the over utilization of cauvery river water 19 2 2 groundwater availability the occurrence of groundwater is influenced by topographic hydro climatic geologic as well as degree of human activities related to pumping and other water uses in addition to these factors the complex network of unconsolidated fractures crystalline and sedimentary rocks help in movement of groundwater in the basin the groundwater yield of weathered gneiss is around 400 m3 day whereas the amount is around 40 m3 day for unweathered and charnockite formations 10 in majority of the basin the groundwater level fluctuates between 5 and 10 m with shallow water level in deltaic and upper reaches of the basin 11 the interannual monsoon rainfall variability controls the trend of groundwater level it is observed that groundwater levels are shallower during and after south west monsoon 20 based on depth to groundwater depth data from 192 observation wells during 1996 2014 the upper and middle cauvery basin shows decline in groundwater level whereas an increasing trend is observed in the lower cauvery basin 11 this increasing trend is attributed to irrigation practices and presence of numerous distributaries of cauvery draining to bay of bengal 2 3 changing climate land use and anthropogenic activities the availability of water resources greatly depends on the effective planning and management of the land use practices especially under the changing climatic conditions the urban water demand is directly influenced by the changes in urban population whereas agricultural water demand is dependent on the changes in land use and irrigation patterns the cauvery basin has been subjected to large scale changes in urban population irrigation patterns and land use in the past few decades for instance bengaluru city in karnataka has witnessed a population growth from 4 7 million 2001 to 8 5 million 2011 and cauvery river water along with the uncertain level of groundwater supply are utilized to satisfy the resulting increased water demand 19 the average annual and seasonal temperatures are observed to have an increasing trend in all parts of the basin see supplementary information section s 3 the summer and winter monsoon precipitation in the basin are likely to increase under future climate scenarios 4 however under warmer and wetter climates there is an anticipated increase in evapotranspiration 21 and the average runoff in the basin is expected to decrease by 2 in 2050 5 7 these factors clearly signify the plausible stress on the availability of water resources within the basin anthropogenic activities like the construction of small and large scale intervention structures for water supply and irrigation schemes significantly disturb the natural flow regime of river massive modification of the land use land cover lulc like deforestation unplanned construction activities and shifts in cropping patterns to fulfil the enhanced demand of growing population and development activities have critical impacts on the hydrological processes and water availability to evaluate the changes in lulc in the last few decades the lulc maps of the cauvery river basin for the years 1985 1995 and 2005 are analysed fig 2 the lulc maps are extracted for the cauvery from the decadal lulc database of india 22 provided by ornl daac oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center fig 3 shows the percentage of each lulc class in the cauvery basin for three decades to examine the changes in lulc classes among different years transition matrices are formulated transition matrix provides the land use transformation in percentage from one year to another detailed in supplementary information section s 1 fig 4 shows the transition matrix values in percentage of the lulc classes from 1985 to 2005 transition matrices for 1985 1995 and 1995 2005 are provided in supplementary information supplementary fig s1 1 and fig s1 2 fig 2 shows notable increase of urban built up area around major urban pockets such as bengaluru mysore coimbatore and thiruchirappalli locations specified in fig 1 cropland forms the major class of lulc in the basin followed by fallow land plantations and forests from fig 2 and fig 3 it can be inferred that there has been a decline in the percentage of natural forests substantial increase in the percentage of fallow lands and decrease in area under cropland and plantation classes fig 4 shows that the basin has been subjected to large scale conversions of various lulc classes from one class to another over the last three decades the percentage of conversions of lulc classes have significant increase during 1995 2005 when compared to the transitions from 1985 to 1995 supplementary fig s1 1 and fig s1 2 this could be attributed to the resultant changes in the land use patterns due to the prominent boom in urban population from the lulc change analysis it can be inferred that there have been significant changes in the land use land cover during the past decades especially in the conversion of croplands to fallow lands conversion of forest cover to plantations reduction in the percentage area of cropland and increase in the percentage of urban built up this analysis clearly indicates that there have been massive changes in the lulc due to human induced alterations such lulc changes can significantly create huge additional demand on the available water resources and have potential impacts on the water availability within the basin 2 4 agricultural water demand the high proportion of arable land more than 50 in cauvery basin fosters the growth of agriculture which is the major livelihood of the people the major crops grown in the basin are paddy sugarcane jowar and ragi 10 irrigation is the most important water demand sector in the basin as most of the basin lies within semi arid region around 60 2 of surface area of tamil nadu s cauvery river delta is under cultivation engaging 73 of the people in agriculture 12 rice cultivation is intensively practiced in this region which accounts for 40 of tamil nadu s rice production 7 the water management for this monsoon dependent region experiences water shortages during summer and submerging conditions in monsoons a strong link between el niño southern oscillation enso and rainfall is established for this region during summer monsoon rainfall below normal is observed during el nino years and above normal during la nina years however during north east monsoon rainfall above normal is observed during el nino years and below normal during la nina years 23 due to this situation increase in mean rice production is observed during normal and el nino years than la nino years 24 the cauvery river delta is experiencing warming across all seasons making it vulnerable due to climate change this increased warming may add immense water stress with implications to crop cultivation and water allocation 12 2 5 increasing risks of droughts floods and droughts pose severe threat to agricultural productivity and can have cascading impact on economic activities related to laborer employment and wage rates decline of market and food security 25 unlike other peninsular basins cauvery basin is more prone to droughts 26 28 in cauvery basin the frequency of droughts during 1971 2010 has increased mostly in the downstream region it is found that potential evapotranspiration and temperature play an important role during drought situations in 1975 and 2002 2004 29 in the entire basin an extreme drought cycle of 3 5 7 years is observed with extreme droughts during 2000 2003 the link between sea surface temperature and drought index is observed which modulates the drought by altering rainfall and temperature characteristics 29 the severity of droughts may be increased by decreasing terrestrial water storage anomalies which is supported by declining groundwater levels in the basin 26 2 6 water quality riverine ecology and environmental flows surface water and groundwater quality is an important variable for agricultural industrial activities and society it also affects the riverine ecosystem carbon flux and bacterial community structure 30 in cauvery basin industries related to cement chemical textile and dyeing extensive irrigation for rice and coffee development of urban centers with increasing population density sea water intrusion due to intensive pumping and sewage discharge are causing alteration in surface water and groundwater quality 30 32 based on concentration of sodium and sodium carbonate river water is found to be suitable for irrigation whereas the use of groundwater is doubtful groundwater quality near to coast confluence of tributaries and industrial region is poor for drinking and irrigation purpose 31 the concentration of total dissolved solids is found more than the permissible limit for groundwater samples however it is below the permissible limit for river water samples 30 the riverine ecology and environment are severely impacted by heavy metal concentration the runoff generated from agricultural fields and storm water networks is identified as one of the important non point sources for heavy metal contamination at various stretch of river the downstream gauging stations exhibit higher metal concentration than upstream stations moreover the human activities such as sand dredging at downstream section is found to be responsible for transportation and seasonal fluctuation of heavy metal concentration 33 the untreated effluents from urban centers and hospitals are introducing toxic substances posing severe threat to human health as well as aquatic ecosystem higher concentrations of metals cr zn hg are found in hospital outlets than the sediments from cauvery basin 34 the concentrations of these metals largely exceed the permissible limits for aquatic ecosystem it is necessary to analyze the basin s long term availability of water resources and its hydro climatology as the cauvery river continues to be under inter state dispute for decades and the basin being overburdened by large scale shifts in land use patterns and increased water stress due to anthropogenic interventions section 3 discusses the relevant materials and methods adopted for the analyses in this study and section 4 provides a detailed discussion on the assessment of cauvery s long term hydrology 3 materials and methods in this study a combination of hydrological modelling approaches and statistical analysis of hydro climatology is employed for the estimation of long term water availability in the cauvery river basin for the time period 1951 2016 the long term water balance is simulated using a macro scale grid based hydrological model namely the variable infiltration capacity vic model apart from the estimation of annual average water balance the long term extreme climatology seasonal flow behaviour and impact of human activities on the streamflow are also assessed a drought duration analysis at monthly scale is carried out to evaluate significant trends in rainfall runoff and soil moisture drought durations statistical trends of hydro climatic variables and surface fluxes are evaluated at annual and seasonal scales using non parametric mann kendall m k test and sen s slope estimation 35 36 at 5 significance level the impact of dam construction human activities on streamflow variability is assessed through flow duration curves permutation entropy is used to evaluate the changes in the predictability of streamflow due to dam construction these methodological details are discussed in sections 3 1 to 3 3 for the analyses precipitation and temperature datasets at a spatial resolution of 0 250 0 250 and 10 10 respectively are obtained from the india meteorological department 37 38 and extracted for cauvery basin extent the daily streamflow data for various gauge locations in the cauvery basin fig 1 are obtained from india wris database www india wris nrsc gov in for the implementation of the vic model several additional datasets such as reservoir flows windspeed elevation soil characteristics which comprise of soil composition and bulk density and vegetation properties such as land use type leaf area index lai albedo and crop characteristics the details of which are provided in supplementary information section s 2 it may be noted that the cauvery delta is excluded in the analysis due to the unavailability of climate datasets 3 1 trend analysis the non parametric mann kendall test 36 has applications over various domains and it is widely used for trend detection in hydro climatology 39 42 statistic s can be obtained by 1 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x k where n is the length of the sample xk and xj are from k 1 2 n 1 and j k 1 n if n is bigger than 8 statistic s approximates to normal distribution the mean of s is 0 and the variance of s can be obtained as follows 2 var s n n 1 2 n 5 18 test statistic z is defined as follows 3 z s 1 var s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 var s i f s 0 z 0 indicates an increasing trend z 0 indicates absence of trends and z 0 indicates decreasing trends for a confidence interval α the sequential data would be supposed to experience statistically significajt trend if z z 1 α 2 where z 1 α 2 following the standard normal distribution the confidence interval α used in this analysis is 0 05 95 significance level the magnitude of the trend is quantified using sen s slope 43 estimation the magnitude of trend β is calculated as 4 β median x j x i j i j i β 0 indicates a positive upward trend in the time series and vice versa 3 2 entropy measures permutation entropy 44 is a model free tool to detect changes in the predictability of a variable it is based on the principle of shannon entropy the procedure to compute permutation entropy is as follows with a permutation order d the time series x t t 1 t d 1 can be organized into overlapping segments x t x t x t 1 x t d 1 of length d for each segment the values are sorted in increasing order to get the index r 0 r 1 r d 1 such that x t r 0 x t r 1 x t r d 1 the corresponding combinations π r 0 r 1 r d 1 are symbolic representatives of the original segments and can assume any of the d possible permutations of the set 0 1 d 1 the permutation entropy of order greater than 2 can be defined as 5 h d π p π log p π where π denotes summation over all the d possible permutations of order d and p π is the relative frequency of each permutation π the maximum value of the permutation entropy with order d is log d therefore the normalized permutation entropy h d n used in this study is formulated as 6 h d n h d l o g d for a fixed d higher the value of h d n lower will be the predictability of the variable in this study the integers 2 3 4 and 5 are used as order of permutation 3 3 vic hydrological model the variable infiltration capacity vic model 45 46 is a macroscale grid based land atmosphere transfer model that can solve water balance at a given time step for spatially distributed grid cells the model represents surface and subsurface hydrological processes and considers sub grid vegetation heterogeneity non linear baseflow computation and facilitates the inclusion of multiple soil layers with variable infiltration the model can be implemented for a wide range of spatial resolutions varying from 1 80 to 20 latitude by longitude at hourly to daily time step both water balance and energy balance modes can be executed in the model to compute the surface atmosphere fluxes the vic model has been extensively used worldwide to address several challenges related to water resources assessment and management 47 the model has proven to perform fairly well in many indian river basins in the assessment of impact of land use estimation of runoff potential and flood and drought monitoring 40 48 50 in this study the vic model is set up for cauvery river basin excluding the river delta due to the unavailability of meteorological data at 0 25 grid resolution and the surface fluxes are computed at a daily time scale for the years 1951 2016 the water balance mode is adopted to compute the surface fluxes at a daily time step such as grid wise surface runoff evapotranspiration soil moisture at three distinct soil layers and baseflow the output fluxes are fed into a routing model 51 which uses linear transfer functions for grid cells to estimate streamflow at specific locations meteorological forcings required to run the model include precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature and windspeed at daily scale the datasets used for setting up the vic model for cauvery river basin are provided in supplementary information table s2 1 the vic model is calibrated with respect to observed monthly streamflow at various gauge locations within the basin for those gauge locations at which the effects of reservoirs are considered the monthly change in the upstream reservoir storage δs monthly inflow monthly outflow is added to the observed gauged flow qobs to obtain an equivalent estimate of the naturalized flow qn obs the flow values thus obtained qn obs are compared with the model simulated flows qsim for the corresponding gauge stations for model calibration and validation a brief description of the model parameters and calibration and validation details provided in supplementary information section s 2 the calibrated vic model is then employed for the entire cauvery river basin to obtain grid wise hydrological fluxes total surface runoff evapotranspiration and baseflow at annual and seasonal time scales to evaluate the long term water balance in the basin 3 4 separating the influence of climate change and human activities on streamflow in this paper a hydrological modelling approach is employed to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow variability based on 52 the streamflow time series is divided into two parts a streamflow before construction of dam and b streamflow after construction of dam the variation of streamflow after dam construction is influenced by both climate change and human activities the following equations are used to identify the contribution of climate change and human activity dam construction on streamflow variation 7 q t q n q l 8 q c q m q n 9 q h q t q c the relative contributions of climate change η c and human activities η h are given by 10 η c q c q t 100 11 η h q h q t 100 where q t is the total streamflow variation given by difference between average annual streamflow q n before construction of dam reference period and average annual streamflow q l after dam construction impacted period q c is streamflow variation due to climate change given by difference between model simulated natural flow during impacted period q m and q n q h is the streamflow variation induced due to human activities section 4 provides the detailed discussion on the assessment of long term hydro climatology and availability of water resources at seasonal and annual scales across the entire river basin 4 assessment of long term availability of water resources 4 1 seasonal rainfall hydro climatology the quantification of water availability at seasonal time scales is of immense importance for water allocation and management in agriculture riverine ecosystem and allied ecological services and human water consumption alteration in amount and timing of rainfall at seasonal scales has significant cascading impact on agriculture economy and food security therefore investigation of seasonal hydro climatology of cauvery river basin is vital as it experiences dominant south west and north east monsoons the long term mean annual and seasonal rainfall characteristics for the period 1951 2016 are shown in fig 5 the south west monsoon jjas rainfall rainfall covers the northern and north western regions of the catchment whereas north east monsoon ond rainfall covers the southern and south eastern regions of the basin fig 5 top panel a gradient of rainfall pattern is observed for both seasonal rainfall fig 5 jjas and ond rainfall most of the grids in the northern and north western part of the basin shows significantly increasing trend during jjas rainfall fig 5 middle and lower panel however the southern and south eastern part of the basin exhibits a mixed trend direction during north east monsoon fig 5 middle panel at seasonal time scale the northern part of the basin is significantly wetter than southern part fig 5 middle panel seasonally wet regions of the basin need to be better managed by proper planning and policy for water allocation to different demand sectors the timing and magnitude of different percentiles of annual rainfall receipt affect the partitioning of rainfall into runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration thus controlling the water availability for different demand sectors at seasonal time scales in cauvery basin significant changes in the distribution of rainfall timing at different percentiles of annual rainfall and their corresponding rainfall amount are observed fig 6 around 10 of grids have shown significant changes in the distribution of timing of rainfall during 1984 2016 relative to 1951 1983 similarly higher number of grids 15 30 exhibit changes in the receipt of rainfall amount at different percentiles of annual rainfall this may have implications to many demand sectors for example in rainfall dependent agricultural activities changes in timing and amount of rainfall will have impact on growth of paddy and its transplantation to field and subsequent water availability to meet crop water requirements this will affect overall crop yield crop market and livelihood of the people 4 2 seasonal flow behaviour using regime curves like rainfall patterns spatial variability of streamflow patterns is significant as it informs about the quantum of water availability across different seasons different hydro climatic and catchment characteristics like phase relationship between rainfall and evapotranspiration catchment wetness and storage land use and land cover aridity index are important drivers of streamflow regimes the knowledge about the seasonal patterns of streamflow across the river is vital for managing water resources in rainfall dependent agricultural and allied activities the signature of the influence of south west monsoon and north east monsoon is exhibited in the regime curves of streamflow moreover the combined influence of these monsoons is noted where the sub catchment experience both seasons the northern and north western gauging stations m h halli t narasipur kollegal and muthankera locations 2 5 6 and 4 respectively in fig 1 shows strong seasonality in streamflow which corresponds to the timing of the south west monsoon fig 7 the gauges savandapur thengumarahada and musiri locations 9 10 and 12 respectively in fig 1 at the central part of the basin exhibit bi modal regime curves indicating the dominance of south west and north east monsoon seasons the impact of north east monsoon season is dominant in the flow regimes of south eastern gauging stations exhibiting significant flows during winter months understanding the components of water balance and their variability across annual and seasonal scales is key to perceive hydrological functioning of a system in context of cauvery basin the regime curves portray seasonal flow characteristics as the basin experiences both south west and north east monsoons bimodal variability of flows is observed in central portion of the basin however higher summer seasonal flow and moderate winter flow patterns are observed in the north western and southern part of the basin policy planners need to use the seasonal flow variability across space to frame a sustainable water use policy in the basin 4 3 influence of human activities on streamflow variability in addition to climate variability construction of water retention structures has immense potential to alter the short and long term temporal variability of streamflow thus affecting the periods of high and low flows sedimentation and streamflow predictability at downstream section flow duration curve fdc and permutation entropy pe are used to understand the changes in streamflow variability and predictability respectively due to human activities in addition an analysis is performed to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities impact of dams on mean annual streamflow due to the construction of dams at t narasipur and kollegal gauge stations locations shown in fig 1 the impact of kabini dam location shown in fig 1 on streamflow variability at two different locations can have different patterns a similar change in the streamflow variability from fdc is observed fig 8 b and fig 8d after the construction of kabini dam at two gauging sites however the predictability of streamflow decreased at kollegal fig 8c increased post dam pe and increased at t narasipur this type of change can be attributed to difference in runoff generation at two contributing catchments and rainfall gradient another effect of dam is noted on increased low flows fig 8b and fig 8d reflecting the storage characteristics of dam it is observed that the mean annual streamflow has decreased at t narasipur gauge station after the construction of kabini dam overall an estimated 66 5 and 33 5 decrease in streamflow is observed at t narasipur due to the contributions of climate change and the construction of dam respectively however the contribution of climate change and dam construction on the decrease in mean annual streamflow at kollegal gauge station is 37 and 63 respectively the operation of a large number of dams apart from two major dams kabini and krishnaraja sagara in kollegal catchment is responsible for significantly higher contribution of dams in the reduction of streamflow the flow dynamics at gauging stations downstream of a dam behave differently the rainfall runoff transformation processes occurring within the landscape downstream of dam contributing to streamflow at these stations may superimpose the influence of dam modified flows this may alter the regularity patterns of streamflow affecting the water use scenarios at the downstream of a dam 4 4 long term extreme hydro climatology the period of prolong dry or wet days impact the soil moisture and subsequently affect the partitioning of water and energy at basin scale understanding the dynamics of the extreme spells is crucial in reservoir operation policy choice of agricultural crops and cropping patterns functioning of riverine ecosystem and downstream water quality and quantity the north western part of the basin exhibits higher number of wet days fig 9 a greater than 70 on an average than rest of the basin however the contribution of extreme rainfall to annual rainfall in this region is around 60 fig 9d however the central and southern part of the basin experience moderately lesser number of wet days around 60 days with more extreme rainfall more than 80 of annual rainfall due to extreme rainfall than rest of the basin therefore southern region receives high rainfall in lesser number of days which may induce flood like situation and therefore need a different approach to manage and hold water than rest of the basin the northern part of the basin receives moderate to high rainfall in higher number of wet days relative to the southern counterpart most of the central and southern part of the basin exhibit decrease in wet days with increase in the fraction of annual rainfall due to extreme rain fig 9b and e however the northern part of the basin exhibits increasing wet days with decreasing fraction of annual rainfall due to extreme rain the period of extreme dry and wet spells is of immense important to understand the resilience of the basin during shortage and excess of water availability the northern part of the basin is experiencing decreasing trend in extreme dry spell length while the southern part exhibits increasing trend in the dry spell period fig 10 b these changes are found to be significant more in the northern part than the southern part of the basin fig 10c however the duration of extreme wet spell is fairly uniformly distributed across the basin with higher duration in the north western and western part of the basin fig 10d which also exhibit decrease trend fig 10e 4 5 long term water balance assessment of the long term water budget provides insightful inferences about the water availability in a catchment to this end the vic model is employed to estimate the long term water balance in the cauvery basin and significant trends are identified the statistical analysis for rainfall is provided in detail in section 4 1 fig 11 fig 12 and fig 13 show the long term mean annual and seasonal jjas and ond water balance simulated for the years 1951 2016 the total surface runoff simulations indicate that the western part of the basin has increased runoff potential at the annual scale fig 11a and during south west monsoon jjas season fig 12a whereas the eastern part of the basin is found to have an increased runoff potential during the north eastern monsoon season fig 13a this could be attributed to the seasonal variations in rainfall distributions however most of the grids show a declining trend in the availability of total runoff at both seasonal and annual scales the north west and the north western part of the basin has significantly increasing trends in total surface runoff potential and evapotranspiration during jjas fig 11 the eastern part of the basin exhibits higher values of evapotranspiration which could be attributed to the impact of large scale paddy cultivation in the deltaic regions from fig 2 and fig 11 it can be observed that the higher evapotranspiration values are in alignment with the agricultural and forested areas in the basin evapotranspiration in the northern part of the basin seems to have a significant decrease which could be attributed to the increase in built up area regions near bengaluru city in karnataka which can be observed from fig 2 baseflow is the critical component of the water balance which supplies water to the river network during non rainy period of the year therefore significant changes in baseflow can have implications to agriculture riverine ecology and water quality the north western part of the basin shows comparatively high baseflow which can be attributed to the influence of topography due to the presence of western ghats for majority of the grids baseflow contribution is observed to have an increasing trend during ond and for jjas and annual scale it manifests mixed trends fig 12 fig 13 the water balance components are observed to exhibit similar patterns in significance of trends as that of the rainfall during jjas and ond seasons fig 14 shows the annual average water balance for cauvery river basin for the period 1951 2016 the major component of the water balance is evapotranspiration followed by total surface runoff and baseflow the large tracts of agricultural land followed by plantations and forests could be the potential contributors of high evapotranspiration in the basin the analysis shows that there is a decline in the availability for water resources with increasing demand in the basin due to expansion of urban population and large scale shifts in land use patterns 4 6 drought duration analysis drought is a complex and slow process which develops over time in conjunction with precipitation and temperature it occurs over range of time scales and affects agricultural productivity water availability and economy of a region drought duration one of the important characteristics of drought can be utilized to understand the spatial patterns of drought time scales and its implications the vic simulated surface runoff and soil moisture along with observed rainfall are used to investigate the spatial trends in long term drought durations of these variables a similarity in spatial patterns of the trends is observed in rainfall and runoff drought durations across the cauvery basin fig 15 the central and southern portion of the basin exhibit relatively shorter drought durations whereas it is larger in northern and south eastern deltaic region the mean annual rainfall in central and southern portion of the basin is high due to contribution of south west monsoon rainfall however annual rainfall in southern deltaic region is low due to relatively less amount of rainfall during north east monsoon similar spatial trends in runoff drought durations are also observed revealing the association with rainfall anomalies higher soil moisture drought durations are observed in southern and south eastern deltaic regions which can be attributed to high inter annual rainfall variability this poses serious challenges to the paddy cultivation in this region due to limited water availability a vital component to frame sustainable water use policy is to understand the dynamics long term hydroclimatic variables at multiple time scales the long term seasonal and annual variability of rainfall and associated extreme characteristics reveal the temporal evolution of water availability in the basin the hydrological signatures based on regime curves provided the information on seasonal water availability indicating the role of monsoons and its spatial variation this understanding of regional variability in seasonal water availability should be harnessed for policy framing of water allocation the water availability is found to be affected by human activities which modifies the streamflow dynamics it is observed that the predictability and the temporal variability of streamflow has changed significantly after the construction of dams this may affect the downstream water use and riverine ecosystem where both timing and adequate water quantity plays a major role the assessment of long term water balance components and hydro climatology shows significant trends in the hydrological behaviour of cauvery river basin the analysis shows that the hydrology of the basin is greatly influenced by the changes in land use patterns analysis at the annual scale shows significantly increasing trends in the evapotranspiration and decline in the total runoff potential evapotranspiration comprises the major losses in the basin which can be attributed to the prevalent lulc classes being cropland plantations and forests the annual and seasonal water balance studies signify that there are pronounced seasonal variations in the availability of water within the basin seasonally wet and dry regions in the basin are identified in the study and such regions require adequate attention during water allocation and development of a sustainable policy framework 5 summary and conclusions this paper provides a descriptive overview of the availability of water resources in the cauvery river basin which is facing major challenges in water resources management in the recent decades the evaluation of the long term trends in hydro climatology and water balance have provided significant insights on the distribution and availability of water resources within the basin the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources are found to be highly uneven and the variations in water balance components align with the changes in land use land cover patterns across the basin under the scenario of decreasing availability of global water resources it becomes extremely important to prioritize the need of efficient management of available resources few plausible solutions to tackle the problem of water crisis can be integrated water resources management concise assessment of water availability and demand sustainable agricultural practices like rationalizing cropping patterns adequate management of frequent floods and droughts like conservation of flood flows and inter basin water transfers it is also important to look at the interconnectivity between the surface water and groundwater and have micro level information about the recharging properties of aquifers to consider the potential and applicability of artificial recharge water resources development plans should be devised for the river basins with more focus on the recycling and reusing of the available resources there should be continuous monitoring on the riverine ecosystems and stringent policies should be adopted to prevent the constant loading of rivers with hazardous micropollutants and bio accumulation of toxic substances this paper attempts to provide vital insights on the water availability within the cauvery river basin which could be beneficial in framing improved water management policies to ensure enhanced water security in the anthropocene the availability of water resources in the future greatly depends on the planning and management of river basins in the changing environment therefore there is a great necessity to build synergies between research and policy for the sustainable conservation of water resources credit authorship contribution statement r gowri

20119,drought is a complex multifaceted and one of the most widespread natural disasters causing an economic loss of billions of dollars drought declaration is crucial since it signifies the beginning of states s response to drought india s current drought management policy is specified in the manual for drought management 2016 while the manual provides comprehensive guidelines to states and regional drought monitoring centres dmc s for monitoring and declaration of droughts assessing the current drought detection framework and its suitability in different regions has been lacking using gridded products of precipitation soil moisture and remote sensing indicators we examine the differences between detected and declared droughts for all the districts in india during the 2000 2017 period comparison of detected and declared droughts show a higher probability of detection pod in central india in contrast lower pod was found in regions of high drought susceptibility like rajasthan andhra pradesh and karnataka large differences between the detected and declared droughts were identified in the irrigated regions of punjab and gangetic plain the use of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif instead of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi as a remote sensing indicator improved drought detection based on pod and false alarm ratio far in central and western parts of india the framework specified in the drought manual detects most of the major droughts that affected a large part of the country however regional droughts in rajasthan gujarat and karnataka are frequently missed finally we highlight the limitations in the existing drought monitoring framework and opportunities for its enhancement keywords drought declaration drought manual drought management soil moisture ndvi 1 introduction drought is one of the most devastating natural disasters causing huge economic liabilities drought can manifest in various forms in a region starting from a negative precipitation anomaly and then translating to other phases of the hydrological cycle affecting domestic water availability agriculture the environmental and socio economic balance of the affected region 1 3 due to the multifaceted nature of drought it becomes difficult to identify its severity extent and impacts drought monitoring systems worldwide driven by meteorological observations provide crucial information to water managers farmers and governmental institutions to prepare for impending water distress with the increasing susceptibility of droughts it becomes vital for governmental institutions and stakeholders to review their monitoring and response strategies especially in india where agriculture is the primary source of income for more than half of the nation s population droughts in various forms can be identified by the negative anomaly of a water component in a region compared to its normal long term conditions while drought indicators such as standardized precipitation index spi 4 standardized soil moisture index ssmi 5 and standardized streamflow index ssi 6 rely on the conditions of one component of the water cycle in a region on the other hand various drought indicators such as standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei 7 integrated drought index idi 8 and multivariate standardized drought index msdi 5 address the multifaceted nature of drought by including various components into one indicator suited for drought assessment drought monitoring systems such as united states drought monitor 9 and high resolution south asia drought 10 11 monitor conditions using drought indicators that are based on in situ observations modelling products and satellite products while most of the current drought management policies worldwide are limited to crisis management after a drought mitigation strategies are essential to prevent exacerbation of drought impacts by helping water managers and stakeholders take proactive actions 12 13 therefore drought monitoring systems and outlooks provide a crucial information for all the stakeholders many regions in india are prone to recurrent droughts initiated by weak summer monsoons 14 17 although india has many organizations monitoring real time meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought conditions a comprehensive framework to provide crucial drought information to stakeholders all over the country is still lacking declaration of droughts which signifies the beginning of the government s response to the drought situation in a district is governed by the guidelines provided by the manual for drought management 2016 the drought manual offers comprehensive guidelines for drought monitoring detection and declaration however declarations are ultimately governed only by ground verification of agricultural losses hence putting the entire liability on state drought monitoring centres dmc to monitor and declare droughts recent studies by gautam bana 18 and gupta et al 19 addressed the challenges for adaptation and mitigation of drought risk in india yet an assessment of the current drought declaration framework is still lacking bandyopadhyay et al 20 found several drawbacks in the current policy due to a common drought declaration framework being applied across india for instance drought mitigation measures are mostly inadequate ineffective and reactive in nature 20 hence it becomes essential that the current framework is assessed at a national scale to identify the regions where the framework fails to detect droughts effectively the drought monitoring framework specifies some details for the use of indicators however the critical information regarding the use of indicators such as length of accumulation periods and the time frame necessary for observation is not specified in the drought manual furthermore the utility of remote sensing indicators such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi normalized difference water index ndwi and vegetation condition index vci specified in the drought manual used for agricultural drought monitoring needs to be examined solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif which has higher sensitivity to agricultural droughts than ndvi 21 can be evaluated for drought monitoring in india we used observations remotely sensed datasets and a hydrological modelling framework to examine the differences between drought declaration and drought detection recommended by the drought manual in addition we evaluate the factors that can play an important role in drought detection in different seasons in india we first find district wise drought detections made by the framework during the 2000 2017 period then we compare the framework detections to actual drought declarations in each district in india each year we address the two objectives i to examine the role of soil moisture and vegetation indicators on drought detection and ii to compare the detected and declared droughts for the major multi year and regional droughts in india drought in india has several socio poltical aspects associated and has received considerable attention of policy makers post independence 22 23 however aim of the current work is not to review the socio political aspects of drought in india we examine the differences and their potential mostly technical reasons between the declared and detected droughts based on the framework provided in the drought manual 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets drought declaration requires real time monitoring of drought indicators of anomalous condition of precipitation streamflow reservoir level groundwater soil moisture and vegetation health monitoring of drought indicators as specified by the drought manual is required drought is declared in a district if the indicators meet the conditions of the drought declaration framework while a few state departments might have drought monitoring centers dmc s that collect required observations for the drought declaration other dmc s often rely on the national organizations like india meteorological department imd mahalanobis national crop forecast centre mncfc central research institute for dryland agriculture crida indian space and research organization isro and state level remote sensing centers to collect data or provide direct values of drought indicators for drought detection using the framework specified by the drought manual the dmc in a district requires rainfall observations for trigger 1 and impact indicators for trigger 2 impact indicators show drought conditions in soil moisture agricultural hydrology and vegetation in a district we used gridded datasets of precipitation soil moisture and remotely sensed products to implement the drought manual s framework for drought detection in each district of india we used a 0 25 gridded dataset 24 provided by imd for the 1951 2018 period the inverse distance weighted interpolation idw scheme was applied on observed daily rainfall data from a network of 6995 rain gauges all over india to prepare the gridded precipitation 24 comparison with the other rainfall datasets showed good agreement in capturing inter annual seasonal and spatial variability by the gridded precipitation dataset over the indian region 24 25 in addition gridded precipitation captures critical features associated with the spatial and temporal variability of the indian summer monsoon rainfall 24 using rainfall we estimated indicators required for trigger 1 including dry spell and spi 4 long term soil moisture in situ observations are not available across india to provide reliable and timely information on drought moreover satellite soil moisture products have considerable latency and do not provide root zone soil moisture we used gridded soil moisture simulated using the variable infiltration capacity model s simple groundwater model vic sim gm at 0 25 spatial resolution from shah and mishra 17 the vic model simulated soil moisture has been evaluated against the available in situ and satellite datasets 15 25 26 the vic simgm model considers vegetation soil parameters and observed meteorological forcing as inputs the model simulations were conducted after calibration and evaluation using daily meteorological forcings of precipitation wind speed and minimum and maximum temperatures further details on the vic simgm simulations can be obtained from 17 the drought manual specifies using a simple water balance model that can be used to estimate soil moisture up to 30 cm 27 however the root zone of some crops may go beyond the top 30 cm as mentioned in mishra et al 26 we use ndvi from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr which is available from 1981 onwards to examine vegetation conditions during drought 28 we used the version 5 product of avhrr ndvi which was prepared under the long term data project by nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and the university of maryland umd ndvi is available at 0 05 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution the high spatial and temporal resolutions and long term data availability make avhrr ndvi suitable for agricultural drought monitoring 29 31 yield prediction 28 32 and monitoring of vegetation dynamics 33 34 we used solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif as an alternate remote sensing indicator of agricultural drought the global sif product gosif was developed using observations from orbiting carbon observatory 2 oco 2 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and meteorological reanalysis from modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra 2 35 the gosif data comprises sif at 0 05 resolution from 2000 to 2017 at 8 day intervals sif signal has a high correlation with gross primary productivity gpp moreover the ability of sif to capture drought induced changes in absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar makes it suitable for monitoring terrestrial productivity and agricultural droughts 35 38 to validate drought detections we use the yearly district wise declared drought records available at farmers portal ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare government of india the records exist for most of the districts in india from 2000 to 2017 2 2 hydrological model we used the variable infiltration capacity simple groundwater model vic simgm 39 to simulate water balance components at 0 25 spatial and daily temporal resolutions for 1951 2018 the vic simgm combines the vic hydrological model with a simple groundwater model simgm 40 the lumped vic simgm model integrates an unconfined aquifer beneath the multi layer soil column of the vic model and replaces vic s baseflow scheme with parametric equations of the simple groundwater model 39 the vic model is a grid based macro scale model which solves water and energy balance at each timestep in each grid cell 41 43 while considering sub grid variability in soil elevation vegetation and soil moisture we used a calibrated and evaluated vic simgm model as described in asoka and mishra 44 and shah and mishra 17 the model was calibrated for the seventeen major river basins in india and showed a good performance in simulating streamflow and groundwater storage anomalies 44 in addition the vic simgm provides reliable soil moisture estimates as shown by the good agreement against total water storage anomaly twsa from the grace satellites 15 2 3 drought detection framework the drought detection framework lays down a guideline for the state agencies to monitor drought development at the district level and declare drought if the conditions are satisfied tables 1 3 the drought manual specifies that regional dmc s duty is to monitor droughts in their districts actively states can only declare drought if the indicators for an administrative area district satisfy the framework s necessary triggers with a focus primarily on agricultural droughts final declarations are made only after ground truthing and confirming that significant crop losses have occurred in the district the deadlines for states to declare droughts are specified as per the termination of cropping periods of kharif june october and rabi november march crops the framework sets mandatory indicators as trigger 1 and impact indicators as trigger 2 for the drought detection in a district tables 1 3 the triggers specified in the first draft of the manual for drought management 2016 were suitable mainly for kharif crops after the amendment released in 2018 a separate chapter was added to the annexure of the drought manual to address drought declarations during the rabi crop a trigger 1 for kharif crops trigger 1 is set off after checking rainfall deviation standardized precipitation index spi and dry spell as specified in the manual tables 1 2 for rabi crops the amendment specifies the state drought monitoring agencies to identify their district s dominant agricultural situation which may be one of the four types as defined in the revision rainfed crops depending on residual moisture surface irrigated command areas groundwater irrigated areas and north east monsoon nem dependent areas the northeast monsoon provides rainfall to some states in southern india during the october to march period based on the prevailing agricultural situation of the district distinct mandatory indicators and the observational periods for each condition are specified in the amendment finally using the mandatory indicators in the amendment trigger 1 can be assessed for the rabi cropping period we used observed gridded precipitation from imd which was aggregated to a weekly and monthly scale and averaged for all the grids within a district we identified dry spell using the weekly rainfall data and rainfall deviation and spi using the monthly rainfall data for all districts more details on the estimation of rainfall deviation spi and dry spell can be obtained from the supplemental information based on the observation periods for the kharif and rabi droughts we checked whether trigger 1 is set off during the years 2000 2017 for years in which trigger 1 is set off we further investigated the impact indicators for the cropping periods specified in trigger 2 in the drought manual b trigger 2 the drought manual specifies various indicators to assess the drought impact based on meteorology soil moisture hydrology remote sensing and crop losses in a district when trigger 1 is set off for a cropping period table 3 since rainfall model generated soil moisture estimates and remotely sensed data are available in near real time we consider these as impact indicators for trigger 2 we used the standardized precipitation index spi and percentage available soil moisture pasm as impact indicators for meteorological and soil moisture droughts respectively for observing droughts through remote sensing we used both solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif deviation and ndvi deviation as our impact indicators we did not use indicators like groundwater drought index gwdi streamflow drought index sfdi and reservoir storage index rsi due to the limitations of continuous observed data and the applicability of sparse data in drought analysis at a district scale based on the drought manual the category of drought in spi pasm and ndvi sif is first identified to decide the overall drought category from trigger 2 see supplemental information for more details we used the minimum number of indicators three for determining the overall category of drought if all the three indicators show the severe category then the overall drought category was considered as severe if any two indicators show moderate or severe drought then the category is considered moderate in all the other cases the drought category was considered normal drought can only be declared if trigger 2 is moderate or severe after which final declarations are made based on ground truthing moreover states can reduce the drought category by one rank if the irrigation percentage in a district is more than 75 for example if a district falls under the severe drought category based on the indicators in trigger 2 then the state government may consider it a moderate drought if a district has irrigated area more than 75 on the other hand if the district is under the moderate drought category based on the indicators and has more than 75 area under irrigation the state government may consider it normal ground truthing is needed in each of 10 of the drought affected villages which are selected randomly estimating crop damage more than 33 of normal based on field verification will qualify for the declaration of drought for severe droughts the loss in yields should be more than 50 of normal drought assessment during a cropping season is done twice within the first two months and at the end of the cropping season the initial evaluation is to check for the summer monsoon s delayed onset resulting in reduced crop sown area also known as early season drought similar to the drought manual guidelines we used the framework to detect drought in the early and full seasons of kharif and rabi cropping periods since farmers in many districts may be planting crops both in kharif and rabi seasons we applied the framework for both periods for all the districts in india irrespective of their dominant agriculture type we compared the drought detection results against the drought declaration records provided by the farmers portal https farmer gov in drought droughtreport aspx the declaration records only show whether a particular year was a drought year in a district or not regardless of whether it occurred in the kharif or rabi season similarly in our analysis if we find any year to be having early or late season droughts for both the kharif or rabi season that year was considered a drought year we used the probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far as a metric for quantitative comparison of the drought framework s district wise detections against the actual declarations made by the state for the observational period of 2000 2017 each year detected by the framework or declared by the state can be categorized as a hit h detected by the framework and declared miss m declared but not detected by the framework and false alarm f detected by the framework but not declared therefore pod is the fraction of detections by the framework correctly detected against total declarations pod h h m far is the ratio of false detections by the framework against total detections far f h f pod and far are commonly used metrics for drought detection accuracy and assessment 45 48 3 results 3 1 influence of soil moisture and vegetation indicators soil moisture and vegetation indicators play an essential role in drought detection as specified by the drought manual since soil moisture observations are limited to a few locations with insufficient record length model based soil moisture is often used for drought monitoring and prediction 8 26 49 50 soil moisture persistence can vary based on the soil moisture depth considered for the drought assessment 26 for instance mishra et al 26 reported that deeper soil moisture has higher persistence due to which drought onset can be delayed the other potential reason for assessing the role of soil moisture and vegetation indicators in drought declaration is related to the regional differences due to regional differences in drought susceptibility 51 applying a common drought detection framework for all the districts in india as specified by the drought manual may not be appropriate therefore we need to evaluate the efficacy of the drought detection framework in india s districts we used the framework specified in the drought manual to detect droughts in each district for the period of 2000 2017 we used dry spell rainfall deviation and spi as mandatory indicators in trigger 1 and spi pasm and ndvi as impact indicators in trigger 2 please see supplemental material for details however the drought manual does not specify the depth of soil layer to be taken for pasm evaluations since major crops such as wheat maize rice and sugarcane have maximum root depth lying from 50 to 100 cm 52 we use the vic simgm simulated soil moisture at two depths up to 30 cm and 60 cm for estimating pasm in addition we compared ndvi and sif as impact indicators in trigger 2 to examine the effectiveness of sif as a remote sensing indicator for agricultural drought prediction see supplemental information for more details hence with trigger 1 being the same we used four combinations of trigger 2 spi pasm based on 30 cm soil moisture and ndvi spi pasm30 ndvi spi pasm based on 60 cm soil moisture and ndvi spi pasm60 ndvi spi pasm based on 30 cm soil moisture and sif spi pasm30 sif and spi pasm based on 60 cm soil moisture and sid spi pasm60 sif to separately detect district wise droughts following the framework for each combination then the drought detection in each district made by the framework for each case was checked against the actual declarations using metric pod and far we estimated pod for the four combinations of indicators used for trigger 2 fig 1 since declaration records are not available for each district a few districts were excluded from the analysis because of the lack of data all the four combinations show a similar spatial distribution of pod for instance relatively higher pod greater than 0 8 was found for most of the districts located in central india higher pod was also obtained in south india and gujarat districts with values ranging above 0 8 for most districts districts in rajasthan andhra pradesh karnataka and maharashtra showed pod in 0 4 0 6 lower values of pod 0 2 were only observed in the districts of punjab and the north eastern states of india relatively lower pod in punjab was associated with less drought declaration for instance drought was declared in punjab only in 2002 during the 2000 2017 period failing the detection of 2002 drought using the indicators will lead to a zero pod value similarly in districts of north east states drought declaration records show only 2009 as the year in which drought has been declared accounting for the zero pod value if the drought is not detected using 30 cm or 60 cm soil depth for pasm evaluations does not significantly change pod for districts fig 1 this can be due to similar soil moisture anomalies found at both 30 cm and 60 cm depths as bhardwaj et al 53 reported soil moisture persistence at deeper depths can delay the onset of drought and affect drought severity 26 in the drought declaration framework it does not matter as droughts were identified at a seasonal time scale however at weekly time scales using the soil moisture from the two depths would certainly affect drought intensity and severity pod was improved in a few districts especially over central india when sif was used to evaluate vegetation health instead of ndvi fig 1 the improvement in pod with sif can be attributed to the higher sensitivity of sif than ndvi in capturing short term droughts liu et al 21 reported the faster response of sif for drought affected wheat plantations while pod represents the framework s ability to capture the declared droughts far shows whether the framework detected droughts are accurate or not considering declared drought as a reference we estimated far for the same as for pod four combinations for each district in india fig 2 a higher far indicates that the framework detects droughts more often than they are declared while a lower far suggests that the framework accurately detects droughts we find relatively higher far for most districts of central india where observed pod values are also high far above 0 6 in these districts shows that more than 60 percent of drought detections based on the framework do not match with the actual drought declarations a combination of high pod and high far in the districts in central india may be due to more droughts being detected than declared districts of punjab gangetic plain region and north east states show high far 0 8 red high far in punjab and north east states districts is due to declaration records showing drought only once while the framework detects more droughts than declarations we also find that irrigated regions show a high far which can be attributed to the role of irrigation on crop yields for instance soil moisture and precipitation based indicators identify droughts in the irrigated regions however crop yields might be maintained due to groundwater based irrigation lower far 0 2 was observed in rajasthan andhra pradesh and karnataka which indicates that the framework detected droughts are mostly accurate in these regions but the framework detects only 40 60 of the total declared droughts in these regions pod 0 4 0 6 which shows that the framework fails to detect the most drought occurrences in rajasthan andhra pradesh and karnataka like metric pod most districts far values do not change using 60 cm soil depth instead of 30 cm soil depth for pasm evaluations an increase of far in districts of rajasthan using sif in place of ndvi can again be accounted for the higher sensitivity of sif in detecting agricultural droughts pod and far show regional differences in the drought detection using the specified methodology of the framework the framework detects only a few droughts in districts with a high number of declared droughts in rajasthan karnataka and andhra pradesh suggesting a framework to be designed separately to account for regional differences high far in our analysis can be majorly attributed to the missing distinction of kharif and rabi droughts in declaration records and the role of irrigation sif as a remotely sensed indicator of drought increases the framework s detection efficiency and can be used as an alternative to ndvi 3 2 drought detection vs declarations due to droughts multifaceted and complex nature it becomes difficult to assess their impacts severity duration and spatial extent while a drought monitoring system and the drought manual s framework may capture real time anomalies agriculture may also be affected by the propagation of droughts and regional factors that may not be accounted for by the framework to assess the framework s ability to capture both spatial extent and propagation of droughts into multiple seasons we evaluated whether the framework captured droughts years that fall into the category of a major droughts characterized by widespread extent b multi year droughts and c regional droughts since most droughts start from a precipitation deficit during the summer monsoon we used spi to define and identify major multi year and regional droughts in india irrespective of a region s dependence on irrigation 3 3 major droughts we defined an occurrence of a major drought for a season if spi estimated using all india averaged precipitation is below 1 5 therefore the identified droughts will be under the severe extreme or exceptional category 9 we used the 4 month spi at the end of september to identify drought conditions in the kharif season for the rabi season september december sond and october february ondjf we used the 4 5 month spi at the end of december and february respectively table 4 as a result we identified 2002 and 2009 as major droughts for the kharif season table 4 on the other hand major droughts for the rabi season occurred in 2000 2002 2011 2015 and 2016 our identification of droughts is consistent with recent studies 15 26 for instance mishra 15 reported 2000 as one of india s five most severe meteorological and hydrological droughts since 1870 mishra et al 26 found drought in 2002 to be among the five most widespread monsoon season droughts based on precipitation and soil moisture deficits in india for 1951 2018 similarly mishra et al 54 reported that 2015 ranked first in the two year cumulative rainfall deficit from 1906 to 2015 we compared the major droughts detected for the kharif and rabi seasons against the declared droughts figs 3 4 moreover we also compared different drought indicators to understand their contribution to drought detection during the major drought years we evaluated the declarations made by the state agencies and the drought detections based on the framework during the kharif season which lasts from june to september in 2002 droughts were declared in districts covering most regions of india apart from districts in bihar bengal and north east states fig 3 the framework detected most of the declared droughts in 2002 during the kharif period but did not detect droughts for districts in maharashtra s western part drought was not detected as the western part of maharashtra received normal rainfall in the early season june to july with no delay in the summer monsoon onset in june 55 moreover the combined rainfall deficit in the entire monsoon season june to september was also in the normal range rainfall deviation 19 however in july entire india received largely deficient rainfall 56 which may be the reason for crop losses leading to states declaring droughts the 2002 drought was mainly caused due to failure of the summer monsoon in july with a rainfall deficit of more than 50 15 spi and soil moisture showed drought in many regions except bihar bengal northeast and maharashtra however ndvi showed drought conditions mainly in the western part of india which can be attributed to other factors irrigation moreover seasonal averaged ndvi might have overcome drought impacts in the late monsoon season august and september overall we find that declared and detected droughts were comparable for most of the regions in india during kharif 2002 similar to the kharif season drought in 2002 a major drought during the summer monsoon season occurred in 2009 in 2009 drought declarations were made in districts covering most regions in india apart from districts of punjab haryana uttarakhand gujarat west bengal chhattisgarh and south east coast fig 3 while the framework detected droughts in most of these regions it failed to capture droughts in jammu and kashmir karnataka and kerala for major drought years most of the detections by the framework in the kharif season are contingent only on spi and pasm as impact indicators ndvi used as an impact indicator detects droughts in much lesser districts than spi or pasm fig 3 similar to kharif season droughts 2002 and 2009 the major droughts during the rabi season occurred in 2000 2002 2011 2015 and 2016 fig 4 state governments declared droughts in the districts located in central and western india in 2000 fig 4 we find that detected droughts were considerably higher than the declared droughts in many regions in the rabi season of 2000 for instance droughts were detected in the indo gangetic plain and punjab however they were not declared by the governments fig 4 spi and pasm identified a majority of the detected droughts in the rabi season of 2000 while the contribution from ndvi was considerably lower fig 4 in contrast to 2000 detected droughts using the framework were substantially lesser than those declared by the state governments drought estimates using pasm closely matched with the declared droughts in 2015 detected and declared droughts were comparable for most of the regions in india the 2015 drought was one of the most severe droughts in india 54 the drought occurred for the two consecutive years 2014 2015 and the cumulative rainfall deficit over the gangetic plain was more than 50 54 in 2011 and 2016 detected droughts were considerably higher than the declared droughts fig 4 for instance the 2016 drought caused due to the failure of the northeast monsoon in south india was not declared by the state governments the 2016 2018 drought in south india was the worst drought during the 1870 2018 period 57 overall we find a considerable difference in the detected and declared droughts in india s kharif and rabi seasons 3 4 multi year droughts a drought originates due to precipitation deficit propagates through the hydrological cycle accumulating over time and manifesting in forms such as deficit in soil moisture streamflow reservoir and groundwater storage 53 58 59 severe droughts can be long lasting and affect several crop growing seasons for instance the 2014 2015 drought affected the indo gangetic plain and occurred due to the failure of two consecutive summer monsoons the drought affected soil moisture and groundwater in the region 54 similarly the 2016 18 drought in south india resulted in a crisis in the area the 2016 18 drought was caused by the failure of the northeast monsoon 57 we used a 24 month spi to identify the multi year droughts at the end of the water year june to may we considered severe extreme and exceptional multi year droughts by considering 24 month spi less than 1 5 table 4 we identified the 2001 drought as multi year drought in the kharif season drought affected south india and northeast regions as shown by spi and pasm ndvi did not capture the 2001 kharif season drought the declared droughts were mainly centered in rajasthan bihar maharashtra and a few other states in rajasthan and maharashtra droughts were not declared but detected on the other hand in tamil nadu drought was detected but not declared similarly considerable differences were found in the detected and declared droughts during the rabi season of 2001 fig 5 for instance districts with detected droughts are located in the northwestern regions however droughts were declared in rajsthan maharastra and karnataka states fig 5 3 5 regional drought due to the high variability of the indian summer monsoon different regions have a varying probability of drought occurrence drought severity and duration 60 61 mallya et al 62 and gupta et al 51 reported growing regional droughts and differences in india s regional drought susceptibility while major droughts may attract attention and response on a national scale regional drought occurrences may go unnoticed delaying necessary relief actions for that region s farmers to examine the difference between detected and declared droughts we identified the localized and region specific droughts we divided the indian region into six homogeneous regions central north east h1 himalayan region h2 north east h3 north west h4 peninsular region h5 and west central h6 based on the precipitation distribution to understand regional scale variability as in 63 of drought declaration and detection by the framework we use 4 5 month spi at the end of kharif and rabi cropping seasons separately for each zone is used to identify regional droughts separate for each season which were not detected as major or multi year droughts table 4 we identified regional droughts in the kharif season in 2003 2006 2012 and 2016 table 5 regional droughts detected in the rabi season occurred in 2003 2005 2007 2008 2012 and 2017 tables 6 and 7 consistent with the major and multi year droughts considerable differences were found between detected and declared droughts for the kharif season fig 6 districts with detected droughts were higher than declared drought in the indo gangetic plain for most years fig 6 similarly in the rabi season many districts with declared drought were lower than the detected droughts in gangetic plain in several years fig 7 4 discussion we compared detected and declared droughts based on the drought manual for the 2000 2017 period we used gridded precipitation satellite derived vegetation indices and model simulated soil moisture to detect droughts in india s districts the role of soil moisture depth and choice of vegetation indicator was examined for the effectiveness of detected droughts compared to declared droughts our results show that sif could be a better choice than ndvi for remote sensing based vegetation health indicators for drought detection in india however the depth of soil moisture 30 or 60 cm did not show a major difference in pod and far attributed to the seasonal scale analysis comparison of detected and declared droughts exhibited considerable differences for the major multi year and regional droughts our results show both overestimation and underestimation in the detected droughts compared to declared droughts in india using the framework specified by the drought manual moreover the number of districts with the detected and declared droughts compare well for the kharif season for the major droughts 2002 and 2009 indicating that large scale and severe droughts can be effectively detected and then declared more often however during the rabi season the districts with the detected droughts were considerably higher than those with actual declarations for most of years noticeable differences were found in the detected and declared droughts for multi year and regional droughts overall there are considerable differences in the detected droughts using the framework and actually declared droughts there can be several factors contributing to the difference between the detected and declared droughts we used only two steps trigger 1 and trigger 2 that are needed for drought detections the third step is based on field verification and ground truthing in which 10 of drought affected villages are selected randomly for crop cutting experiments if crop yields decline more than 33 in these ground truthing sites only then a drought is declared therefore the detected and declared droughts difference could be due to ground truthing and field verification for which information is not available in the public domain since the number of districts with the detected droughts was considerably higher in many years than the declared droughts one can assume that the major crops did not experience a decline of more than 33 in these districts notwithstanding the occurance of drought one possibility of maintaining yields during drought years is groundwater based irrigation 64 therefore even though rainfall soil moisture and remote sensing based indicators showed droughts droughts were not declared as yields were maintained by irrigation we also identified that the detected droughts in the intensively irrigated regions are significantly higher than the declared droughts which can be once again attributed to crop yields using groundwater based irrigation on the other hand declared droughts are often higher than the detected droughts in the arid regions rajasthan which can be due to considerable variability in rainfall and lack of irrigation from groundwater our results indicate that irrigation plays a vital role in the declaration of droughts for example drought was declared only once during 2000 2017 in punjab intensively irrigated with groundwater excessive groundwater based irrigation helped punjab maintain crop production even in the years that witnessed rainfall deficit however that has a high cost of rapid groundwater depletion and other environmental challenges 65 67 the impacts of moderate and severe droughts can be neglected with the groundwater pumping for irrigation in many parts of north india in this case the absence of a drought declaration may give a false sense of normalcy to the farmers and other stakeholders in these regions which may promote excessive groundwater pumping which will limit the scope of adaptation to increased rainfall variability in india 68 69 for example the drought manual suggests that the state government may reduce the drought category by one level in districts with more than 75 area irrigated other than the differences in the declared and detected droughts in the intensively irrigated regions there are limitations with the current drought detection and declaration framework for instance the drought manual specifies the use of dry spell and spi for trigger 1 however it remains unclear for which period spi needs to be estimated spi for short duration can have high uncertainty in the regions that do not receive sufficient rainfall or the districts state that do not use long term rainfall observations for estimation of spi for instance rainfall during june and july may not be enough to provide a robust estimation of spi in many districts of semi arid and arid regions of india moreover the drought manual does not give a clear recommendation on the climatological period for example the climatological period used to estimate the category of different indicators is not properly mentioned a short term record of remote sensing based indicators or hydrological indicators may not provide a reliable estimate of drought severity there are other challenges associated with the availability of long term data that have a reasonable number of droughts for each district in india for instance long term quality controlled datasets of soil moisture groundwater and ndvi that can be used as a reference for the drought monitoring agencies are not available the drought manual specifies the use of streamflow and groundwater based indicators however if drought detection and declaration happens at the administrative levels it remains unclear how these indicators will be used for instance streamflow at any given location can provide information on the condition of the upstream catchment since the administrative and catchment boundaries do not overlap streamflow for drought detection at the district level and declaration may not be appropriate similarly the density of groundwater observation wells in each district may vary and there can be many districts without a sufficient number of monitoring wells that can capture drought response similarly soil moisture depth for drought detection and the source of data is not correctly specified moreover all the indicators in trigger 2 have the same weightage in drought detection across india which needs to be evaluated appropriately the suggested drought indicators in trigger 1 and trigger 2 need to be assessed with the actual drought impacts other than technical aspects associated with drought detection several other aspects can influence drought declaration in districts for instance drought conditions may go unnoticed in the districts that are highly irrigated the declaration of drought is based on ground truthing and crop cutting experiments crop yields can be managed using groundwater from surface and groundwater resources in addition the drought prone regions in india may be in a better position in declaring droughts due to increased awareness and monitoring on the other hand in less drought prone districts declaration of drought can be easily missed for instance drought in punjab was declared only once during 2000 2017 mainly due to intensive irrigation from groundwater crop cutting experiments and ground truthing is time consuming which may also influence or delay drought declaration moreover states need to wait till the maturity of crops for the crop cutting experiments due to extreme droughts such as in 2002 crops could not be sown due to the failure of onset of rain which made it difficult to collect reliable crop cutting data 70 during droughts irrigated regions have excessive consumption of energy and withdrawal of groundwater which is not adequately considered in the drought declaration 70 despite the guidelines provided in the manual there can be deviations in drought declarations due to reasons other than technical tarquinio 2021 reddy 2016 bera and sen 2016 discussion of which is beyond the scope of this work in addition policies public outreach and better data availability can play a crucial role in raising awareness among people about water scarcity during drought as reported for san francisco bay area 71 increased data availability regarding drought hit areas and impacts from media social media and other forums can play a vital role in drought declaration 72 74 we find that there is a scope of improvement in the drought detection and declaration framework ground truthing and field verification is essential for the drought declaration as specified by the drought manual the availability of high resolution remotely sensed monitoring near real time drought monitoring and early warning and a reliable framework to provide crop yield forecast can add a lot of value to the existing framework for instance 75 76 showed that high resolution remotely sensed data can be used for the monitoring of cropped area of smallholder farms and to estimate yield gaps similarly ambika et al 77 used high resolution imagery to map irrigated area at 250 m resolution across india moreover high resolution data of vegetation health products and land surface temperature was developed that can be used for drought monitoring at village to block level 78 given the complexity of drought and associated spatial and temporal variabilities we need to put efforts for continuous monitoring of drought at weekly timescale across country at the resoluation that can provide information at sub district level 10 drought monitoring and early warming systems should provide information on different drought types meterological hydrological and agricultural along with the groundwater and surface water storage conditions moreover the long term availability of drought indicators regional scale impact assessment and linking drought indicators with drought impacts can strengthen the existing system the current drought declaration framework is more towards declaring agricultural droughts ignoring the resources required for long term drought management therefore drought declaration should also account for groundwater and surface water resources considering their long term sustainability 5 conclusions based on our findings we conclude the following o detected and declared droughts during the 2000 2017 period showed significant differences in india o the model simulated soil moisture at 30 and 60 cm depth did not show a considerable difference in the detected droughts however sif exhibited better performance for drought detection than ndvi o detected and declared droughts show a higher probability of detection pod in central india on the other hand lower pod was found in regions of high drought susceptibility like rajasthan andhra pradesh and karnataka large differences between the detected and declared droughts were identified in the irrigated areas of punjab and gangetic plain o the difference in detected and declared droughts can be attributed to ground truthing and crop cutting experiments irrigation uncertainty in data and indicators and several other socio political factors 7 discloser statement given his role as guest editor dr vimal

20119,drought is a complex multifaceted and one of the most widespread natural disasters causing an economic loss of billions of dollars drought declaration is crucial since it signifies the beginning of states s response to drought india s current drought management policy is specified in the manual for drought management 2016 while the manual provides comprehensive guidelines to states and regional drought monitoring centres dmc s for monitoring and declaration of droughts assessing the current drought detection framework and its suitability in different regions has been lacking using gridded products of precipitation soil moisture and remote sensing indicators we examine the differences between detected and declared droughts for all the districts in india during the 2000 2017 period comparison of detected and declared droughts show a higher probability of detection pod in central india in contrast lower pod was found in regions of high drought susceptibility like rajasthan andhra pradesh and karnataka large differences between the detected and declared droughts were identified in the irrigated regions of punjab and gangetic plain the use of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif instead of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi as a remote sensing indicator improved drought detection based on pod and false alarm ratio far in central and western parts of india the framework specified in the drought manual detects most of the major droughts that affected a large part of the country however regional droughts in rajasthan gujarat and karnataka are frequently missed finally we highlight the limitations in the existing drought monitoring framework and opportunities for its enhancement keywords drought declaration drought manual drought management soil moisture ndvi 1 introduction drought is one of the most devastating natural disasters causing huge economic liabilities drought can manifest in various forms in a region starting from a negative precipitation anomaly and then translating to other phases of the hydrological cycle affecting domestic water availability agriculture the environmental and socio economic balance of the affected region 1 3 due to the multifaceted nature of drought it becomes difficult to identify its severity extent and impacts drought monitoring systems worldwide driven by meteorological observations provide crucial information to water managers farmers and governmental institutions to prepare for impending water distress with the increasing susceptibility of droughts it becomes vital for governmental institutions and stakeholders to review their monitoring and response strategies especially in india where agriculture is the primary source of income for more than half of the nation s population droughts in various forms can be identified by the negative anomaly of a water component in a region compared to its normal long term conditions while drought indicators such as standardized precipitation index spi 4 standardized soil moisture index ssmi 5 and standardized streamflow index ssi 6 rely on the conditions of one component of the water cycle in a region on the other hand various drought indicators such as standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei 7 integrated drought index idi 8 and multivariate standardized drought index msdi 5 address the multifaceted nature of drought by including various components into one indicator suited for drought assessment drought monitoring systems such as united states drought monitor 9 and high resolution south asia drought 10 11 monitor conditions using drought indicators that are based on in situ observations modelling products and satellite products while most of the current drought management policies worldwide are limited to crisis management after a drought mitigation strategies are essential to prevent exacerbation of drought impacts by helping water managers and stakeholders take proactive actions 12 13 therefore drought monitoring systems and outlooks provide a crucial information for all the stakeholders many regions in india are prone to recurrent droughts initiated by weak summer monsoons 14 17 although india has many organizations monitoring real time meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought conditions a comprehensive framework to provide crucial drought information to stakeholders all over the country is still lacking declaration of droughts which signifies the beginning of the government s response to the drought situation in a district is governed by the guidelines provided by the manual for drought management 2016 the drought manual offers comprehensive guidelines for drought monitoring detection and declaration however declarations are ultimately governed only by ground verification of agricultural losses hence putting the entire liability on state drought monitoring centres dmc to monitor and declare droughts recent studies by gautam bana 18 and gupta et al 19 addressed the challenges for adaptation and mitigation of drought risk in india yet an assessment of the current drought declaration framework is still lacking bandyopadhyay et al 20 found several drawbacks in the current policy due to a common drought declaration framework being applied across india for instance drought mitigation measures are mostly inadequate ineffective and reactive in nature 20 hence it becomes essential that the current framework is assessed at a national scale to identify the regions where the framework fails to detect droughts effectively the drought monitoring framework specifies some details for the use of indicators however the critical information regarding the use of indicators such as length of accumulation periods and the time frame necessary for observation is not specified in the drought manual furthermore the utility of remote sensing indicators such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi normalized difference water index ndwi and vegetation condition index vci specified in the drought manual used for agricultural drought monitoring needs to be examined solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif which has higher sensitivity to agricultural droughts than ndvi 21 can be evaluated for drought monitoring in india we used observations remotely sensed datasets and a hydrological modelling framework to examine the differences between drought declaration and drought detection recommended by the drought manual in addition we evaluate the factors that can play an important role in drought detection in different seasons in india we first find district wise drought detections made by the framework during the 2000 2017 period then we compare the framework detections to actual drought declarations in each district in india each year we address the two objectives i to examine the role of soil moisture and vegetation indicators on drought detection and ii to compare the detected and declared droughts for the major multi year and regional droughts in india drought in india has several socio poltical aspects associated and has received considerable attention of policy makers post independence 22 23 however aim of the current work is not to review the socio political aspects of drought in india we examine the differences and their potential mostly technical reasons between the declared and detected droughts based on the framework provided in the drought manual 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets drought declaration requires real time monitoring of drought indicators of anomalous condition of precipitation streamflow reservoir level groundwater soil moisture and vegetation health monitoring of drought indicators as specified by the drought manual is required drought is declared in a district if the indicators meet the conditions of the drought declaration framework while a few state departments might have drought monitoring centers dmc s that collect required observations for the drought declaration other dmc s often rely on the national organizations like india meteorological department imd mahalanobis national crop forecast centre mncfc central research institute for dryland agriculture crida indian space and research organization isro and state level remote sensing centers to collect data or provide direct values of drought indicators for drought detection using the framework specified by the drought manual the dmc in a district requires rainfall observations for trigger 1 and impact indicators for trigger 2 impact indicators show drought conditions in soil moisture agricultural hydrology and vegetation in a district we used gridded datasets of precipitation soil moisture and remotely sensed products to implement the drought manual s framework for drought detection in each district of india we used a 0 25 gridded dataset 24 provided by imd for the 1951 2018 period the inverse distance weighted interpolation idw scheme was applied on observed daily rainfall data from a network of 6995 rain gauges all over india to prepare the gridded precipitation 24 comparison with the other rainfall datasets showed good agreement in capturing inter annual seasonal and spatial variability by the gridded precipitation dataset over the indian region 24 25 in addition gridded precipitation captures critical features associated with the spatial and temporal variability of the indian summer monsoon rainfall 24 using rainfall we estimated indicators required for trigger 1 including dry spell and spi 4 long term soil moisture in situ observations are not available across india to provide reliable and timely information on drought moreover satellite soil moisture products have considerable latency and do not provide root zone soil moisture we used gridded soil moisture simulated using the variable infiltration capacity model s simple groundwater model vic sim gm at 0 25 spatial resolution from shah and mishra 17 the vic model simulated soil moisture has been evaluated against the available in situ and satellite datasets 15 25 26 the vic simgm model considers vegetation soil parameters and observed meteorological forcing as inputs the model simulations were conducted after calibration and evaluation using daily meteorological forcings of precipitation wind speed and minimum and maximum temperatures further details on the vic simgm simulations can be obtained from 17 the drought manual specifies using a simple water balance model that can be used to estimate soil moisture up to 30 cm 27 however the root zone of some crops may go beyond the top 30 cm as mentioned in mishra et al 26 we use ndvi from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr which is available from 1981 onwards to examine vegetation conditions during drought 28 we used the version 5 product of avhrr ndvi which was prepared under the long term data project by nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and the university of maryland umd ndvi is available at 0 05 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution the high spatial and temporal resolutions and long term data availability make avhrr ndvi suitable for agricultural drought monitoring 29 31 yield prediction 28 32 and monitoring of vegetation dynamics 33 34 we used solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif as an alternate remote sensing indicator of agricultural drought the global sif product gosif was developed using observations from orbiting carbon observatory 2 oco 2 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and meteorological reanalysis from modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra 2 35 the gosif data comprises sif at 0 05 resolution from 2000 to 2017 at 8 day intervals sif signal has a high correlation with gross primary productivity gpp moreover the ability of sif to capture drought induced changes in absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar makes it suitable for monitoring terrestrial productivity and agricultural droughts 35 38 to validate drought detections we use the yearly district wise declared drought records available at farmers portal ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare government of india the records exist for most of the districts in india from 2000 to 2017 2 2 hydrological model we used the variable infiltration capacity simple groundwater model vic simgm 39 to simulate water balance components at 0 25 spatial and daily temporal resolutions for 1951 2018 the vic simgm combines the vic hydrological model with a simple groundwater model simgm 40 the lumped vic simgm model integrates an unconfined aquifer beneath the multi layer soil column of the vic model and replaces vic s baseflow scheme with parametric equations of the simple groundwater model 39 the vic model is a grid based macro scale model which solves water and energy balance at each timestep in each grid cell 41 43 while considering sub grid variability in soil elevation vegetation and soil moisture we used a calibrated and evaluated vic simgm model as described in asoka and mishra 44 and shah and mishra 17 the model was calibrated for the seventeen major river basins in india and showed a good performance in simulating streamflow and groundwater storage anomalies 44 in addition the vic simgm provides reliable soil moisture estimates as shown by the good agreement against total water storage anomaly twsa from the grace satellites 15 2 3 drought detection framework the drought detection framework lays down a guideline for the state agencies to monitor drought development at the district level and declare drought if the conditions are satisfied tables 1 3 the drought manual specifies that regional dmc s duty is to monitor droughts in their districts actively states can only declare drought if the indicators for an administrative area district satisfy the framework s necessary triggers with a focus primarily on agricultural droughts final declarations are made only after ground truthing and confirming that significant crop losses have occurred in the district the deadlines for states to declare droughts are specified as per the termination of cropping periods of kharif june october and rabi november march crops the framework sets mandatory indicators as trigger 1 and impact indicators as trigger 2 for the drought detection in a district tables 1 3 the triggers specified in the first draft of the manual for drought management 2016 were suitable mainly for kharif crops after the amendment released in 2018 a separate chapter was added to the annexure of the drought manual to address drought declarations during the rabi crop a trigger 1 for kharif crops trigger 1 is set off after checking rainfall deviation standardized precipitation index spi and dry spell as specified in the manual tables 1 2 for rabi crops the amendment specifies the state drought monitoring agencies to identify their district s dominant agricultural situation which may be one of the four types as defined in the revision rainfed crops depending on residual moisture surface irrigated command areas groundwater irrigated areas and north east monsoon nem dependent areas the northeast monsoon provides rainfall to some states in southern india during the october to march period based on the prevailing agricultural situation of the district distinct mandatory indicators and the observational periods for each condition are specified in the amendment finally using the mandatory indicators in the amendment trigger 1 can be assessed for the rabi cropping period we used observed gridded precipitation from imd which was aggregated to a weekly and monthly scale and averaged for all the grids within a district we identified dry spell using the weekly rainfall data and rainfall deviation and spi using the monthly rainfall data for all districts more details on the estimation of rainfall deviation spi and dry spell can be obtained from the supplemental information based on the observation periods for the kharif and rabi droughts we checked whether trigger 1 is set off during the years 2000 2017 for years in which trigger 1 is set off we further investigated the impact indicators for the cropping periods specified in trigger 2 in the drought manual b trigger 2 the drought manual specifies various indicators to assess the drought impact based on meteorology soil moisture hydrology remote sensing and crop losses in a district when trigger 1 is set off for a cropping period table 3 since rainfall model generated soil moisture estimates and remotely sensed data are available in near real time we consider these as impact indicators for trigger 2 we used the standardized precipitation index spi and percentage available soil moisture pasm as impact indicators for meteorological and soil moisture droughts respectively for observing droughts through remote sensing we used both solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif deviation and ndvi deviation as our impact indicators we did not use indicators like groundwater drought index gwdi streamflow drought index sfdi and reservoir storage index rsi due to the limitations of continuous observed data and the applicability of sparse data in drought analysis at a district scale based on the drought manual the category of drought in spi pasm and ndvi sif is first identified to decide the overall drought category from trigger 2 see supplemental information for more details we used the minimum number of indicators three for determining the overall category of drought if all the three indicators show the severe category then the overall drought category was considered as severe if any two indicators show moderate or severe drought then the category is considered moderate in all the other cases the drought category was considered normal drought can only be declared if trigger 2 is moderate or severe after which final declarations are made based on ground truthing moreover states can reduce the drought category by one rank if the irrigation percentage in a district is more than 75 for example if a district falls under the severe drought category based on the indicators in trigger 2 then the state government may consider it a moderate drought if a district has irrigated area more than 75 on the other hand if the district is under the moderate drought category based on the indicators and has more than 75 area under irrigation the state government may consider it normal ground truthing is needed in each of 10 of the drought affected villages which are selected randomly estimating crop damage more than 33 of normal based on field verification will qualify for the declaration of drought for severe droughts the loss in yields should be more than 50 of normal drought assessment during a cropping season is done twice within the first two months and at the end of the cropping season the initial evaluation is to check for the summer monsoon s delayed onset resulting in reduced crop sown area also known as early season drought similar to the drought manual guidelines we used the framework to detect drought in the early and full seasons of kharif and rabi cropping periods since farmers in many districts may be planting crops both in kharif and rabi seasons we applied the framework for both periods for all the districts in india irrespective of their dominant agriculture type we compared the drought detection results against the drought declaration records provided by the farmers portal https farmer gov in drought droughtreport aspx the declaration records only show whether a particular year was a drought year in a district or not regardless of whether it occurred in the kharif or rabi season similarly in our analysis if we find any year to be having early or late season droughts for both the kharif or rabi season that year was considered a drought year we used the probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far as a metric for quantitative comparison of the drought framework s district wise detections against the actual declarations made by the state for the observational period of 2000 2017 each year detected by the framework or declared by the state can be categorized as a hit h detected by the framework and declared miss m declared but not detected by the framework and false alarm f detected by the framework but not declared therefore pod is the fraction of detections by the framework correctly detected against total declarations pod h h m far is the ratio of false detections by the framework against total detections far f h f pod and far are commonly used metrics for drought detection accuracy and assessment 45 48 3 results 3 1 influence of soil moisture and vegetation indicators soil moisture and vegetation indicators play an essential role in drought detection as specified by the drought manual since soil moisture observations are limited to a few locations with insufficient record length model based soil moisture is often used for drought monitoring and prediction 8 26 49 50 soil moisture persistence can vary based on the soil moisture depth considered for the drought assessment 26 for instance mishra et al 26 reported that deeper soil moisture has higher persistence due to which drought onset can be delayed the other potential reason for assessing the role of soil moisture and vegetation indicators in drought declaration is related to the regional differences due to regional differences in drought susceptibility 51 applying a common drought detection framework for all the districts in india as specified by the drought manual may not be appropriate therefore we need to evaluate the efficacy of the drought detection framework in india s districts we used the framework specified in the drought manual to detect droughts in each district for the period of 2000 2017 we used dry spell rainfall deviation and spi as mandatory indicators in trigger 1 and spi pasm and ndvi as impact indicators in trigger 2 please see supplemental material for details however the drought manual does not specify the depth of soil layer to be taken for pasm evaluations since major crops such as wheat maize rice and sugarcane have maximum root depth lying from 50 to 100 cm 52 we use the vic simgm simulated soil moisture at two depths up to 30 cm and 60 cm for estimating pasm in addition we compared ndvi and sif as impact indicators in trigger 2 to examine the effectiveness of sif as a remote sensing indicator for agricultural drought prediction see supplemental information for more details hence with trigger 1 being the same we used four combinations of trigger 2 spi pasm based on 30 cm soil moisture and ndvi spi pasm30 ndvi spi pasm based on 60 cm soil moisture and ndvi spi pasm60 ndvi spi pasm based on 30 cm soil moisture and sif spi pasm30 sif and spi pasm based on 60 cm soil moisture and sid spi pasm60 sif to separately detect district wise droughts following the framework for each combination then the drought detection in each district made by the framework for each case was checked against the actual declarations using metric pod and far we estimated pod for the four combinations of indicators used for trigger 2 fig 1 since declaration records are not available for each district a few districts were excluded from the analysis because of the lack of data all the four combinations show a similar spatial distribution of pod for instance relatively higher pod greater than 0 8 was found for most of the districts located in central india higher pod was also obtained in south india and gujarat districts with values ranging above 0 8 for most districts districts in rajasthan andhra pradesh karnataka and maharashtra showed pod in 0 4 0 6 lower values of pod 0 2 were only observed in the districts of punjab and the north eastern states of india relatively lower pod in punjab was associated with less drought declaration for instance drought was declared in punjab only in 2002 during the 2000 2017 period failing the detection of 2002 drought using the indicators will lead to a zero pod value similarly in districts of north east states drought declaration records show only 2009 as the year in which drought has been declared accounting for the zero pod value if the drought is not detected using 30 cm or 60 cm soil depth for pasm evaluations does not significantly change pod for districts fig 1 this can be due to similar soil moisture anomalies found at both 30 cm and 60 cm depths as bhardwaj et al 53 reported soil moisture persistence at deeper depths can delay the onset of drought and affect drought severity 26 in the drought declaration framework it does not matter as droughts were identified at a seasonal time scale however at weekly time scales using the soil moisture from the two depths would certainly affect drought intensity and severity pod was improved in a few districts especially over central india when sif was used to evaluate vegetation health instead of ndvi fig 1 the improvement in pod with sif can be attributed to the higher sensitivity of sif than ndvi in capturing short term droughts liu et al 21 reported the faster response of sif for drought affected wheat plantations while pod represents the framework s ability to capture the declared droughts far shows whether the framework detected droughts are accurate or not considering declared drought as a reference we estimated far for the same as for pod four combinations for each district in india fig 2 a higher far indicates that the framework detects droughts more often than they are declared while a lower far suggests that the framework accurately detects droughts we find relatively higher far for most districts of central india where observed pod values are also high far above 0 6 in these districts shows that more than 60 percent of drought detections based on the framework do not match with the actual drought declarations a combination of high pod and high far in the districts in central india may be due to more droughts being detected than declared districts of punjab gangetic plain region and north east states show high far 0 8 red high far in punjab and north east states districts is due to declaration records showing drought only once while the framework detects more droughts than declarations we also find that irrigated regions show a high far which can be attributed to the role of irrigation on crop yields for instance soil moisture and precipitation based indicators identify droughts in the irrigated regions however crop yields might be maintained due to groundwater based irrigation lower far 0 2 was observed in rajasthan andhra pradesh and karnataka which indicates that the framework detected droughts are mostly accurate in these regions but the framework detects only 40 60 of the total declared droughts in these regions pod 0 4 0 6 which shows that the framework fails to detect the most drought occurrences in rajasthan andhra pradesh and karnataka like metric pod most districts far values do not change using 60 cm soil depth instead of 30 cm soil depth for pasm evaluations an increase of far in districts of rajasthan using sif in place of ndvi can again be accounted for the higher sensitivity of sif in detecting agricultural droughts pod and far show regional differences in the drought detection using the specified methodology of the framework the framework detects only a few droughts in districts with a high number of declared droughts in rajasthan karnataka and andhra pradesh suggesting a framework to be designed separately to account for regional differences high far in our analysis can be majorly attributed to the missing distinction of kharif and rabi droughts in declaration records and the role of irrigation sif as a remotely sensed indicator of drought increases the framework s detection efficiency and can be used as an alternative to ndvi 3 2 drought detection vs declarations due to droughts multifaceted and complex nature it becomes difficult to assess their impacts severity duration and spatial extent while a drought monitoring system and the drought manual s framework may capture real time anomalies agriculture may also be affected by the propagation of droughts and regional factors that may not be accounted for by the framework to assess the framework s ability to capture both spatial extent and propagation of droughts into multiple seasons we evaluated whether the framework captured droughts years that fall into the category of a major droughts characterized by widespread extent b multi year droughts and c regional droughts since most droughts start from a precipitation deficit during the summer monsoon we used spi to define and identify major multi year and regional droughts in india irrespective of a region s dependence on irrigation 3 3 major droughts we defined an occurrence of a major drought for a season if spi estimated using all india averaged precipitation is below 1 5 therefore the identified droughts will be under the severe extreme or exceptional category 9 we used the 4 month spi at the end of september to identify drought conditions in the kharif season for the rabi season september december sond and october february ondjf we used the 4 5 month spi at the end of december and february respectively table 4 as a result we identified 2002 and 2009 as major droughts for the kharif season table 4 on the other hand major droughts for the rabi season occurred in 2000 2002 2011 2015 and 2016 our identification of droughts is consistent with recent studies 15 26 for instance mishra 15 reported 2000 as one of india s five most severe meteorological and hydrological droughts since 1870 mishra et al 26 found drought in 2002 to be among the five most widespread monsoon season droughts based on precipitation and soil moisture deficits in india for 1951 2018 similarly mishra et al 54 reported that 2015 ranked first in the two year cumulative rainfall deficit from 1906 to 2015 we compared the major droughts detected for the kharif and rabi seasons against the declared droughts figs 3 4 moreover we also compared different drought indicators to understand their contribution to drought detection during the major drought years we evaluated the declarations made by the state agencies and the drought detections based on the framework during the kharif season which lasts from june to september in 2002 droughts were declared in districts covering most regions of india apart from districts in bihar bengal and north east states fig 3 the framework detected most of the declared droughts in 2002 during the kharif period but did not detect droughts for districts in maharashtra s western part drought was not detected as the western part of maharashtra received normal rainfall in the early season june to july with no delay in the summer monsoon onset in june 55 moreover the combined rainfall deficit in the entire monsoon season june to september was also in the normal range rainfall deviation 19 however in july entire india received largely deficient rainfall 56 which may be the reason for crop losses leading to states declaring droughts the 2002 drought was mainly caused due to failure of the summer monsoon in july with a rainfall deficit of more than 50 15 spi and soil moisture showed drought in many regions except bihar bengal northeast and maharashtra however ndvi showed drought conditions mainly in the western part of india which can be attributed to other factors irrigation moreover seasonal averaged ndvi might have overcome drought impacts in the late monsoon season august and september overall we find that declared and detected droughts were comparable for most of the regions in india during kharif 2002 similar to the kharif season drought in 2002 a major drought during the summer monsoon season occurred in 2009 in 2009 drought declarations were made in districts covering most regions in india apart from districts of punjab haryana uttarakhand gujarat west bengal chhattisgarh and south east coast fig 3 while the framework detected droughts in most of these regions it failed to capture droughts in jammu and kashmir karnataka and kerala for major drought years most of the detections by the framework in the kharif season are contingent only on spi and pasm as impact indicators ndvi used as an impact indicator detects droughts in much lesser districts than spi or pasm fig 3 similar to kharif season droughts 2002 and 2009 the major droughts during the rabi season occurred in 2000 2002 2011 2015 and 2016 fig 4 state governments declared droughts in the districts located in central and western india in 2000 fig 4 we find that detected droughts were considerably higher than the declared droughts in many regions in the rabi season of 2000 for instance droughts were detected in the indo gangetic plain and punjab however they were not declared by the governments fig 4 spi and pasm identified a majority of the detected droughts in the rabi season of 2000 while the contribution from ndvi was considerably lower fig 4 in contrast to 2000 detected droughts using the framework were substantially lesser than those declared by the state governments drought estimates using pasm closely matched with the declared droughts in 2015 detected and declared droughts were comparable for most of the regions in india the 2015 drought was one of the most severe droughts in india 54 the drought occurred for the two consecutive years 2014 2015 and the cumulative rainfall deficit over the gangetic plain was more than 50 54 in 2011 and 2016 detected droughts were considerably higher than the declared droughts fig 4 for instance the 2016 drought caused due to the failure of the northeast monsoon in south india was not declared by the state governments the 2016 2018 drought in south india was the worst drought during the 1870 2018 period 57 overall we find a considerable difference in the detected and declared droughts in india s kharif and rabi seasons 3 4 multi year droughts a drought originates due to precipitation deficit propagates through the hydrological cycle accumulating over time and manifesting in forms such as deficit in soil moisture streamflow reservoir and groundwater storage 53 58 59 severe droughts can be long lasting and affect several crop growing seasons for instance the 2014 2015 drought affected the indo gangetic plain and occurred due to the failure of two consecutive summer monsoons the drought affected soil moisture and groundwater in the region 54 similarly the 2016 18 drought in south india resulted in a crisis in the area the 2016 18 drought was caused by the failure of the northeast monsoon 57 we used a 24 month spi to identify the multi year droughts at the end of the water year june to may we considered severe extreme and exceptional multi year droughts by considering 24 month spi less than 1 5 table 4 we identified the 2001 drought as multi year drought in the kharif season drought affected south india and northeast regions as shown by spi and pasm ndvi did not capture the 2001 kharif season drought the declared droughts were mainly centered in rajasthan bihar maharashtra and a few other states in rajasthan and maharashtra droughts were not declared but detected on the other hand in tamil nadu drought was detected but not declared similarly considerable differences were found in the detected and declared droughts during the rabi season of 2001 fig 5 for instance districts with detected droughts are located in the northwestern regions however droughts were declared in rajsthan maharastra and karnataka states fig 5 3 5 regional drought due to the high variability of the indian summer monsoon different regions have a varying probability of drought occurrence drought severity and duration 60 61 mallya et al 62 and gupta et al 51 reported growing regional droughts and differences in india s regional drought susceptibility while major droughts may attract attention and response on a national scale regional drought occurrences may go unnoticed delaying necessary relief actions for that region s farmers to examine the difference between detected and declared droughts we identified the localized and region specific droughts we divided the indian region into six homogeneous regions central north east h1 himalayan region h2 north east h3 north west h4 peninsular region h5 and west central h6 based on the precipitation distribution to understand regional scale variability as in 63 of drought declaration and detection by the framework we use 4 5 month spi at the end of kharif and rabi cropping seasons separately for each zone is used to identify regional droughts separate for each season which were not detected as major or multi year droughts table 4 we identified regional droughts in the kharif season in 2003 2006 2012 and 2016 table 5 regional droughts detected in the rabi season occurred in 2003 2005 2007 2008 2012 and 2017 tables 6 and 7 consistent with the major and multi year droughts considerable differences were found between detected and declared droughts for the kharif season fig 6 districts with detected droughts were higher than declared drought in the indo gangetic plain for most years fig 6 similarly in the rabi season many districts with declared drought were lower than the detected droughts in gangetic plain in several years fig 7 4 discussion we compared detected and declared droughts based on the drought manual for the 2000 2017 period we used gridded precipitation satellite derived vegetation indices and model simulated soil moisture to detect droughts in india s districts the role of soil moisture depth and choice of vegetation indicator was examined for the effectiveness of detected droughts compared to declared droughts our results show that sif could be a better choice than ndvi for remote sensing based vegetation health indicators for drought detection in india however the depth of soil moisture 30 or 60 cm did not show a major difference in pod and far attributed to the seasonal scale analysis comparison of detected and declared droughts exhibited considerable differences for the major multi year and regional droughts our results show both overestimation and underestimation in the detected droughts compared to declared droughts in india using the framework specified by the drought manual moreover the number of districts with the detected and declared droughts compare well for the kharif season for the major droughts 2002 and 2009 indicating that large scale and severe droughts can be effectively detected and then declared more often however during the rabi season the districts with the detected droughts were considerably higher than those with actual declarations for most of years noticeable differences were found in the detected and declared droughts for multi year and regional droughts overall there are considerable differences in the detected droughts using the framework and actually declared droughts there can be several factors contributing to the difference between the detected and declared droughts we used only two steps trigger 1 and trigger 2 that are needed for drought detections the third step is based on field verification and ground truthing in which 10 of drought affected villages are selected randomly for crop cutting experiments if crop yields decline more than 33 in these ground truthing sites only then a drought is declared therefore the detected and declared droughts difference could be due to ground truthing and field verification for which information is not available in the public domain since the number of districts with the detected droughts was considerably higher in many years than the declared droughts one can assume that the major crops did not experience a decline of more than 33 in these districts notwithstanding the occurance of drought one possibility of maintaining yields during drought years is groundwater based irrigation 64 therefore even though rainfall soil moisture and remote sensing based indicators showed droughts droughts were not declared as yields were maintained by irrigation we also identified that the detected droughts in the intensively irrigated regions are significantly higher than the declared droughts which can be once again attributed to crop yields using groundwater based irrigation on the other hand declared droughts are often higher than the detected droughts in the arid regions rajasthan which can be due to considerable variability in rainfall and lack of irrigation from groundwater our results indicate that irrigation plays a vital role in the declaration of droughts for example drought was declared only once during 2000 2017 in punjab intensively irrigated with groundwater excessive groundwater based irrigation helped punjab maintain crop production even in the years that witnessed rainfall deficit however that has a high cost of rapid groundwater depletion and other environmental challenges 65 67 the impacts of moderate and severe droughts can be neglected with the groundwater pumping for irrigation in many parts of north india in this case the absence of a drought declaration may give a false sense of normalcy to the farmers and other stakeholders in these regions which may promote excessive groundwater pumping which will limit the scope of adaptation to increased rainfall variability in india 68 69 for example the drought manual suggests that the state government may reduce the drought category by one level in districts with more than 75 area irrigated other than the differences in the declared and detected droughts in the intensively irrigated regions there are limitations with the current drought detection and declaration framework for instance the drought manual specifies the use of dry spell and spi for trigger 1 however it remains unclear for which period spi needs to be estimated spi for short duration can have high uncertainty in the regions that do not receive sufficient rainfall or the districts state that do not use long term rainfall observations for estimation of spi for instance rainfall during june and july may not be enough to provide a robust estimation of spi in many districts of semi arid and arid regions of india moreover the drought manual does not give a clear recommendation on the climatological period for example the climatological period used to estimate the category of different indicators is not properly mentioned a short term record of remote sensing based indicators or hydrological indicators may not provide a reliable estimate of drought severity there are other challenges associated with the availability of long term data that have a reasonable number of droughts for each district in india for instance long term quality controlled datasets of soil moisture groundwater and ndvi that can be used as a reference for the drought monitoring agencies are not available the drought manual specifies the use of streamflow and groundwater based indicators however if drought detection and declaration happens at the administrative levels it remains unclear how these indicators will be used for instance streamflow at any given location can provide information on the condition of the upstream catchment since the administrative and catchment boundaries do not overlap streamflow for drought detection at the district level and declaration may not be appropriate similarly the density of groundwater observation wells in each district may vary and there can be many districts without a sufficient number of monitoring wells that can capture drought response similarly soil moisture depth for drought detection and the source of data is not correctly specified moreover all the indicators in trigger 2 have the same weightage in drought detection across india which needs to be evaluated appropriately the suggested drought indicators in trigger 1 and trigger 2 need to be assessed with the actual drought impacts other than technical aspects associated with drought detection several other aspects can influence drought declaration in districts for instance drought conditions may go unnoticed in the districts that are highly irrigated the declaration of drought is based on ground truthing and crop cutting experiments crop yields can be managed using groundwater from surface and groundwater resources in addition the drought prone regions in india may be in a better position in declaring droughts due to increased awareness and monitoring on the other hand in less drought prone districts declaration of drought can be easily missed for instance drought in punjab was declared only once during 2000 2017 mainly due to intensive irrigation from groundwater crop cutting experiments and ground truthing is time consuming which may also influence or delay drought declaration moreover states need to wait till the maturity of crops for the crop cutting experiments due to extreme droughts such as in 2002 crops could not be sown due to the failure of onset of rain which made it difficult to collect reliable crop cutting data 70 during droughts irrigated regions have excessive consumption of energy and withdrawal of groundwater which is not adequately considered in the drought declaration 70 despite the guidelines provided in the manual there can be deviations in drought declarations due to reasons other than technical tarquinio 2021 reddy 2016 bera and sen 2016 discussion of which is beyond the scope of this work in addition policies public outreach and better data availability can play a crucial role in raising awareness among people about water scarcity during drought as reported for san francisco bay area 71 increased data availability regarding drought hit areas and impacts from media social media and other forums can play a vital role in drought declaration 72 74 we find that there is a scope of improvement in the drought detection and declaration framework ground truthing and field verification is essential for the drought declaration as specified by the drought manual the availability of high resolution remotely sensed monitoring near real time drought monitoring and early warning and a reliable framework to provide crop yield forecast can add a lot of value to the existing framework for instance 75 76 showed that high resolution remotely sensed data can be used for the monitoring of cropped area of smallholder farms and to estimate yield gaps similarly ambika et al 77 used high resolution imagery to map irrigated area at 250 m resolution across india moreover high resolution data of vegetation health products and land surface temperature was developed that can be used for drought monitoring at village to block level 78 given the complexity of drought and associated spatial and temporal variabilities we need to put efforts for continuous monitoring of drought at weekly timescale across country at the resoluation that can provide information at sub district level 10 drought monitoring and early warming systems should provide information on different drought types meterological hydrological and agricultural along with the groundwater and surface water storage conditions moreover the long term availability of drought indicators regional scale impact assessment and linking drought indicators with drought impacts can strengthen the existing system the current drought declaration framework is more towards declaring agricultural droughts ignoring the resources required for long term drought management therefore drought declaration should also account for groundwater and surface water resources considering their long term sustainability 5 conclusions based on our findings we conclude the following o detected and declared droughts during the 2000 2017 period showed significant differences in india o the model simulated soil moisture at 30 and 60 cm depth did not show a considerable difference in the detected droughts however sif exhibited better performance for drought detection than ndvi o detected and declared droughts show a higher probability of detection pod in central india on the other hand lower pod was found in regions of high drought susceptibility like rajasthan andhra pradesh and karnataka large differences between the detected and declared droughts were identified in the irrigated areas of punjab and gangetic plain o the difference in detected and declared droughts can be attributed to ground truthing and crop cutting experiments irrigation uncertainty in data and indicators and several other socio political factors 7 discloser statement given his role as guest editor dr vimal
