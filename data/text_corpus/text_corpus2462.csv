of the himalaya which includes the rural as well as the major urban chunk of the jammu region the groundwater samples were collected from the study area examined for detail hydrochemistry of cations and anions the groundwater quality of study area classified as fresh water normal chloride normal sulphate normal carbonate water and moderately hard based on chemical analysis of the various parameters such as non carbonate hardness sodium absorption ratio sodium percentage potential salinity residual sodium carbonate kelly ratio magnesium ratio chebotarev sequence gibbs ratio index of base exchange and permeability were calculated the results demonstrate that the hydrochemistry was dominated by the alkaline earth and weak acids graphical representation of the expanded durov diagram shows the dominance of calcium bicarbonate indicates the recharging of water from the carbonate presents as cementing material in the sandstone aquifer chebotarev sequence indicates that in the bicarbonate water class the evolution of ground water belongs to initial stage indicates the fresh water quality spatial analysis was performed using arc gis 10 software to attain the spatial distribution of various physical and chemical parameters in the study area which illustrate that groundwater is suitable for domestic as well as the irrigation purposes in most of the study area except few pockets the overall groundwater quality of the study area shows that during the post monsoon period all constituents are high because of rock water interaction and rules out any major pollution from the extraneous sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrochemistry water quality spatial distribution jammu himalaya india 1 introduction water is a precious natural resource basic human need and a precious national asset india accounts for 2 2 of the global land 4 of the world s water resources and supporting more than 16 of the world population groundwater is one of the primary resources for the development activities in india and around the world in recent years there has been a tremendous increase in the demand of the fresh water globally and india is facing an acute shortage of water during the summer in most parts of the country in societies with the developing economies like india the optimum development and efficient management of their water resources should be a dominant strategy for economic growth although in the recent years unscientific planning and management and use of groundwater for various purposes almost invariably have created undesirable problems in its wake water logging and salinity in case agricultural use and environmental pollution as a result of industrial and municipal use the siwaliks rocks of the study area are quite diverse in terms of flora and fauna because of diversity in geological formations temperature and climatic conditions basu 2004 due to large scale expansion of industries residential and intense use of the fertilizer in the agricultural activities the water quality has been severely affected in the last two decades dar et al 2010 2012 bahri et al 2011 ramkumar et al 2013 besides this geochemical reactions that take place within the aquifer as well as reaction by rock water interaction also affect the water quality appelo and postma 1993 stamatis et al 2006 lambrakis 2006 bathrellos et al 2008 kannel et al 2008 enwright and hudak 2009 nas and berktay 2010 although seasonal variation of water quality data assessment is also complicated and requires statistical analysis of long term data monitoring of the data elci and polat 2010 gamvroula et al 2013 to understand the water quality for irrigation purposes several chemical indices have been defined such as permeability index residual sodium carbonate sodium percentage sodium adsorption ratio magnesium hazard etc around the world and well documented in various researches adhikary et al 2012 ramesh and elango 2012 vasanthavigar et al 2012 al taani 2013 one of the important requirements to undertake an irrigation quality assessment is to produce a specialized map to identify areas under pollution threat however better results may be obtained by analyzing the chemistry of all the anions and cations rather than individual parameters hem 1985 with the rapidity of technology the need of groundwater quality assessment before the implementation of the land development programme in order to overcome water borne diseases of the people who depend upon groundwater for their consumption is also a matter of great consideration and also well documented niranjanbabu et al 1997 kvitsand and fiksdal 2010 murphy et al 2014 saba et al 2015 the detail hydrochemistry and groundwater quality in various parts of india have been studied by numbers of researchers to evaluate the major ion chemistry geochemical processes controlling water composition and suitability of water for domestic industrial and irrigation uses jasrotia and singh 2007 arumugam and elangovan 2009 kshetrimayum and bajpai 2012 sivasankar et al 2014 bob et al 2016 geographic information system gis has emerged as a powerful tool for storing analyzing and displaying spatial data for decision making in several areas including engineering agriculture hydrology and environmental fields goodchild 1993 in the recent studies gis based spatial distribution mapping of groundwater quality for domestic and agricultural purposes was carried out by numerous researchers in india and abroad to accelerate the sustainable development shankar et al 2010 swarnalatha and nageswara rao 2010 jasrotia and kumar 2014a cortes et al 2016 gis based groundwater quality along with groundwater prospects mapping has also been carried out by the various researchers in india jasrotia et al 2013 dhar et al 2015 the jammu himalaya is a part of the siwaliks and indo gangetic fertile plains where intensive cultivation is going on from the last so many years over the years increasing population with the rise of industrial and urban activities plus a lack of proper environmental control measures with the increasing and necessary demand of continuous monitoring of the groundwater quality the purpose of the present study is to understand the groundwater quality in the cenozoic rocks of jammu himalaya and to prepare the spatial distribution maps of the various physical chemical parameters using geospatial technology 2 description of study area the study area located in the hilly terrain of jammu himalaya lies between latitude 32 33 07 to 33 07 30 n and longitude 74 27 00 to 77 21 00 e and covers a total area of 3092 km2 bounded by lofty mountain in the north and western side with a stretch of indo gangetic plains in the south and southeastern part of the study area the geology structure and lithology play a major role in the evolution of the various types of drainage pattern in the study area the major rivers flow through the study area are the basantar the chenab the jammu tawi and munawartawi fig 1 b which flows predominantly in the sw direction are the parts of the indus drainage basin and draining ultimately into the arabian sea 2 1 geological setting tectonically the study area is the part of siwalik foreland basin fig 1a sediments have been studied extensively by the various researchers around the world for research related to palaeobotany stratigraphy tectonics sedimentology geomorphology and groundwater hydrochemistry parkash et al 1980 ranga rao et al 1981 meigs et al 1995 basu 2004 ganjoo and shaker 2007 bhat et al 2008 jasrotia and kumar 2014a the geological formation of the study area mainly comprises of siwaliks rocks exposed in uplifted thrust sheets and an integral part of the compression zones involved in the collision of indian and asian plate tectonics meigs et al 1995 geologically southern parts of the study area composed of younger and older alluvium formations which are heavily composed of fine to coarse grained sand silt and clay fine to medium grained micaceous sand silt and clay reworked materials derived from the upper siwaliks boulder conglomerate bed and also comprised of clast supported deposits in the upper fan area ageing recent to upper pleistocene fig 1d the siwaliks rocks mainly exposed in the study area lower siwaliks of miocene age forming the core of the surinsar mastgarh nw se trending anticline given in the stratigraphic succession of the study area table 1 lithologically composed of red mudstone and fine medium grained grey green sandstone ranga rao et al 1988 the middle siwaliks of upper miocene age and upper siwalik of pliocene to upper pleistocene age subgroups are best exposed in the southern limb of the siwaliks rocks of jammu himalaya the middle siwaliks composed of medium to coarse grained sandstones and subordinate grey brown mudstone where as the upper siwaliks rocks of the study area are sand silt and clay dominantly coarse grained sandstone and pink grey mudstone the upper siwalik rock of jammu himalaya is subdivided into three formations i e parmandal sandstone nagrota silt and boulder conglomerate 2 2 hydrogeology the study area is covered with large numbers of unconfined aquifers with ground water flow direction following the direction of the river flow as structure and lithology plays a major role in the evolution of the topography and drainage pattern of the area hydrogeologically the study area was broadly classified divided into three sub division such as the northern hilly area which act as a runoff zone underlain by the siwalik group of rocks which rises gradually in the northern part of the study area and the jammu alluvial plains of pleistocene age jasrotia and kumar 2014b 2 2 1 northern hilly area the northern hilly area lies at an altitude above 900 above mean sea level amsl characterized by high altitude fig 1c steep slope and high drainage density with a thin layer of soil cover however major fractures joints faults lineaments and narrow inter mountain valleys favour minute infiltration in the hilly area in this area surface as well as groundwater flows from higher gradient to low lying areas structural hill and denudation hills are of common occurrences and the dissections in these hills are important surficial features for artificial recharge to groundwater although the area is devoid of any major aquifers having poor prospects of groundwater 2 2 2 siwalik group the siwalik rocks generally act as recharge zone is one of the important factors in groundwater studies the siwaliks group of rocks is characterized by low yielding capacity with deep water table conditions the gentle slope and unconsolidated material in the valley fill areas together with faults fractures lineaments with veneer soil cover favour infiltration the area is predominately under high drawdown and high infiltration ratio the unconfined aquifers usually occupying higher elevations with a deeper water table conditions the piedmont zone and fluvial deposits fall into this category 2 2 3 jammu alluvial plains the jammu alluvial plains tract of the study area lies at an altitude of less than 350 m above mean sea level amsl the alluvial flat land with a gentle slope well irrigation system large number of tube well dug well for domestic and irrigation and industrial uses are widely found the shallow water table condition with minor seasonal fluctuations high discharge low drawdown and high specific yield the outlets of ground water were diffused in the form of seepages but at some places the flow may be directed in the form of springs through well defined outlets 3 materials and methods in the present study ground water samples of the hundred dug well and tube well were collected from the different locations including urban rural and industrial area of the present study area during pre monsoon and post monsoon season and analyzed for their chemistry fig 1d by using random sampling technique to select wells which have been extensively used for drinking and other domestic purposes toposheets were used to prepare the base map and the drainage map and to understand the general nature of the study area during the collection of samples global positioning system was used to map the well location during the field visits measurement of ph was made using a portable ph meter water proof ph scan 2 tester ec and temperature value of the samples were also measured during the field visits by the ec meter water proof ec scan 3 tester and thermometer respectively whereas tds was measured with tds meter water proof tds scan1tester the techniques and methods for collection and analysis of water samples followed in this study were those after the american public health association apha 1992 and manual of pollution control board new delhi mpcb 1997 the dissolved oxygen do analyzed in the laboratory by the winkler titrimetric azide modification iodometric method and total alkalinity by the color indicator method the total hardness and calcium were estimated by the edta titrimetric method and magnesium estimated by their difference sodium and potassium were estimated with the flame photometer whereas carbonate and bicarbonate was determined by titrimetric method the chloride concentration was analyzed by titrimetric argentometric method fluoride ion concentration was estimated by fluoride ion selective electrode coupled to ion analyzer the sulphate nitrate and silica ion concentration were estimated by the gravimetric method the nitrate and silica ion concentration were also analyzed by using the ultraviolet uv spectrophotometer all the concentrations are expressed in mg l except ph and ec in μs cm the location of each well was taken into the gis environment and the results of each parameter analyzed were added to the concerned wells the spatial analysis was carried out for drinking and irrigation water quality mapping in the study area 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry of groundwater the graphical representations of the hydrochemistry of the groundwater were evaluated by plotting the cations and anions in percent of total meq l in the piper trilinear diagram piper 1944 expanded durov diagram doneen 1948 domenico and schwartz 1990 chebotarev classification chebotarev 1955 facing mapping approach back 1961 mechanisms controlling water chemistry gibbs 1970 salinity hazard diagram usda 1955 sodium percentage wilcox 1955 permeability index doneen 1964 4 1 1 piper trilinear diagram piper diagram consists of three distinct fields including two triangular fields and a diamond shaped field has been extensively used to understand problems concerning the geochemical evolution of groundwater the cations expressed as percentage of total cations in meq l as a single point on the left triangle while the anions plot in the right triangle piper 1953 the piper s diagram is considered to be one of the most widely and effectively used diagram to determine the chemical facies based on the dominant cations and anions analysis of hydrochemical facies on the piper trilinear diagram fig 2 reveals that the water quality belongs to the ca2 mg2 hco3 plot of the groundwater samples from the pre monsoon period although post monsoon data samples falling in the field 1 ca2 hco3 type 3 mixed ca2 na hco3 type 4 mixed ca2 mg2 cl type which suggests that alkaline earth exceeds alkalies and weak acids exceeds strong acids respectively the ca2 and mg2 are major cations in the study area where as the hco3 is the major anion constitutes about 75 80 of the total anion concentration 4 1 2 expanded durov diagram expanded durov diagram was used to show the clustering of groundwater point data to specify the samples that have similar compositions in this diagram major cations ca2 mg2 na k and anions ci so4 2 hco3 were plotted in terms of percentage by converting the chemical facies concentration meq l guler et al 2002 fianko et al 2010 the major cations and anions plotted durov 1948 as percentages of miliequivalents in two base triangles all ions with concentrations surpassing 10 of the molar concentration in the solution are considered to be major ions guler et al 2002 this diagram used to understand the hydrochemical evolutionary sequence of groundwater as plotted fig 3 the groundwater samples in the study area mostly fall in the field 1 dominance of calcium bicarbonate which indicates recharging of water from the carbonates present as cementing materials in the sandstone and the rest of the samples fall in the other fields 2 and 3 the field 2 indicates that the groundwater is ca2 so4 2 water is associated with the sedimentary rock which signifies that the groundwater reveals the initial and intermediate stage of freshwater quality the deposition of ca2 so4 2 from the saturated solution is also induced by a rise in the ca2 hco3 content in consequence of raising co2 pressure the samples fall in the field 3 indicating that mg2 water often associated with dolomite where calcium and sodium are important partial ion exchange sulphate in the groundwater is derived from gypsum or anhydrite calcium sulphate and may also be derived by the oxidation of pyrite and other sulfides widely distributed in sedimentary rocks as minor accessories in the study area the geographical representation of the expanded durov diagram indicates the dominance of calcium bicarbonate 4 1 3 gibbs diagram the relationship of water composition and aquifer lithological characteristics were widely described with the help of three different facies such as evaporation dominance precipitation dominance and rock water interaction dominance gibbs 1970 the gibbs ratio i cl cl hco3 for anion fig 4 a and gibbs ratio ii na k na k ca2 for cation fig 4b of the water sample data plotted against the relative values of the total dissolved solids point towards rock dominance of the chemistry of groundwater in the region which reflects the influence of the chemistry of aquifer lithology vis a vis groundwater 4 1 4 facies mapping approach hydrochemical facies depict the diagnostic chemical character of water in various parts of the system the facies reflects the effects of the chemical reaction occurring between minerals within the lithological framework the mineralogy of the aquifer system largely determines the type of hydro chemical facies which develop flow pattern modify the hydro chemical facies and control their distribution the chemical data were plotted following facies mapping approach back 1961 the hydrochemical variation and the distribution of facies of groundwater throughout the study area show that most of the cation facies falls in the calcium sodium and calcium magnesium fig 5 a the anion facies are mostly found in the bicarbonate chloride sulphate and a few samples are falling in the chloride sulphate bicarbonate fig 5b 4 1 5 chebotarev classification the chebotarev 1955 proposed a geochemical classification of water based on anion occurrence and prevalence as they are regarded as independent gradients type of water class of water hco3 1 hco3 cl ii cl hco3 iii cl so4 2 iv cl v further he has also given an idealized anion evolution sequence in which the initial recharge water of the hco3 type finally evolves to cl type water which is shown below hco3 hco3 cl cl hco3 cl so4 2 or so4 2 cl cl chebotarev sequence expressed in simpler terms as follows bicarbonate waters sulphate waters chloride waters in the present study hco3 shows the highest values in the hydrochemical data persuasive the class of bicarbonate water indicating the initial stage of groundwater evolution which interns of freshwater quality 4 2 groundwater classifications the classification of groundwater is very much essential to know the suitability of groundwater of an area for domestic agricultural or industrial uses in the study area groundwater is classified based on the total dissolved constituents davis and dewiest 1966 and genetic classification schoeller 1962 classified groundwater based on the concentration of cl so4 2 hco 3 and index of base exchange ibe etc are given below i classification based on tds concentration based on tds carroll 1962 classification the groundwater of the study area falls under fresh water environment tds 1000 mg l ii classification based on hco 3 concentration the mean value of hco3 concentration in groundwater during the pre monsoon season is 201 65 mg l and 221 80 mg l in the post monsoon season table 2 in the study area sixty samples fall in the normal carbonate water and fourteen samples fall in under carbonate water and only one sample shows super carbonated water hence the groundwater of the study area is generally normal carbonate water iii classification based on hardness the total hardness of groundwater in the study area has been calculated by using the formula proposed by raghunath 1987 as under th as caco3 in mg l ca2 mg2 meq l 50 the mean values of total hardness concentration in groundwater during the pre monsoon season and post monsoon season are 216 meq l and 237 09 meq l respectively according to sawyer and mccarty 1967 classification the groundwater falls under soft to hard category table 3 iv classification based on cl concentration genetic classification based on cl concentration as proposed by schoeller 1962 the mean values of chloride concentration table 2 observed in groundwater during the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are 24 60 mg l and 22 46 mg l respectively which indicates that the groundwater is normal chloride water v classification based on so 4 2 concentration differentiation according to so4 2 concentration the groundwater is normal sulphate water the mean values of sulphate concentration in groundwater during the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are 37 60 mg l and 39 98 mg l respectively which indicates that the groundwater is normal sulphate vi classification based on base exchange schoeller 1965 index of base exchange ibe shows negative to positive value in the water suggesting the enrichment of chloride because of the proximity of the wells to clay minerals 4 3 groundwater quality assessment the analysis of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes were evaluated from the data obtained by chemical analysis of the groundwater samples described as under 4 3 1 suitability for drinking water purposes to evaluate the quality of the groundwater for the drinking purposes major cation and anion of the groundwater in the study area table 4 was compared with the standard of the world health organization who 1984 and drinking water standards of the indian standard institute isi 1991 according to the chemical composition of groundwater of the study area ph is in the range of 6 5 8 5 indicating an alkaline nature tds which is a measure of the total concentrations of dissolved salts ranges from 70 to 780 mg l the mean values of the total alkalinity ta concentrations during the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are 167 65 mg l and 184 78 mg l respectively table 2 the groundwater based on total hardness belongs to the soft 75 150 mg l to hard 150 3000 mg l categories sawyer and mccarty 1967 that all the samples show th ta indicates non carbonate hardness the concentration of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 no3 and cl varies from 18 to 160 1 9 to 44 3 to 62 0 5 to 25 35 to 435 6 to 111 0 1 to 60 and 5 94 100 mg l respectively table 4 the groundwater in the present study area is characterized by ca2 na mg2 k hco3 so4 2 cl and no3 type 4 3 2 spatial analysis of groundwater quality gis based techniques have been extensively used by numerous researchers of various disciplines for spatial queries analysis and integration various thematic layers from the last three decades burrough and mc donnel 1998 jasrotia and kumar 2014a for the solution of desired outputs gis based spatial analysis is emerging as powerful technique and an effective tool to produce the desirable output for the spatial distribution of various groundwater elements numbers of studies were conducted to determine spatial distribution of the chemical constituents related to groundwater quality studies around the world within various kinds of geological set up using remote sensing and gis techniques ketata et al 2012 selvam et al 2014 gnanachandrasamy et al 2015 in the present study spatial analyses were performed using arc gis 10 software these samples were plotted in the respective gps based samples locations and contours were generated using interpolation techniques in gis the spatial maps fig 6 of all the major anion and cation were prepared to reveal the spatial distribution of the various elements in the study area the spatial analysis reveals that the majority of the study area is under desirable limit whereas a few pockets in some of the elements are above the permissible limit 4 3 3 suitability for irrigation uses in order to evaluate the groundwater quality and its suitability for irrigation salinization is the major cause of loss of production and is one of the most prolific adverse environmental impacts associated with irrigation saline condition severely limits the choice of the crops adversely affects crop germination and yields and can cause soils to be difficult to work with the purpose of reducing the salinity effects on the crops effective management strategies required which includes installing subsurface drainage changing change in the irrigation pattern crop rotation strategies based on the suitability of land and local conditions moreover it is also important that all evaluations regarding water quality for irrigation uses are linked to the evaluation of the soils to be irrigated westcott and ayers 1984 low poor quality irrigation water might be hazardous on heavy clay soils while the same water could be used for satisfactorily on sandy and or permeable soils the important hydrochemical properties of groundwater used to determine its suitability for irrigation are 4 3 3 1 electrical conductivity ec and sodium percentage na electrical conductivity is the ability of a material to conduct an electric current electrical conductivity ec of the groundwater samples was measured during the collection of groundwater samples in the field as per the world health organization who 1984 the maximum desirable limit in the drinking water is 1500 μs cm based on the enrichment of salts sarath prasanth et al 2012 ec can be classified into three types low ec 1500 μs cm medium ec 1500 and 3000 μs cm and high ec 3000 μs cm ec and na concentration are very important in classifying irrigation water the salts besides affecting the growth of the plants directly also affect soil structure permeability and aeration which indirectly affect plant growth the sodium percentage is widely utilized for evaluating the suitability of water quality for irrigation doneen 1964 is calculated as n a n a k c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 the concentrations of cations are in meq l based on the sodium percent value table 5 it is found that during the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons excellent groundwater quality samples are 93 and 87 respectively the plot of the analytical data on the wilcox 1955 diagram of ec and sodium percentage shows that majority of groundwater samples fall in excellent to good quality and a few samples fall in the good to permissible quality fig 7 a gis based salinity hazard map was also prepared using interpolation technique in the gis environment which shows regions with low medium and high salinity hazards the majority of the area is covered by groundwater with decent quality fig 8 although a few pockets in the northeastern parts of the study area where the zone of undesirable category is found 4 3 3 2 alkali and salinity hazard based on the concentration of soluble salts in the irrigation water richards 1954 classified the irrigation water into low ec 250 μs cm medium ec 250 750 μs cm high ec 750 2250 μs cm and very high ec 2250 μs cm while the salt concentration in water leads to the formation of saline soil a high sodium concentration leads to the development of an alkaline soil excessive solutes in irrigation water are a common problem in arid and semi arid areas where water loss through evaporation is maximized the sodium or alkali hazard in the use of water for irrigation is determined by the absolute and the relative concentration of cations and is expressed in terms of the sodium absorption ratio sar and it can be estimated by the formula s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 sar concentration is in meq l sodium concentration is important in ground water since the increase of sodium concentration in water affects the deterioration of the soil properties by reducing permeability kelly 1951 tejani 1994 the process leads to the cation exchange reactions in the soil may also be studied from the sodium absorption ratio ussl 1954 sodium absorbed on clay surface as suitable from calcium and magnesium may damage the soil structure making it compact and impervious the sar value in the study area ranges from 0 03 to 1 17 meq l which indicates no hazard of alkalinity richards 1954 4 3 3 3 iii integrated effect of ec and sar the values of the sar and ec of groundwater water samples of the study area were plotted for the pre monsoon period and post monsoon period for irrigation water field in the graphical diagram fig 9 of ussl 1954 the values fall in the three categories such as good quality c1 s1 c2 s1 and c3 s1 with low alkalinity and with medium to excellent salinity hazard table 6 4 3 3 4 iv residual sodium carbonate rsc the quantity of carbonate and bicarbonate in excess of alkaline earths ca2 mg2 also influences the suitability of water for irrigation purposes when the sum of carbonates and bicarbonate is in excess of calcium and magnesium there may be possibility of complete precipitation ca2 and mg2 raghunath 1987 to quantify the effects of carbonate and bicarbonate residual sodium carbonate rsc has been computed by the equation rsc co3 hco3 ca2 mg2 meq l in the rsc values in groundwater of the study area the pre monsoon period ranges from 5 61 to 0 12 meq l and the values of the post monsoon period ranges from 5 67 to 0 64 meq l it implies that according to the values of rsc the quality of groundwater of the study area is good for irrigation purposes 4 3 3 5 kelly ratio the level of sodium measured against calcium and magnesium is known as kelly ratio based on kelly ratio irrigation water has been rated as suitable and unsuitable kelly 1940 paliwal 1967 the concentration of sodium in irrigation water is considered as excess and unsuitable if it is 1 kelly ratio and the water with a kelly ratio of 1 is only suitable in the pre monsoon season data 60 samples have 1 kelly ratio and in post monsoon 45 samples having kelly ratio 1 the kelly ratio in the pre monsoon samples varies from 0 31 to 4 80 whereas in the post monsoon samples vary from 0 41 to 4 69 hence the groundwater in the study area is suitable to partially suitable for irrigation purposes 4 3 3 6 magnesium ratio mr it is expressed as mr mg2 x100 ca2 mg2 where all the ions are expressed in meq l it may be described as the excess amount of magnesium over calcium and magnesium magnesium values more than 50 are considered harmful and unsuitable for the irrigation purposes excess of magnesium affects the quality of soils which is the main cause of poor yield of crops the magnesium ratio of the pre monsoon samples varies from 6 57 to 96 99 31 samples more than 50 percent and in the post monsoon samples the magnesium ratio varies from 6 75 to 94 26 25 sample more than 50 percent in the present study the majority of the magnesium ratio of the pre monsoon and post monsoon samples of the groundwater shows the value 50 which are suitable and not harmful for the irrigation purposes although it is also observed in the study area a few pockets have the magnesium value 50 4 3 3 7 vii corrosivity ratio cr the corrosivity ratio is defined by the formula cr cl 35 5 2 so4 2 96 2 hco3 co3 100 where all the ions are expressed in ppm of groundwater it denotes the susceptibility of groundwater to corrosion and is expressed as a ratio of the alkaline earths to saline salts in groundwater the effects of corrosion are losses in hydraulic capacity of the pipes the effect of the corrosivity on metallic pipes has been widely studied ryner 1944 raman 1985 the corrosivity ratio 1 is considered unsafe and the cr value 1 polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes should be used although it is found in the study area that all the samples of the pre monsoon and the post monsoon are safe having corrosivity ratio 1 the corrosivity ratio ranges from 0 11 to 0 87 in the pre monsoon and 0 10 to 0 88 in the post monsoon season 4 3 3 8 viii permeability index pi doneen 1964 classified the irrigation water based on the permeability index pi it is defined by p i n a h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 n a 100 where the concentrations of cations and anions are in meq l according to the permeability indices the water may be divided into three classes viz class i class ii class iii types the class i and class ii are suitable for the irrigation with 75 percent or more of maximum permeability the groundwater samples in the study area during the post monsoon 85 samples fall in class i and 15 samples in class ii whereas in the pre monsoon 77 samples are found in class i and 23 in class ii fig 10 the groundwater samples of study area fall in class i and class ii indicate that indicate that quality of groundwater is good for irrigation purpose 4 3 4 suitability for industrial uses the water quality requirement for industrial varies considerably between area kind of industries and processes based on the standards set by the awwa 1971 one can conclude that the groundwater of the study area is suitable for industrial purposes except a few cases the purest of water is required for manufacturing of pharmaceuticals while for certain phases of mining industry the quality requirements are less exacting food industries such as dairying brewing and carbonated beverage canning must comply with drinking water standards with disinfections and treatment the difference in the quality of groundwater of shallow and deeper has been observed that the concentration of the chemical constituents in the groundwater from shallow aquifer is comparatively higher than the deeper aquifers groundwater samples of the study area fall in the class i and class ii shows that excellent water quality is found in the deeper aquifers whereas shallow and medium aquifers falls in the good to permissible category which is safe for human irrigation purposes 5 conclusions the current study demonstrates that the groundwater is soft to hard excellent to fair and alkaline in nature the order of the abundance of the major cations and anions in the following order by ca2 na mg2 k hco3 so4 2 cl and no3 type the alkaline earth ca2 and mg2 exceeds alkalies na and k and weak acids hco3 exceeds strong acids cl so4 2 no3 the ca2 mg2 and hco3 depict the temporary hardness and indicate that total hydrochemistry is dominated by alkaline earth and weak acids calcium sodium and magnesium are major cations and bicarbonate is the major anion in the present study shows the dominance of calcium bicarbonate the groundwater is classified as fresh water normal chloride normal sulphate normal carbonate water and moderately hard the gibbs ratio for anions and cations point towards rock dominance of the chemistry of groundwater in the region which reflects the influence of the chemistry of aquifer lithology vis a vis groundwater salinity hazard of the study area is low to medium and low alkalinity hazard is experienced the residual sodium carbonate permeability index kelley s ratio magnesium ratio sodium alkali hazard indicate that groundwater quality good for the irrigation purpose based on this study it is found that groundwater quality of the study area is good for both drinking as well as irrigational purposes apart from a few localities acknowledgements authors are highly

basic human need and a precious national asset india accounts for 2 2 of the global land 4 of the world s water resources and supporting more than 16 of the world population groundwater is one of the primary resources for the development activities in india and around the world in recent years there has been a tremendous increase in the demand of the fresh water globally and india is facing an acute shortage of water during the summer in most parts of the country in societies with the developing economies like india the optimum development and efficient management of their water resources should be a dominant strategy for economic growth although in the recent years unscientific planning and management and use of groundwater for various purposes almost invariably have created undesirable problems in its wake water logging and salinity in case agricultural use and environmental pollution as a result of industrial and municipal use the siwaliks rocks of the study area are quite diverse in terms of flora and fauna because of diversity in geological formations temperature and climatic conditions basu 2004 due to large scale expansion of industries residential and intense use of the fertilizer in the agricultural activities the water quality has been severely affected in the last two decades dar et al 2010 2012 bahri et al 2011 ramkumar et al 2013 besides this geochemical reactions that take place within the aquifer as well as reaction by rock water interaction also affect the water quality appelo and postma 1993 stamatis et al 2006 lambrakis 2006 bathrellos et al 2008 kannel et al 2008 enwright and hudak 2009 nas and berktay 2010 although seasonal variation of water quality data assessment is also complicated and requires statistical analysis of long term data monitoring of the data elci and polat 2010 gamvroula et al 2013 to understand the water quality for irrigation purposes several chemical indices have been defined such as permeability index residual sodium carbonate sodium percentage sodium adsorption ratio magnesium hazard etc around the world and well documented in various researches adhikary et al 2012 ramesh and elango 2012 vasanthavigar et al 2012 al taani 2013 one of the important requirements to undertake an irrigation quality assessment is to produce a specialized map to identify areas under pollution threat however better results may be obtained by analyzing the chemistry of all the anions and cations rather than individual parameters hem 1985 with the rapidity of technology the need of groundwater quality assessment before the implementation of the land development programme in order to overcome water borne diseases of the people who depend upon groundwater for their consumption is also a matter of great consideration and also well documented niranjanbabu et al 1997 kvitsand and fiksdal 2010 murphy et al 2014 saba et al 2015 the detail hydrochemistry and groundwater quality in

carried out by the various researchers in india jasrotia et al 2013 dhar et al 2015 the jammu himalaya is a part of the siwaliks and indo gangetic fertile plains where intensive cultivation is going on from the last so many years over the years increasing population with the rise of industrial and urban activities plus a lack of proper environmental control measures with the increasing and necessary demand of continuous monitoring of the groundwater quality the purpose of the present study is to understand the groundwater quality in the cenozoic rocks of jammu himalaya and to prepare the spatial distribution maps of the various physical chemical parameters using geospatial technology 2 description of study area the study area located in the hilly terrain of jammu himalaya lies between latitude 32 33 07 to 33 07 30 n and longitude 74 27 00 to 77 21 00 e and covers a total area of 3092 km2 bounded by lofty mountain in the north and western side with a stretch of indo gangetic plains in the south and southeastern part of the study area the geology structure and lithology play a major role in the evolution of the various types of drainage pattern in the study area the major rivers flow through the study area are the basantar the chenab the jammu tawi and munawartawi fig 1 b which flows predominantly in the sw direction are the parts of the indus drainage basin and draining ultimately into the arabian sea 2 1 geological setting tectonically the study area is the part of siwalik foreland basin fig 1a sediments have been studied extensively by the various

limb of the siwaliks rocks of jammu himalaya the middle siwaliks composed of medium to coarse grained sandstones and subordinate grey brown mudstone where as the upper siwaliks rocks of the study area are sand silt and clay dominantly coarse grained sandstone and pink grey mudstone the upper siwalik rock of jammu himalaya is subdivided into three formations i e parmandal sandstone nagrota silt and boulder conglomerate 2 2 hydrogeology the study area is covered with large numbers of unconfined aquifers with ground water flow direction following the direction of the river flow as structure and lithology plays a major role in the evolution of the topography and drainage pattern of the area hydrogeologically the study area was broadly classified divided into three sub division such as the northern hilly area which act as a runoff zone underlain by the siwalik group of rocks which rises gradually in the northern part of the study area and the jammu alluvial plains of pleistocene age jasrotia and kumar 2014b 2 2 1 northern hilly area the northern hilly area lies at an altitude above 900 above mean sea level amsl characterized by high altitude fig 1c steep slope and high drainage density with a thin layer of soil cover however major fractures joints faults lineaments and narrow inter mountain valleys favour minute infiltration in the hilly area in this area surface as well as groundwater flows from higher gradient to low lying areas structural hill and denudation hills are of common occurrences and the dissections in these hills are important surficial features for artificial recharge to groundwater although the area is devoid of any major aquifers having poor prospects of groundwater 2 2 2 siwalik group the siwalik rocks generally act as recharge zone is one of the important factors in groundwater studies the siwaliks group of rocks is characterized by low yielding capacity with deep water table conditions the gentle slope and unconsolidated material in the valley fill areas together with faults fractures lineaments with veneer soil cover favour infiltration the area is predominately under high drawdown and high infiltration ratio the unconfined aquifers usually occupying higher elevations with a deeper water table conditions the piedmont zone and fluvial deposits fall into this category 2 2 3 jammu alluvial plains the jammu alluvial plains tract of the study area lies at an altitude of less than 350 m above mean sea level amsl the alluvial flat land with a gentle slope well irrigation system large number of tube well dug well for domestic and irrigation and industrial uses are widely found the shallow water table condition with minor seasonal fluctuations high discharge low drawdown and high specific yield the outlets of ground water were diffused in the form of seepages but at some places the flow may be directed in the form of springs through well defined outlets 3 materials and methods in the present study ground water samples of the hundred dug well and tube well were collected from the different locations including urban rural and industrial area of the present study area during pre monsoon and post monsoon season and analyzed for their chemistry fig 1d by using random sampling technique to select wells which have been extensively used for drinking and other domestic purposes toposheets were used to prepare the base map and the drainage map and to understand the general nature of the study area during the collection of samples global positioning system was used to map the well location during the field visits measurement of ph was made using a portable ph meter water proof ph scan 2 tester ec and temperature value of the samples were also measured during the field visits by the ec meter water proof ec scan 3 tester and thermometer respectively whereas tds was measured with tds meter water proof tds scan1tester the techniques and methods for collection and analysis of water samples followed in this study were those after the american public health association apha 1992 and manual of pollution control board new delhi mpcb 1997 the dissolved oxygen do analyzed in the laboratory by the winkler titrimetric azide modification iodometric method and total alkalinity by the color indicator method the total hardness and calcium were estimated by the edta titrimetric method and magnesium estimated

by the gravimetric method the nitrate and silica ion concentration were also analyzed by using the ultraviolet uv spectrophotometer all the concentrations are expressed in mg l except ph and ec in μs cm the location of each well was taken into the gis environment and the results of each parameter analyzed were added to the concerned wells the spatial analysis was carried out for drinking and irrigation water quality mapping in the study area 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry of groundwater the graphical representations of the hydrochemistry of the groundwater were evaluated by plotting the cations and anions in percent of total meq l in the piper trilinear diagram piper 1944 expanded durov diagram doneen 1948 domenico and schwartz 1990 chebotarev classification chebotarev

trilinear diagram piper diagram consists of three distinct fields including two triangular fields and a diamond shaped field has been extensively used to understand problems concerning the geochemical evolution of groundwater the cations expressed as percentage of total cations in meq l as a single point on the left triangle while the anions plot in the right triangle piper 1953 the piper s diagram is considered to be one of the most widely and effectively used diagram to determine the chemical facies based on the dominant cations and anions analysis of hydrochemical facies on the piper trilinear diagram fig 2 reveals that the water quality belongs to the ca2 mg2 hco3 plot of the groundwater samples from the pre monsoon period although post monsoon data samples falling in the field 1 ca2 hco3 type 3 mixed ca2 na hco3 type 4 mixed ca2 mg2 cl type which suggests that alkaline earth exceeds alkalies and weak acids exceeds strong acids respectively the ca2 and mg2 are major cations in the study area where as the hco3 is the major anion constitutes about 75 80 of the total anion concentration 4 1 2 expanded durov diagram expanded durov diagram was used to show the clustering of groundwater point data to specify the samples that have similar compositions in this diagram major cations ca2 mg2 na k and anions ci so4 2 hco3 were plotted in terms of percentage by converting the chemical facies concentration meq l guler et al 2002 fianko et al 2010 the major cations and anions plotted durov 1948 as percentages of miliequivalents in two base triangles all ions with concentrations surpassing 10 of the molar concentration in the solution are considered to be major ions guler et al 2002 this diagram used to understand the hydrochemical evolutionary sequence of groundwater as plotted fig 3 the groundwater samples in the study area mostly fall in the field 1 dominance of calcium bicarbonate which indicates recharging of water from the carbonates present as cementing materials in the sandstone and the rest of the samples fall in the other fields 2 and 3 the field 2 indicates that the groundwater is ca2 so4 2 water is associated with the sedimentary rock which signifies that the groundwater reveals the initial and intermediate stage of freshwater quality the deposition of ca2 so4 2 from the saturated solution is also induced by a rise in the ca2 hco3 content in consequence of raising co2 pressure the samples fall in the field 3 indicating that mg2 water often associated with dolomite where calcium and sodium are important partial ion exchange sulphate in the groundwater is derived from gypsum or anhydrite calcium sulphate and may also be derived by the oxidation of pyrite and other sulfides widely distributed in sedimentary rocks as minor accessories in the study area the geographical representation of the expanded durov diagram indicates the dominance of calcium bicarbonate 4 1 3 gibbs diagram the relationship of water composition and aquifer lithological characteristics were widely described with the help of three different facies such as evaporation dominance precipitation dominance and rock water interaction dominance gibbs 1970

towards rock dominance of the chemistry of groundwater in the region which reflects the influence of the chemistry of aquifer lithology vis a vis groundwater 4 1 4 facies mapping approach hydrochemical facies depict the diagnostic chemical character of water in various parts of the system the facies reflects the effects of the chemical reaction occurring between minerals within the lithological framework the mineralogy of the aquifer system largely determines the type of hydro chemical facies which develop flow pattern modify the hydro chemical facies and control their distribution the chemical data were plotted following facies mapping approach back 1961 the hydrochemical variation and the distribution of facies of groundwater throughout the study area show that most of the cation facies falls in the calcium sodium and calcium magnesium fig 5 a the anion facies are mostly found in the bicarbonate chloride sulphate and a few samples are falling in the chloride sulphate bicarbonate fig 5b 4 1 5 chebotarev classification the chebotarev 1955 proposed a geochemical classification of water based on anion occurrence and prevalence as they are regarded as independent gradients type of water class of water hco3 1 hco3 cl ii cl hco3 iii cl so4 2 iv cl v further he has also given an idealized anion evolution sequence in which the initial recharge water of the hco3 type finally evolves to cl type water which is shown below hco3 hco3 cl cl hco3 cl so4 2 or so4 2 cl cl chebotarev sequence expressed in simpler terms as follows bicarbonate waters sulphate waters chloride waters in the present study hco3 shows the highest values in the hydrochemical data persuasive the class of bicarbonate water indicating the initial stage of groundwater evolution which interns of freshwater quality 4 2 groundwater classifications the classification of groundwater is very much essential to know the suitability of groundwater of an area for domestic agricultural or industrial uses in the study area groundwater is classified based on the total dissolved constituents davis and dewiest 1966 and genetic classification schoeller 1962 classified groundwater based on the concentration of cl so4 2 hco 3 and index of base exchange ibe etc are given below i classification based on tds concentration based on tds carroll 1962 classification the groundwater of the study area falls under fresh water environment tds 1000 mg l ii classification based on hco 3 concentration the mean value of hco3 concentration in groundwater during the pre monsoon season is 201 65 mg l and 221 80 mg l in the post monsoon season table 2 in the study area sixty samples fall in the normal carbonate water and fourteen samples fall in under carbonate water and only one sample shows super carbonated water hence the groundwater of the study area is generally normal carbonate water iii classification based on hardness the total hardness of groundwater in the study area has been calculated by using the formula proposed by raghunath 1987 as under th as caco3 in mg l ca2 mg2 meq l 50 the mean values of total hardness concentration in groundwater during the pre monsoon season and post monsoon season are 216 meq l and 237 09 meq l respectively according to sawyer and mccarty 1967 classification the groundwater falls under soft to hard category table 3 iv classification based on cl concentration genetic classification based on cl concentration as proposed by schoeller 1962 the mean values of chloride concentration table 2 observed in groundwater during the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are 24 60 mg l and 22 46 mg l respectively which indicates that the groundwater is normal chloride water v classification based on so 4 2 concentration differentiation according to so4 2 concentration the groundwater is normal sulphate water the mean values of sulphate concentration in groundwater during the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are 37 60 mg l and 39 98 mg l respectively which indicates that the groundwater is normal sulphate vi classification based on base exchange schoeller 1965 index of base exchange ibe shows negative to positive value in the water suggesting the enrichment of chloride because of the proximity of the wells to clay minerals 4 3 groundwater quality assessment the analysis of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes were evaluated from the data obtained by chemical analysis of the groundwater samples described as under 4 3 1 suitability for drinking water purposes to evaluate the quality of the groundwater for the drinking purposes major cation and anion of the groundwater in the study area table 4 was compared with the standard of the world health organization who 1984 and drinking water standards of the indian standard institute isi 1991 according to the chemical composition of groundwater of the study area ph is in the range of 6 5 8 5 indicating an alkaline nature tds which is a measure of the total concentrations of dissolved salts ranges from 70 to 780 mg l the mean values of the total alkalinity ta concentrations during the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are 167 65 mg l and 184 78 mg l respectively table 2 the groundwater based on total hardness belongs to the soft 75 150 mg l to hard 150 3000 mg l categories sawyer and mccarty 1967 that all the samples show th ta indicates non carbonate hardness the concentration of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 no3 and cl varies from 18 to 160 1 9 to 44 3 to 62 0 5 to 25 35 to 435 6 to 111 0 1 to 60 and 5 94 100 mg l respectively table 4 the groundwater in the present study area is characterized by ca2 na mg2 k hco3 so4 2 cl and no3 type 4 3 2 spatial analysis of groundwater quality gis based techniques have been extensively used by numerous researchers of various disciplines for spatial queries analysis and integration various thematic layers from the last three decades burrough and mc donnel 1998 jasrotia and kumar 2014a for the solution of desired outputs gis based spatial analysis is emerging as powerful technique and an effective tool to produce the desirable output for the spatial distribution of various groundwater elements numbers of studies were conducted to determine spatial distribution of the chemical constituents related to groundwater quality studies around the world within various kinds of geological set up using remote sensing and gis techniques ketata et al 2012 selvam et al 2014 gnanachandrasamy et al 2015 in the present study spatial analyses were performed using arc gis 10 software these samples were plotted in the respective gps based samples locations and contours were generated using interpolation techniques in gis the spatial maps fig 6 of all the major anion and cation were prepared to reveal the spatial distribution of the various elements in the study area the spatial analysis reveals that the majority of the study area is under desirable limit whereas a few pockets in some of the elements are above the permissible limit 4 3 3 suitability for irrigation uses in order to evaluate the groundwater quality and its suitability for irrigation salinization is the major cause of loss of production and is one of the most prolific adverse environmental impacts associated with irrigation saline condition severely limits the choice of the crops adversely affects crop germination and yields and can cause soils to be difficult to work with the purpose of reducing the salinity effects on the crops effective management strategies required which includes installing subsurface drainage changing change in the irrigation pattern crop rotation strategies based on the suitability of land and local conditions moreover it is also important that all evaluations regarding water quality for irrigation uses are linked to the evaluation of the soils to be irrigated westcott and ayers 1984 low poor quality irrigation water might be hazardous on heavy clay soils while the same water could be used for satisfactorily on sandy and or permeable soils the important hydrochemical properties of groundwater used to determine its suitability for irrigation are 4 3 3 1 electrical conductivity ec and sodium percentage na electrical conductivity is the ability of a material to conduct an electric current electrical conductivity ec of the groundwater samples was measured during the collection of groundwater samples in the field as per the world health organization who 1984 the maximum desirable limit in the drinking water is 1500 μs cm based on the enrichment of salts sarath prasanth et al 2012 ec can be classified into three types low ec 1500 μs cm medium ec 1500 and 3000 μs cm and high ec 3000 μs cm ec and na concentration are very important in classifying irrigation water the salts besides affecting the growth of the plants directly also affect soil structure permeability and aeration which indirectly affect plant growth the sodium percentage is widely utilized for evaluating the suitability of water quality for irrigation doneen 1964 is calculated as n a n a k c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 the concentrations of cations are in meq l based on the sodium percent value table 5 it is found that during the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons excellent groundwater quality samples are 93 and 87 respectively the plot of the analytical data on the wilcox 1955 diagram of ec and sodium percentage shows that majority of groundwater samples fall in excellent to good quality and a few samples fall in the good to permissible quality fig 7 a gis based salinity hazard map was also prepared using interpolation technique in the gis environment which shows regions with low medium and high salinity hazards the majority of the area is covered by groundwater with decent quality fig 8 although a few pockets in the northeastern parts of the study area where the zone of undesirable category is found 4 3 3 2 alkali and salinity hazard based on the concentration of soluble salts in the irrigation water richards 1954 classified the irrigation water into low ec 250 μs cm medium ec 250 750 μs cm high ec 750 2250 μs cm and very high ec 2250 μs cm while the salt concentration in water leads to the formation of saline soil a high sodium concentration leads to the development of an alkaline soil excessive solutes in irrigation water are a common problem in arid and semi arid areas where water loss through evaporation is maximized the sodium or alkali hazard in the use of water for irrigation is determined by the absolute and the relative concentration of cations and is expressed in terms of the sodium absorption ratio sar and it can be estimated by the formula s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 sar concentration is in meq l sodium concentration is important in ground water since the increase of sodium concentration in water affects the deterioration of the soil properties by reducing permeability kelly 1951 tejani 1994 the process leads to the cation exchange reactions in the soil may also be studied from the sodium absorption ratio ussl 1954 sodium absorbed on clay surface as suitable from calcium and magnesium may damage the soil structure making it compact and impervious the sar value in the study area ranges from 0 03 to 1 17 meq l which indicates no hazard of alkalinity richards 1954 4 3 3 3 iii integrated effect of ec and sar the values of the sar and ec of groundwater water samples of the study area were plotted for the pre monsoon period and post monsoon period for irrigation water field in the graphical diagram fig 9 of ussl 1954 the values fall in the three categories such as good quality c1 s1 c2 s1 and c3 s1 with low alkalinity and with medium to excellent salinity hazard table 6 4 3 3 4 iv residual sodium carbonate rsc the quantity of carbonate and bicarbonate in excess of alkaline earths ca2 mg2 also influences the suitability of water for irrigation purposes when the sum of carbonates and bicarbonate is in excess of calcium and magnesium there may be possibility of complete precipitation ca2 and mg2 raghunath 1987 to quantify the effects of carbonate and bicarbonate residual sodium carbonate rsc has been computed by the equation rsc co3 hco3 ca2 mg2 meq l in the rsc values in groundwater of the study area the pre monsoon period ranges from 5 61 to 0 12 meq l and the values of the post monsoon period ranges from 5 67 to 0 64 meq l it implies that according to the values of rsc the quality of groundwater of the study area is good for irrigation purposes 4 3 3 5 kelly ratio the level of sodium measured against calcium and magnesium is known as kelly ratio based on kelly ratio irrigation water has been rated as suitable and unsuitable kelly 1940 paliwal 1967 the concentration of sodium in irrigation water is considered as excess and unsuitable if it is 1 kelly ratio and the water with a kelly ratio of 1 is only suitable in the pre monsoon season data 60 samples have 1 kelly ratio and in post monsoon 45 samples having kelly ratio 1 the kelly ratio in the pre monsoon samples varies from 0 31 to 4 80 whereas in the post monsoon samples vary from 0 41 to 4 69 hence the groundwater in the study area is suitable to partially suitable for irrigation purposes 4 3 3 6 magnesium ratio mr it is expressed as mr mg2 x100 ca2 mg2 where all the ions are expressed in meq l it may be described as the excess amount of magnesium over calcium and magnesium magnesium values more than 50 are considered harmful and unsuitable for the irrigation purposes excess of magnesium affects the quality of soils which is the main cause of poor yield of crops the magnesium ratio of the pre monsoon samples varies from 6 57 to 96 99 31 samples more than 50 percent and in the post monsoon samples the magnesium ratio varies from 6 75 to 94 26 25 sample more than 50 percent in the present study the majority of the magnesium ratio of the pre monsoon and post monsoon samples of the groundwater shows the value 50 which are suitable and not harmful for the irrigation purposes although it is also observed in the study area a few pockets have the magnesium value 50 4 3 3 7 vii corrosivity ratio cr the corrosivity ratio is defined by the formula cr cl 35 5 2 so4 2 96 2 hco3 co3 100 where all the ions are expressed in ppm of groundwater it denotes the susceptibility of groundwater to corrosion and is expressed as a ratio of the alkaline earths to saline salts in groundwater the effects of corrosion are losses in hydraulic capacity of the pipes the effect of the corrosivity on metallic pipes has been widely studied ryner 1944 raman 1985 the corrosivity ratio 1 is considered unsafe and the cr value 1 polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes should be used although it is found in the study area that all the samples of the pre monsoon and the post monsoon are safe having corrosivity ratio 1 the corrosivity ratio ranges from 0 11 to 0 87 in the pre monsoon and 0 10 to 0 88 in the post monsoon season 4 3 3 8 viii permeability index pi doneen 1964 classified the irrigation water based on the permeability index pi it is defined by p i n a h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 n a 100 where the concentrations of cations and anions are in meq l according to the permeability indices the water may be divided into three classes viz class i class ii class iii types the class i and class ii are suitable for the irrigation with 75 percent or more of maximum permeability the groundwater samples in the study area during the post monsoon 85 samples fall in class i and 15 samples in class ii whereas in the pre monsoon 77 samples are found in class i and 23 in class ii fig 10 the groundwater samples of study area fall in class i and class ii indicate that indicate that quality of groundwater is good for irrigation purpose 4 3 4 suitability for industrial uses the water quality requirement for industrial varies considerably between area kind of industries and processes based on the standards set by the awwa 1971 one can conclude that the groundwater of the study area is suitable for industrial purposes except a few cases the purest of water is required for manufacturing of pharmaceuticals while for certain phases of mining industry the quality requirements are less exacting food industries such as dairying brewing and carbonated beverage canning must comply with drinking water standards with disinfections and treatment the difference in the quality of groundwater of shallow and deeper has been observed that the concentration of the chemical constituents in the groundwater from shallow aquifer is comparatively higher than the deeper aquifers groundwater samples of the study area fall in the class i and class ii shows that excellent water quality is found in the deeper aquifers whereas shallow and medium aquifers falls in the good to permissible category which is safe for human irrigation purposes 5 conclusions the current study demonstrates that the groundwater is soft to hard excellent to fair and alkaline in nature the order of the abundance of the major cations and anions in the following order by ca2 na mg2 k hco3 so4 2 cl and no3 type the alkaline earth ca2 and mg2 exceeds alkalies na and k and weak acids hco3 exceeds strong acids cl so4 2 no3 the ca2 mg2 and hco3 depict the temporary hardness and indicate that total hydrochemistry is dominated by alkaline earth and weak acids calcium sodium and magnesium are major cations and bicarbonate is the major anion in the present study shows the dominance of calcium bicarbonate the groundwater is classified as fresh water normal chloride normal sulphate normal carbonate water and moderately hard the gibbs ratio for anions and cations point towards rock dominance of the chemistry of groundwater in the region which reflects the influence of the chemistry of aquifer lithology vis a vis groundwater salinity hazard of the study area is low to medium and low alkalinity hazard is experienced the residual sodium carbonate permeability index kelley s ratio magnesium ratio sodium alkali hazard indicate that groundwater quality good for the irrigation purpose

unsustainable groundwater abstraction and water quality deterioration in the past few decades groundwater contamination has emerged as a serious environmental problem aronovsky 2000 although to some extent the physical environment provides protection to the groundwater vrba and zaporozec 1994 the extent of the protection could be variably uncertain regardless the protection of groundwater resources from contamination requires a thorough understanding of the groundwater environment elmahdy and mohamed 2015 the high concentration of no3 in the range from 0 4 to 318 2 mg l in the groundwater indicates recent contamination from surface activities primarily agriculture and city sewages ahmed et al 2017 nazzal et al 2014a nazzal et al 2014b moreover in the last 2 3 decades the study area has witnessed high human and infrastructural developments which have resulted in the excessive abstraction of quaternary tertiary aquifer in the liwa area studies have documented groundwater quality deterioration primarily due to prolonged rock water interaction and anthropogenic influences including increased usage of chemical fertilizers nazzal et al 2014a considering these factors it became necessary to perform a pollution assessment study of the underlying aquifers to determine its vulnerability to contamination the results of the study will assist the policy makers in the proper management of the available groundwater resources by restricting the activities contributing to groundwater pollution in the highly vulnerable zones groundwater resources are often studied to address qualitative and quantitative issues groundwater pollution has become a serious environmental problem primarily due to increased human interaction with the groundwater environment ahmed et al 2015 mendizabal and stuyfzand 2011 güler et al 2012 the best preventive measures require delineation of the area on the basis of susceptibility to contamination vulnerability assessment basically a subjective concept is based on the fact that some land areas are more vulnerable to groundwater contamination than others vrba and zaporozec 1994 depending upon their hydrogeologic nature the vulnerability assessment does not account for the characteristics of the pollutants in recent years groundwater vulnerability assessment employing drastic model and gis techniques has become a very useful tool for the planning and decision making involving groundwater protection ahmed et al 2015 2017 oroji and karimi 2018 jarray et al 2017 the vulnerability assessment technique includes the overlay index method neshat et al 2014 the statistical method sorichetta et al 2011 and the process based method milnes 2011 numerous studies have been performed to systematically evaluate the potential of a hydrogeological environment to pollution contamination some of these methods include drastic aller et al 1987 god foster 1987 avi van stempvoort et al 1993 sintacs civita 1994 seepage civita and de regibus 1995 epik doerfliger and zwahlen 1997 and isis navlur and engel 1997 these methods integrate various hydrological and hydrogeological parameters in different combinations set by ratings and weights nevertheless all of the methods were mainly used to assess groundwater vulnerability to contamination the drastic method which is an overlay index method is a widely used technique for vulnerability assessment aller et al 1987 evans and myers 1990 rosen 1994 babiker et al 2005 rahman 2008 that integrates seven physical and hydrodynamic parameters some researchers modified drastic by adding parameters such as land use pattern umar et al 2009 alam et al 2014 and the contaminant adsorption coefficient of sediment in the vadose zone qinghai et al 2007 a successful model depends on the accuracy of drastic parameters new estimation approaches are often used that can differentiate between the identical data types with slightly different characteristics the present study deals with a detailed assessment of groundwater resources vulnerability to contamination within the liwa region the integrated use of gis techniques and the hydrodynamic behavior of the study area have generated first hand information on aquifer vulnerability in liwa area which policy makers can use for implementing policies for effective and sustainable groundwater usage 2 study area description the selected study area in the present study is quaternary tertiary aquifer in the liwa area united arab emirates focusing on the quaternary tertiary aquifer in the liwa area located in abu dhabi which is situated along the arabian gulf between the latitudes 22 5 25 north and longitudes 51 55 east in the present study major wells were located in the western region of abu dhabi fig 1 north of the liwa crescent between madinat zayed and meziyrah the highway between madinat zayed and meziyrah represents its eastern boundary land use distribution in the study area can be seen in fig 2 the surficial geology of abu dhabi emirate consists of 1 the coastal region of tidal flats sabkhas and terraces along the arabian gulf 2 the internal sand dune region covering most of the emirate and 3 the piedmont plain near al ain city symonds et al 2005 liwa can be classifies into two main stratigraphic units quaternary unit holocene and pleistocene aeolian fine to medium sand and interlunar deposits the thickness of this unit varies from 100 m to 150 m depending on the topographic elevation and can be divided into two subunits the upper unit is mostly composed of well sorted fairly loose aeolian dune sands with the occasional appearance of find grained slightly cemented interdunal deposits these interdunal deposits are dominant in the lower subunit which is composed of caliche horizons with traces of organic matter silt stones and even marls the boundary between the two sub units cannot be clearly defined by the information collected from the boreholes however a significant increase in slightly cemented interdunal deposits in observed around 60 m above mean sea level tertiary unit mudstone evaporates and clastics of miocene age the oligo miocene clastics unit is lithologically characterized by continental siliceous sand and sandstone and minor inter bedded shale layers the oligo miocene clastics unit has an average thickness of 105 m with a thickness of 20 m and 180 m in west east of liwa respectively the upper subunit consists of mudstone layers and evaporates of the lower fars formation the lower subunit is characterized by the prevalence of clastic sediment with layers of mudstone and anhydrite the boundary between the first appearance of evaporates depth of 30 m below msl and marks the end of the aquifer aquitard system shahid et al 2013 groundwater level is encountered between 104 m and 107 m above the detailed study area description including geology and hydrogeological set up was recently published by our research group iqbal et al 2018 uae s single biggest fresh groundwater resources lie in liwa region it is the residual water left behind from the wetter periods that are associated with the glaciations of the northern hemisphere 6 10 thousand years ago the lens shaped aquifer composed of windblown sand is located in a depression in the underlying fars formation arguably the lens of fresh water is naturally losing water to the surrounding desert however the annual rate is very low i e some 9 mm3 primarily because the very low groundwater gradients induce minimal groundwater flow united states geological survey usgs has calculated that it would take about 6000 years for a particle of water to move 20 km from the center of the lens in consequence the fresh water at liwa can be considered as an independent reservoir with minimal baseflow from oman mountains which can be beneficially mined ministry of environment and water moew 2010 due to its proximity with landuse activity the degradation of groundwater quality in the liwa region is attributed to evaporation and agricultural practices in most cases al katheeri et al 2009 the hydrochemical results iqbal et al 2018 in the liwa area have shown high concentration of sulfate and nitrate which can be linked to anthropogenic activities such as excessive use of agricultural fertilizers 3 methodology the drastic method is based on ratings and weights associated with seven hydrogeological parameters these parameters are hydraulic conductivity c depth to groundwater table d soil media s topography t net recharge r aquifer media a and impact of vadose zone i each parameter is assigned a rating ri and unique weight wi the weight factor ranges from 1 to 5 i e lowest to highest the ratings of the data may vary depending upon the type frequency and range thus making the model function in a site specific manner the linear additive combination of the above parameters with weights and ratings was used to calculate the drastic vulnerability index dvi as given below aller et al 1987 1 d v i d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where the suffixes r and w represent the rating and the weight assigned to each parameter in the present study the drastic model aller et al 1987 was further modified by the unique rating classes of each parameter relevant to the study area the land use map with 5 classes was selected to account for their role in the groundwater contamination for the land use classes two landsat 8 oli data path row 160 44 161 44 at 30 m resolution for the study area on august 14 2017 and august 21 2017 were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs website https earthexplorer usgs gov maps were prepared using arcgis software with an average grid size of 1 km the map removal sensitivity analysis lodwick et al 1990 was computed as a variation index 2 s v i n v x i n 100 v i where s is the sensitivity index vi is the vulnerability index n is the number of map layers used for computing vi vxi is the vulnerability index excluding one map layer and n is the number of maps used for calculating vxi the variation index which refers to the variation in the magnitude produced by removing one map layer corresponding to one parameter is computed as 3 v v i v x i v i 100 where v is the variation index of the removed parameter vi is the vulnerability index computed using eqn 1 and vxi is the vulnerability index calculated excluding one map layer napolitano and fabbri 1996 single parameter sensitivity analysis and was computed as 4 w p r p w v 100 where w is the effective weight of the parameter p pr is the rating pw is the weight and v is the vulnerability index water quality data was used from our recently published paper iqbal et al 2018 where 41 groundwater samples were collected from liwa aquifer in abu dhabi emirate united arab emirates and were tested for various physiochemical parameters 3 1 conceptualization of the drastic model the limited data type makes the data acquisition step very crucial as it could lead to inaccurate results different techniques and sources were referred to obtain data used for various input parameters table 1 data acquired from a pre set study area of specific geographical limits were translated to construct a 1 km2 grid size the distributed data contours are transformed into ranges corresponding to which ratings are assigned based on the relative likelihood to contamination the data range depends on the local geology and hydrogeology therefore the rating of the parameters can differ from one study area to another table 1 presents the range rating and weights assigned to each parameter 3 2 depth to the water level the distance that a contaminant will travel before reaching the aquifer is calculated using the depth to the water level the time taken by the contaminant to reach a deep water level is relatively longer than compared to a shallow water level in addition the attenuation capacity of the geologic material is proportional to the depth of the water level i e deeper the water level higher the attenuation aller et al 1987 civita 1994 in this study the depth to the water level was measured at approximately 115 piezometers the depth to the water level map was generated by taking the depth of the first occurrence of the water level the depth water level map and its index map are shown in fig 3 3 3 potential groundwater recharge the groundwater recharge was an average of 3 18 year and was estimated using various techniques such as darcy s law chloride mass balance and 14c isotopes the groundwater recharge across the entire liwa area is variable and does not exceed 8 mm year and assuming it to be a uniform recharge to the entire study area could potentially lead to inaccurate results consequently the groundwater recharge potential was estimated rather than the actual recharge using detailed topographic slope geology rainfall amount and drainage pattern the migration of the contaminants into the aquifer through cation exchange sorption filtration and other processes is controlled by geology of the area soller and berg 1992 as the geology controls the movement and quality of the groundwater in this study the nature of the overall formation was taken into account by a comparative rating among the different hydrogeological formations fig 4 table 2 a high rating assigned to a formation implies that it can behave as an aquifer while a low rating indicates an aquiclude and aquifuge table 1 a suitable site for groundwater recharge can be located or set with the help of geomorphological features chenini and mammou 2010 among the many factors in relation to groundwater recharge the drainage density is considered to be an important factor the high index value is assigned to areas exhibiting high drainage density fig 5 topography refers to the slope variability of land and often governs the general gradient and the direction of the flow of groundwater todd 1980 aller et al 1987 slope influence both the groundwater and the surface water environment high topographic slope slower the rate of infiltration and hence decreases the migration of contaminants however the steeper slope signifies a high groundwater velocity in the groundwater environment and increases the migration of contaminants the slope map was derived from a digital elevation model dem of 90 m resolution obtained from the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm and further classified into different rating classes fig 6 the study area is an arid region with low rainfall ranging from 70 mm year in the eastern part to 50 mm year in the west fig 7 a unique class was allocated to each isohyet fig 3 the low intensity rainfall restricts the groundwater recharge to selective sites where the concentration of runoff coincides with favorable sites preferably wadi channels alluviums karst openings etc selected studies from uae indicated a high rainfall recharge at small catchments and favorable sites elmahdy and mohamed 2015 elmahdy and mohamed 2014a b c for the computation of the potential recharge each of the parameters was converted to an index map by assigning a unique rating depending upon its expected role in groundwater recharge table 1 the groundwater recharge potential gwr can be represented as 5 gwr geology index drainage index slope index rainfall index 4 the recharge potential data layer was obtained after all the four data layers were sum averaged in the gis environment using equation 5 and then the average was scaled to uniform ratings from 1 to 10 fig 3 3 4 aquifer media and soil media characterization of lithology was undertaken to address vertical and horizontal lithological variability interpolation of the point data was performed to generate surfaces of the hydrogeological formation the ratings are based on a comparative assessment regarding how well a given formation would behave as an aquifer unit fig 8 the soil has a significant impact on the amount of recharge and on the ability of contaminants to move vertically into the vadose zone aller et al 1987 in the study area predominant soil types are haplosalids torripsamments medium relief tottipsamments low relief and torripsamments high relief as shown in fig 9 they represent the uppermost weathered portion of the unsaturated zone and control the amount of recharge that can infiltrate downwards a suitable rating to each soil type was assigned by taking various soil parameters such as thickness use water retention and conductivity into consideration table 1 the spatial extents and distribution of the various soil types are shown in fig 9 3 5 impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity the vadose zone is an unsaturated zone above the water table the vadose zone was evaluated using many lithologs various lithological units encountered in the lithologs are presented with their respective ratings in table 2 the material present in the vadose zone may vary significantly due to its hydraulic characteristics fig 10 to account for the variation in different materials in a litholog the harmonic mean of the vadose zone was taken this lithological log of more than 41 wells was divided into the above mentioned classes and the individual thicknesses of these layers were calculated the rating of each lithology was assigned as mentioned above the impact of the vadose zone ir was calculated by the following formula 6 i r t i 1 n t i i r i where ir the weighted harmonic mean of the vadose zone t total thickness of the vadose zone ti thickness of the layer i and iri rating of layer i the hydraulic conductivity controls the rate of groundwater movement into the saturated zone thereby controlling the degree and fate of the contaminants shirazi et al 2014 the distribution of the various voda zone types and spatial extents are shown in fig 11 4 results and discussion 4 1 vulnerability map the results show a robust correlation between the dvi and the different parameters included here as groundwater depth to water recharge aquifer media and soils media other parameters which are moderately correlated to dvi are the impact of vadose zone and conductivity up to some extent whereas the topography slope parameter shows poor correlation with dvi the promptly used approach for vulnerability classification relies on the index range ahmed et al 2015 hussain et al 2006 umar et al 2009 edet 2014 instead of using the various national color coding of vulnerability maps aller et al 1987 the dvi was finalized based assimilating collective impacts of seven data layers with gis environment fig 12 classify the study area into four different classes of vulnerability potential based on dvi scores the dvi scores are given without units in greatness relative and area specific where a higher drastic index assumes greater groundwater pollution umar et al 2009 edet 2014 ahmed et al 2015 and vice versa the dvi map fig 12 showed that most of the study area falls within high to very high vulnerability zones the area specific ratings increase the significance of localized data in comparison to the ratings given by aller et al 1987 the error due to the subjectivity of the index can be improved by enhancing characteristics of the individual parameter through some modification for instance groundwater recharge instead of estimating empirically from rainfall is estimated through incorporating collective impacts of geology slope and drainage indices this would bring more accuracy in dataset used for vulnerability mapping ahmed et al 2015 similarly modification for accurate assessment of the impact of vadose zone hussain et al 2006 soil media and landuse patters umar et al 2009 have proved instrumental in accuracy of the vulnerability assessment studies the vulnerability map of the liwa region indicates that the aquifer beneath the extensive agriculture track line ew part is falling in high to very high pollution vulnerability zones the high values of the selected parameters in particular the high levels of depth to groundwater recharge potential aquifer media and impact to the vadose zone are responsible for the high vulnerability in this region however the other parts showed intermediate to high vulnerability typically the dvi rises from the west to eastern part in the upper half of the study area although a no clear pattern is observed in vulnerability classes the middle track and ne part show very high vulnerability to pollution 4 2 drastic parameters table 3 presents the statistics of the seven drastic input data layers the high mean rating of depth to groundwater mean 8 34 followed by topography slope mean rating 8 17 assume a maximum risk of groundwater contamination moreover the values of the impact of hydraulic conductivity vadose zone soil and aquifer media imply a moderate of groundwater contamination while recharge potential indicates a low menace of aquifer contamination the conductivity data with a high coefficient of variation cv 84 are highly variable within the study area the recharge potential impact of vadose zone exhibit the least variability cv 0 0 and 3 94 the variability of the parameters evaluates the amount of their contribution to the variation of dvi where a high variability indicates a significant contribution to the change of dvi and a low variability infers to a small contribution to the dvi variation a low variability of the drastic parameters could be attributed either to the natural set or to the erroneous conceptualization the absence of a robust correlation enforces the sorting of the drastic parameters as independent parameters it is evident that crucial parameters like recharge aquifer media soil media and vadose zone have been addressed through a modified approach to bring about their key behavior towards pollution attenuation 4 3 model sensitivity the possibility of considering large datasets with the drastic model makes it a high potential model for this study evans and myers 1990 ahmed et al 2015 and limits the impact of the errors of the individual parameters to the final output rosen 1994 perhaps models that consider fewer input parameters may grant better accuracy due to the inconsistency in the input parameters the selection of the ratings and the weights may cause errors to the resulting output after data acquisition during conceptualization phase and data enhancement model sensitivity provides a secondary check on data sensitivity two methods i e the map removal sensitivity lodwick et al 1990 and the single parameter sensitivity analysis introduced by napolitano and fabbri 1996 are applied to complete sensitivity analyses of the model the single parameter sensitivity study was established to measure the effect of each of the drastic parameters on the dvi 4 3 1 map removal sensitivity analysis table 4 presents the outcomes of the map removal sensitivity analysis done by eliminating one or more data layers at a time are the highest sensitivity index accompanies the removal of the depth of groundwater 1 804 followed by the impact of vadose zone 1 502 table 4 the aquifer media parameter leads to a low theoretical weight this result is ascribed to the very high coefficient of variation cv 84 0 of the depth to groundwater layer the trend of variation indices is the order d i r s t c a as a result the collective impact of the mean rating score the coefficient of variation the theoretical weight babiker et al 2005 rahman 2008 ahmed et al 2015 and the large data range rule the variation index the impact of the vadose zone the removal of the data layers the topography slope from the computations and the recharge potential also seem to impact the variation of the vulnerability the sensitivity index should not be mixed up with the variation index which reflects the degree of the variation produced by map removal ahmed et al 2015 furthermore the elimination of the data layers relatively to their increasing sensitivity indices allowed to reflect the sensitivity index of more than one parameter reasonably the successive removal of data layers should trigger a gradual increase of the mean sensitivity index contrary to this the elimination of two layers depth to groundwater and impact to vadose zone displays a great sensitivity index than the elimination of three layers recharge potential soil media and topography the increasing mean sensitivity index is most likely due to the collective impact of the weight data range the coefficient of variation the mean rating scores and the correlation with dvi 4 3 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis in this type of sensitivity study the hypothetical weights ascribed to the drastic parameters are related to the effective weights which are a function of the single parameter value with regard to the remining six parameters considering their weight babiker et al 2005 ahmed et al 2015 the depth to groundwater and impact of vadose zone parameters are the most efficient inputs of the drastic model with the greatest weight of the of five equivalents to 28 97 followed by the impact of vadose zone 24 73 hydraulic conductivity 16 aquifer media 8 6 topography slope 5 5 and recharge potential 2 7 table 5 the present study directs a deviation in the actual weights compared to the hypothetical weights applied to the drastic model due to the high actual weights compared to the hypothetical weights the depth to groundwater 28 9 and impact to vadose zone 24 7 tend to be the most effective parameter the remaining parameters exhibited less actual weights than the theoretical weights one point here the revised weight to some of the low theoretical weight shows high value like aquifer media hydraulic conductivity this result directs the small augmentation in the extent of the reviewed vulnerability index therefore the actual weights were further applied to calculate the reviewed drastic vulnerability index with the following equation 7 r e v i s e d d v i 4 3 d r 4 8 r r 4 2 a r 1 8 s r 1 6 t r 4 6 i r 1 7 c r equation 7 shows the revised dvi exhibit 7 3 increase in the average vulnerability score when compared with dvi obtained using equation 1 4 4 pollution risk map numerous human activities and land usage forms have significant impacts on the groundwater vulnerability of most of the area especially the liwa area since its one of the most agricultural productive area in uae according to civita 1994 integrated vulnerability can be found by overlying an illustration of the actual pollution sources these causes of contamination are sectioned based on their contamination potential on the intrinsic vulnerability map babiker et al 2005 a land usage map with six land use categories fig 2 was realized using modis data these land use categories are given a unique rating based on their predicted role as a contamination input to the groundwater environment table 6 the urban waste disposal and quarry and mineral exploration land use categories were restricted in their geographical extends with only 0 22 0 06 and 0 14 respectively table 6 of the whole zone assigned a high rating the risk map is attained by joining the land usage data layer with the improved dvi which is calculated using the reviewed effective weights 8 r i s k m a p i n d e x r e v i s e d d v i l u r l u w where l u r l u w are the landuse ratings and weights respectively the reviewed dvi is the drastic vulnerability index found via the effective weights fig 13 the risk map or the integrated vulnerability map distinguished area is carrying pollution pressures the risk index is classified into categories fig 13 beginning from very low 131 150 low 151 170 medium 171 190 high 191 210 and very high 210 agricultural area the boundary overlap of the agronomic zones over the risk map reveals that these zones fall within high risk zones fig 14 the area extends from east to west in the northern part of liwa fall within the high risk area 5 conclusions and recommendations the evaluation of vulnerability index for the liwa area in uae was done using the geographic information system gis based drastic model depending upon the collective nature of the seven hydrogeological parameters the drastic vulnerability map classified the area into low medium high and very high vulnerability zones the results showed that the aquifer beneath the agriculture track line ew part is high to very high pollution vulnerable sensitivity analyses allowed the validation and evaluation of the consistency of analytical results the highest sensitivity index is observed upon elimination of the depth of groundwater 1 804 followed by the impact of vadose zone a risk map was also created and the area was classified into low medium and high the largest risk of groundwater pollution could be referred from the large mean rating of depth to groundwater mean 8 34 followed by topography slope mean rating 8 17 and it was also observed that the zones at the boundary overlap of the agronomic zones fall within high risk zones the presence of the impact of aquifer media soil media vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity imply moderate groundwater contamination while recharge potential indicates a low risk of aquifer pollution with an effective database in gis environment drastic is an effective tool for investigating the groundwater vulnerability the study suggests that this model can be used as a better tool for local authorities and policy makers who are responsible for groundwater management the groundwater contamination in vulnerable zones in the liwa area can be prevented by a implementing appropriate agriculture pesticides or chemical fertilizers b checking the disposal systems accompanying the human communities and industries in the eastern part of the study area c giving more attentiveness against pollution diminution to the areas where deep aquifers are outcropped regardless of their current vulnerability class and d regularly monitoring the groundwater quality especially at the areas with high vulnerability acknowledgement this project was funded by the research office zayed university in united arab emirates project no r 17041 
12311,anthropogenic activities and land use types can have a significant impact on the groundwater vulnerability especially in areas with agricultural activities such as liwa area in the united arab emirates uae in the study area the groundwater resources over exploited and are prone to quality deterioration due to the urbanization and growth in the agriculture sector in the present study various parameters and techniques were considered to represent the data variation and to analyze the water quality e g vulnerability mapping and drastic model estimates of the parameters such as recharge potential soil media and vadose zone were obtained based on modified criteria to account for the data variability statistical analysis indicates that the input parameters are independent and contribute individually to the vulnerability index based on the vulnerability index the study area is classified into low to very high vulnerability classes the land use pattern was included as one of the parameters to assess the human interaction on the groundwater resources in the study area to analyze the model sensitivity two techniques i e the map removal sensitivity and the single parameter sensitivity analysis were used drastic vulnerability index dvi was calculated by the linear additive combination of seven hydrogeological parameters with weights and ratings the single parameter

sediment with layers of mudstone and anhydrite the boundary between the first appearance of evaporates depth of 30 m below msl and marks the end of the aquifer aquitard system shahid et al 2013 groundwater level is encountered between 104 m and 107 m above the detailed study area description including geology and hydrogeological set up was recently published by our research group iqbal et al 2018 uae s single biggest fresh groundwater resources lie in liwa region it is the residual water left behind from the wetter periods that are associated with the glaciations of the northern hemisphere 6 10 thousand years ago the lens shaped aquifer composed of windblown sand is located in a depression in the underlying fars formation arguably the lens of fresh water is naturally losing water to the surrounding desert however the annual rate is very low i e some 9 mm3 primarily because the very low groundwater gradients induce minimal groundwater flow united states geological survey usgs has calculated that it would take about 6000 years for a particle of water to move 20 km from the center of the lens in consequence the fresh water at liwa can be considered as an independent reservoir with minimal baseflow from oman mountains which can be beneficially mined ministry of environment and water moew 2010 due to its proximity with landuse activity the degradation of groundwater quality in the liwa region is attributed to evaporation and agricultural practices in most cases al katheeri et al 2009 the hydrochemical results iqbal et al 2018 in the liwa area have shown high concentration of sulfate and nitrate which can be linked to anthropogenic activities such as excessive use of agricultural fertilizers 3 methodology the drastic method is based on ratings and weights associated with seven hydrogeological parameters these parameters are hydraulic conductivity c depth to groundwater table d soil media s topography t net recharge r aquifer media a and impact of vadose zone i each parameter is assigned a rating ri and unique weight wi the weight factor ranges from 1 to 5 i e lowest to highest the ratings of the data may vary depending upon the type frequency and range thus making the model function in a site specific manner the linear additive combination of the above parameters with weights and ratings was used to calculate the drastic vulnerability index dvi as given below aller et al 1987 1 d v i d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where the suffixes r and w represent the rating and the weight assigned to each parameter in the present study the drastic model aller et al 1987 was further modified by the unique rating classes of each parameter relevant to the study area the land use map with 5 classes was selected to account for their role in the groundwater contamination for the land use classes two landsat 8 oli data path row 160 44 161 44 at 30 m resolution for the study area on august 14 2017 and august 21 2017 were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs website https earthexplorer usgs gov maps were prepared using arcgis software with an average grid size of 1 km the map removal sensitivity analysis lodwick et al 1990 was computed as a variation index 2 s v i n v x i n 100 v i where s is the sensitivity index vi is the vulnerability index n is the number of map layers used for computing vi vxi is the vulnerability index excluding one map layer and n is the number of maps used for calculating vxi the variation index which refers to the variation in the magnitude produced by removing one map layer corresponding to one parameter is computed as 3 v v i v x i v i 100 where v is the variation index of the removed parameter vi is the vulnerability index computed using eqn 1 and vxi is the vulnerability index calculated excluding one map layer napolitano and fabbri 1996 single parameter sensitivity analysis and was computed as 4 w p r p w v 100 where w is the effective weight of the parameter p pr is the rating pw is the weight and v is the vulnerability index water quality data was used from our recently published paper iqbal et al 2018 where 41 groundwater samples were collected from liwa aquifer in abu dhabi emirate united arab emirates and were tested for various physiochemical parameters 3 1 conceptualization of the drastic model the limited data type makes the data acquisition step very crucial as it could lead to inaccurate results different techniques and sources were referred to obtain data used for various input parameters table 1 data acquired from a pre set study area of specific geographical limits were translated to construct a 1 km2 grid size the distributed data contours are transformed into ranges corresponding to which ratings are assigned based on the relative likelihood to contamination the data range depends on the local geology and hydrogeology therefore the rating of the parameters can differ from one study area to another table 1 presents the range rating and weights assigned to each parameter 3 2 depth to the water level the distance that a contaminant will travel before reaching the aquifer is calculated using the depth to the water level the time taken by the contaminant to reach a deep water level is relatively longer than compared to a shallow water level in addition the attenuation capacity of the geologic material is proportional to the depth of the water level i e deeper the water level higher the attenuation aller et al 1987 civita 1994 in this study the depth to the water level was measured at approximately 115 piezometers the depth to the water level map was generated by taking the depth of the first occurrence of the water level the depth water level map and its index map are shown in fig 3 3 3 potential groundwater recharge the groundwater recharge was an average of 3 18 year and was estimated using various techniques such as darcy s law chloride mass balance and 14c isotopes the groundwater recharge across the entire liwa area is variable and does not exceed 8 mm year and assuming it to be a uniform recharge to the entire study area could potentially lead to inaccurate results consequently the groundwater recharge potential was estimated rather than the actual recharge using detailed topographic slope geology rainfall amount and drainage pattern the migration of the contaminants into the aquifer through cation exchange sorption filtration and other processes is controlled by geology of the area soller and berg 1992 as the geology controls the movement and quality of the groundwater in this study the nature of the overall formation was taken into account by a comparative rating among the different hydrogeological formations fig 4 table 2 a high rating assigned to a formation implies that it can behave as an aquifer while a low rating indicates an aquiclude and aquifuge table 1 a suitable site for groundwater recharge can be located or set with the help of geomorphological features chenini and mammou 2010 among the many factors in relation to groundwater recharge the drainage density is considered to be an important factor the high index value is assigned to areas exhibiting high drainage density fig 5 topography refers to the slope variability of land and often governs the general gradient and the direction of the flow of groundwater todd 1980 aller et al 1987 slope influence both the groundwater and the surface water environment high topographic slope slower the rate of infiltration and hence decreases the migration of contaminants however the steeper slope signifies a high groundwater velocity in the groundwater environment and increases the migration of contaminants the slope map was derived from a digital elevation model dem of 90 m resolution obtained from the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm and further classified into different rating classes fig 6 the study area is an arid region with low rainfall ranging from 70 mm year in the eastern part to 50 mm year in the west fig 7 a unique class was allocated to each isohyet fig 3 the low intensity rainfall restricts the groundwater recharge to selective sites where the concentration of runoff coincides with favorable sites preferably wadi channels alluviums karst openings etc selected studies from uae indicated a high rainfall recharge at small catchments and favorable sites elmahdy and mohamed 2015 elmahdy and mohamed 2014a b c for the computation of the potential recharge each of the parameters was converted to an index map by assigning a unique rating depending upon its expected role in groundwater recharge table 1 the groundwater recharge potential gwr can be represented as 5 gwr geology index drainage index slope index rainfall index 4 the recharge potential data layer was obtained after all the four data layers were sum averaged in the gis environment using equation 5 and then the average was scaled to uniform ratings from 1 to 10 fig 3 3 4 aquifer media and soil media characterization of lithology was undertaken to address vertical and horizontal lithological variability interpolation of the point data was performed to generate surfaces of the hydrogeological formation the ratings are based on a comparative assessment regarding how well a given formation would behave as an aquifer unit fig 8 the soil has a significant impact on the amount of recharge and on the ability of contaminants to move vertically into the vadose zone aller et al 1987 in the study area predominant soil types are haplosalids torripsamments medium relief tottipsamments low relief and torripsamments high relief as shown in fig 9 they represent the uppermost weathered portion of the unsaturated zone and control the amount of recharge that can infiltrate downwards a suitable rating to each soil type was assigned by taking various soil parameters such as thickness use water retention and conductivity into consideration table 1 the spatial extents and distribution of the various soil types are shown in fig 9 3 5 impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity the vadose zone is an unsaturated zone above the water table the vadose zone was evaluated using many lithologs various lithological units encountered in the lithologs are presented with their respective ratings in table 2 the material present in the vadose zone may vary significantly due to its hydraulic characteristics fig 10 to account for the variation in different materials in a litholog the harmonic mean of the vadose zone was taken this lithological log of more than 41 wells was divided into the above mentioned classes and the individual thicknesses of these layers were calculated the rating of each lithology was assigned as mentioned above the impact of the vadose zone ir was calculated by the following formula 6 i r t i 1 n t i i r i where ir the weighted harmonic mean of the vadose zone t total thickness of the vadose zone ti thickness of the layer i and iri rating of layer i the hydraulic conductivity controls the rate of groundwater movement into the saturated zone thereby controlling the degree and fate of the contaminants shirazi et al 2014 the distribution of the various voda zone types and spatial extents are shown in fig 11 4 results and discussion 4 1 vulnerability map the results show a robust correlation between the dvi and the different parameters included here as groundwater depth to water recharge aquifer media and soils media other parameters which are moderately correlated to dvi are the impact of vadose zone and conductivity up to some extent whereas the topography slope parameter shows poor correlation with dvi the promptly used approach for vulnerability classification relies on the index range ahmed et al 2015 hussain et al 2006 umar et al 2009 edet 2014 instead of using the various national color coding of vulnerability maps aller et al 1987 the dvi was finalized based assimilating collective impacts of seven data layers with gis environment fig 12 classify the study area into four different classes of vulnerability potential based on dvi scores the dvi scores are given without units in greatness relative and area specific where a higher drastic index assumes greater groundwater pollution umar et al 2009 edet 2014 ahmed et al 2015 and vice versa the dvi map fig 12 showed that most of the study area falls within high to very high vulnerability zones the area specific ratings increase the significance of localized data in comparison to the ratings given by aller et al 1987 the error due to the subjectivity of the index can be improved by enhancing characteristics of the individual parameter through some modification for instance groundwater recharge instead of estimating empirically from rainfall is estimated through incorporating collective impacts of geology slope and drainage indices this would bring more accuracy in dataset used for vulnerability mapping ahmed et al 2015 similarly modification for accurate assessment of the impact of vadose zone hussain et al 2006 soil media and landuse patters umar et al 2009 have proved instrumental in accuracy of the vulnerability assessment studies the vulnerability map of the liwa region indicates that the aquifer beneath the extensive agriculture track line ew part is falling in high to very high pollution vulnerability zones the high values of the selected parameters in particular the high levels of depth to groundwater recharge potential aquifer media and impact to the vadose zone are responsible for the high vulnerability in this region however the other parts showed intermediate to high vulnerability typically the dvi rises from the west to eastern part in the upper half of the study area although a no clear pattern is observed in vulnerability classes the middle track and ne part show very high vulnerability to pollution 4 2 drastic parameters table 3 presents the statistics of the seven drastic input data layers the high mean rating of depth to groundwater mean 8 34 followed by topography slope mean rating 8 17 assume a maximum risk of groundwater contamination moreover the values of the impact of hydraulic conductivity vadose zone soil and aquifer media imply a moderate of groundwater contamination while recharge potential indicates a low menace of aquifer contamination the conductivity data with a high coefficient of variation cv 84 are highly variable within the study area the recharge potential impact of vadose zone exhibit the least variability cv 0 0 and 3 94 the variability of the parameters evaluates the amount of their contribution to the variation of dvi where a high variability indicates a significant contribution to the change of dvi and a low variability infers to a small contribution to the dvi variation a low variability of the drastic parameters could be attributed either to the natural set or to the erroneous conceptualization the absence of a robust correlation enforces the sorting of the drastic parameters as independent parameters it is evident that crucial parameters like recharge aquifer media soil media and vadose zone have been addressed through a modified approach to bring about their key behavior towards pollution attenuation 4 3 model sensitivity the possibility of considering large datasets with the drastic model makes it a high potential model for this study evans and myers 1990 ahmed et al 2015 and limits the impact of the errors of the individual parameters to the final output rosen 1994 perhaps models that consider fewer input parameters may grant better accuracy due to the inconsistency in the input parameters the selection of the ratings and the weights may cause errors to the resulting output after data acquisition during conceptualization phase and data enhancement model sensitivity provides a secondary check on data sensitivity two methods i e the map removal sensitivity lodwick et al 1990 and the single parameter sensitivity analysis introduced by napolitano and fabbri 1996 are applied to complete sensitivity analyses of the model the single parameter sensitivity study was established to measure the effect of each of the drastic parameters on the dvi 4 3 1 map removal sensitivity analysis table 4 presents the outcomes of the map removal sensitivity analysis done by eliminating one or more data layers at a time are the highest sensitivity index accompanies the removal of the depth of groundwater 1 804 followed by the impact of vadose zone 1 502 table 4 the aquifer media parameter leads to a low theoretical weight this result is ascribed to the very high coefficient of variation cv 84 0 of the depth to groundwater layer the trend of variation indices is the order d i r s t c a as a result the collective impact of the mean rating score the coefficient of variation the theoretical weight babiker et al 2005 rahman 2008 ahmed et al 2015 and the large data range rule the variation index the impact of the vadose zone the removal of the data layers the topography slope from the computations and the recharge potential also seem to impact the variation of the vulnerability the sensitivity index should not be mixed up with the variation index which reflects the degree of the variation produced by map removal ahmed et al 2015 furthermore the elimination of the data layers relatively to their increasing sensitivity indices allowed to reflect the sensitivity index of more than one parameter reasonably the successive removal of data layers should trigger a gradual increase of the mean sensitivity index contrary to this the elimination of two layers depth to groundwater and impact to vadose zone displays a great sensitivity index than the elimination of three layers recharge potential soil media and topography the increasing mean sensitivity index is most likely due to the collective impact of the weight data range the coefficient of variation the mean rating scores and the correlation with dvi 4 3 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis in this type of sensitivity study the hypothetical weights ascribed to the drastic parameters are related to the effective weights which are a function of the single parameter value with regard to the remining six parameters considering their weight babiker et al 2005 ahmed et al 2015 the depth to groundwater and impact of vadose zone parameters are the most efficient inputs of the drastic model with the greatest weight of the of five equivalents to 28 97 followed by the impact of vadose zone 24 73 hydraulic conductivity 16 aquifer media 8 6 topography slope 5 5 and recharge potential 2 7 table 5 the present study directs a deviation in the actual weights compared to the hypothetical weights applied to the drastic model due to the high actual weights compared to the hypothetical weights the depth to groundwater 28 9 and impact to vadose zone 24 7 tend to be the most effective parameter the remaining parameters exhibited less actual weights than the theoretical weights one point here the revised weight to some of the low theoretical weight shows high value like aquifer media hydraulic conductivity this result directs the small augmentation in the extent of the reviewed vulnerability index therefore the actual weights were further applied to calculate the reviewed drastic vulnerability index with the following equation 7 r e v i s e d d v i 4 3 d r 4 8 r r 4 2 a r 1 8 s r 1 6 t r 4 6 i r 1 7 c r equation 7 shows the revised dvi exhibit 7 3 increase in the average vulnerability score when compared with dvi obtained using equation 1 4 4 pollution risk map numerous human activities and land usage forms have significant impacts on the groundwater vulnerability of most of the area especially the liwa area since its one of the most agricultural productive area in uae according to civita 1994 integrated vulnerability can be found by overlying an illustration of the actual pollution sources these causes of contamination are sectioned based on their contamination potential on the intrinsic vulnerability map babiker et al 2005 a land usage map with six land use categories fig 2 was realized using modis data these land use categories are given a unique rating based on their predicted role as a contamination input to the groundwater environment table 6 the urban waste disposal and quarry and mineral exploration land use categories were restricted in their geographical extends with only 0 22 0 06 and 0 14 respectively table 6 of the whole zone assigned a high rating the risk map is attained by joining the land usage data layer with the improved dvi which is calculated using the reviewed effective weights 8 r i s k m a p i n d e x r e v i s e d d v i l u r l u w where l u r l u w are the landuse ratings and weights respectively the reviewed dvi is the drastic vulnerability index found via the effective weights fig 13 the risk map or the integrated vulnerability map distinguished area is carrying pollution pressures the risk index is classified into categories fig 13 beginning from very low 131 150 low 151 170 medium 171 190 high 191 210 and very high 210 agricultural area the boundary overlap of the agronomic zones over the risk map reveals that these zones fall within high risk zones fig 14 the area extends from east to west in the northern part of liwa fall within the high risk area 5 conclusions and recommendations the evaluation of vulnerability index for the liwa area in uae was done using the geographic information system gis based drastic model depending upon the collective nature of the seven hydrogeological parameters the drastic vulnerability map classified the area into low medium high and very high vulnerability zones the results showed that the aquifer beneath the agriculture track line ew part is high to very high pollution vulnerable sensitivity analyses allowed the validation and evaluation of the consistency of analytical results the highest sensitivity index is observed upon elimination of the depth of groundwater 1 804 followed by the impact of vadose zone a risk map was also created and the area was classified into low medium and high the largest risk of groundwater pollution could be referred from the large mean rating of depth to groundwater mean 8 34 followed by topography slope mean rating 8 17 and it was also observed that the zones at the boundary overlap of the agronomic zones fall within high risk zones the presence of the impact of aquifer media soil media vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity imply moderate groundwater contamination while recharge potential indicates a low risk of aquifer pollution with an effective database in gis environment drastic is an effective tool for investigating the groundwater vulnerability the study suggests that this model can be used as a better tool for local authorities and policy makers who are responsible for groundwater management the groundwater contamination in vulnerable zones in the liwa area can be prevented by a implementing appropriate agriculture pesticides or chemical fertilizers b checking the disposal systems accompanying the human communities and industries in the eastern part of the study area c giving more attentiveness against pollution diminution to the areas where deep aquifers are outcropped regardless of their current vulnerability class and d regularly monitoring the groundwater quality especially at the areas with high vulnerability acknowledgement this project

12312,groundwater in pacific small island developing states is a critical source of freshwater for island ecosystems and human communities groundwater systems face challenges from growing populations climate change and climate variability many groundwater systems in the region have been inappropriately managed with increasing occurrences of groundwater pollution and saltwater intrusion this limits the availability of freshwater increases the likelihood of contracting water borne diseases and the cost of access to alternative freshwater sources in this paper we argue that groundwater systems are social ecological systems where anthropogenic activities and groundwater conditions are linked through dynamic non linear processes we also argue that groundwater management failures in the region are associated with traditional command and control approaches to management which ignore the systemic nature of coupled social and ecological groundwater systems and assumes that groundwater resources and the dependant human communities can be managed independently recognising the linkages and feedbacks between groundwater and dependant social communities is important for the long term sustainability of groundwater in these regions conceptual frameworks are useful tools to order phenomena and material revealing patterns and processes and enabling the joining of multiple areas of understanding into a single conceptual empirical structure we propose a framework to manage groundwater as a social ecological system the framework is comprised of three building blocks complex adaptive systems resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management we discuss how the application of the framework in the republic of nauru may alter decades of groundwater mismanagement and steer the resource towards a sustainable path graphical abstract image 1 keywords social ecological systems pacific small island developing states groundwater management resilience 1 introduction groundwater is a major freshwater resource providing drinking water to half of the world s population fao 2016 in the pacific region fig 1 groundwater is the only reliable source of freshwater for communities of small atoll islands igrac 2016 groundwater resources in pacific small island developing states psids are threatened by many anthropogenic activities pollution of groundwater originates from chemicals derived from agricultural practices solid waste disposal and industrial discharge biological pollution from solid waste disposal and sanitation systems and hydrocarbon leaks and spills dillon 1997 igrac 2016 the threat of groundwater contamination is high on several islands such as nauru bouchet et al 2014 tarawa lal 2014 kiritimati metutera et al 2002 funafuti and majuro igrac 2017a where groundwater has been deemed unsafe to drink without prior treatment proximity to the sea and the overuse of groundwater also increases the threat of saltwater intrusion in the pacific region this phenomena has long been observed ohrt 1947 momii et al 2005 and is exacerbated by sea level rise berthe et al 2014 ketabchi et al 2016 many pacific islands have seen an increase in saltwater intrusion from 2000 to 2010 igrac 2017a and a recent sea level rise impact study showed that saltwater intrusion into groundwater systems is likely to trigger relocation of communities long before the sea submerges coastal areas and islands storlazzi et al 2018 thus the groundwater systems of psids are an important but highly vulnerable resource for pacific island communities given the importance of groundwater for psids sustainable management of the resource is critical many psids have very limited governance structures for the management of groundwater or to monitor and assess management activities that protect groundwater resources from anthropogenic activities igrac 2016 a common argument to explain the lack of protection for groundwater resources is that many psids have limited financial technical and human capacity to do so duncan 2011 moglia et al 2008 unesco ihp 2015 white and falkland 2010 however this cannot be the sole justification for management lapses because there is ongoing commitment of donors to financial and technical assistance in the region an estimated aud 1 7 billion was available for groundwater management activities in 2016 1 1 total net receipt from official development assistance oda to oceania countries oecd 2018 the limited progress toward sustainable groundwater management in psids may be linked to traditional command and control management approaches that pervade groundwater management command and control is a type of management characterised by centralised top down control and technocratic approaches cox 2016 holling and meffe 1996 where the resource and community expectations are managed separately the management approach to groundwater in psids is symptomatic of the command and control approach there is a central authority responsible for groundwater management but it has limited in house technical personnel the authority is thus strongly tied to regional agencies and donors who offer technical assistance through consulting experts bouchet et al 2014 experts may have professional motivations in proposing certain interventions over others technical fixes institutional and technological are often led by consulting experts through short term donor projects clarke et al 2014 solutions are often based on the replication of measures efficient in other groundwater systems or on the assumption that groundwater systems are generally simple to conceptualise with clear boundaries and linear cause to effect relationships the community may be involved in donor projects but participation is often limited by the short time frame of most donor projects clarke et al 2014 command and control approaches to the management of groundwater resources in psids technical solutions are often not well fitted to the local context for example the development of national water policies to regulate water sectors including the protection of groundwater resources did not obtain social consensus over groundwater ownership and has led to inaction in many psids bouchet et al 2014 subsequently most psids have limited if any legislation in place to manage groundwater resources and regulations that do exist are often poorly enforced bouchet et al 2014 solutions also do not address the root causes of issues and instead treat the symptoms for example many short term donor projects seek to improve infrastructures through small scale projects without sufficient time commitment and community leadership to ensure a lasting acceptance this leads to rejection and non sustainable investments clarke et al 2014 perpetuating inadequate management practices and further system degradation in 2016 after decades of donor support for the water sector in the region many psids have failed to make sustainable progress toward regional and international goals belmar et al 2016 or the establishment of groundwater monitoring igrac 2016 groundwater systems in psids are social ecological systems ses in which human communities aquifers and dependant ecosystems are linked groundwater in psids provides a range of ecosystem services including the supply of freshwater and the support of groundwater dependant ecosystems keener et al 2012 johannes 1980 anthropogenic activities effect groundwater aquifers through extraction land use and pollution which in turn influence natural recharge processes and groundwater quality aquifers groundwater dependant ecosystems gdes and human communities interact through dynamic non linear relationships and open boundaries comte et al 2015 pokhrel et al 2015 these interactions contribute to a dynamic ses where change in one system component e g groundwater extraction rate does not necessarily lead to a change of similar magnitude in a connected component e g saltwater intrusion the openness of the groundwater ses allows driving forces at multiple scales e g rainfall climate global economy extraction rates to influence groundwater systems within the groundwater system human communities have the greatest influence on groundwater quality and availability in psids human interaction with the resource is governed by formal and informal mechanisms at many levels i e dwelling community island state and international levels consequently the social and ecological components of groundwater as a ses cannot be studied in isolation rather understanding groundwater as a ses requires holistic approaches that use principles of sustainability and which view humans as part of the groundwater system not as external drivers to the system thoms et al 2018 socio hydrology has been proposed as an approach to identify and predict the dynamic features of coupled human water systems sivapalan et al 2012 socio hydrogeology has developed alongside socio hydrology and emphasises the importance of knowledge exchange networked stakeholder engagement interdisciplinarity and effective communication in sustainable groundwater management re 2015 hynds et al 2018 socio hydrogeology situates hydrogeologists as facilitators of knowledge exchange proposing that hydrogeologists are leaders via advocation mediation translation and promotion of best practice they are in a unique position to advocate for appropriate groundwater management and protection promote and develop experience at the local catchment scale into regional or national management strategy and assist in translating between the ideal science and the achievable practise hynds et al 2018 p 10 resilience thinking is an alternative perspective to the conceptualisation of human groundwater interactions resilience thinking proposes that humans are embedded within ecosystems and feedbacks within a ses generate system dynamics at multiple scales folke et al 2010 resilience thinking assumes that ses behave as complex adaptive systems with the capacity to learn and adapt to changing conditions that may occur gradually or in response to a shock folke et al 2010 resilience is the capacity of the ses to absorb shocks and to persist to sustain ecosystem services and human well being walker et al 2004 while socio hydrogeology and resilience thinking both stress the importance of stakeholder engagement in resource management this paper explores the sustainable management of groundwater using a framework situated in resilience thinking specifically it explores groundwater as a social ecological system and develops a framework for managing groundwater using the tenets of resilience thinking including complex adaptive systems resilience thresholds and adaptive co management there is a disconnect between the value of groundwater and the management of groundwater in psids while there is a need to better integrate social and ecological systems for sustainable use of groundwater the resilience related concept of ses has not been applied to groundwater systems conceptual frameworks are useful tools to detail new research approaches as they provide a logical structure to assist the integration of various disciplines and associated concepts conceptual frameworks are commonly used in interdisciplinary research delong and thoms 2016 dollar et al 2007 they are useful tools for integrating different disciplines and are used widely as a means to organise ideas understand systems link cause and effect and guide decisions about system management parsons et al 2009 a framework for managing groundwater as a social ecological system in psids is developed in this manuscript the framework is centred on three building blocks 1 a complex adaptive systems approach to viewing groundwater what are the characteristics of a groundwater system as an ses 2 sustainability and resilience thinking why is considering groundwater systems as ses necessary to sustainably manage the resource 3 strategic adaptive management how can a groundwater ses be managed to improve and or retain its sustainability 2 framework components the framework for groundwater as an ses is organised using three building blocks complex adaptive systems resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management fig 2 the first building block addresses the characteristics of groundwater systems from a social ecological perspective systems thinking is used as the overarching scientific premise because it allows an understanding of the properties that explain the behaviour of groundwater as a complex adaptive system the second building block addresses the sustainability of groundwater resilience thinking is used as a philosophical lens to understand the dynamics of complex systems that allow them to absorb disturbances maintain function and persist which is a prerequisite for sustainability fazey 2010 walker et al 2004 walker and salt 2006 the third building block addresses the management of groundwater as a ses strategic adaptive management sam is used because it allows the management of groundwater as a ses using principles of resilience and systems thinking sam provides an approach to groundwater management that focuses on learning adaptation and experimentation this is important in contexts where knowledge of the resource is limited and conflict over the management of the resource is high roux and foxcroft 2011 williams and brown 2016 2 1 complex adaptive systems 2 1 1 properties of complex adaptive systems a complex adaptive system cas is one that involves many interacting components that adapt or learn as they interact holland 2006 the dynamic and adaptive nature of a cas is of central importance and the study of cas generally focuses on how systems change their structure and function in response to external or internal pressure and interactions between system components chan 2001 the dynamics of cas is governed by fundamental properties including self organisation long and short term interactions non linear dynamics and feedbacks path dependency openness and emergence cilliers and spurrett 1999 three of these properties are of major importance to the framework for managing groundwater as a ses self organisation non linear dynamics and feedbacks and system openness self organisation refers to the ability of complex systems to create a form of order where components interact following tacit rules without the presence of a central or external control mahmud 2009 complex adaptive systems are adaptive because they have the capacity to re organise themselves at critical points of instability to absorb disturbances and return to a stable state levin 1998 a stable state is thus created by a cas through self organisation system functions also depend on self organisation and under pressure a system might lose gain or change function to accommodate new persistent conditions complex adaptive systems are generally sensitive to a small subset of variables whose changes can trigger system re organisation anderson 1999 the self organisation of cas occurs through mechanisms of non linear dynamics and feedbacks because of non linear dynamics a change in one system variable does not always produce an outcome that is proportional to that change rickles et al 2007 thus cas cannot be studied as the combination of their individual parts and cas also have limited predictably cilliers and spurrett 1999 feedback mechanisms explain the non linear dynamics through which cas self organise a part of a system receives feedback when the way its neighbours interact with it at a later time depends on how it interacts with them at an earlier time ladyman et al 2013 feedbacks are of two main types reinforcing positive and balancing negative balancing feedbacks are an important tacit rule within cas that help maintain the system in a stable domain mitleton kelly 2003 conversely reinforcing feedbacks can lead to drastic change in the system and re organisation until a new stable state is reached with a set of balancing feedbacks openness refers to the degree of connectivity of a system with other systems at larger scales as open systems cas are defined at various temporal spatial and organisational scales redman et al 2004 to study a complex system spatial temporal and organisational boundaries must be set to acknowledge exogenous components and processes that are outside the defined system but which may influence the flows of materials and information into and out of the system walker et al 2012 these drivers set conditions for internal variables influencing system processes virapongse et al 2016 walker et al 2012 unlike components within the system drivers are not affected by variables within the system 2 1 2 groundwater systems as complex adaptive systems groundwater systems have characteristics reflective of complex adaptive systems they are dynamic and adaptive systems that comprise of 3 sub cas the aquifer the natural environment which include gdes and the island communities that lives above aquifers fig 3 the main function of the groundwater system is the delivery of ecosystem services such as the storage and provision of freshwater the sustaining of gdes also vital to local communities and the mitigation of droughts griebler and avramov 2014 the groundwater system may change its structure i e the nature of the interactions within the system which may affect its function under pressure from within the system or from human or environmental drivers in groundwater systems self organisation can occur within each of the three subsystems and effect the system as whole for example in the island natural environment spatial self organisation can be observed from vegetation exposed to climate disturbances under sufficient disturbance vegetation may reorganise spatially to best thrive with changing conditions vincenot et al 2016 the change in vegetation distribution may affect the island communities who rely on its abundance for uses such as food medicine and building material and the aquifer when water balance is affected by the change in evapotranspiration within the island community self organisation may refer to the ability of local communities to organise the management of shared groundwater resources without any formal control by state and local institutions self organisation and self regulation of groundwater resources is prevalent in the psids as groundwater resources are mostly privately owned traditionally attached to land titles white and falkland 2011 self organisation is often triggered as a response to disturbances that affect system function for example in 1998 on majuro atoll an increase in groundwater abstraction from public utilities led to saltwater intrusion in the island s aquifer the increase in salinity was of concern to the local community that lives above the aquifer and relied almost exclusively on it for their water needs in response to concerns over long term damage to the aquifer and loss of ecosystem services for their community they requested the government stop pumping water from the aquifer which they obliged bouchet 2014 self organisation is a lever that helped the community absorb disturbance and return to a stable state without losing system function this example also illustrates how a change in only one variable i e aquifer salinity can affect an entire system self organisation of groundwater systems is led by nonlinear dynamics and feedback mechanisms self organisation of vegetation for example may be due to a balancing feedback mechanism with seawater intrusion this feedback was observed by comte et al 2015 in a small coral atoll and revealed that an increase in seawater intrusion causes a decrease in vegetation because many species cannot survive in highly saline conditions the decrease in vegetation then facilitates an increase in aquifer recharge which reduces aquifer salinity self organisation of human communities may be triggered by a reinforcing feedback between seawater intrusion and pumping this feedback is widely acknowledged e g sherif and singh 2002 kura et al 2014 and was observed by paniconi et al 2001 in the coastal aquifer of eastern cap bon tunisia where under certain pumping conditions seawater intrusion occurs at a faster rate than it takes for the groundwater table to drop and release water the more seawater that is drawn to the well the less freshwater can enter the well increasing seawater intrusion this feedback which creates a steady increase in salinity forces human communities to reduce or stop pumping to keep groundwater salinity within an acceptable range that maximises its use the presence of these feedbacks shows the importance of nonlinear dynamics and feedbacks between groundwater gdes and human activities groundwater systems cannot be studied as the combination of their subsystems because it would ignore these important feedbacks openness and scale are important properties of groundwater systems the groundwater system should not be bounded at the aquifer level because social and ecological parameters extend well beyond the aquifer physical boundaries these social and ecological parameters and processes connected at various scales can have important impacts on the fluxes of materials into and out of the groundwater system re 2015 tringali et al 2017 hynds et al 2018 when identifying the appropriate scale to study the system it is crucial to include components that affect and are affected by the groundwater and to acknowledge that human communities interact in a dynamic nonlinear two way relationship with the groundwater system drivers in psids groundwater systems are exogenous forces such as rainfall and sea level and may include human forces at higher scales such as political instability and gross domestic product fig 3 thus the openness of groundwater systems is defined by the processes and feedbacks in the system particularly between communities and the groundwater resource 2 2 resilience thinking 2 2 1 properties of resilience thinking resilience thinking offers a framework to study the dynamics of complex systems in the face of change originating in the field of ecological science in the 1970s resilience thinking has evolved to a transdisciplinary science with wide application ecological resilience was first defined by holling 1973 as the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem can withstand without changing self organized processes and structures ecological resilience considers ecosystems as complex systems with multiple stable states studying ecological resilience thus focuses on maintaining existence of function in ecological systems schulze 1996 four components of resilience thinking are of relevance to psids groundwater systems basins of attraction and tipping points ecosystem services and the potential loss that might occur between two stable states the adaptability and transformability of the system and the prerequisite of resilience for sustainability understanding the disturbance that a system can absorb before it reaches a tipping point and moves into a new basin of attraction is the main objective of resilience studies carpenter et al 2001 a complex system is constantly changing i e the variables characterising its structure and function are changing but the structure of the system i e key variables and processes that support function tend to remain within the same basin of attraction fig 4 supported by balancing feedbacks walker et al 2004 complex systems are generally controlled by a small number 4 6 of variables walker et al 2012 these key variables are also called slow variables because they tend to change slowly over time walker et al 2012 a disturbance of sufficient magnitude may push the system across a tipping point into a new basin of attraction in which the system no longer has the same structure function and feedbacks fig 4 one area of resilience thinking called specified resilience focuses on identifying tipping points for slow variables carpenter et al 2001 understanding for which value or range of value in its slow variables a system is likely to move into a new basin of attraction allows human communities to better safeguard the provision of ecosystem services by a ses ecosystem services represent the services that human communities receive from their natural environment daily et al 1997 slow variables in coupled social ecological systems are often associated with the delivery of ecosystem services although the type and level of services are inherently limited by the natural setting and resources that make up the ecosystem the desired level of service and the value that society places on an ecosystem is subjective therefore tipping points for slow variables in social ecological systems may be subjective and hard to define carpenter et al 2001 resilient systems are able to self organise in the face of disturbance to maintain a sufficient level of ecosystem services and thus avoid crossing a tipping point into a new basin of attraction identifying tipping points is challenging but can provide great insight into a system behaviour and delineate operational boundaries tipping points exist when two relatively close values for a slow variable lead to two different system states with distinctively different function and ecosystem services i e state 1 and state 4 fig 4 system states are of limited reversibility and exhibit significant self organisation noticeable through new balancing feedbacks milkoreit et al 2018 thus ecosystem services on each side of a tipping point must show lasting differences characteristic of different basin of attraction i e intermittent loss in ecosystem services due to disturbance are not necessarily service losses adaptability and transformability are also important elements of resilience thinking because these represent the capacity of human communities to shape variability and change in the state of the system folke 2016 adaptability is the capacity to maintain or improve the functions of a system in the face of change gallopín 2006 while transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when the current system cannot be modified to maintain system function walker et al 2004 transformation can occur autonomously e g natural selection intentionally e g human intervention or externally e g forced by drivers outside the system o connell et al 2015 both adaptation and transformation can be seen as levers that humans can use to modify the system s resilience and avoid undesirable regime shifts folke 2016 understanding system dynamics is a necessary condition for sustainability of natural resources perrings 2006 sustainability can be defined as the degree to which the system maintains levels of service in the long term whilst maximising social economic and environmental goals ward and butler 2016 sustainability of a social ecological system is thus the ability to maintain ecosystem services for future generations while fulfilling society s social ambitions non sustainable systems are not always obvious because of the non linearity that characterises complex systems a complex system may appear sustainable until sudden and or unpredicted change occurs and results in the loss of ecosystem services a prerequisite for sustainability is thus the ability to withstand changes without losing ecosystem services derissen et al 2009 2 2 2 resilience thinking and the sustainable management of groundwater understanding the disturbance that a groundwater system can absorb before it crosses a tipping point leading to ecosystem service loss is important for the sustainability of groundwater systems sustaining existing ecosystem services or restoring previous services provided by groundwater systems is a priority in psids as the impact of highly degraded systems such as found in nauru and funafuti is high for local communities bouchet and sinclair 2010 duncan 2011 nakada et al 2012 degraded groundwater systems pose threats to community health during drought periods when freshwater is limited and groundwater use increases sinclair et al 2012 emont 2015 communities may require replacement technologies e g desalination that are expensive and complex to maintain and run and which pose additional environmental threats e g brine discharge that affect the health of gdes and their ability to provide food to local communities younos 2005 to sustain or restore ecosystem services requires an understanding of system resilience and how change in slow variables will push the system from one regime to another folke 2016 groundwater systems in the psids provide many ecosystem services freshwater lenses provide island communities with drinking water table 1 a however the freshwater lens might be inconsistent and groundwater quality highly variable from fresh to brackish table 1b in this state water can be used for most activities except drinking water when groundwater quality is very low it has high salinity and is also likely to be highly polluted table 1c in this state it is mainly used for flushing toilets highly contaminated groundwater prohibits all use table 1d as complex system each state in a groundwater system is maintained by key hydrogeological social and environmental processes these processes maintain system function by keeping slow variables within an operational range table 1 although each state is characterised by different slow variables four main categories of slow variables are associated with changes in the provision of ecosystem services under different states groundwater quantity e g aquifer volume aquifer geometry groundwater salinity groundwater demand e g percentage of total water use volume per capita per day and groundwater quality associated with land use e g vegetation type and density point source pollutants maintaining the supply of ecosystem services from groundwater needs to be cognizant of how quantity quality salinity and demand variables can push a system into a new basin of attraction a shift may occur if a slow variable crosses a tipping point permanently changing the type of ecosystem services provided by the system walker et al 2004 for example climate drivers such as repeated droughts or storm surges can increase salinity levels in aquifers white et al 2007 if they occur regularly enough they can change the average salinity storlazzi et al 2018 when a previously fresh aquifer becomes predominantly brackish it can no longer be a reliable source of freshwater this illustrates a regime shift from a to b table 1 this regime shift may also occur if the shallow aquifer is significantly disturbed such as occurred in funafuti following major land reclamation and borrow pits during the second world war duncan 2011 nakada et al 2012 inversely an increase in average precipitation of sufficient magnitude can increase groundwater recharge and produce the opposite regime shift tipping points are difficult to measure because they are dependent on how human communities and gdes respond to change folke 2016 some systems will have greater tolerance to salinity increase the tipping point for salinity is thus dependant on a social regime shift where groundwater demand is significantly affected and triggers system re organisation a social regime shift occurring without an ecological regime shift may also be sufficient to push the system into a new state for example the increasing reliance of a growing population on groundwater can increase aquifer salinity to a point where communities have to re organise and find additional water sources at least for drinking the ecological state change is in theory reversible and maintained only by human pressure however when a groundwater resource becomes largely abandoned for drinking it can trigger reinforcing feedbacks from behaviours that may increase pollution and further degrade the resource the further the resource is degraded the less it can provide services the less it is valued and the less likely it is for ecosystem services to ever be restored the adaptive capacity of groundwater systems can help prevent or facilitate state change from the social perspective adaptive capacity refers to the capacity of island communities to self organise and respond to change in groundwater quality by altering their behaviour adaptation can also be driven by institutions through regulatory or technical responses adaptive responses may target groundwater use land use wastewater disposal and pollution when adaptation is not feasible often due to a new ecological regime transformation might be required from the social system to find another way to access water in psids this is often through a mix of rainwater and desalination technology falkland 1999 moglia et al 2008 white and falkland 2012 adaptation is often a preferred option since transformation may require the deployment of new technology such as desalination units which are expensive and complex to run and maintain scholes 2012 2 3 strategic adaptive management 2 3 1 properties of strategic adaptive management adaptive management approaches account for uncertainty in a complex system by trialling management options designed to gain insight about system dynamics and improve its management curtin and parker 2014 adaptive management may reveal key feedbacks self organisation patterns openness and tipping points by increasing knowledge of the system adaptive management approaches can help increase adaptive capacity and sustainability of complex systems strategic adaptive management sam is a form of adaptive management that has been developed and implemented in south african national parks roux and foxcroft 2011 a notable difference that sets sam apart from other adaptive management approaches is its strategic component it helps foster action and organise management activities notably through the use of an objectives hierarchy and thresholds of potential concern meffe 2002 rogers and biggs 1999 it also allows the development of flexible structures to integrate various type of knowledge including cultural social technical and institutional rogers et al 2000 strategic adaptive management is thus a process designed to be adaptive participatory and strategic roux and foxcroft 2011 by investigating system desirability conducting experimental management practices that are aimed at steering the system toward its desired state and systematically reviewing and learning from management practices three components of sam are of interest for this framework the objectives hierarchy tpcs and learning by doing 2 3 2 components of sam the objectives hierarchy within sam is the mechanism to formulate goals in a hierarchical order and to set measurable targets for system management the objectives hierarchy enables managers to develop activities for tangible smaller objectives while working toward a better understanding and eventually management of the higher order objective kingsford and biggs 2012 in doing so it allows managers to initiate management measures when knowledge of the system is limited the objectives hierarchy is part of the strategic aspect of sam and along with social inclusion it helps foster participatory action and facilitate learning thresholds of potential concern tpcs are operational targets for monitoring progress toward management objectives allen et al 2011 because tipping points are dynamic and hard to define in complex sess tpcs can be used to monitor slow variables that potentially lead to loss of ecosystem services tpcs may also be used with other variables known to have a potential leverage on the system since thresholds are dynamic and may be desirable or undesirable they must be reviewed regularly as part of the evaluation and learning process of sam biggs et al 2011 learning by doing is an important tenet of adaptive management approaches and learning is embedded within sam depending on the system boundaries learning may be mainly about the ecological system i e reducing ecological uncertainty but may also be about the social system i e what social and institutional structures are the most efficient to sustainably manage the resource in targeting small experiments to get a better understanding of the system sam and am approaches in general offer an alternative to passive adaptive and deferred action management style walters and hilborn 1978 in deferred action management management actions and practices are put on hold in favour of studies the idea is that the system cannot be managed until it is fully understood because of the complexity and dynamic nature of natural resource systems there might never be sufficient data and the absence of management practices is likely to incur more degradation in a passive adaptive approach management practices are developed based on local studies and experiences from similar systems with the aim to be refined as more studies are conducted however in application practices are rarely reviewed walters and hilborn 1978 furthermore the focus is on a steady state of the system with objectives based on optimistic predictions and a tendency to not question initial assumptions often on the basis of their validity in other contexts walters and hilborn 1978 2 3 3 managing groundwater using strategic adaptive management a strategic adaptive management approach can help address two key issues for groundwater management in the region that are characteristic of command and control management style the hegemony of foreign technical experts to design and control the implementation of management activities dornan and pryke 2017 and the mechanistic approach to groundwater management first there is a high reliance on foreign technical experts in the psids as many countries have limited financial and skilled human resources donor agencies and partners fill this gap by providing technical expertise and funding often through the implementation of short term projects although expert advice is needed in specific areas such as hydrogeology white and falkland 2011 many aspects of project design and implementation are controlled by technical experts through short term projects 5 years this limits community involvement necessary for project sustainability keppel et al 2012 upadhyay 2005 and hinders behavioural and socio economical changes which demand longer commitment keppel et al 2012 a post project review by clarke et al 2014 to assess the lasting impact of 27 community development projects for the water and sanitation sector in psids found that only 1 out of 27 projects have had lasting benefit to the targeted communities and could thus be deemed sustainable secondly the mechanistic approach to groundwater management fails to acknowledge groundwater systems as ses and thus to understand the importance of community self organisation for the management of the resource the nonlinear dynamic between groundwater island communities and the natural environment and the openness of the system it fails to acknowledge that groundwater systems can exist in different stable states with fundamental differences in their ability to provide ecosystem services to island communities consequently the design of management options is often technical addresses causes not roots of issues and is not well fitted to local contexts groundwater systems are also at risk of crossing a tipping point where groundwater cannot provide the same level of services and communities must rely on expensive technological solutions further perpetuating technocratic governance the sam process for groundwater in psids aims to generate long term commitment for groundwater management where island communities governments and other stakeholders co generate management initiatives based on their knowledge and shared vision it is a 5 step process that focuses on the improvement of existing management structures and leadership roles governance and groundwater management fig 5 management structures in psids are unique to each setting but share key characteristics such as important informal governance and management structures and ill defined formal hierarchies of governance belmar et al 2016 defining the desirable states for the groundwater system is a participatory process that would involve a wide range of stakeholders to develop a vision objectives and the objectives hierarchy safeguarding or increasing ecosystem services might be prioritised as a first order objective followed by the improvement of management structures and activities social inclusion is key in this process to enable consensus over system desirability and derive lower scale objectives that are realistic and that drive stakeholders blended interests generating interest from diverse stakeholders at the onset of the initiative is important to foster long term commitment in psids keen 2003 cvitanovic et al 2016 and other contexts re 2015 hynds et al 2018 for example integrating donors research agendas i e research objectives that are interesting to donors or linking objectives with other sectors is likely important for many stakeholders an objectives hierarchy supported by a strong social network is also important to avoid setback due to political instability next tpcs are defined to provide long term monitoring targets for the slow variables in the groundwater system and additional variables associated with critical system processes these should include tpcs to measure sustainability not only of management activities but of institutional structures leadership partnership and engagement this is key for groundwater sustainability not only in psids but for groundwater systems globally it may also include variables associated with key characteristics of the social system structure for groundwater management that could reveal a changing behaviour toward groundwater and land use key characteristics of the gdes structure and self organisation patterns and key biophysical characteristics e g rainfall intensity and frequency although qualitative tpcs may be relevant at all levels e g the consumption of groundwater for drinking is purely based on taste not on tds measurements sound scientific data is required to best support management activities white and falkland 2011 dixon jain et al 2014 igrac 2016 the design and implementation of management experiments will refine tpcs as managers and social structures alike increase the knowledge of the system as a third step management options are assessed partners might be involved at that stage to provide financial and technical support conceptual analytical and numerical models might be used to predict outcomes and test acceptability in step 4 management activities are implemented alongside a monitoring system which uses tpcs as the mechanism to assess the state of the system and its relationship to the goals set in the objectives hierarchy the final step is dedicated to learning through evaluation of management measures and information to stakeholders mcloughlin and thoms 2015 increasing co developing and sharing knowledge within the groundwater ses is key to improve the system s adaptive capacity the sam approach for groundwater in psids fosters eco hydrogeological technical and institutional learning eco hydrogeological learning is much needed in the psids as uncertainties are high for example knowledge of the response of freshwater lenses to sea level rise seawater movement and environmental pressures is still limited dixon jain et al 2014 unesco ihp 2015 white and falkland 2011 white and falkland 2011 also argues that because groundwater systems in the region are so vulnerable improving knowledge of these systems is a key to their sustainable management technical learning is needed to assess the relevance of technical solutions in various hydrogeological socio cultural and economic contexts finally institutional learning provides opportunities to strengthen governance structures and adaptive capacity by understanding and incorporating informal structures nested leadership and processes that have the power to generate positive changes in the systems 3 case study groundwater as a ses in nauru the framework developed in this manuscript provides a road map to manage groundwater as a social ecological system using complex adaptive systems resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management the framework situates groundwater sustainability as a series of dynamic feedbacks between the social and ecological components of groundwater systems placing humans as part of the groundwater system rather than external drivers management of groundwater systems takes a shared approach with solutions co generated among multiple societal scientific and institutional stakeholders using the structured learning by doing approach of sam in this section we briefly discuss how the framework could be applied to visualise a ses approach to groundwater sustainability in nauru one of the psids it is not the intent to describe in detail the nauru ses rather we show how the three elements of the framework correspond to groundwater systems in nauru and how application of the framework elements could potentially enhance groundwater sustainability the pacific island of nauru is a 22 km2 independent island nation of 10 000 people in the central pacific region fig 1 where groundwater is a key freshwater water source bouchet and sinclair 2010 freshwater is primarily found in the coarse alluvium aquifer along the island coastline fig 6 the aquifer is small and thin and salinity levels vary throughout the year from fresh to brackish depending on rainfall and extraction only a small area in the northeast of the island contains a permanent freshwater lens alberti et al 2017 groundwater is used in conjunction with rainwater and desalinated water around half of the island s population has direct access to groundwater through privately owned wells and households with reticulated access to groundwater tend to use it for up to 83 of their water needs bouchet and sinclair 2010 reliance on groundwater varies from about 25 to more than 50 of total water use depending on the availability of rainwater bouchet and sinclair 2010 bouchet 2011 groundwater is thus a vital source of water for nauru and its use has been steadily increasing in the past 50 years bouchet and sinclair 2010 groundwater quality on nauru has been gradually declining despite ongoing commitment from government and donor partners to improve groundwater management there is widespread faecal contamination from poorly designed sanitation systems point source contamination such as hydrocarbons and high variability in salinity levels bouchet and sinclair 2010 high levels of pollution restrict human use of groundwater and poor groundwater quality can pose serious health risks to the community notably for infants who are at high risk from waterborne diseases bouchet and sinclair 2010 efforts by governments and donor partners to improve the management of groundwater have focused on technical solutions and top down regulation hydrogeological investigations have focused on finding contamination free groundwater for extraction jacobson and hill 1988 jacobson 1997 castelletti et al 2012 alberti et al 2017 the lack of success in this area resulted in termination of groundwater research and groundwater monitoring in 2014 donor projects have also started trialling sanitation technologies e g compost toilets dual chamber septic tanks for private households however after eight years only a dozen of these have been installed and there is no ongoing monitoring of their efficiency groundwater management and protection measures i e identification and remediation of groundwater pollution development of sustainable yields pumping regulation were included as part of the water policy developed in 2012 ron 2011 but it has yet to lead to any legislation or management protection procedures very little has been achieved on the ground and groundwater quality is still degrading failure to manage and protect groundwater is linked to the state centred top down command and control management style which prevails in nauru the command and control approach to regulation through the inclusion of groundwater protection measures in the water and sanitation policy is not compatible with local practices such as customary land and groundwater ownership land ownership is of high importance in nauru and the state does not interfere with private lands governments are thus reticent to introduce any bill or measure that will impose regulations on private land and even though policy documents might be developed they are unlikely to be implemented second command and control management is perpetuating a mechanistic approach to groundwater studies this has led groundwater activities to be divided between hydrogeological investigations small scale sanitation technology trials and policy development with little coordination or common shared vision between activities most activities are led by donors who have limited leverage to make sustainable change at institutional levels and limited time and budget to implement sustainable management activities the groundwater system of nauru as a ses comprises human actors that rely on the resource for daily water supply drought relief and gdes this complex system is affected by drivers at higher scales such as environmental changes brought by climate change change in water quality due to anthropogenic activities has impacted local communities to the point where groundwater is called brackish water and regarded as a dirty source of water bouchet 2011 even though it is widely used low groundwater quality has created a reinforcing feedback where groundwater is poorly valued and whose protection is of low priority although the need to manage groundwater in a holistic way has been recognised in nauru for more than a decade sopac 2007 there has not been any significant improvement in either the management structure legal framework for groundwater management or groundwater quality and availability to date bouchet et al 2014 there is a need to move away from command and control approaches both at institutional level where a new form of collaborative multidisciplinary and participative form of governance is needed and at the groundwater level where solutions that recognise the complex adaptive dynamic of groundwater system should be developed implementing the framework in nauru would operationalise the three building blocks of the framework complex adaptive systems resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management for the complex adaptive systems building block a system conceptualisation would be derived to investigate how nauruan ecosystems respond to changes in groundwater quality and the feedback that it has on the aquifer and the system slow variables combined with existing hydrogeological knowledge and numerical models the system conceptualisation will allow understanding how the aquifer including areas of potential future development respond to combinations of various rates and methods of extraction rainfall and temperature regimes sea level rise and land use changes and surface activities for the resilience thinking building block a resilience analysis would investigate the magnitude of disturbance that slow variables can absorb before the ses reorganises and ecosystem service provision changes it will allow developing dynamic sustainable yields of extraction and context specific design for wells and on site sanitation systems with a significant increase in average rainfall forecast for years to come the brackish aquifer could experience an ecological shift from brackish to fresh understanding social tpcs for the use of groundwater will allow for both sustainable management of the groundwater resources and informed future water management planning for the sam building block a sam approach would be designed to allow improved management structures for groundwater resources the identification and implementation of important objectives and the identification and implementation of effective technological ecological and social management measures the management structures will be based on a long term shared vision between groundwater users community groups government institutions and with the long term support of donor partners and external supporting organisations hierarchical objectives will be informed by the resilience analysis and decided through the management structures effective management measures based on sam objectives tpcs and dynamic sustainable yield will be trailed tested and refined to best support their intent sam will enable the management of the resource based on ses desirability and the conservation of ecosystem services a well designed sam approach will increase the system s adaptive capacity and the ability of groundwater ses to absorb and adapt to current and future pressures managing groundwater as a ses requires a paradigm shift in the way groundwater is conceptualised studied and managed this involves a shift away from the command and control paradigm towards multidisciplinary and participative governance in the psids future climate and social changes will bring high uncertainty in the availability and quality of groundwater in nauru although groundwater could become fresher drought may be more extreme in order to take advantage of potential positive change brought by climate change and be resilient to negative changes and extreme events psids communities must be adaptive and recognise the complex adaptive nature of groundwater systems in this paper we have detailed a framework to conceptualise study and manage groundwater as ses it offers a new approach to manage groundwater systems under high environmental and social uncertainty although this framework was developed for the psids with a special focus on the limited resources and institutional challenges that these countries faces it may also prove relevant to other contexts where groundwater is vital and environmental and social uncertainty is high declarations of interest none acknowledgements lb was financially supported through an australian government

12312,groundwater in pacific small island developing states is a critical source of freshwater for island ecosystems and human communities groundwater systems face challenges from growing populations climate change and climate variability many groundwater systems in the region have been inappropriately managed with increasing occurrences of groundwater pollution and saltwater intrusion this limits the availability of freshwater increases the likelihood of contracting water borne diseases and the cost of access to alternative freshwater sources in this paper we argue that groundwater systems are social ecological systems where anthropogenic activities and groundwater conditions are linked through dynamic non linear processes we also argue that groundwater management failures in the region are associated with traditional command and control approaches to management which ignore the systemic nature of coupled social and ecological groundwater systems and assumes that groundwater resources and the dependant human communities can be managed independently recognising the linkages and feedbacks between groundwater and dependant social communities is important for the long term sustainability of groundwater in these regions conceptual frameworks are useful tools to order phenomena and material revealing patterns and processes and enabling the joining of multiple areas of understanding into a single conceptual empirical structure we propose a framework to manage groundwater as a social ecological system the framework is comprised of three building blocks complex adaptive systems resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management we discuss how the application of the framework in the republic of nauru may alter decades of groundwater mismanagement and steer the resource towards a sustainable path graphical abstract image 1 keywords social ecological systems pacific small island developing states groundwater management resilience 1 introduction groundwater is a major freshwater resource providing drinking water to half of the world s population fao 2016 in the pacific region fig 1 groundwater is the only reliable source of freshwater for communities of small atoll islands igrac 2016 groundwater resources in pacific small island developing states psids are threatened by many anthropogenic activities pollution of groundwater originates from chemicals derived from agricultural practices solid waste disposal and industrial discharge biological pollution from solid waste disposal and sanitation systems and hydrocarbon leaks and spills dillon 1997 igrac 2016 the threat of groundwater contamination is high on several islands such as nauru bouchet et al 2014 tarawa lal 2014 kiritimati metutera et al 2002 funafuti and majuro igrac 2017a where groundwater has been deemed unsafe to drink without prior treatment proximity to the sea and the overuse of groundwater also increases the threat of saltwater intrusion in the pacific region this phenomena has long been observed ohrt 1947 momii et al 2005 and is exacerbated by sea level rise berthe et al 2014 ketabchi et al 2016 many pacific islands have seen an increase in saltwater intrusion from 2000 to 2010 igrac 2017a and a recent sea level rise impact study showed that saltwater intrusion into groundwater systems is likely to trigger relocation of communities long before the sea submerges coastal areas and islands storlazzi et al 2018 thus the groundwater systems of psids are an important but highly vulnerable resource for pacific island communities given the importance of groundwater for psids sustainable management of the resource is critical many psids have very limited governance structures for the management of groundwater or to monitor and assess management activities that protect groundwater resources from anthropogenic activities igrac 2016 a common argument to explain the lack of protection for groundwater resources is that many psids have limited financial technical and human capacity to do so duncan 2011 moglia et al 2008 unesco ihp 2015 white and falkland 2010 however this cannot be the sole justification for management lapses because there is ongoing commitment of donors to financial and technical assistance in the region an estimated aud 1 7 billion was available for groundwater management activities in 2016 1 1 total net receipt from official development assistance oda to oceania countries oecd 2018 the limited progress toward sustainable groundwater management in psids may be linked to traditional command and control management approaches that pervade groundwater management command and control is a type of management characterised by centralised top down control and technocratic approaches cox 2016 holling and meffe 1996 where the resource and community expectations are managed separately the management approach to groundwater in psids is symptomatic of the command and control approach there is a central authority responsible for groundwater management but it has limited in house technical personnel the authority is thus strongly tied to regional agencies and donors who offer technical assistance through consulting experts bouchet et al 2014 experts may have professional motivations in proposing certain interventions over others technical fixes institutional and technological are often led by consulting experts through short term donor projects clarke et al 2014 solutions are often based on the replication of measures efficient in other groundwater systems or on the assumption that groundwater systems are generally simple to conceptualise with clear boundaries and linear cause to effect relationships the community may be involved in donor projects but participation is often limited by the short time frame of most donor projects clarke et al 2014 command and control approaches to the management of groundwater resources in psids technical solutions are often not well fitted to the local context for example the development of national water policies to regulate water sectors including the protection of groundwater resources did not obtain social consensus over groundwater ownership and has led to inaction in many psids bouchet et al 2014 subsequently most psids have limited if any legislation in place to manage groundwater resources and regulations that do exist are often poorly enforced bouchet et al 2014 solutions also do not address the root causes of issues and instead treat the symptoms for example many short term donor projects seek to improve infrastructures through small scale projects without sufficient time commitment and community leadership to ensure a lasting acceptance this leads to rejection and non sustainable investments clarke et al 2014 perpetuating inadequate management practices and further system degradation in 2016 after decades of donor support for the water sector in the region many psids have failed to make sustainable progress toward regional and international goals belmar et al 2016 or the establishment of groundwater monitoring igrac 2016 groundwater systems in psids are social ecological systems ses in which human communities aquifers and dependant ecosystems are linked groundwater in psids provides a range of ecosystem services including the supply of freshwater and the support of groundwater dependant ecosystems keener et al 2012 johannes 1980 anthropogenic activities effect groundwater aquifers through extraction land use and pollution which in turn influence natural recharge processes and groundwater quality aquifers groundwater dependant ecosystems gdes and human communities interact through dynamic non linear relationships and open boundaries comte et al 2015 pokhrel et al 2015 these interactions contribute to a dynamic ses where change in one system component e g groundwater extraction rate does not necessarily lead to a change of similar magnitude in a connected component e g saltwater intrusion the openness of the groundwater ses allows driving forces at multiple scales e g rainfall climate global economy extraction rates to influence groundwater systems within the groundwater system human communities have the greatest influence on groundwater quality and availability in psids human interaction with the resource is governed by formal and informal mechanisms at many levels i e dwelling community island state and international levels consequently the social and ecological components of groundwater as a ses cannot be studied in isolation rather understanding groundwater as a ses requires holistic approaches that use principles of sustainability and which view humans as part of the groundwater system not as external drivers to the system thoms et al 2018 socio hydrology has been proposed as an approach to identify and predict the dynamic features of coupled human water systems sivapalan et al 2012 socio hydrogeology has developed alongside socio hydrology and emphasises the importance of knowledge exchange networked stakeholder engagement interdisciplinarity and effective communication in sustainable groundwater management re 2015 hynds et al 2018 socio hydrogeology situates hydrogeologists as facilitators of knowledge exchange proposing that hydrogeologists are leaders via advocation mediation translation and promotion of best practice they are in a unique position to advocate for appropriate groundwater management and protection promote and develop experience at the local catchment scale into regional or national management strategy and assist in translating between the ideal science and the achievable practise hynds et al 2018 p 10 resilience thinking is an alternative perspective to the conceptualisation of human groundwater interactions resilience thinking proposes that humans are embedded within ecosystems and feedbacks within a ses generate system dynamics at multiple scales folke et al 2010 resilience thinking assumes that ses behave as complex adaptive systems with the capacity to learn and adapt to changing conditions that may occur gradually or in response to a shock folke et al 2010 resilience is the capacity of the ses to absorb shocks and to persist to sustain ecosystem services and human well being walker et al 2004 while socio hydrogeology and resilience thinking both stress the importance of stakeholder engagement in resource management this paper explores the sustainable management of groundwater using a framework situated in resilience thinking specifically it explores groundwater as a social ecological system and develops a framework for managing groundwater using the tenets of resilience thinking including complex adaptive systems resilience thresholds and adaptive co management there is a disconnect between the value of groundwater and the management of groundwater in psids while there is a need to better integrate social and ecological systems for sustainable use of groundwater the resilience related concept of ses has not been applied to groundwater systems conceptual frameworks are useful tools to detail new research approaches as they provide a logical structure to assist the integration of various disciplines and associated concepts conceptual frameworks are commonly used in interdisciplinary research delong and thoms 2016 dollar et al 2007 they are useful tools for integrating different disciplines and are used widely as a means to organise ideas understand systems link cause and effect and guide decisions about system management parsons et al 2009 a framework for managing groundwater as a social ecological system in psids is developed in this manuscript the framework is centred on three building blocks 1 a complex adaptive systems approach to viewing groundwater what are the characteristics of a groundwater system as an ses 2 sustainability and resilience thinking why is considering groundwater systems as ses necessary to sustainably manage the resource 3 strategic adaptive management how can a groundwater ses be managed to improve and or retain its sustainability 2 framework components the framework for groundwater as an ses is organised using three building blocks complex adaptive systems resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management fig 2 the first building block addresses the characteristics of groundwater systems from a social ecological perspective systems thinking is used as the overarching scientific premise because it allows an understanding of the properties that explain the behaviour of groundwater as a complex adaptive system the second building block addresses the sustainability of groundwater resilience thinking is used as a philosophical lens to understand the dynamics of complex systems that allow them to absorb disturbances maintain function and persist which is a prerequisite for sustainability fazey 2010 walker et al 2004 walker and salt 2006 the third building block addresses the management of groundwater as a ses strategic adaptive management sam is used because it allows the management of groundwater as a ses using principles of resilience and systems thinking sam provides an approach to groundwater management that focuses on learning adaptation and experimentation this is important in contexts where knowledge of the resource is limited and conflict over the management of the resource is high roux and foxcroft 2011 williams and brown 2016 2 1 complex adaptive systems 2 1 1 properties of complex adaptive systems a complex adaptive system cas is one that involves many interacting components that adapt or learn as they interact holland 2006 the dynamic and adaptive nature of a cas is of central importance and the study of cas generally focuses on how systems change their structure and function in response to external or internal pressure and interactions between system components chan 2001 the dynamics of cas is governed by fundamental properties including self organisation long and short term interactions non linear dynamics and feedbacks path dependency openness and emergence cilliers and spurrett 1999 three of these properties are of major importance to the framework for managing groundwater as a ses self organisation non linear dynamics and feedbacks and system openness self organisation refers to the ability of complex systems to create a form of order where components interact following tacit rules without the presence of a central or external control mahmud 2009 complex adaptive systems are adaptive because they have the capacity to re organise themselves at critical points of instability to absorb disturbances and return to a stable state levin 1998 a stable state is thus created by a cas through self organisation system functions also depend on self organisation and under pressure a system might lose gain or change function to accommodate new persistent conditions complex adaptive systems are generally sensitive to a small subset of variables whose changes can trigger system re organisation anderson 1999 the self organisation of cas occurs through mechanisms of non linear dynamics and feedbacks because of non linear dynamics a change in one system variable does not always produce an outcome that is proportional to that change rickles et al 2007 thus cas cannot be studied as the combination of their individual parts and cas also have limited predictably cilliers and spurrett 1999 feedback mechanisms explain the non linear dynamics through which cas self organise a part of a system receives feedback when the way its neighbours interact with it at a later time depends on how it interacts with them at an earlier time ladyman et al 2013 feedbacks are of two main types reinforcing positive and balancing negative balancing feedbacks are an important tacit rule within cas that help maintain the system in a stable domain mitleton kelly 2003 conversely reinforcing feedbacks can lead to drastic change in the system and re organisation until a new stable state is reached with a set of balancing feedbacks openness refers to the degree of connectivity of a system with other systems at larger scales as open systems cas are defined at various temporal spatial and organisational scales redman et al 2004 to study a complex system spatial temporal and organisational boundaries must be set to acknowledge exogenous components and processes that are outside the defined system but which may influence the flows of materials and information into and out of the system walker et al 2012 these drivers set conditions for internal variables influencing system processes virapongse et al 2016 walker et al 2012 unlike components within the system drivers are not affected by variables within the system 2 1 2 groundwater systems as complex adaptive systems groundwater systems have characteristics reflective of complex adaptive systems they are dynamic and adaptive systems that comprise of 3 sub cas the aquifer the natural environment which include gdes and the island communities that lives above aquifers fig 3 the main function of the groundwater system is the delivery of ecosystem services such as the storage and provision of freshwater the sustaining of gdes also vital to local communities and the mitigation of droughts griebler and avramov 2014 the groundwater system may change its structure i e the nature of the interactions within the system which may affect its function under pressure from within the system or from human or environmental drivers in groundwater systems self organisation can occur within each of the three subsystems and effect the system as whole for example in the island natural environment spatial self organisation can be observed from vegetation exposed to climate disturbances under sufficient disturbance vegetation may reorganise spatially to best thrive with changing conditions vincenot et al 2016 the change in vegetation distribution may affect the island communities who rely on its abundance for uses such as food medicine and building material and the aquifer when water balance is affected by the change in evapotranspiration within the island community self organisation may refer to the ability of local communities to organise the management of shared groundwater resources without any formal control by state and local institutions self organisation and self regulation of groundwater resources is prevalent in the psids as groundwater resources are mostly privately owned traditionally attached to land titles white and falkland 2011 self organisation is often triggered as a response to disturbances that affect system function for example in 1998 on majuro atoll an increase in groundwater abstraction from public utilities led to saltwater intrusion in the island s aquifer the increase in salinity was of concern to the local community that lives above the aquifer and relied almost exclusively on it for their water needs in response to concerns over long term damage to the aquifer and loss of ecosystem services for their community they requested the government stop pumping water from the aquifer which they obliged bouchet 2014 self organisation is a lever that helped the community absorb disturbance and return to a stable state without losing system function this example also illustrates how a change in only one variable i e aquifer salinity can affect an entire system self organisation of groundwater systems is led by nonlinear dynamics and feedback mechanisms self organisation of vegetation for example may be due to a balancing feedback mechanism with seawater intrusion this feedback was observed by comte et al 2015 in a small coral atoll and revealed that an increase in seawater intrusion causes a decrease in vegetation because many species cannot survive in highly saline conditions the decrease in vegetation then facilitates an increase in aquifer recharge which reduces aquifer salinity self organisation of human communities may be triggered by a reinforcing feedback between seawater intrusion and pumping this feedback is widely acknowledged e g sherif and singh 2002 kura et al 2014 and was observed by paniconi et al 2001 in the coastal aquifer of eastern cap bon tunisia where under certain pumping conditions seawater intrusion occurs at a faster rate than it takes for the groundwater table to drop and release water the more seawater that is drawn to the well the less freshwater can enter the well increasing seawater intrusion this feedback which creates a steady increase in salinity forces human communities to reduce or stop pumping to keep groundwater salinity within an acceptable range that maximises its use the presence of these feedbacks shows the importance of nonlinear dynamics and feedbacks between groundwater gdes and human activities groundwater systems cannot be studied as the combination of their subsystems because it would ignore these important feedbacks openness and scale are important properties of groundwater systems the groundwater system should not be bounded at the aquifer level because social and ecological parameters extend well beyond the aquifer physical boundaries these social and ecological parameters and processes connected at various scales can have important impacts on the fluxes of materials into and out of the groundwater system re 2015 tringali et al 2017 hynds et al 2018 when identifying the appropriate scale to study the system it is crucial to include components that affect and are affected by the groundwater and to acknowledge that human communities interact in a dynamic nonlinear two way relationship with the groundwater system drivers in psids groundwater systems are exogenous forces such as rainfall and sea level and may include human forces at higher scales such as political instability and gross domestic product fig 3 thus the openness of groundwater systems is defined by the processes and feedbacks in the system particularly between communities and the groundwater resource 2 2 resilience thinking 2 2 1 properties of resilience thinking resilience thinking offers a framework to study the dynamics of complex systems in the face of change originating in the field of ecological science in the 1970s resilience thinking has evolved to a transdisciplinary science with wide application ecological resilience was first defined by holling 1973 as the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem can withstand without changing self organized processes and structures ecological resilience considers ecosystems as complex systems with multiple stable states studying ecological resilience thus focuses on maintaining existence of function in ecological systems schulze 1996 four components of resilience thinking are of relevance to psids groundwater systems basins of attraction and tipping points ecosystem services and the potential loss that might occur between two stable states the adaptability and transformability of the system and the prerequisite of resilience for sustainability understanding the disturbance that a system can absorb before it reaches a tipping point and moves into a new basin of attraction is the main objective of resilience studies carpenter et al 2001 a complex system is constantly changing i e the variables characterising its structure and function are changing but the structure of the system i e key variables and processes that support function tend to remain within the same basin of attraction fig 4 supported by balancing feedbacks walker et al 2004 complex systems are generally controlled by a small number 4 6 of variables walker et al 2012 these key variables are also called slow variables because they tend to change slowly over time walker et al 2012 a disturbance of sufficient magnitude may push the system across a tipping point into a new basin of attraction in which the system no longer has the same structure function and feedbacks fig 4 one area of resilience thinking called specified resilience focuses on identifying tipping points for slow variables carpenter et al 2001 understanding for which value or range of value in its slow variables a system is likely to move into a new basin of attraction allows human communities to better safeguard the provision of ecosystem services by a ses ecosystem services represent the services that human communities receive from their natural environment daily et al 1997 slow variables in coupled social ecological systems are often associated with the delivery of ecosystem services although the type and level of services are inherently limited by the natural setting and resources that make up the ecosystem the desired level of service and the value that society places on an ecosystem is subjective therefore tipping points for slow variables in social ecological systems may be subjective and hard to define carpenter et al 2001 resilient systems are able to self organise in the face of disturbance to maintain a sufficient level of ecosystem services and thus avoid crossing a tipping point into a new basin of attraction identifying tipping points is challenging but can provide great insight into a system behaviour and delineate operational boundaries tipping points exist when two relatively close values for a slow variable lead to two different system states with distinctively different function and ecosystem services i e state 1 and state 4 fig 4 system states are of limited reversibility and exhibit significant self organisation noticeable through new balancing feedbacks milkoreit et al 2018 thus ecosystem services on each side of a tipping point must show lasting differences characteristic of different basin of attraction i e intermittent loss in ecosystem services due to disturbance are not necessarily service losses adaptability and transformability are also important elements of resilience thinking because these represent the capacity of human communities to shape variability and change in the state of the system folke 2016 adaptability is the capacity to maintain or improve the functions of a system in the face of change gallopín 2006 while transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when the current system cannot be modified to maintain system function walker et al 2004 transformation can occur autonomously e g natural selection intentionally e g human intervention or externally e g forced by drivers outside the system o connell et al 2015 both adaptation and transformation can be seen as levers that humans can use to modify the system s resilience and avoid undesirable regime shifts folke 2016 understanding system dynamics is a necessary condition for sustainability of natural resources perrings 2006 sustainability can be defined as the degree to which the system maintains levels of service in the long term whilst maximising social economic and environmental goals ward and butler 2016 sustainability of a social ecological system is thus the ability to maintain ecosystem services for future generations while fulfilling society s social ambitions non sustainable systems are not always obvious because of the non linearity that characterises complex systems a complex system may appear sustainable until sudden and or unpredicted change occurs and results in the loss of ecosystem services a prerequisite for sustainability is thus the ability to withstand changes without losing ecosystem services derissen et al 2009 2 2 2 resilience thinking and the sustainable management of groundwater understanding the disturbance that a groundwater system can absorb before it crosses a tipping point leading to ecosystem service loss is important for the sustainability of groundwater systems sustaining existing ecosystem services or restoring previous services provided by groundwater systems is a priority in psids as the impact of highly degraded systems such as found in nauru and funafuti is high for local communities bouchet and sinclair 2010 duncan 2011 nakada et al 2012 degraded groundwater systems pose threats to community health during drought periods when freshwater is limited and groundwater use increases sinclair et al 2012 emont 2015 communities may require replacement technologies e g desalination that are expensive and complex to maintain and run and which pose additional environmental threats e g brine discharge that affect the health of gdes and their ability to provide food to local communities younos 2005 to sustain or restore ecosystem services requires an understanding of system resilience and how change in slow variables will push the system from one regime to another folke 2016 groundwater systems in the psids provide many ecosystem services freshwater lenses provide island communities with drinking water table 1 a however the freshwater lens might be inconsistent and groundwater quality highly variable from fresh to brackish table 1b in this state water can be used for most activities except drinking water when groundwater quality is very low it has high salinity and is also likely to be highly polluted table 1c in this state it is mainly used for flushing toilets highly contaminated groundwater prohibits all use table 1d as complex system each state in a groundwater system is maintained by key hydrogeological social and environmental processes these processes maintain system function by keeping slow variables within an operational range table 1 although each state is characterised by different slow variables four main categories of slow variables are associated with changes in the provision of ecosystem services under different states groundwater quantity e g aquifer volume aquifer geometry groundwater salinity groundwater demand e g percentage of total water use volume per capita per day and groundwater quality associated with land use e g vegetation type and density point source pollutants maintaining the supply of ecosystem services from groundwater needs to be cognizant of how quantity quality salinity and demand variables can push a system into a new basin of attraction a shift may occur if a slow variable crosses a tipping point permanently changing the type of ecosystem services provided by the system walker et al 2004 for example climate drivers such as repeated droughts or storm surges can increase salinity levels in aquifers white et al 2007 if they occur regularly enough they can change the average salinity storlazzi et al 2018 when a previously fresh aquifer becomes predominantly brackish it can no longer be a reliable source of freshwater this illustrates a regime shift from a to b table 1 this regime shift may also occur if the shallow aquifer is significantly disturbed such as occurred in funafuti following major land reclamation and borrow pits during the second world war duncan 2011 nakada et al 2012 inversely an increase in average precipitation of sufficient magnitude can increase groundwater recharge and produce the opposite regime shift tipping points are difficult to measure because they are dependent on how human communities and gdes respond to change folke 2016 some systems will have greater tolerance to salinity increase the tipping point for salinity is thus dependant on a social regime shift where groundwater demand is significantly affected and triggers system re organisation a social regime shift occurring without an ecological regime shift may also be sufficient to push the system into a new state for example the increasing reliance of a growing population on groundwater can increase aquifer salinity to a point where communities have to re organise and find additional water sources at least for drinking the ecological state change is in theory reversible and maintained only by human pressure however when a groundwater resource becomes largely abandoned for drinking it can trigger reinforcing feedbacks from behaviours that may increase pollution and further degrade the resource the further the resource is degraded the less it can provide services the less it is valued and the less likely it is for ecosystem services to ever be restored the adaptive capacity of groundwater systems can help prevent or facilitate state change from the social perspective adaptive capacity refers to the capacity of island communities to self organise and respond to change in groundwater quality by altering their behaviour adaptation can also be driven by institutions through regulatory or technical responses adaptive responses may target groundwater use land use wastewater disposal and pollution when adaptation is not feasible often due to a new ecological regime transformation might be required from the social system to find another way to access water in psids this is often through a mix of rainwater and desalination technology falkland 1999 moglia et al 2008 white and falkland 2012 adaptation is often a preferred option since transformation may require the deployment of new technology such as desalination units which are expensive and complex to run and maintain scholes 2012 2 3 strategic adaptive management 2 3 1 properties of strategic adaptive management adaptive management approaches account for uncertainty in a complex system by trialling management options designed to gain insight about system dynamics and improve its management curtin and parker 2014 adaptive management may reveal key feedbacks self organisation patterns openness and tipping points by increasing knowledge of the system adaptive management approaches can help increase adaptive capacity and sustainability of complex systems strategic adaptive management sam is a form of adaptive management that has been developed and implemented in south african national parks roux and foxcroft 2011 a notable difference that sets sam apart from other adaptive management approaches is its strategic component it helps foster action and organise management activities notably through the use of an objectives hierarchy and thresholds of potential concern meffe 2002 rogers and biggs 1999 it also allows the development of flexible structures to integrate various type of knowledge including cultural social technical and institutional rogers et al 2000 strategic adaptive management is thus a process designed to be adaptive participatory and strategic roux and foxcroft 2011 by investigating system desirability conducting experimental management practices that are aimed at steering the system toward its desired state and systematically reviewing and learning from management practices three components of sam are of interest for this framework the objectives hierarchy tpcs and learning by doing 2 3 2 components of sam the objectives hierarchy within sam is the mechanism to formulate goals in a hierarchical order and to set measurable targets for system management the objectives hierarchy enables managers to develop activities for tangible smaller objectives while working toward a better understanding and eventually management of the higher order objective kingsford and biggs 2012 in doing so it allows managers to initiate management measures when knowledge of the system is limited the objectives hierarchy is part of the strategic aspect of sam and along with social inclusion it helps foster participatory action and facilitate learning thresholds of potential concern tpcs are operational targets for monitoring progress toward management objectives allen et al 2011 because tipping points are dynamic and hard to define in complex sess tpcs can be used to monitor slow variables that potentially lead to loss of ecosystem services tpcs may also be used with other variables known to have a potential leverage on the system since thresholds are dynamic and may be desirable or undesirable they must be reviewed regularly as part of the evaluation and learning process of sam biggs et al 2011 learning by doing is an important tenet of adaptive management approaches and learning is embedded within sam depending on the system boundaries learning may be mainly about the ecological system i e reducing ecological uncertainty but may also be about the social system i e what social and institutional structures are the most efficient to sustainably manage the resource in targeting small experiments to get a better understanding of the system sam and am approaches in general offer an alternative to passive adaptive and deferred action management style walters and hilborn 1978 in deferred action management management actions and practices are put on hold in favour of studies the idea is that the system cannot be managed until it is fully understood because of the complexity and dynamic nature of natural resource systems there might never be sufficient data and the absence of management practices is likely to incur more degradation in a passive adaptive approach management practices are developed based on local studies and experiences from similar systems with the aim to be refined as more studies are conducted however in application practices are rarely reviewed walters and hilborn 1978 furthermore the focus is on a steady state of the system with objectives based on optimistic predictions and a tendency to not question initial assumptions often on the basis of their validity in other contexts walters and hilborn 1978 2 3 3 managing groundwater using strategic adaptive management a strategic adaptive management approach can help address two key issues for groundwater management in the region that are characteristic of command and control management style the hegemony of foreign technical experts to design and control the implementation of management activities dornan and pryke 2017 and the mechanistic approach to groundwater management first there is a high reliance on foreign technical experts in the psids as many countries have limited financial and skilled human resources donor agencies and partners fill this gap by providing technical expertise and funding often through the implementation of short term projects although expert advice is needed in specific areas such as hydrogeology white and falkland 2011 many aspects of project design and implementation are controlled by technical experts through short term projects 5 years this limits community involvement necessary for project sustainability keppel et al 2012 upadhyay 2005 and hinders behavioural and socio economical changes which demand longer commitment keppel et al 2012 a post project review by clarke et al 2014 to assess the lasting impact of 27 community development projects for the water and sanitation sector in psids found that only 1 out of 27 projects have had lasting benefit to the targeted communities and could thus be deemed sustainable secondly the mechanistic approach to groundwater management fails to acknowledge groundwater systems as ses and thus to understand the importance of community self organisation for the management of the resource the nonlinear dynamic between groundwater island communities and the natural environment and the openness of the system it fails to acknowledge that groundwater systems can exist in different stable states with fundamental differences in their ability to provide ecosystem services to island communities consequently the design of management options is often technical addresses causes not roots of issues and is not well fitted to local contexts groundwater systems are also at risk of crossing a tipping point where groundwater cannot provide the same level of services and communities must rely on expensive technological solutions further perpetuating technocratic governance the sam process for groundwater in psids aims to generate long term commitment for groundwater management where island communities governments and other stakeholders co generate management initiatives based on their knowledge and shared vision it is a 5 step process that focuses on the improvement of existing management structures and leadership roles governance and groundwater management fig 5 management structures in psids are unique to each setting but share key characteristics such as important informal governance and management structures and ill defined formal hierarchies of governance belmar et al 2016 defining the desirable states for the groundwater system is a participatory process that would involve a wide range of stakeholders to develop a vision objectives and the objectives hierarchy safeguarding or increasing ecosystem services might be prioritised as a first order objective followed by the improvement of management structures and activities social inclusion is key in this process to enable consensus over system desirability and derive lower scale objectives that are realistic and that drive stakeholders blended interests generating interest from diverse stakeholders at the onset of the initiative is important to foster long term commitment in psids keen 2003 cvitanovic et al 2016 and other contexts re 2015 hynds et al 2018 for example integrating donors research agendas i e research objectives that are interesting to donors or linking objectives with other sectors is likely important for many stakeholders an objectives hierarchy supported by a strong social network is also important to avoid setback due to political instability next tpcs are defined to provide long term monitoring targets for the slow variables in the groundwater system and additional variables associated with critical system processes these should include tpcs to measure sustainability not only of management activities but of institutional structures leadership partnership and engagement this is key for groundwater sustainability not only in psids but for groundwater systems globally it may also include variables associated with key characteristics of the social system structure for groundwater management that could reveal a changing behaviour toward groundwater and land use key characteristics of the gdes structure and self organisation patterns and key biophysical characteristics e g rainfall intensity and frequency although qualitative tpcs may be relevant at all levels e g the consumption of groundwater for drinking is purely based on taste not on tds measurements sound scientific data is required to best support management activities white and falkland 2011 dixon jain et al 2014 igrac 2016 the design and implementation of management experiments will refine tpcs as managers and social structures alike increase the knowledge of the system as a third step management options are assessed partners might be involved at that stage to provide financial and technical support conceptual analytical and numerical models might be used to predict outcomes and test acceptability in step 4 management activities are implemented alongside a monitoring system which uses tpcs as the mechanism to assess the state of the system and its relationship to the goals set in the objectives hierarchy the final step is dedicated to learning through evaluation of management measures and information to stakeholders mcloughlin and thoms 2015 increasing co developing and sharing knowledge within the groundwater ses is key to improve the system s adaptive capacity the sam approach for groundwater in psids fosters eco hydrogeological technical and institutional learning eco hydrogeological learning is much needed in the psids as uncertainties are high for example knowledge of the response of freshwater lenses to sea level rise seawater movement and environmental pressures is still limited dixon jain et al 2014 unesco ihp 2015 white and falkland 2011 white and falkland 2011 also argues that because groundwater systems in the region are so vulnerable improving knowledge of these systems is a key to their sustainable management technical learning is needed to assess the relevance of technical solutions in various hydrogeological socio cultural and economic contexts finally institutional learning provides opportunities to strengthen governance structures and adaptive capacity by understanding and incorporating informal structures nested leadership and processes that have the power to generate positive changes in the systems 3 case study groundwater as a ses in nauru the framework developed in this manuscript provides a road map to manage groundwater as a social ecological system using complex adaptive systems resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management the framework situates groundwater sustainability as a series of dynamic feedbacks between the social and ecological components of groundwater systems placing humans as part of the groundwater system rather than external drivers management of groundwater systems takes a shared approach with solutions co generated among multiple societal scientific and institutional stakeholders using the structured learning by doing approach of sam in this section we briefly discuss how the framework could be applied to visualise a ses approach to groundwater sustainability in nauru one of the psids it is not the intent to describe in detail the nauru ses rather we show how the three elements of the framework correspond to groundwater systems in nauru and how application of the framework elements could potentially enhance groundwater sustainability the pacific island of nauru is a 22 km2 independent island nation of 10 000 people in the central pacific region fig 1 where groundwater is a key freshwater water source bouchet and sinclair 2010 freshwater is primarily found in the coarse alluvium aquifer along the island coastline fig 6 the aquifer is small and thin and salinity levels vary throughout the year from fresh to brackish depending on rainfall and extraction only a small area in the northeast of the island contains a permanent freshwater lens alberti et al 2017 groundwater is used in conjunction with rainwater and desalinated water around half of the island s population has direct access to groundwater through privately owned wells and households with reticulated access to groundwater tend to use it for up to 83 of their water needs bouchet and sinclair 2010 reliance on groundwater varies from about 25 to more than 50 of total water use depending on the availability of rainwater bouchet and sinclair 2010 bouchet 2011 groundwater is thus a vital source of water for nauru and its use has been steadily increasing in the past 50 years bouchet and sinclair 2010 groundwater quality on nauru has been gradually declining despite ongoing commitment from government and donor partners to improve groundwater management there is widespread faecal contamination from poorly designed sanitation systems point source contamination such as hydrocarbons and high variability in salinity levels bouchet and sinclair 2010 high levels of pollution restrict human use of groundwater and poor groundwater quality can pose serious health risks to the community notably for infants who are at high risk from waterborne diseases bouchet and sinclair 2010 efforts by governments and donor partners to improve the management of groundwater have focused on technical solutions and top down regulation hydrogeological investigations have focused on finding contamination free groundwater for extraction jacobson and hill 1988 jacobson 1997 castelletti et al 2012 alberti et al 2017 the lack of success in this area resulted in termination of groundwater research and groundwater monitoring in 2014 donor projects have also started trialling sanitation technologies e g compost toilets dual chamber septic tanks for private households however after eight years only a dozen of these have been installed and there is no ongoing monitoring of their efficiency groundwater management and protection measures i e identification and remediation of groundwater pollution development of sustainable yields pumping regulation were included as part of the water policy developed in 2012 ron 2011 but it has yet to lead to any legislation or management protection procedures very little has been achieved on the ground and groundwater quality is still degrading failure to manage and protect groundwater is linked to the state centred top down command and control management style which prevails in nauru the command and control approach to regulation through the inclusion of groundwater protection measures in the water and sanitation policy is not compatible with local practices such as customary land and groundwater ownership land ownership is of high importance in nauru and the state does not interfere with private lands governments are thus reticent to introduce any bill or measure that will impose regulations on private land and even though policy documents might be developed they are unlikely to be implemented second command and control management is perpetuating a mechanistic approach to groundwater studies this has led groundwater activities to be divided between hydrogeological investigations small scale sanitation technology trials and policy development with little coordination or common shared vision between activities most activities are led by donors who have limited leverage to make sustainable change at institutional levels and limited time and budget to implement sustainable management activities the groundwater system of nauru as a ses comprises human actors that rely on the resource for daily water supply drought relief and gdes this complex system is affected by drivers at higher scales such as environmental changes brought by climate change change in water quality due to anthropogenic activities has impacted local communities to the point where groundwater is called brackish water and regarded as a dirty source of water bouchet 2011 even though it is widely used low groundwater quality has created a reinforcing feedback where groundwater is poorly valued and whose protection is of low priority although the need to manage groundwater in a holistic way has been recognised in nauru for more than a decade sopac 2007 there has not been any significant improvement in either the management structure legal framework for groundwater management or groundwater quality and availability to date bouchet et al 2014 there is a need to move away from command and control approaches both at institutional level where a new form of collaborative multidisciplinary and participative form of governance is needed and at the groundwater level where solutions that recognise the complex adaptive dynamic of groundwater system should be developed implementing the framework in nauru would operationalise the three building blocks of the framework complex adaptive systems resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management for the complex adaptive systems building block a system conceptualisation would be derived to investigate how nauruan ecosystems respond to changes in groundwater quality and the feedback that it has on the aquifer and the system slow variables combined with existing hydrogeological knowledge and numerical models the system conceptualisation will allow understanding how the aquifer including areas of potential future development respond to combinations of various rates and methods of extraction rainfall and temperature regimes sea level rise and land use changes and surface activities for the resilience thinking building block a resilience analysis would investigate the magnitude of disturbance that slow variables can absorb before the ses reorganises and ecosystem service provision changes it will allow developing dynamic sustainable yields of extraction and context specific design for wells and on site sanitation systems with a significant increase in average rainfall forecast for years to come the brackish aquifer could experience an ecological shift from brackish to fresh understanding social tpcs for the use of groundwater will allow for both sustainable management of the groundwater resources and informed future water management planning for the sam building block a sam approach would be designed to allow improved management structures for groundwater resources the identification and implementation of important objectives and the identification and implementation of effective technological ecological and social management measures the management structures will be based on a long term shared vision between groundwater users community groups government institutions and with the long term support of donor partners and external supporting organisations hierarchical objectives will be informed by the resilience analysis and decided through the management structures effective management measures based on sam objectives tpcs and dynamic sustainable yield will be trailed tested and refined to best support their intent sam will enable the management of the resource based on ses desirability and the conservation of ecosystem services a well designed sam approach will increase the system s adaptive capacity and the ability of groundwater ses to absorb and adapt to current and future pressures managing groundwater as a ses requires a paradigm shift in the way groundwater is conceptualised studied and managed this involves a shift away from the command and control paradigm towards multidisciplinary and participative governance in the psids future climate and social changes will bring high uncertainty in the availability and quality of groundwater in nauru although groundwater could become fresher drought may be more extreme in order to take advantage of potential positive change brought by climate change and be resilient to negative changes and extreme events psids communities must be adaptive and recognise the complex adaptive nature of groundwater systems in this paper we have detailed a framework to conceptualise study and manage groundwater as ses it offers a new approach to manage groundwater systems under high environmental and social uncertainty although this framework was developed for the psids with a special focus on the limited resources and institutional challenges that these countries faces it may also prove relevant to other contexts where groundwater is vital and environmental and social uncertainty is high declarations of interest none acknowledgements lb was financially supported through an australian government

12313,this study assesses the hydrochemical characteristics and water quality for irrigation use around the hard rock mining area the hydrochemical analysis shows that there are wide variations of ions e g ph sp ec turbidity fe3 na cl cd2 soluble silica and others which exceeded the acceptable limit of drinking as well as the irrigation uses the concentration of sio2 in the water is very high than the natural limit it indicates a direct impact of granitic rock extracted from the mine in fact such rock contains a large quantity 50 17 74 7 by weight of silica the wqi analysis shows that water samples are slightly marginal to excellent quality water where the surface water samples possess comparatively good quality water than groundwater for irrigation purpose the scatter graph of ca2 mg2 versus total cations tz plot suggests that some ions are produced due to the weathering of silicate minerals the trilinear diagram exhibits that 77 24 of samples are showing the cahco3 type of facies where 85 7 of surface water falls within this category the durov diagram illustrates the mixing of ion dissolution with reverse ion exchanging water type the correlation matrix affirms the relationship strength and direction of multivariate data in particular the various classification of water such as sar na salinity and tds values confirmed excellent to permissible use of water for agricultural purpose around the mining area graphical abstract image 1 keywords hard rock mine hydrochemical characteristics wqi correlation matrix irrigation water quality 1 introduction water is indispensable for both life and civilization to date the pure water is part and parcel for all living beings on the other hand poor contaminated water can be frightened to the existence of the aquatic species health and environment as a whole however water is necessary and unavoidable natural resource because of its diverse uses but it is a matter of regret that this element is suffering for preserving its different physicochemical properties all over the world due to different activities where the human deeds are responsible comprehensively the mining is a major man made activity that has a serious impact on the water quality environment as well as ecological balance around mine surrounding area in case of metal mining minerals come in contact with groundwater from near aquifer zone and different major and trace elements may result through various physiochemical reaction the disposal of these mine waste water can cause change in physical and chemical water quality properties of surface water and also the heavy metal leaching often contains toxic and objectionable elements these elements contaminate the water and soil around the mine area as well as nearby river moreover the groundwater in the area can also be polluted because of water recharge from rivers channels ponds and also from agricultural lands the mining method which is applied in maddhapara hardrock granite mine is room and pillar sublevel stopping the groundwater seeping to the mine is increasing day by day for example the seeping rate of the mine was about 53 51 m3 hours in 2010 mgmcl 2010 but this rate gradually increased to about 92 m3 hours in 2015 as reported by the responsible authority of maddhapara granite mine company limited mgmcl as a result the impacts of groundwater discharge are also rising the hydrochemical characteristics consisted of physical and chemical parameters vary spatially and temporarily control the chemical composition of waters howladar 2012 hossain et al 2010 martinez and bocanegra 2002 apodaca et al 2002 the water quality index wqi can give an indication of the status of the watershed at various points it can be used to keep track of and analyze the changes of water quality time to time for appropriate actions the wqi can be used to monitor water quality changes in a particular water supply over time or it can be used to compare a water supply s quality with other water supplies in the region the wqi is one of the most widely used of all existing water quality procedures srivastava and kumar 2013 water quality index aims at giving a single value to the water of a source on the basis of one or the other system horton s 1965 water quality index is considered as the forerunner of the modern wqis abbasi and abbasi 2012 saeedi et al 2010 developed a wqi for groundwater quality monitoring by considering eight water quality parameters wqi was used by reza and singh 2010 to monitor the spatial temporal groundwater quality variations in india however previously the research about the ground water chemistry of two aquifers around the study area had been conducted by bashar et al 2008 which was on the water chemistry with no statistical analysis moreover it was done immediately after the production of hard rock had been started 2007 previously howladar et al 2017b had studied the water chemistry around the study area and examined the suitability of the water for drinking purposes thus the purpose of this study was to evaluate the hydrochemical characteristics and water quality for irrigation use by performing various statistical analyses around the study area in fact this study interpreted the obtained data set their similarities and dissimilarities and recognized the physicochemical parameters affecting water quality with the help of statistical analysis 2 study area the study area is located in maddhapara under the parbottipur upazila of dinajpur district the north western part of bangladesh and 330 km away from dhaka city maddhapara is located between latitude n 25 33 15 and n 25 34 13 and longitude e 89 3 30 to e 89 4 53 fig 1 the climate of this area can be characterized by hot season in summer moderate in monsoon and cool season in winter the highest average temperature generally takes place in june with a maximum of 38 8 c and average temperature during january is the lowest with a minimum of 7 c as bangladesh has a heavy rainfall the study area has a rainfall equivalent to 85 of annual rainfall in the monsoon season between june and october and comparatively little rainfall in the dry season from november to may the highest average humidity of this area is about 90 2 1 geology and stratigraphy based on the geological framework the country can be classified into two major parts namely a precambrian platform and b deeper basin or bengal foredeep reimann 1993 guha 1978 the precambrian platform is situated at north western part of bangladesh on the contrary the south eastern part is termed as basin or geosynclines the pre cambrian platform can be sub classified into a rangpur saddle and b bogra shelf however the basin part is split into two segments namely folded belt in eastern sides and bengal foredeep in relatively eastern part of the country fig 2 the study area is situated in rangpur saddle it is characterized by the thin sedimentary cover and the basement rock is buried at shallow depth the surrounding area is covered by the deposition of three different materials e g piedmont alluvium tista alluvium and barind tract piedmont alluvium dominates in most of the area covered by dinajpur and rangpur district it is a result of the flow of tista river the tista alluvium is underlain by brahmaputra jamuna floodplain barind tract is a alluvium which is further termed as madhupur clay the study area is drained by jamuna river in the west and jamuneswari river in the east side kalanadi river flows from west to south east and another river named chirnai flows from north to south east the subsurface of the study area can be characterized by highly fractured and fault controlled because of tectonic activity during the permo carboniferous period the basement rock is located at shallower depth the basement rock is located below the successive layers of alluvium soil 0 0 5 m madhupur clay 0 5 6 m dupi tila 6 120 m tura 120 141 m and the gondwana group 160 259 6 m the stratigraphic successions of the distinctive layers have been shown in table 1 as tabulated by bashar et al 2008 and karim 2001 the formation of the basement is of archean era they can be kaolinized granodiorite the weathered granodiorite and the fresh granodiorite the basement rock also includes fine grained silicified whitish granite pegmatite and dykes of micro granodiorite the geological cross section showing the rock types across the maddhapara hardrock mining project mhrmp area boreholes is shown in fig 3 2 2 hydrogeology there are two types of aquifers systems are present in maddhapara granite mine area bashar et al 2008 examined the hydrostratigraphy of the maddhapara granite mine area along two sections aa and bb as shown in fig 4 the upper aquifer is termed as porous aquifer and the lower aquifer is termed as fissure aquifer the porous aquifer is formed by the stratification of dupi tila tura and gondwana formation bashar et al 2008 the dupi tila formation consisted of fine particles of yellowish brown to medium grained sands and coarse grained pebbly sands besides the tura formation composed of fine to medium sands the gondwana formation covered by well rounded fine to medium grained feldspathic sandstone and pebbles these all formations form an overburden porous aquifer on the other hand the fissure aquifer is composing of an achaean weathered green granodiorite and fresh rocks it also makes up with numerous fractures joints and fissures which play a vital role to flow the water into this confined aquifer a white clay non permeable stratum composed of kaolin that isolates the porous aquifer and the fissure aquifer zones the thickness of the upper aquifer is about 128 m the flooding of the underground mine is the main hindrance for the ceaseless development of the mine pollutants released on the ground surface from mine activities may rapidly reach the aquifer and travel through preferential pathways ewusi et al 2017 tazioli et al 1995 moreover the rock itself contains many trace elements which may be mixed up with the water available in underground therefore the quality maintenance of the underground aquifer has become a matter of big challenges in rock mining area 3 methodology the water samples were collected from both surface and groundwater around the study area the latitude and longitude of sampling sites were recorded during sampling period fig 1 the 500 ml polyethylene pe bottles had been soaked with 1 1 hno3 solution and properly rinsed using demineralized water before sample collection in order to get proper samples properties the collecting bottles had been rinsed thoroughly for at least two times before samples poured into it the collected water samples are marked by s1 to s31 where the s2 s3 s5 s11 s24 s26 and s30 are surface water samples the remaining is underground water collected from shallow tube wells the samples were analyzed for ph turbidity t in ntu and electrical conductivity ec in μs cm 1 the test of these variables was performed instantly after the samples were collected by using in situ digital ph meter model 720 wtw service germany a digital turbidity meter model ec215 hanna instrument romana and a digital electrical conductivity meters respectively for getting precise measurements the collected samples were tightly packed and transported to the water treatment plant laboratory of the barapukuria thermal power station barapukuria dinajpur for chemical analysis on the same day and stored in temperature controlled air condition room during the analysis however before the analyses the respective meter was calibrated sincerely by using the specific standard solution the total hardness th mg l 1 total alkalinity ta mg l 1 and chloride cl mg l 1 were determined by titrimetric volumetric method by using a calibrated micro burette germany for each of the analytical parameters a minimum of three analyses were carried out and finally the average values are noted the concentrations of nitrate no3 mg l 1 silica sio2 mg l 1 phosphate po4 3 mg l 1 ammonia nh4 mg l 1 bicarbonate hco3 mg l 1 sulfate so4 2 mg l 1 fe3 mg l 1 cu2 mg l 1 and zn2 mg l 1 were estimated by using spectro photometric method using a uv spectrophotometer model 721 china the concentrations of na mg l 1 k mg l 1 ca2 mg l 1 mg2 mg l 1 as3 mg l 1 cd2 mg l 1 and cr3 mg l 1 were estimated by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas model pg 999 graphite furnace power supply acs 990 graphite furnace auto sampler china during the analyses of each parameter the proper calibrations for respective instruments were carried out all the chemicals used in these investigations were of reagent grade analytical grade made of e merck germany or bdh england in the overall investigation double de mineralized water ddmw was used to avoid any types of contamination tds mg l 1 values of water samples were analyzed by evaporating a certain amount 100 ml of sample water in normal atmospheric pressure moreover the detail process of analysis of various parameters of water samples explained previously by howladar et al 2017 a the water quality index wqi is a single numeric value expression that abridges multiple water quality parameters wqi is defined as a rating that reflects the composite influence of different water quality parameters pawar et al 2014 sahu and sikdar 2008 the quality of water can be predicted solely based on any single parameter this is because the value beyond the optimum limits of any of the parameters that plays significant role in irrigation water suitability can deteriorates its quality from guideline limits therefore wqi can summarize the resultant effects of some parameters and is capable of signifying the suitability of available water for irrigation purposes it has two parts namely q value and the weighting factor w the q value is an indication of water quality relative to 100 of one parameter the weighting factor sets the relative importance of the parameter to the overall water quality due to the missing of few variables that influence irrigation water quality in a great manner in this study wqi is calculated based on four variables such as total phosphates ph dissolved oxygen do and nitrate n the q value is calculated for the respective parameters from table 2 the q value for different respective measurements of the selected parameters can be taken by correlation from fig 5 or from table 2 the weighting factor wi for dissolved oxygen nitrate n total phosphates and ph is taken as 0 3 0 2 0 2 and 0 3 respectively according to their relative importance for irrigation purposes and the wqi is then calculated by the following formula hosseini moghari et al 2015 1 wqi i 1 i n q i wi where wi weighting factor that summarize the relative influencing value of respective parameter as fraction in order to simplify the calculation process a representative wqi calculation is shown in table 3 the wqi ranges from 1 to 100 that express the overall water quality at a specific location and time based on several water quality parameters where 1 and 100 indicating the poorest and best quality water respectively in order to classify the water quality as poor marginal fair good or excellent the designations within this range have been set by srivastava and kumar 2013 is given in table 4 the sodium content is usually expressed in terms of percent sodium or soluble sodium percentage na the excess absorption of sodium can cause sodium toxicity in sensitive plants causing marginal leaf burn on older foliage and possibly defoliation the water containing excessive amount of sodium may immobilize other nutrient ions particularly calcium magnesium and potassium which can result in deficiencies of these elements in plants nagaraju et al 2014 sharifi and safari sinegani 2012 todd and mays 2005 nwqms 2000 domenico and schwartz 1990 kelly 1951 sodium content expressed in terms of sodium percentage is defined as 2 na n a 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a k where all ionic concentrations are expressed in mill equivalents per liter meq l 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar is an important parameter that can be used for detecting the sodium hazard sar can be evaluated as a measure of excess of sodium or limited calcium and magnesium and expressed as 3 sodium absorption ratio sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where all ionic concentrations are expressed in mill equivalents per liter meq l 1 residual sodium carbonate rsc of irrigation water is used as an indication of the alkalinity hazard of soil for irrigation purposes it is calculated as a measurement of the excess sum of co 3 2 and hco 3 content in irrigation water over the total of ca 2 and mg 2 content and according to esmaeili vardanjani et al 2015 this excess amount influences the suitability of water for irrigation purposes it can be measured by following equation r s c h c o 3 c o 3 2 c a 2 m g 2 where all ionic concentrations are expressed in mill equivalents per liter meq l 1 the langelier saturation index lsi is used to assess the ability of the water to dissolve or precipitate calcium carbonate dissolution and precipitation reactions of minerals occur below the soil surface where their concentration is influenced by many environmental factors especially water rock interaction omar et al 2009 ronge and claesson 1982 lin and clemency 1980 it provides a degree of calcium carbonate saturation in water it is calculated using the ph alkalinity as caco3 mg l 1 calcium ion concentration mg l 1 total dissolved solids tds mg l 1 electrical conductivity ec μs cm 1 bicarbonate concentration hco3 as caco3 mg l 1 water temperature c etc langelier saturation indices for all the samples were calculated by using lenntech calculator https www lenntech com calculators langelier index langelier htm the box plot is a simplest way of displaying the distribution of data based on statistical parameters the box plot graph allows the differences between the measuring points to be identified and visually summarizes the quantitative data bilgin ayla 2015 box plot is used in this study because it is a simplest way usually used in data interpretation and analyses because it depicts the spatial and temporal variations of the water samples qualities machiwa and singh 2015 it gives the visual concept about the spread of data by showing five number summery tukey 1977 consisting of the minimum the first quartile the median the third quartile and the maximum as well as two other indictors namely the outliers and the extremes first and third quartile means below which 25 and 75 of the data fall respectively the middle quartile is termed as median inter quartile range iqr is the range between the 25th percentile and 75th percentiles outlier is either 1 5 iqr or more above the third quartile or 1 5 iqr or more below the first quartile extremes are either 3 iqr or more the third quartile and or 3 iqr or more the more below the first quartile 4 result and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry the hydrochemical study reveals that the quality of water is suitable for drinking agriculture and industrial uses in the area the descriptive statistical method is used for analyzing the hydrochemical characteristics of the water based on 25 variables are shown in table 5 the ph values of the water samples are found between 5 30 and 9 02 fig 6 the normal ph range for irrigation water is from 6 to 8 5 nagaraju et al 2014 ayers and westcot 1985 irrigation water with a ph outside the normal range may cause a nutritional imbalance or may contain toxic ions the electrical conductivity of water varies from 41 μs cm 1 to 587 μs cm 1 the ec values in groundwater samples are comparatively higher than surface water samples fig 7 a water with ec less than 250 μs cm 1 is considered good and with greater than 750 μs cm 1 is unsuitable for irrigation joshi et al 2009 the concentration of the total dissolved solids tds value varies from 24 to 382 mg l 1 it has been observed that the tds value is comparatively lower in groundwater samples fig 7b according to who 2011 the maximum permissible limit of tds for drinking water is 500 mg l 1 water with tds less than 450 mg l 1 is considered good joshi et al 2009 turbidity in the water varies between 3 ntu to 45 ntu with an average value of 10 742 ntu when maximum allowable turbidity value is stetted at 10 ntu it is obvious that the turbidity in the surface water samples is very much higher than that of groundwater samples fig 7c the total alkalinity ta value ranges between 5 mg l 1 and 88 mg l 1 as caco3 it is seen that ta values in surface water samples are comparatively higher fig 7d total hardness th value for the water samples varies from 2 5 mg l 1 to 87 5 mg l 1 as caco3 these values suggest that the water samples are soft to moderately hard fig 7e calcium ca2 concentration varies from 1 3 mg l 1 to 55 mg l 1 with an average value of 15 06 mg l 1 as caco3 which is within the acceptable limit for drinking purposes 75 mg l 1 as who 2011 standards fig 7f fao 1985 recommends concentration of calcium ions in irrigation water should be between 0 and 400 mg l 1 magnesium mg2 concentration varies from 1 mg l 1 to 41 mg l 1 with an average value of 15 06 mg l 1 as caco3 the permissible limit of mg2 concentration in drinking water is within 50 mg l 1 the fao 1985 recognized value of magnesium ion concentration in irrigation water should be less than 60 mg l 1 the concentration of magnesium in irrigation should be ranged from 0 to 5 mg l 1 the concentration of sodium na is found between 2 1 mg l 1 to 53 mg l 1 with an average of 14 34 mg l 1 as caco3 na concentration is comparatively higher in ground water samples fig 7g potassium k concentration in the water samples varies from 0 4 to 12 2 mg l 1 fig 7h the maximum allowable potassium in drinking water is below 10 mg l 1 who 2011 and for irrigation waters it should be in between 0 and 2 mg l 1 fao 1985 the concentrations of arsenic as3 in water samples are found within the permissible limit between 0 and 0 0017 mg l 1 fig 7i the concentrations of cadmium cd2 in the water samples are found beyond the permissible limit and ranges between 0 008 mg l 1 to 0 042 mg l 1 it has been found that cd2 in groundwater samples is usually higher than the other samples fig 7j the concentration of the zinc zn2 in the collected water samples are found between 0 08 mg l 1 to 0 32 mg l 1 zinc may be toxic to many plants at widely varying concentrations reduced toxicity at increased ph 6 or above and in fine textured or organic soils rowe and abdel magid 1995 chromium cr3 is found between 0 mg l 1 to 0 015 mg l 1 with an average value of 0 0023 mg l 1 which is below the who 2011 chromium is not generally recognized as essential for growing plants but it concentrations should be kept below 0 1 mg l 1 for any harmful effects to plants fipps 2015 iron fe3 concentration within the area ranged from 0 09 mg l 1 to 0 92 mg l 1 the sulfate so4 2 concentrations among the samples ranges from 0 08 mg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 which indicates a low sulfate concentration in the area fig 7k all of the collected samples have shown their sulfate ion concentration within the permissible limit for drinking water 250 mg l 1 who 2011 and for irrigation purposes 350 mg l 1 mine drainage waste may produce large amounts of so4 2 through oxidation of pyrite and chalcopyrite and also change the quality water due to rock water interaction or any type of anthropogenic influence belkhiri and mouni 2012 wilcox 1948 kelley 1940 phosphate po4 3 concentration varies from 0 08 mg l 1 to 2 3 mg l 1 with an average value of 0 4835 mg l 1 fao 1985 standard value of phosphate in water bodies used for irrigational purposes should be less than 2 mg l 1 ammonium ion nh4 concentration ranges from 0 22 to 1 07 mg l 1 is higher in the surface water than groundwater samples the concentration of the ammonium ion in sampled water has been found within the fao 1985 recommended value for irrigation purposes nitrate no3 concentration varies between 0 07 and 0 71 mg l 1 the concentration of the nitrate in irrigation water should be less than 10 mg l 1 fao 1985 carbonate concentration in the water alters from 4 3 mg l 1 to 18 mg l 1 chloride cl concentration ranges from 0 071 mg l 1 to 73 84 mg l 1 fig 7l according to fao 1985 the concentration of chloride in irrigation water can be ranged from 0 to 1065 mg l 1 the average concentration of the soluble silica sio2 is 28 82 mg l 1 it is very higher compared to the permissible limit 5 25 mg l 1 which clearly strengthens the dissolution and the weathering effect of the hardrock which contains 50 17 74 7 by weight of sio2 the concentration of the dissolved oxygen do in the samples have been noticed to vary from 30 65 saturation to 105 63 saturation dissolved oxygen may have a significant impact on plant health root development fertilizer and water uptake as well as yield the bi carbonate alkalinity around the area varies between 5 mg l 1 to 87 5 mg l 1 the quality of irrigation water is best as its bi carbonate concentration is less than 91 525 mg l 1 however the concentration of hco3 in examined samples varied from 5 mg l 1 to 87 5 mg l 1 the spatial distribution of the bi carbonate around the mhrmp area is shown in fig 8 4 2 water quality index a single number cannot tell the whole story of water quality there are many other water quality parameters that are not included in the index however a water quality index based on very important parameters can provide a simple indicator of water quality yogendra and puttaiah 2008 the water quality index values of all samples have been found between 59 63 and 94 92 indicating slightly marginal to excellent quality water the wqi value of both surface and groundwater samples have been shown in fig 9 it is clear that the surface water samples possess comparatively good quality water than groundwater for irrigation purposes 4 3 hydrogeochemical evaluation the chemical quality of water results from hydrogeological process of solution or precipitation of solid minerals reduction and oxidation compounds sorption or ion exchange pollution leaching fertilizers or manure and mixing of different waters abreha 2014 hounslow 1995 appelo and postuma 1993 these processes are dependent on water and rock interaction atmospheric inputs inputs of chemicals by human activities precipitation geological structure and mineralogy of aquifers howladar et al 2017 a abreha 2014 krishnaraj et al 2011 jeong 2001 hem 1985 freeze cherry 1980 the geochemical variations in the ionic concentrations in water can be understood when they are plotted along an x y coordinate kshetrimayum 2015 in the field of hydrogeochemical study hydrochemistry is a scientific approach used to understand the hydrochemical process evolution of water quality to examine human impacts against natural conditions krishnaraj et al 2011 hem 1985 freeze cherry 1980 the graph of so4 2 hco3 versus ca2 mg2 for water samples from both the groundwater and surface water shows most of the samples fall above the 1 1 line indicating the predominance of the ion exchanges fig 10 a the scatter diagram of na versus cl plot fig 10b and ca2 mg2 versus total cations tz plot suggests almost all of the samples fall near the 1 1 line fig 10c indicating that some ions are generated due to the weathering of silicate minerals kshetrimayum 2015 stallard and edmond 1983 the scatter graph of the plot of na k versus total cations tz fig 10d shows that most of the samples lies near to na k line indicating the involvement of silicate weathering in the geochemical process kshetrimayum 2015 stallard and edmond 1983 the presence of carbonic acid and sulfuric acid enhances weathering reactions if the weathering of carbonates is by carbonic acid the equivalent ratio of dissolved ca2 and hco3 in the groundwater resulting from calcite weathering is 1 2 whereas for dolomite weathering it is 1 4 kshetrimayum 2015 garrels and mackenzie 1971 if sulfuric acid is the weathering agent then the ca2 so4 2 ratio is almost 1 1 kshetrimayum 2015 das and kaur 2001 the scatter diagram of ca2 versus hco3 fig 10e shows that most of the water samples fall above the 1 2 line on the other hand in the scatter diagram of ca2 versus so4 2 all of the samples fall below the 1 1 and even 1 2 line fig 10f these clearly indicate that the dominance of calcite weathering in the little presence of sulfuric acid the hydrochemical facies of both the groundwater and surface water samples can be illustrated and hence classified into six categories as shown in table 6 according to their location fields in the trilinear diagram as shown in fig 11 the percentage reacting values of the cations and anions are plotted as a single value point according to trilinear coordinates at the lower left and right triangles respectively nagarajan et al 2012 in general we can classify the sample points in the piper diagram into six fields kumar 2013 nagarajan et al 2012 almost all of the surface water is characterized by ca2 hco3 water type this water generally considered as moderately soft category see fig 11 the durov diagram specifies the mixing of ion dissolution with a reverse ion exchanging tendency of water types see fig 12 4 4 statistical analysis correlation is widely used in statistical or numerical concepts for parametric classification of modeling studies rahman et al 2017 howladar et al 2017 b howladar and rahman 2016 kshetrimayum 2015 balasubramanian et al 1985 the results of the correlation matrices for 31 water samples from groundwater and surface water taking 14 variables are shown in table 7 a and table 7 b the results illustrates that in case of groundwater ec shows significant strong correlation at p 0 01 with tds k ca2 co3 2 cl and hco3 whereas in surface water samples it also shows strong correlation with mg2 the po4 2 does not shows significant correlation at p 0 01 with other variables except so4 2 r 0 72 but in case of surf ace water samples it shows strong positive correlation with ec tds na co3 2 and cl the pairs of na k na ca2 na co3 2 na cl na po4 2 show a significant strong correlation in surface water samples r 0 87 at p 0 01 but moderate correlation in ground water samples r 0 47 at p 0 01 indicating this ions are originated from the same sources which are exposed in surface conditions the weak correlation between ca2 and so4 2 ions in both types of water samples indicates less possibility of the presence of gypsum however the strong significant correlation between ca2 with co3 2 hco3 and cl are an indication of carbonate dissolution on the other hand sio2 shows moderate positive correlation with ph and hco3 for groundwater samples on the contrary it shows very strong negative correlation with ph but moderate negative correlation with ec tds na ca2 mg2 hco3 and cl these indicate the dissolution and weathering of the aluminosilicate minerals 4 5 water quality for irrigation around the mining area the important chemical constituents that affect the suitability of water for irrigation are the total concentrations of dissolved salts and the relative proportion of bicarbonate to calcium magnesium and relative proportion of sodium to calcium water quality problems in irrigation include salinity and alkalinity howladar 2017 b howladar et al 2013 2014 ewusi et al 2013 hossain et al 2010 the total salt concentration expressed by ec and relative proportions of na for irrigation jassas and merkel 2015 the excessive amount of salt concentration in water used for irrigation purposes is responsible for the increment of soil solution osmotic pressure and affects the chemical and physical properties of the plants and soil therefore the assessment of excess sodium content in irrigation water is essential for determining the suitability of that water for agricultural purposes sodium adsorption ratio sar is an important parameter that can be used for detecting the sodium hazard according to the sar classification 100 of maddhapara granite mine area water samples in were in excellent category which can be used for irrigation work sar can indicate the degree to which irrigation water tends to enter into cation exchange reactions in soil based on tds water for irrigation purposes can be classified by ussl 1954 96 77 of the water samples are in excellent and 3 23 of water samples in good qualities the primary effect of high ec water on crop productivity is the inability of the plant to compete with ions in the soil solution for water physiological drought the higher the ec the less water is available to plants even though the soil may appear wet because plants can only transpire pure water useable plant water in the soil solution decreases dramatically as ec increases actual yield reduction from irrigating with high ec water varies substantially bauder et al 2014 the wilcox diagram 1955 indicates that about 96 77 of the total water samples are in excellent qualities for irrigation purposes from the plot of wilcox diagram fig 13 it is visible that all samples are in the low sodium hazard and low to medium salinity hazard zones according to the irrigation water having excess of total co 3 2 and hco 3 over the total ca 2 and mg 2 is capable of forming alkaline which decreases soil permeability it is measured in terms of residual sodium carbonate rsc a rsc value less than 1 25 is considered as excellent quality water for irrigation purposes the study shows 100 of the water samples are in excellent quality for agricultural purposes table 8 the degree of equilibrium between water and minerals is assessed by the saturation indices bhat et al 2018 the calculated result of the langelier saturation index lsi has been shown in table 9 a negative index si indicates undersaturation condition and dissolution of mineral phase while neutral si is in equilibrium state with the mineral phase singh et al 2008 the result shows that 90 32 of the water samples were in undersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate undersaturated water has a tendency to dissolve calcite if the water comes in contact source rock therefore undersaturated water is responsible for the corrosion effect of the irrigation equipments in addition to at the end the overall summery of the water quality for irrigation has been shown in fig 14 5 conclusions a comparative study of the water around the mhrmp area has been carried out to evaluate the quality of water for irrigation purposes the hydrochemical analysis of the water samples shows that there are wide variations of the ph electrical conductity turbidity total alkalinity total hardness iron sodium chloride cadmium and soluble silica have found to exceeded the prescribed acceptable limit for drinking water the concentration of the sio2 in the water is higher than the natural limit this indicates a visual impact of hard rock in the area as this rock consisted of silica 50 17 74 7 by weight found in the mine area however for safe drinking water the silica concentration must be bellow 5 g kg 1 with an ld50 it indicates the possibility of the tremendous subsistence of silica dust in the air in the vicinity of the mine area as a result the area could be under a threat of being affected by the outbreaks of several diseases viz silicosis bronchitis or cancer due to the inhalation of the silica dust in air the wqi analysis shows that surface water are comparatively good quality than that of groundwater the graph of so4 2 hco3 versus ca2 mg2 indicates the predominance of the ion exchanges the scatter diagram of na versus clpointed out the excess of sodium ion due to the weathering of silicate minerals the scatter graph of ca2 mg2 versus total cations tz plot suggests that some ions of ca2 mg2 are produced due to the weathering of silicate minerals the plot of na k versus total cations tz reveals the involvement of silicate weathering in the geochemical process which contributes mainly sodium and potassium ions to water the trilinear diagram illustrates that 77 24 of water samples are showing the facies type of ca2 hco3 where 85 7 of the surface water falls in this category the durov diagram specifies the mixing of ion dissolution with a reverse ion exchanging tendency of water types the correlation matrix indicates the relationship and strength and the direction of the multivariate data irrigation waters classified on sar has shown that water qualities are in excellent categories based on tds 96 77 of the water samples are in excellent and 3 23 of water samples are in good qualities for irrigation purposes plotting of wilcox diagram it is visible that all samples are in the low sodium hazard and low to medium salinity hazard zones at the end from the collective results it can be concluded that water around the mining area is in good condition for irrigation use in addition the regular water quality analysis with time to time monitoring would give more

agricultural purpose around the mining area graphical abstract image 1 keywords hard rock mine hydrochemical characteristics wqi correlation matrix irrigation water quality 1 introduction water is indispensable for both life and civilization to date the pure water is part and parcel for all living beings on the other hand poor contaminated water can be frightened to the existence of the aquatic species health and environment as a whole however water is necessary and unavoidable natural resource because of its diverse uses but it is a matter of regret that this element is suffering for preserving its different physicochemical properties all over the world due to different activities where the human deeds are responsible comprehensively the mining is a major man made activity that has a serious impact on the water quality environment as well as ecological balance around mine surrounding area in case of metal mining minerals come in contact with groundwater from near aquifer zone and different major and trace elements may result through various physiochemical reaction the disposal of these mine waste water can cause change in physical and chemical water quality properties of surface water and also the heavy metal leaching often contains toxic and objectionable elements these elements contaminate the water and soil around the mine area as well as nearby river moreover the groundwater in the area can also be polluted because of water recharge from rivers channels ponds and also from agricultural lands the mining method which is applied in maddhapara hardrock granite mine is room and pillar sublevel stopping the groundwater seeping to the mine is increasing day by day for example the seeping rate of the mine was about 53 51 m3 hours in 2010 mgmcl 2010 but this rate gradually increased to about 92 m3 hours in 2015 as reported by the responsible authority of maddhapara granite mine company limited mgmcl as a result the impacts of groundwater discharge are also rising the hydrochemical characteristics consisted of physical and chemical parameters vary spatially and temporarily control the chemical composition of waters howladar 2012 hossain et al 2010 martinez and bocanegra 2002 apodaca et al 2002 the water quality index wqi can give an indication of the status of the watershed at various points it can be used to keep track of and analyze the changes of water quality time to time for appropriate actions the wqi can be used to monitor water quality changes in a particular water supply over time or it can be used to compare a water supply s quality with other water supplies in the region the wqi is one of the most widely used of all existing water quality procedures srivastava and kumar 2013 water quality index aims at giving a single value to the water of a source on the basis of one or the other system horton s 1965 water quality index is considered as the forerunner of the modern wqis abbasi and abbasi 2012 saeedi et al 2010 developed a wqi for groundwater quality monitoring by considering eight water quality parameters wqi was used by reza and singh 2010 to monitor the spatial temporal groundwater quality variations in india however previously the research about the ground water chemistry of two aquifers around the study area had been conducted by bashar et al 2008 which was on the water chemistry with no statistical analysis moreover it was done immediately after the production of hard rock had been started 2007 previously howladar et al 2017b had studied the water chemistry around the study area and examined the suitability of the water for drinking purposes thus the purpose of this study was to evaluate the hydrochemical characteristics and water quality for irrigation use by performing various statistical analyses around the study area in fact this study interpreted the obtained data set their similarities and dissimilarities and recognized the physicochemical parameters affecting water quality with the help of statistical analysis 2 study area the study area is located in maddhapara under the parbottipur upazila of dinajpur district the north western part of bangladesh and 330 km away from dhaka city maddhapara is located between latitude n 25 33 15 and n 25 34 13 and longitude e 89 3 30 to e 89 4 53 fig 1 the climate of this area can be characterized by hot season in summer moderate in monsoon and cool season in winter the highest average temperature generally takes place in june with a maximum of 38 8 c and average temperature during january is the lowest with a minimum of 7 c as bangladesh has a heavy rainfall the study area has a rainfall equivalent to 85 of annual rainfall in the monsoon season between june and october and comparatively little rainfall in the dry season from november to may the highest average humidity of this area is about 90 2 1 geology and stratigraphy based on the geological framework the country can be classified into two major parts namely a precambrian platform and b deeper basin or bengal foredeep reimann 1993 guha 1978 the precambrian platform is situated at north western part of bangladesh on the contrary the south eastern part is termed as basin or geosynclines the pre cambrian platform can be sub classified into a rangpur saddle and b bogra shelf however the basin part is split into two segments namely folded belt in eastern sides and bengal foredeep in relatively eastern part of the country fig 2 the study area is situated in rangpur saddle it is characterized by the thin sedimentary cover and the basement rock is buried at shallow depth the surrounding area is covered by the deposition of three different materials e g piedmont alluvium tista alluvium and barind tract piedmont alluvium dominates in most of the area covered by dinajpur and rangpur district it is a result of the flow of tista river the tista alluvium is underlain by brahmaputra jamuna floodplain barind tract is a alluvium which is further termed as madhupur clay the study area is drained by jamuna river in the west and jamuneswari river in the east side kalanadi river flows from west to south east and another river named chirnai flows from north to south east the subsurface of the study area can be characterized by highly fractured and fault controlled because of tectonic activity during the permo carboniferous period the basement rock is located at shallower depth the basement rock is located below the successive layers of alluvium soil 0 0 5 m madhupur clay 0 5 6 m dupi tila 6 120 m tura 120 141 m and the gondwana group 160 259 6 m the stratigraphic successions of the distinctive layers have been shown in table 1 as tabulated by bashar et al 2008 and karim 2001 the formation of the basement is of archean era they can be kaolinized granodiorite the weathered granodiorite and the fresh granodiorite the basement rock also includes fine grained silicified whitish granite pegmatite and dykes of micro granodiorite the geological cross section showing the rock types across the maddhapara hardrock mining project mhrmp area boreholes is shown in fig 3 2 2 hydrogeology there are two types of aquifers systems are present in maddhapara granite mine area bashar et al 2008 examined the hydrostratigraphy of the maddhapara granite mine area along two sections aa and bb as shown in fig 4 the upper aquifer is termed as porous aquifer and the lower aquifer is termed as fissure aquifer the porous aquifer is formed by the stratification of dupi tila tura and gondwana formation bashar et al 2008 the dupi tila formation consisted of fine particles of yellowish brown to medium grained sands and coarse grained pebbly sands besides the tura formation composed of fine to medium sands the gondwana formation covered by well rounded fine to medium grained feldspathic sandstone and pebbles these all formations form an overburden porous aquifer on the other hand the fissure aquifer is composing of an achaean weathered green granodiorite and fresh rocks it also makes up with numerous fractures joints and fissures which play a vital role to flow the water into this confined aquifer a white clay non permeable stratum composed of kaolin that isolates the porous aquifer and the fissure aquifer zones the thickness of the upper aquifer is about 128 m the flooding of the underground mine is the main hindrance for the ceaseless development of the mine pollutants released on the ground surface from mine activities may rapidly reach the aquifer and travel through preferential pathways ewusi et al 2017 tazioli et al 1995 moreover the rock itself contains many trace elements which may be mixed up with the water available in underground therefore the quality maintenance of the underground aquifer has become a matter of big challenges in rock mining area 3 methodology the water samples were collected from both surface and groundwater around the study area the latitude and longitude of sampling sites were recorded during sampling period fig 1 the 500 ml polyethylene pe bottles had been soaked with 1 1 hno3 solution and properly rinsed using demineralized water before sample collection in order to get proper samples properties the collecting bottles had been rinsed thoroughly for at least two times before samples poured into it the collected water samples are marked by s1 to s31 where the s2 s3 s5 s11 s24 s26 and s30 are surface water samples the remaining is underground water collected from shallow tube wells the samples were analyzed for ph turbidity t in ntu and electrical conductivity ec in μs cm 1 the test of these variables was performed instantly after the samples were collected by using in situ digital ph meter model 720 wtw service germany a digital turbidity meter model ec215 hanna instrument romana and a digital electrical conductivity meters respectively for getting precise measurements the collected samples were tightly packed and transported to the water treatment plant laboratory of the barapukuria thermal power station barapukuria dinajpur for chemical analysis on the same day and stored in temperature controlled air condition room during the analysis however before the analyses the respective meter was calibrated sincerely by using the specific standard solution the total hardness th mg l 1 total alkalinity ta mg l 1 and chloride cl mg l 1 were determined by titrimetric volumetric method by using a calibrated micro burette germany for each of the analytical parameters a minimum of three analyses were carried out and finally the average values are noted the concentrations of nitrate no3 mg l 1 silica sio2 mg l 1 phosphate po4 3 mg l 1 ammonia nh4 mg l 1 bicarbonate hco3 mg l 1 sulfate so4 2 mg l 1 fe3 mg l 1 cu2 mg l 1 and zn2 mg l 1 were estimated by using spectro photometric method using a uv spectrophotometer model 721 china the concentrations of na mg l 1 k mg l 1 ca2 mg l 1 mg2 mg l 1 as3 mg l 1 cd2 mg l 1 and cr3 mg l 1 were estimated by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas model pg 999 graphite furnace power supply acs 990 graphite furnace auto sampler china during the analyses of each parameter the proper calibrations for respective instruments were carried out all the chemicals used in these investigations were of reagent grade analytical grade made of e merck germany or bdh england in the overall investigation double de mineralized water ddmw was used to avoid any types of contamination tds mg l 1 values of water samples were analyzed by evaporating a certain amount 100 ml of sample water in normal atmospheric pressure moreover the detail process of analysis of various parameters of water samples explained previously by howladar et al 2017 a the water quality index wqi is a single numeric value expression that abridges multiple water quality parameters wqi is defined as a rating that reflects the composite influence of different water quality parameters pawar et al 2014 sahu and sikdar 2008 the quality of water can be predicted solely based on any single parameter this is because the value beyond the optimum limits of any of the parameters that plays significant role in irrigation water suitability can deteriorates its quality from guideline limits therefore wqi can summarize the resultant effects of some parameters and is capable of signifying the suitability of available water for irrigation purposes it has two parts namely q value and the weighting factor w the q value is an indication of water quality relative to 100 of one parameter the weighting factor sets the relative importance of the parameter to the overall water quality due to the missing of few variables that influence irrigation water quality in a great manner in this study wqi is calculated based on four variables such as total phosphates ph dissolved oxygen do and nitrate n the q value is calculated for the respective parameters from table 2 the q value for different respective measurements of the selected parameters can be taken by correlation from fig 5 or from table 2 the weighting factor wi for dissolved oxygen nitrate n total phosphates and ph is taken as 0 3 0 2 0 2 and 0 3 respectively according to their relative importance for irrigation purposes and the wqi is then calculated by the following formula hosseini moghari et al 2015 1 wqi i 1 i n q i wi where wi weighting factor that summarize the relative influencing value of respective parameter as fraction in order to simplify the calculation process a representative wqi calculation is shown in table 3 the wqi ranges from 1 to 100 that express the overall water quality at a specific location and time based on several water quality parameters where 1 and 100 indicating the poorest and best quality water respectively in order to classify the water quality as poor marginal fair good or excellent the designations within this range have been set by srivastava and kumar 2013 is given in table 4 the sodium content is usually expressed in terms of percent sodium or soluble sodium percentage na the excess absorption of sodium can cause sodium toxicity in sensitive plants causing marginal leaf burn on older foliage and possibly defoliation the water containing excessive amount of sodium may immobilize other nutrient ions particularly calcium magnesium and potassium which can result in deficiencies of these elements in plants nagaraju et al 2014 sharifi and safari sinegani 2012 todd and mays 2005 nwqms 2000 domenico and schwartz 1990 kelly 1951 sodium content expressed in terms of sodium percentage is defined as 2 na n a 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a k where all ionic concentrations are expressed in mill equivalents per liter meq l 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar is an important parameter that can be used for detecting the sodium hazard sar can be evaluated as a measure of excess of sodium or limited calcium and magnesium and expressed as 3 sodium absorption ratio sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where all ionic concentrations are expressed in mill equivalents per liter meq l 1 residual sodium carbonate rsc of irrigation water is used as an indication of the alkalinity hazard of soil for irrigation purposes it is calculated as a measurement of the excess sum of co 3 2 and hco 3 content in irrigation water over the total of ca 2 and mg 2 content and according to esmaeili vardanjani et al 2015 this excess amount influences the suitability of water for irrigation purposes it can be measured by following equation r s c h c o 3 c o 3 2 c a 2 m g 2 where all ionic concentrations are expressed in mill equivalents per liter meq l 1 the langelier saturation index lsi is used to assess the ability of the water to dissolve or precipitate calcium carbonate dissolution and precipitation reactions of minerals occur below the soil surface where their concentration is influenced by many environmental factors especially water rock interaction omar et al 2009 ronge and claesson 1982 lin and clemency 1980 it provides a degree of calcium carbonate saturation in water it is calculated using the ph alkalinity as caco3 mg l 1 calcium ion concentration mg l 1 total dissolved solids tds mg l 1 electrical conductivity ec μs cm 1 bicarbonate concentration hco3 as caco3 mg l 1 water temperature c etc langelier saturation indices for all the samples were calculated by using lenntech calculator https www lenntech com calculators langelier index langelier htm the box plot is a simplest way of displaying the distribution of data based on statistical parameters the box plot graph allows the differences between the measuring points to be identified and visually summarizes the quantitative data bilgin ayla 2015 box plot is used in this study because it is a simplest way usually used in data interpretation and analyses because it depicts the spatial and temporal variations of the water samples qualities machiwa and singh 2015 it gives the visual concept about the spread of data by showing five number summery tukey 1977 consisting of the minimum the first quartile the median the third quartile and the maximum as well as two other indictors namely the outliers and the extremes first and third quartile means below which 25 and 75 of the data fall respectively the middle quartile is termed as median inter quartile range iqr is the range between the 25th percentile and 75th percentiles outlier is either 1 5 iqr or more above the third quartile or 1 5 iqr or more below the first quartile extremes are either 3 iqr or more the third quartile and or 3 iqr or more the more below the first quartile 4 result and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry the hydrochemical study reveals that the quality of water is suitable for drinking agriculture and industrial uses in the area the descriptive statistical method is used for analyzing the hydrochemical characteristics of the water based on 25 variables are shown in table 5 the ph values of the water samples are found between 5 30 and 9 02 fig 6 the normal ph range for irrigation water is from 6 to 8 5 nagaraju et al 2014 ayers and westcot 1985 irrigation water with a ph outside the normal range may cause a nutritional imbalance or may contain toxic ions the electrical conductivity of water varies from 41 μs cm 1 to 587 μs cm 1 the ec values in groundwater samples are comparatively higher than surface water samples fig 7 a water with ec less than 250 μs cm 1 is considered good and with greater than 750 μs cm 1 is unsuitable for irrigation joshi et al 2009 the concentration of the total dissolved solids tds value varies from 24 to 382 mg l 1 it has been observed that the tds value is comparatively lower in groundwater samples fig 7b according to who 2011 the maximum permissible limit of tds for drinking water is 500 mg l 1 water with tds less than 450 mg l 1 is considered good joshi et al 2009 turbidity in the water varies between 3 ntu to 45 ntu with an average value of 10 742 ntu when maximum allowable turbidity value is stetted at 10 ntu it is obvious that the turbidity in the surface water samples is very much higher than that of groundwater samples fig 7c the total alkalinity ta value ranges between 5 mg l 1 and 88 mg l 1 as caco3 it is seen that ta values in surface water samples are comparatively higher fig 7d total hardness th value for the water samples varies from 2 5 mg l 1 to 87 5 mg l 1 as caco3 these values suggest that the water samples are soft to moderately hard fig 7e calcium ca2 concentration varies from 1 3 mg l 1 to 55 mg l 1 with an average value of 15 06 mg l 1 as caco3 which is within the acceptable limit for drinking purposes 75 mg l 1 as who 2011 standards fig 7f fao 1985 recommends concentration of calcium ions in irrigation water should be between 0 and 400 mg l 1 magnesium mg2 concentration varies from 1 mg l 1 to 41 mg l 1 with an average value of 15 06 mg l 1 as caco3 the permissible limit of mg2 concentration in drinking water is within 50 mg l 1 the fao 1985 recognized value of magnesium ion concentration in irrigation water should be less than 60 mg l 1 the concentration of magnesium in irrigation should be ranged from 0 to 5 mg l 1 the concentration of sodium na is found between 2 1 mg l 1 to 53 mg l 1 with an average of 14 34 mg l 1 as caco3 na concentration is comparatively higher in ground water samples fig 7g potassium k concentration in the water samples varies from 0 4 to 12 2 mg l 1 fig 7h the maximum allowable potassium in drinking water is below 10 mg l 1 who 2011 and for irrigation waters it should be in between 0 and 2 mg l 1 fao 1985 the concentrations of arsenic as3 in water samples are found within the permissible limit between 0 and 0 0017 mg l 1 fig 7i the concentrations of cadmium cd2 in the water samples are found beyond the permissible limit and ranges between 0 008 mg l 1 to 0 042 mg l 1 it has been found that cd2 in groundwater samples is usually higher than the other samples fig 7j the concentration of the zinc zn2 in the collected water samples are found between 0 08 mg l 1 to 0 32 mg l 1 zinc may be toxic to many plants at widely varying concentrations reduced toxicity at increased ph 6 or above and in fine textured or organic soils rowe and abdel magid 1995 chromium cr3 is found between 0 mg l 1 to 0 015 mg l 1 with an average value of 0 0023 mg l 1 which is below the who 2011 chromium is not generally recognized as essential for growing plants but it concentrations should be kept below 0 1 mg l 1 for any harmful effects to plants fipps 2015 iron fe3 concentration within the area ranged from 0 09 mg l 1 to 0 92 mg l 1 the sulfate so4 2 concentrations among the samples ranges from 0 08 mg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 which indicates a low sulfate concentration in the area fig 7k all of the collected samples have shown their sulfate ion concentration within the permissible limit for drinking water 250 mg l 1 who 2011 and for irrigation purposes 350 mg l 1 mine drainage waste may produce large amounts of so4 2 through oxidation of pyrite and chalcopyrite and also change the quality water due to rock water interaction or any type of anthropogenic influence belkhiri and mouni 2012 wilcox 1948 kelley 1940 phosphate po4 3 concentration varies from 0 08 mg l 1 to 2 3 mg l 1 with an average value of 0 4835 mg l 1 fao 1985 standard value of phosphate in water bodies used for irrigational purposes should be less than 2 mg l 1 ammonium ion nh4 concentration ranges from 0 22 to 1 07 mg l 1 is higher in the surface water than groundwater samples the concentration of the ammonium ion in sampled water has been found within the fao 1985 recommended value for irrigation purposes nitrate no3 concentration varies between 0 07 and 0 71 mg l 1 the concentration of the nitrate in irrigation water should be less than 10 mg l 1 fao 1985 carbonate concentration in the water alters from 4 3 mg l 1 to 18 mg l 1 chloride cl concentration ranges from 0 071 mg l 1 to 73 84 mg l 1 fig 7l according to fao 1985 the concentration of chloride in irrigation water can be ranged from 0 to 1065 mg l 1 the average concentration of the soluble silica sio2 is 28 82 mg l 1 it is very higher compared to the permissible limit 5 25 mg l 1 which clearly strengthens the dissolution and the weathering effect of the hardrock which contains 50 17 74 7 by weight of sio2 the concentration of the dissolved oxygen do in the samples have been noticed to vary from 30 65 saturation to 105 63 saturation dissolved oxygen may have a significant impact on plant health root development fertilizer and water uptake as well as yield the bi carbonate alkalinity around the area varies between 5 mg l 1 to 87 5 mg l 1 the quality of irrigation water is best as its bi carbonate concentration is less than 91 525 mg l 1 however the concentration of hco3 in examined samples varied from 5 mg l 1 to 87 5 mg l 1 the spatial distribution of the bi carbonate around the mhrmp area is shown in fig 8 4 2 water quality index a single number cannot tell the whole story of water quality there are many other water quality parameters that are not included in the index however a water quality index based on very important parameters can provide a simple indicator of water quality yogendra and puttaiah 2008 the water quality index values of all samples have been found between 59 63 and 94 92 indicating slightly marginal to excellent quality water the wqi value of both surface and groundwater samples have been shown in fig 9 it is clear that the surface water samples possess comparatively good quality water than groundwater for irrigation purposes 4 3 hydrogeochemical evaluation the chemical quality of water results from hydrogeological process of solution or precipitation of solid minerals reduction and oxidation compounds sorption or ion exchange pollution leaching fertilizers or manure and mixing of different waters abreha 2014 hounslow 1995 appelo and postuma 1993 these processes are dependent on water and rock interaction atmospheric inputs inputs of chemicals by human activities precipitation geological structure and mineralogy of aquifers howladar et al 2017 a abreha 2014 krishnaraj et al 2011 jeong 2001 hem 1985 freeze cherry 1980 the geochemical variations in the ionic concentrations in water can be understood when they are plotted along an x y coordinate kshetrimayum 2015 in the field of hydrogeochemical study hydrochemistry is a scientific approach used to understand the hydrochemical process evolution of water quality to examine human impacts against natural conditions krishnaraj et al 2011 hem 1985 freeze cherry 1980 the graph of so4 2 hco3 versus ca2 mg2 for water samples from both the groundwater and surface water shows most of the samples fall above the 1 1 line indicating the predominance of the ion exchanges fig 10 a the scatter diagram of na versus cl plot fig 10b and ca2 mg2 versus total cations tz plot suggests almost all of the samples fall near the 1 1 line fig 10c indicating that some ions are generated due to the weathering of silicate minerals kshetrimayum 2015 stallard and edmond 1983 the scatter graph of the plot of na k versus total cations tz fig 10d shows that most of the samples lies near to na k line indicating the involvement of silicate weathering in the geochemical process kshetrimayum 2015 stallard and edmond 1983 the presence of carbonic acid and sulfuric acid enhances weathering reactions if the weathering of carbonates is by carbonic acid the equivalent ratio of dissolved ca2 and hco3 in the groundwater resulting from calcite weathering is 1 2 whereas for dolomite weathering it is 1 4 kshetrimayum 2015 garrels and mackenzie 1971 if sulfuric acid is the weathering agent then the ca2 so4 2 ratio is almost 1 1 kshetrimayum 2015 das and kaur 2001 the scatter diagram of ca2 versus hco3 fig 10e shows that most of the water samples fall above the 1 2 line on the other hand in the scatter diagram of ca2 versus so4 2 all of the samples fall below the 1 1 and even 1 2 line fig 10f these clearly indicate that the dominance of calcite weathering in the little presence of sulfuric acid the hydrochemical facies of both the groundwater and surface water samples can be illustrated and hence classified into six categories as shown in table 6 according to their location fields in the trilinear diagram as shown in fig 11 the percentage reacting values of the cations and anions are plotted as a single value point according to trilinear coordinates at the lower left and right triangles respectively nagarajan et al 2012 in general we can classify the sample points in the piper diagram into six fields kumar 2013 nagarajan et al 2012 almost all of the surface water is characterized by ca2 hco3 water type this water generally considered as moderately soft category see fig 11 the durov diagram specifies the mixing of ion dissolution with a reverse ion exchanging tendency of water types see fig 12 4 4 statistical analysis correlation is widely used in statistical or numerical concepts for parametric classification of modeling studies rahman et al 2017 howladar et al 2017 b howladar and rahman 2016 kshetrimayum 2015 balasubramanian et al 1985 the results of the correlation matrices for 31 water samples from groundwater and surface water taking 14 variables are shown in table 7 a and table 7 b the results illustrates that in case of groundwater ec shows significant strong correlation at p 0 01 with tds k ca2 co3 2 cl and hco3 whereas in surface water samples it also shows strong correlation with mg2 the po4 2 does not shows significant correlation at p 0 01 with other variables except so4 2 r 0 72 but in case of surf ace water samples it shows strong positive correlation with ec tds na co3 2 and cl the pairs of na k na ca2 na co3 2 na cl na po4 2 show a significant strong correlation in surface water samples r 0 87 at p 0 01 but moderate correlation in ground water samples r 0 47 at p 0 01 indicating this ions are originated from the same sources which are exposed in surface conditions the weak correlation between ca2 and so4 2 ions in both types of water samples indicates less possibility of the presence of gypsum however the strong significant correlation between ca2 with co3 2 hco3 and cl are an indication of carbonate dissolution on the other hand sio2 shows moderate positive correlation with ph and hco3 for groundwater samples on the contrary it shows very strong negative correlation with ph but moderate negative correlation with ec tds na ca2 mg2 hco3 and cl these indicate the dissolution and weathering of the aluminosilicate minerals 4 5 water quality for irrigation around the mining area the important chemical constituents that affect the suitability of water for irrigation are the total concentrations of dissolved salts and the relative proportion of bicarbonate to calcium magnesium and relative proportion of sodium to calcium water quality problems in irrigation include salinity and alkalinity howladar 2017 b howladar et al 2013 2014 ewusi et al 2013 hossain et al 2010 the total salt concentration expressed by ec and relative proportions of na for irrigation jassas and merkel 2015 the excessive amount of salt concentration in water used for irrigation purposes is responsible for the increment of soil solution osmotic pressure and affects the chemical and physical properties of the plants and soil therefore the assessment of excess sodium content in irrigation water is essential for determining the suitability of that water for agricultural purposes sodium adsorption ratio sar is an important parameter that can be used for detecting the sodium hazard according to the sar classification 100 of maddhapara granite mine area water samples in were in excellent category which can be used for irrigation work sar can indicate the degree to which irrigation water tends to enter into cation exchange reactions in soil based on tds water for irrigation purposes can be classified by ussl 1954 96 77 of the water samples are in excellent and 3 23 of water samples in good qualities the primary effect of high ec water on crop productivity is the inability of the plant to compete with ions in the soil solution for water physiological drought the higher the ec the less water is available to plants even though the soil may appear wet because plants can only transpire pure water useable plant water in the soil solution decreases dramatically as ec increases actual yield reduction from irrigating with high ec water varies substantially bauder et al 2014 the wilcox diagram 1955 indicates that about 96 77 of the total water samples are in excellent qualities for irrigation purposes from the plot of wilcox diagram fig 13 it is visible that all samples are in the low sodium hazard and low to medium salinity hazard zones according to the irrigation water having excess of total co 3 2 and hco 3 over the total ca 2 and mg 2 is capable of forming alkaline which decreases soil permeability it is measured in terms of residual sodium carbonate rsc a rsc value less than 1 25 is considered as excellent quality water for irrigation purposes the study shows 100 of the water samples are in excellent quality for agricultural purposes table 8 the degree of equilibrium between water and minerals is assessed by the saturation indices bhat et al 2018 the calculated result of the langelier saturation index lsi has been shown in table 9 a negative index si indicates undersaturation condition and dissolution of mineral phase while neutral si is in equilibrium state with the mineral phase singh et al 2008 the result shows that 90 32 of the water samples were in undersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate undersaturated water has a tendency to dissolve calcite if the water comes in contact source rock therefore undersaturated water is responsible for the corrosion effect of the irrigation equipments in addition to at the end the overall summery of the water quality for irrigation has been shown in fig 14 5 conclusions a comparative study of the water around the mhrmp area has been carried out to evaluate the quality of water for irrigation purposes the hydrochemical analysis of the water samples shows that there are wide variations of the ph electrical conductity turbidity total alkalinity total hardness iron sodium chloride cadmium and soluble silica have found to exceeded the prescribed acceptable limit for drinking water the concentration of the sio2 in the water is higher than the natural limit this indicates a visual impact of hard rock in the area as this rock consisted of silica 50 17 74 7 by weight found in the mine area however for safe drinking water the silica concentration must be bellow 5 g kg 1 with an ld50 it indicates the possibility of the tremendous subsistence of silica dust in the air in the vicinity of the mine area as a result the area could be under a threat of being affected by the outbreaks of several diseases viz silicosis bronchitis or cancer due to the inhalation of the silica dust in air the wqi analysis shows that surface water are comparatively good quality than that of groundwater the graph of so4 2 hco3 versus ca2 mg2 indicates the predominance of the ion exchanges the scatter diagram of na versus clpointed out the excess of sodium ion due to the weathering of silicate minerals the scatter graph of ca2 mg2 versus total cations tz plot suggests that some ions of ca2 mg2 are produced due to the weathering of silicate minerals the plot of na k versus total cations tz reveals the involvement of silicate weathering in the geochemical process which contributes mainly sodium and potassium ions to water the trilinear diagram illustrates that 77 24 of water samples are showing the facies type of ca2 hco3 where 85 7 of the surface water falls in this category the durov diagram specifies the mixing of ion dissolution with a reverse ion exchanging tendency of water types the correlation matrix indicates the relationship and strength and the direction of the multivariate data irrigation waters classified on sar has shown that water qualities are in excellent categories based on tds 96 77 of the water samples are in excellent and 3 23 of water samples are in good qualities for irrigation purposes plotting of wilcox diagram it is visible that all samples are in the low sodium hazard and low to medium salinity hazard zones at the end from the collective results it can be concluded that water around the mining area is in good condition for irrigation use in addition the regular water quality analysis with time to time monitoring would give more qualitative and quantitative insights of the mining impact on water and ecological environment around the area conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest authors

12314,groundwater modelers usually delineate wellhead protection areas whpas assuming steady state flow conditions however time varying groundwater flow conditions dynamically change the area from which the water is actually pumped for instance seasonal changes in the ambient flow direction might bring locations with hazardous land use activities e g gas stations or agricultural lands into the actual abstraction zone for parts of the year thus steady state whpa solutions can become inadequate for reliable drinking water well protection of course one might simply enlarge the delineated whpa to account for all seasonal conditions but this could lead to a massive enlargement of required whpas the goal of this paper is to present a management scheme that reduces the influence of transient flow on the actual abstraction zone by optimally re distributing pumping rates within well fields we solve our management problem utilizing time dependent multiobjective optimization moo concepts to search for compromise solutions that consider three objectives 1 to minimize the risk of pumping water from outside a given whpa 2 to minimize the gap between groundwater supply and demand and 3 to minimize the involved costs of pumping additionally we address aquifer heterogeneity through scenarios representative of the uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity our results from a synthetic application case show that 1 the competitiveness among the objectives shows that the moo formulation is a valid approach 2 an optimal dynamic pumping scheme can indeed reduce the transient influence on the actual abstraction zone while still covering the groundwater demand 3 implementing optimal pumping rates leads to a more densely utilized and more static capture area 4 geological uncertainty has an important influence on the obtained optimal set of solutions and should be included via monte carlo simulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords well catchment delineation groundwater protection transient flow conditions risk assessment multiobjective optimization 1 introduction wellhead protection areas whpas are one of the most widespread strategies followed by many drinking water protection programs in order to prevent pollution of drinking water wells us epa 1993 in general the whpa approach consists on outlining time of travel capture areas around drinking water wells within these areas one restricts hazardous land use activities that have the potential to contaminate the groundwater flowing towards the wells one of the main assumptions usually taken by groundwater modelers is to neglect the impact of time varying flow conditions during whpa analysis instead the standard routine is to assume one single allegedly representative steady state flow condition however nature is transient and thus the actual time of travel capture area has a dynamic outline with no guarantee to remain within the delineated whpa transiency in groundwater flow can be triggered by several sources for instance the transition between dry and rainy seasons can lead to a dynamic water demand that increases and decreases respectively the required groundwater abstraction of a well field the influence of transient pumping conditions on whpa analysis has been analyzed by ramanarayanan et al 1995 they observed how unsteady pumping rate conditions expand the required whpa outline compared to its equivalent steady state delineation they concluded that transient pumping seems not to average out with time and thus should be included in whpa analysis furthermore seasonal dynamics and stochastically occurring weather conditions can also lead to changes in the outline of the actual abstraction area triggered by changes in both the regional flow direction and the regional hydraulic gradient festger and walter 2002 analyzed the influence of both conditions and concluded that such variations influence the size of the actual abstraction zone by shifting expanding or shrinking its outline recently rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 investigated the effects of uncertain transient flow conditions in probabilistic whpa delineation they showed through four selected transient drivers how the involved transience triggers significant changes in whpa delineation when compared to equivalent steady state solutions from this they concluded that working under steady state conditions is not enough instead they showed how a transient capture area calls for delineation of larger whpas to reduce the fraction of time per year where water is pumped from outside the delineated area they also provided a combined probabilistic frequentistic delineation rule as a way out however the obtained whpas are always larger than steady state based whpas enlarging a whpa might not be an issue in rural areas dominated by forests or with non intensive farming but in densely populated areas especially with industrial activities larger whpas become difficult to implement even in domestic areas oil tanks for heating or major motorways are an issue therefore alternative solution strategies to handle transience are required we argue that once one starts caring about transient flow one could just as well use tailored dynamic pumping schemes within the well field to counteract natural fluctuation and thus reduce the dynamic changes in the actual abstraction outline dynamically managed pumping schemes are the most straightforward way out since natural transient effects e g regional gradients cannot be brought under human control many research papers about optimal pumping management schemes can been found in the literature most of these studies address sustainable management of groundwater resources involving quantity and quality issues singh et al 2013 singh 2014 a and singh et al 2014 b gaur et al 2015 cyriac and rastogi 2016 or solutions for groundwater remediation kitanidis and kitanidis 1990 huang and mayer 1997 mays and neupauer 2012 li et al 2014 piscopo et al 2015 when adapting such schemes to whpa management one should consider at least three objectives 1 to minimize groundwater abstraction from outside of a predefined whpa 2 to minimize groundwater disparity between demand and supply and 3 to minimize the involved costs of pumping these three objectives seem to conflict with one another for example a pumping scheme that rigorously restricts the actual abstraction zone to an existing whpa may not meet the water demand additionally a strong redistribution of pumping rates can lead to locally stronger drawdown and hence increases the energy costs for pumping therefore we propose to utilize multi objective optimization moo concepts marler and arora 2004 using this formulation if a management solution improves at least one of the aforementioned objectives without being worse in any of the other objectives it is acknowledged as a so called non dominated solution the set of all non dominated solutions forms what is called a pareto front the pareto front is a list of all meaningful trade off options between the three selected objectives and the final selection for a specific solution is based on decision rules or discussions that reflect the preferences of the decision maker furthermore given the dynamic behavior of our groundwater system our dynamic multi objective optimization dmoo problem azzouz et al 2017 has to continuously search for new optimal pumping decisions that address the current state of a dynamic system so that the pareto front changes and has to be tracked over time hence our management scheme requires to solve the moo problem in a dynamic way e g by re optimizing at a sequence of time steps additionally it is essential to consider the impact that spatial variability and uncertainty of aquifer properties e g hydraulic conductivity have on whpa analysis the impact of geological uncertainty has been widely analyzed in the literature e g franzetti and guadagnini 1996 leeuwen et al 1998 vassolo et al 1998 stauffer et al 2004 enzenhoefer et al 2012 enzenhoefer et al 2014 consequently dynamic pumping strategies that would not consider uncertainty could not be considered robust instead they would represent over confident management strategies that perform worse in practice than what is expected during the optimization and decision making in our study we address robustness through monte carlo simulation over conditioned hydraulic conductivity fields the contribution of this paper is to formulate and develop a multi objective dynamic management model with the goal to reduce and deliver control to the decision maker of the changes in the actual abstraction outline compared to the delineated whpa caused by transient flow conditions thus model based steady state whpas together with analytic scheme outlines can represent a robust and still valid solution against unconsidered dynamics of the flow environment our proposed scheme achieves this via dynamically adapting and re distributing pumping rates of individual wells in a well field to avoid infeasible decisions it works with trade off solutions among aforementioned competitive three objectives the remainder of this study is structured as follows first in section 2 1 we describe our intended management scheme and we formulate the corresponding dynamic multiobjective optimization problem later we extend our moo problem to provide robustness over geological uncertainty see section 2 3 finally in section 2 4 we extend to a dynamic moo problem and explain the decision rules we use for selecting pareto solutions at each time interval in section 3 we present the used methodology to carry out our novel pumping management approach section 4 describes a 3d synthetic application model and provide implementation detail results and corresponding discussions are found in section 5 while the conclusion and outlook are presented in section 6 2 the proposed pumping rate management strategy 2 1 management problems in safe groundwater production due to transient flow conditions most groundwater protection programs use whpas to safeguard groundwater abstraction against pollution fig 1 highlights in black a typical whpa of a well field composed of eight drinking water wells that during whpa analysis assumes a complete knowledge about heterogeneous aquifer conditions hence the irregular whpa geometry and steady state conditions likewise fig 1 highlights in red a larger additional outline for the same well field that accounts for transient flow conditions influencing the whpa analysis rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 thus the goal of our suggested pumping management approach is to optimally re distribute pumping rates so that the adapted capture area remains within the original steady state whpa solution even in transient environment and so to avoid the whpa enlargement sketched in fig 1 to achieve this we investigate over a defined time horizon whether the predicted abstraction zone driven by transient flow and pumping rate conditions exceeds the given whpa if yes we counter this exceedance by re adjusting for the analyzed time horizon the pumping rates we use the indicator map i s x θ for the actually delineated whpa this indicator map marks all locations x inside the whpa with i s 1 and i s 0 otherwise θ are hydrogeological parameters influencing the whpa delineation such as hydraulic conductivity or porosity likewise for the predicted transient time of travel abstraction area we use the indicator map i d t x θ q τ α τ additional for being dependent on aquifer parameters θ the dynamic capture zone predicted at time t into the future depends on pumping rates at q τ and groundwater transient conditions α τ acting over some relevant time interval τ for the latter indicator map to simplify notation we use its shorter expression i d t x θ the predicted abstraction zone results from the combined influence of past ambient transient flow conditions and past pumping either optimally rearranged or not with forecasted ambient flow behavior and suggested pumping rate management thus the time interval τ starts in the past of t and extends into the future of t to evaluate whether the whpa currently delineated remains valid as protection measure for the forthcoming stress period our framework compares for any suggested future pumping rate i s x θ to i d t x θ in plain words we anew the extent of area in i d that is not protected by i s we base the evaluation of a suggested pumping management on three aspects of relevant interest in whpa analysis 1 its quality which describes the extent of area in i d t x θ that currently contributes with groundwater to the well field without being protected by i s 2 the quantity of actual groundwater demand not fulfilled by the suggested pumping strategy and 3 the efficiency of the suggested management scheme interpreted as the costs for pumping operation over the studied time horizon these three metrics are in fact competing among each other for example a pumping rate management strategy that always fulfills the actual groundwater demand will necessarily violate the given whpa outline when compared to a solution with lesser groundwater supply and of course it will represent a more expensive management strategy however different management strategies producing the same quantity of groundwater would not necessarily lead to the same size and shape of the actual abstraction zone as we can re distribute the pumping rate within the well field in order to find pumping management conditions that represent optimal management solutions in the face of transient flow behavior and geological uncertainty we use multi objective optimization moo concepts marler and arora 2004 searching for compromise solutions among the considered three aspects 2 2 multi objective optimization formulation based on the approach described above we formulate the following moo problem 1 q o p t τ d e c θ α τ d e c α τ p a s t q τ p a s t argmin q q f d e l q τ d e c θ α τ d e c α τ p a s t q τ p a s t f g w s q τ d e c θ α τ d e c α τ p a s t q τ p a s t f c o s t q τ d e c θ α τ d e c α τ p a s t q τ p a s t t t 0 δ τ d e c here q o p t τ d e c is an optimal pumping rate solution q for the upcoming management period τ d e c starting at the current time t the suggested pumping rates q τ d e c are subject to the constraints q q such as being positive satisfying a minimal required groundwater supply or remaining below maximal admitted values each optimal pumping solution aims to reduce the influence of forecasted groundwater transient flow conditions α τ d e c e g regional changes in the hydraulic gradient or seasonal groundwater recharge while conditioned to past pumping rates q τ p a s t and past groundwater transient flow conditions α τ p a s t the sum of these two time intervals τ p a s t and τ d e c defines a time interval τ which we use for capture analysis for instance if we want to provide an optimal pumping rate management for the upcoming 30 days τ d e c 30 of a one year time of travel whpa outline τ 365 days τ p a s t 335 days represents the relevant past time interval of already experienced transient flow behavior these time intervals are illustrated in fig 2 hence in order to solve eq 1 we would run for each suggested pumping management alternative the same natural transient flow and pumping rates over time τ p a s t once each alternative reaches time τ p a s t the suggested pumping rate alternative would run over τ d e c 30 days until it reaches the total time simulation τ τ p a s t τ d e c then for each suggested pumping rate management we evaluate its performance through three objective functions f d e l f g w s and f c o s t which are explained in the following exceedance area f d e l eq 2 describes integrated over time the extent of area in the overall domain ω that is within the predicted transient groundwater abstraction area i d t x θ and exceeds the whpa outline highlighted by i s x θ to compute this exceedance area we solve a transport problem for the suggested pumping rate strategy using an available whpa transient simulator see section 4 2 for instance if f d e l 0 then the predicted capture zone will fully remain inside the given whpa during all of τ d e c minimizing f d e l corresponds to the quality goal 1 formulated in section 2 1 2 f d e l θ q τ d e c t t δ τ d e c ω 1 i s x θ i d t x θ d x d t groundwater shortage f g w s the objective function for groundwater shortage depicts the difference in the water volume between the expected groundwater demand d τ d e c and the suggested groundwater supply s q τ d e c that corresponds to a suggested pumping scheme q τ d e c in our analysis we discard any pumping management alternative that would lead to undersupply in case of sufficient groundwater availability within the given whpa and formulate this as part of the constraints q q minimizing f g w s represents the quantity goal 2 from section 2 1 3 f g w s q τ d e c d τ d e c s τ d e c q 4 s q τ d e c k 1 n k t t δ τ d e c q k τ d e c d τ here q k τ d e c is the pumping rate at well k during time interval τ d e c and n k is the number of wells in the well field as additional constraints our optimization problem is subject to a maximum allowed pumping rate q m a x for each well and to the prohibition of injection 0 q k τ d e c q m a x involved costs f c o s t we evaluate the energy costs of the management scheme over the considered time horizon τ d e c using the following expression 5 f c o s t q τ d e c a k 1 n k t t δ τ d e c q k τ d e c h k d τ as stated by katsifarakis et al 2018 eq 5 can be used for any aquifer type with a describing the energy cost per pumped volume and vertical height which for the sake of simplicity is assumed constant in this study here h k τ d e c is the time dependent depth of the water level at each well location that is predicted from the simulated groundwater flow conditions over time τ d e c as additional constraint within q q we constrain the dynamic drawdown at each well h k τ d e c to h k τ d e c h m a x at all times where h m a x is a maximum allowed drawdown the solution of eq 1 provides a set of all non dominated solutions that forms a pareto front each of these solutions depicts an optimal pumping management alternative because at least one of its objectives improves over other alternatives without sacrificing the performance of the remaining objectives marler and arora 2004 2 3 integrating model uncertainty into the multi objective optimization in the practice any optimal management strategy from eq 1 will represent an over confident management alternative that deviates from the expected performance this is due to the high sensitivity that capture analysis has towards geological uncertainty in order to achieve robustness against this uncertainty we evaluate our moo formulation over an ensemble of n monte carlo realizations that represents the uncertainty triggered by the limited knowledge we have about the model parameters θ after computing the objective function for each monte carlo realization we average over them and then solve the moo problem again to get a pareto front of expected goal attainment levels thus we replace the objective functions in eq 1 with their expected objectives functions f d e l θ f g w s θ f c o s t s θ 6 q o p t τ d e c θ argmin q q f d e l θ q τ d e c θ f g w s θ q τ d e c θ f c o s t θ q τ d e c θ t t 0 δ τ d e c although in this study the implemented concept of robustness rest on expected values alternative statistics such as percentiles or the use of extreme scenarios can be implemented 2 4 dynamic decision making within the dynamic multi objective optimization the obvious dynamic nature of our groundwater system makes the pareto front evolve over time resulting in dynamic optimal pumping rate management our moo formulation will permanently search for new pumping management alternatives whenever the groundwater flow conditions change therefore a decision maker will dynamically need to select from the evolving pareto front the pumping management strategy to use we discretize the dynamic decision making with piecewise constant pumping rates in each time horizon τ d e c to select from these pareto alternatives in every time step one possibility is to use the actual decision maker s preferences inside the simulation optimization loop to select the best ranked alternatives however for automation of our analysis we emulate four decision rules that allow us to construct dynamic decision paths that any decision maker can easily understand and implement 1 decision rule a meeting the demand to prioritize groundwater supply we select among pareto solutions with the smallest penalties for groundwater shortage the one that achieves the lowest penalty in exceedance area 2 decision rule b risk aversion we pick from all solutions that minimize penalty in exceedance area the pareto alternative that achieves the lowest penalty in supply shortage this decision criterion switches priorities with respect to the previous one this management alternative will inevitably require to rely on external water sources to cover the missing gap in water supply 3 decision rule c best compromise is to select the pareto solution with the so called best compromise alternative between the three considered objective values this optimal solution has the smallest euclidean distance to an idealistic unattainable scenario situated at the coordinates origin of the objective values talbi 2009 4 as decision rule d conventional we select the pareto solution that always follows the demand like a but uses spatially uniform pumping for all wells in the well field we use this management alternative for contrasting optimal pumping i e the previous decision rules with a management alternative considered as non optimal 3 methodology in the present section we describe the methodology we use to carry out our novel pumping management approach furthermore we explain how we achieve robust pareto fronts in the face of geological uncertainty 3 1 groundwater transient flow simulation to simulate transient groundwater flow we use the whpa transient simulator developed by rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 it solves the groundwater flow equation described by 7 s s ϕ t k ϕ q s x t in ω here k is hydraulic transmissivity ϕ is hydraulic head s s is specific storage and q s x t is the sink source term in the domain ω the boundary conditions for eq 7 are 8 k ϕ n q ˆ t on γ 1 ϕ ϕ ˆ t on γ 2 where q ˆ and ϕ ˆ are predefined fluxes and heads on neumann γ 1 and dirichlet γ 2 boundaries respectively and n is the outward directed unit normal to γ where γ γ 1 γ 2 3 2 transport simulation under transient flow conditions to simulate contaminant transport for conservative tracers the transient model solves the advection dispersion equation 9 c t v c d c 0 in ω here c is concentration t is time v q n e is velocity q is darcy velocity n e is effective porosity assumed constant in this study and d is the hydromechanic dispersion tensor scheidegger 1954 given by 10 d α t v d e i α l α t v v t v with longitudinal and transversal dispersivities α l and α t respectively effective diffusion coefficient d e and the identity matrix i eq 9 is subject to the boundary conditions 11 n v c n d c j ˆ on γ 1 12 c c ˆ on γ γ 1 here j ˆ is a prescribed normal flux density and c ˆ represents prescribed concentrations 3 3 optimal management of pumping rate conditions in groundwater production to start with our dmoo analysis we define and store a given whpa solution i s x θ that defines the quality compliance criterion f d e l then for each pumping scheme q τ i suggested by our dmoo at the current time interval t i we conduct the following steps first for the current stress period under analysis we solve a forward advective dispersive transport problem batches of particles are continuously injected at times t j in the entire domain outside the given whpa to save computational time of tracking particles injected over the entire domain rock and kupfersberger 2002 it is sufficient to restrict particle release to a compliance testing zone around the whpa then based on the grid used for flow discretization we inject one particle at the center of each grid cell in the buffer zone afterwards particles from previous times τ d e c and recently injected move throughout the domain for the current τ d e c or until they completed their life time τ i or when they reach the well field the transport of particles under transient conditions requires a brief explanation about the different time discretizations used for flow and transport simulation and how they couple with our dmoo formulation in comparison to steady state flow scenarios when particles are released under time varying flow conditions these particles experience during their life cycle sequences of different velocity fields hence to tailor our dmoo formulation with the available model we use δ t d e c to discretize the transient flow time domain thus states of transient boundary conditions are discretized into piecewise constant changes at points in time t d e c likewise we use times t j t t δ t d e c to discretize the continuous injection of particles in time at which we release a new batch of particles each batch of particles is tracked until it reaches a maximum relevant life time which for purposes of our optimization analysis it is the time of travel capture distance τ or δ t d e c for a deeper explanation about the mathematical treatment and the assumptions taken by the whpa transient model to simulate transient groundwater flow as a consecutive set of steady state scenarios the interested reader is referred to rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 second using the information of the previous particle tracking analysis we generate the boolean yes no capture map representation i d t x θ of the predicted transient groundwater abstraction area within this boolean capture map each map pixel x i receives an indicator value of one if a particle released in it at time t j reaches the well field within the current τ d e c third we compute the respective objective values according to the suggested pumping rate and obtained capture map see section 2 2 fourth we solve a moo problem using eq 1 to find compromise solutions between the three considered objective functions this uses the algorithm to be explained in section 4 2 and requires to repeat steps 1 2 and 3 many times finally as the fifth step we select using the decision criteria explained in 2 4 and implement the preferred optimal pumping strategy then the whpa transient simulation continues with the evaluation of the next time interval τ d e c until is completed the total simulation time 4 test case scenario and numerical implementation for the sake of clarity we demonstrate and discuss our proposed methodology using a synthetic model scenario first we describe the model domain then we introduce the numerical methods and implementation used in our novel dmoo formulation 4 1 test case scenario our model scenario resembles a rectangular 3d domain that is confined by a leaky aquifer on top that permits recharge see fig 3 our synthetic model is equally discretized by d x d y d z 15 m and has an extent of 5 250 m 5 250 m 60 m we represent a well field located in the eastern part of the model with a row of eight fully penetrating wells depicted in fig 3 as blue circles with 160 m separation distance between each other in our approach we do not infer transient flow behavior from observed data neither do we forecast future transient flow conditions both are beyond of the scope of this study instead we assume that there is an accurate characterization of transient drivers sufficient knowledge of transient drivers is an acceptable assumption for whpa programs that actively survey groundwater flow behavior our model represents transiency via three transient conditions that are often observed on seasonal scale i changes in the regional groundwater flow direction ii varying strength of the regional hydraulic gradient and iii changing natural recharge to the groundwater for simplicity all three transient drivers will follow sinusoidal patterns of given frequency ω π year and phase shift values φ n 0 likewise we address the time variant groundwater demand following a sinusoidal behavior but using a phase shift value of opposite magnitude to groundwater recharge φ n 180 with stronger pumping taking place during the dry season and vice versa conlon et al 2005 the model uses prescribed fluxes and heads for the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions see fig 3 we set the total simulation time for the dmoo formulation to 720 days with τ 360 days thus outlining whpas of 360 days of total travel time the time length of every decision time step is τ d e c 40 days we release every four days δ t j a new batch of particles into a delimited area to reconcile our model with the time discretization of our optimization approach see sections 2 2 and 2 3 we set each aquifer stress period used to approximate the transient environment to last time τ d e c ergo each decision interval τ d e c represents a stress period influenced by different transient flow and pumping rate conditions at which we search for optimal pumping rate management in fig 3 the black outline depicts the fixed steady state whpa delineation using the mean magnitude of pumping and transient drivers while the red outline defines the whpa that account for transient flow conditions computed according to rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 with 100 time reliability due to transient influence the total area of the red transient delineation is 30 bigger than the fixed steady state whpa solution the goal of our dmoo framework is to cope with the fixed too small whpa we treat hydraulic conductivity as a random space function described by a matérn covariance function minasny and mcbratney 2005 using the parameters listed in table 1 fig 3 shows the realization of the hydraulic conductivity field used as synthetic truth scenario in order to evaluate our dmoo formulation see section 5 1 then to analyze our dmoo problem against geological uncertainty conditions see section 5 3 we use the same set of geostatistical covariance parameters to generate an ensemble of 100 hydraulic conductivity realizations each hydraulic conductivity field is conditioned to a set of 40 hydraulic conductivity measurements which were taken at ten different locations 4 measurements per location each measurement is taken at each of the four grid cells representing depth of our initial synthetic truth realization the position of each taken measurement is highlighted with black squares in fig 3 to generate our ensemble of conditioned hydraulic conductivity fields we use the fft based geostatistical tool described in fritz et al 2009 fritz et al 2009 4 2 numerical implementation to simulate groundwater transient flow conditions see section 3 1 the available whpa transient simulator uses a dynamic superposition of steady state flow solutions to get each steady state scenario the transient simulator solves eq 7 using the standard galerkin finite element code as introduced by nowak et al 2008 to simulate contaminant transport see section 3 2 we use a lagrangian particle tracking approach with continuous injection we choose a particle tracking random walk scheme due to its absence of numerical dispersion kinzelbach 1988 salamon and fern 2006 we obtain the set of pareto optimal solutions see section 2 3 in each of the dmoo decision time steps using a multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso algorithm for the sake of brevity we refer to reyes sierra and coello coello 2006 coello coello and reyes sierra 2006 for a detailed review and explanation of the algorithm and different existing mopsos techniques in our analysis we use the optimal mopso algorithm omopso developed by reyes sierra and coello coello 2005 sierra and coello coello 2005 which is acknowledged as a prominent and competitive formulation among their mopso peers and with respect to evolutionary formulations hadka and reedborg 2012 5 results and discussion 5 1 management scenarios to analyze the use of multiobjective concepts for optimal control of pumping rates and to evaluate the impact of the different dynamic decision rules we set up four different test cases a b c and d in each of these cases at each time horizon we select pumping rates following the corresponding dynamic decision rules described in section 5 2 thus we obtain dynamic decision paths for each rule a b c and d for simplicity we prefer to keep the application scenarios straightforward and will not look at a possible change of decision preference over time for each decision rule we analyze two scenarios 1 assuming well known hydraulic conductivity conditions and 2 admitting geological uncertainty in the first version we evaluate the four management scenarios over time see section 5 2 contrast the different decision rules 5 3 compare the performance to a simple satisfying all demand rule 5 4 and scrutiny the resulting capture maps 5 5 in the second version we investigate the impact of geological uncertainty for a fixed time horizon 5 6 remarks concerning the assumptions made in our scenarios their influence possible generalizations and remaining restrictions will be bundled in section 5 7 5 2 trade offs in the multi objective single decision horizon problem as a first result we present and discuss what are the achievable goal attainment levels and their trade offs in a single decision horizon to investigate this aspect we show in fig 4 the three dimensional pareto front for the initial time horizon here each sphere represents a multi objective compromise solution over the considered three objective functions fig 4 shows additionally the projections of the pareto front onto the planes of the coordinate system for easier analysis of the trade offs the goal attainment levels are normalized to an interval 0 1 that spans the lowest and highest goal attainment levels found in the current decision period for each objective function axis in addition for reasons of clarity we add to each axis label the obtained maximum and minimum values for instance the gw shortage axis in fig 4 denotes 90 of groundwater shortage as the largest value found during the optimization analysis just 10 of the current groundwater demand is fulfilled in the most extreme solution when looking at fig 4 we can observe the apparent conflict among the three selected objectives pareto solutions achieving a lower groundwater shortage entail larger pumping costs and a larger exceedance area in the following we will walk through the pairwise trade offs one by one in the tension between meeting the groundwater demand and complying with the given whpa the actual groundwater demand can be virtually fulfilled 0 of groundwater shortage by a wide range of pareto solutions all located at the upper part of the pareto front this set of pareto solutions represents the ability of the well field to supply the actual groundwater demand through different pumping rate management strategies that re distribute the overall pumping across the well field in this specific time step this leads to different sizes and shapes of the expected capture zone that all comply with the given whpa compare section 5 5 among these pareto solutions we can find the management strategy based on average fixed pumping rates decision rule d highlighted with the smaller blue sphere solution d is always a low cost solution among all solutions with the same total pumping rate because spatially uniform pumping leads to a quite uniform drawdown and costs rise with deeper drawdown however this strategy does not achieve the lowest possible penalty in exceedance area among all solutions that satisfy demand instead solution a according to decision rule a depicted in fig 4 with the large blue sphere minimizes exceedance area while satisfying the demand it achieves this trade off by spatially re distributing the pumping values in an optimal manner the reduced exceedance area is a first benefit of spatial redistribution of pumping now we look at the trade offs between costs and exceedance area rear plane of fig 4 here the trade off reveals a similar behavior to the aforementioned pareto front similar low penalty values of area exceedance can be reached when adopting different cost related pumping management strategies following decision rule b the black sphere in fig 4 depicts the opposite alternative to solution a big blue sphere the black sphere represents the solution that risk averse decision makers would select totally avoiding the exceedance area while searching for the maximum possible groundwater supply when looking at the two dimensional projection between costs and groundwater shortage right face of fig 4 it shows a narrow range of behavior in principle it follows the energy cost versus pumping equation katsifarakis et al 2018 which would be a clear parabola in homogeneous aquifers with identical pumping at all wells the small scatter of the points is the consequence of spatially redistributed pumping finally we highlight the management alternative representing the best compromise solution green sphere in fig 4 or decision rule c between all three objectives this solution is defined by the shortest distance to the origin of the normalized coordinates highlighted with a white sphere for many moo problems the best compromise solution might be suggested however in our case the necessity for external water supply may suggest to select a compromise solution like a or d unless when accompanied by demand side management strategies to conclude the use of spatially adaptive pumping within multi objective concepts can provide a valuable set of decision options from which a decision maker can select the upcoming management strategy according to her his preferences while considering three objectives of interest in whpa management 5 3 dynamic decision paths following distinct decision rules here we investigate how our dynamic moo approach provides dynamic pumping schemes that react to a transient environment to demonstrate this we show in fig 5 the dynamic pumping rates of the eight wells composing the well field plotted over the decision intervals τ d e c of 40 days each color in the stacked bars depicts the individual pumping rate of each well and the sinusoidal function black shows the time dependent groundwater demand the figure shows the results of decision paths obtained by following decision rules a left b center and c right first we analyze scenario a apparently as prescribed by rule a the demand is satisfied at all times however the colors show that different wells contribute different fractions of demand at different times the reason is as follows in some time intervals the mean flow direction extends the current abstraction zone to areas outside the given whpa then the optimal strategy reduces this expansion by assigning higher pumping rates to wells located in the opposite direction of the current flow direction for instance for time interval 8 with a mean flow direction coming from the north west southern wells yellow and red colors contribute more to groundwater supply on the other hand for time intervals with lower groundwater demand pumping rate conditions are more evenly distributed e g time intervals 4 and 13 this is because the low demand leads to a buffer area between abstraction zone and whpa that allows to use cost optimal uniform pumping rates across all wells the lower row of fig 5 summarizes for each decision path the pumping rates at each well in general the intermediate wells would provide most of the drinking well this is expected since most of the violation of the given whpa is located in the transversal section next we look at the risk averse pumping strategy of scenario b center of fig 5 apparently there is a situation of undersupply at almost each time interval the overall performance of this strategy would depend on the existing buffer area between actual abstraction zones and the given whpa the size of this buffer area depends on the demand the whpa size and geometry and the position of wells inside the whpa possible remedies are water import or an enlarged whpa which is either costly or perhaps impossible to implement finally in fig 5c we look at the re distribution of pumping rates for scenario c here the decision path is a best compromise between all three objectives accordingly we observe a mixture of the effects discussed above groundwater demand is satisfied at most times except for high demand periods in those periods spatially adaptive pumping is used to comply as good as reasonably possible with the given whpa in periods of low demand energy costs are minimized also we observe that there is the possibility to shut down groundwater abstraction in well 8 for most of the time intervals the periodically unsatisfied demand could be addressed by demand side management water import or enlarged whpa delineation if none of these options are available one should choose a decision path like in scenario a in summary these results demonstrate that optimal re distribution of pumping can adapt to a transient environment by pumping more in those wells with best compliance to the given whpa outline 5 4 overall performance of transient well field management how does the overall performance of our optimal pumping approach compare to a conventional pumping scheme to address this question we compare in fig 6 the performances of transient optimization decision scenarios a b and c in blue black and green respectively with the performance of a spatially uniform pumping that simply follows the demand decision scenario d in red in the upper row fig 6a shows the exceedance area growing over time while fig 6b c show the objective function values over time for groundwater shortage b and costs c the exceedance area rises over time wherever the whpa is exceeded at a new location the lower row fig 6d f shows the obtained total performance for exceedance area we show in fig 6d the worst i e the final value occurring over time in fig 6a and call it total exceedance for total groundwater shortage we compute the sum of shortage over time and normalize it by total demand total costs in fig 6f are simply the sum of pumping costs at all time steps in fig 6c first we evaluate the exceedance area using fig 6a and d the groundwater production in scenario a satisfies the dynamic demand just like scenario d however it reduces the exceedance of the whpa at all time intervals thus by using rule a we can reduce the total penalty in exceedance area from about 30 to above 20 fig 6d once we accept an optimal compromise between groundwater shortage and exceedance area scenario c we can reduce exceedance area down to 4 now we analyze the groundwater shortage versus time using fig 6b and e obviously scenarios a and d fulfill the groundwater demand at all times 0 total shortage here scenario c green fulfills roughly 87 of the total water demand while scenario b is only capable of supplying 30 finally fig 6c and e present the energy costs for the four considered scenarios comparing to the cost of the conventional scheme d scenario a supply first safety later is slightly more expensive but the best compromise scenario c brings the cost back down to the costs of d b is cheapest because it puts safety first and so leads to very low groundwater abstraction and related energy costs in general scenario c would be the recommended strategy if additional sources of water supply were available with a similar cost as the conventional solution scenario d scenario c is safer half the exceedance area but still provides 87 of the total groundwater demand scenario a provides full water supply 0 of groundwater shortage but is more expensive than d apparently these are the costs of increased safety in both a and c one could consider mitigating the remaining safety issue a or the remaining shortage c by seeking to enlarge the existing whpa such a decision however may be constrained by the land use activities around the existing whpa therefore a and c are valuable decision alternatives for well field management in densely populated areas finally scenario b shows that in our test case the consequences of maximal safety are too high in water shortage to conclude we could show that the optimal dynamic spatial re distribution of pumping rates can effectively reduce the expansion of the current abstraction zone caused by transiency driven scenarios however the energy costs for pumping operation increases or one has to import some fraction of water 5 5 impact of dynamic re distribution on the capture maps in this section we compare the different pumping rate strategies on a map that shows capture areas in order to visually illustrate the resulting differences we show in fig 7 the dynamic capture map for each decision path from left to right scenarios a b c and d respectively for purposes of comparison each figure highlights in white the total capture area of the corresponding strategy in red the total capture area of the conventional case scenario d and in green the actually delineated whpa the color shading in the background shows the percentage of the year in which each location on the map is part of the corresponding capture area this kind of map has been called time reliability map by rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 the white outlines envelope all locations that belong to the capture area on any day of the year it would be the whpa one would need to have full protection over the entire year in principle we can see two effects of adaptive pumping 1 the total capture area can be smaller due to restricted pumping as in scenarios b and c and 2 the utilization of the whpa is more dense in a and c allowing to pump almost the same water from a more compact and smaller total capture area the first effect is trivial and we will not pay further attention to it instead we have a closer look at the second one as mentioned previously scenarios a and d fulfill the groundwater demand at all time intervals if we look at fig 6a we see that most of the reduction in the total capture area due to optimal pumping in scenario a took place at the extremes in the transverse direction this is because a pumps in the south when groundwater flow comes from the north east and vice versa also it reacts to the effect of aquifer heterogeneity on capture area this leads to a stabilization of the dynamic capture zone within the more densely utilized core area that aligns better with the given whpa 5 6 robust optimization benefits when introducing geological uncertainties in the previous sections we discussed how an optimal re distribution of pumping rates can provide flexible control to limit the expansion of the actual abstraction zone however we assumed a complete characterization of the hydraulic conductivity field now we investigate the impact of geological uncertainty on our suggested approach for this purpose we repeat the entire moo exercise but now using eq 6 as objective function i e the mean effective objective value over 100 conditioned hydraulic conductivity fields see section 4 1 the resulting trade off solutions now account for geological uncertainty rather than relying on a single hydraulic conductivity assumption for the purpose of discussion we show in fig 8 the pareto fronts from three distinctive uncertainty scenarios within moo for simplicity we show only the projection onto the shortage exceedance plane scenario i red resembles full ignorance of the decision maker about geological uncertainty i e we see the pareto front from section 5 2 scenario ii blue shows the performance of the same solutions but evaluated on average over 100 realizations this shows how a deterministic planner must expect to perform when confronted with an uncertain environment finally scenario iii black considers uncertainty in planning i e it uses eq 6 as objective function the loss of performance from i to ii shows the disadvantage of ignoring uncertainty as a deterministic planner the gap in performance from ii to iii is the benefit of considering uncertainty in planning this demonstrates that our suggested dynamic pumping can be used to reduce the impact of uncertainty the loss from i to iii are the plain consequences of being in an uncertain situation and is not a problem of our specific approach we can demonstrate this by looking at the conventional pumping scheme scenario d green spheres in the three pareto fronts it suffers to the same degree from scenario i red to scenario ii blue and it benefits to the same degree from ii blue to iii black instead it is the problem of trying to use a given whpa that is too small to cope with uncertainty for considering uncertainty more successfully one could use methods like probabilistic delineation of whpas enzenhoefer et al 2012 rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 that eventually lead to a larger more robust assessment of capture areas under geological uncertainty this would provide our suggested approach with more freedom to adapt to uncertainties however we do not show corresponding results of a combined approach because the computational cost is already high enough while the deterministic moo in the previous sections took only 50 h per decision horizon on a small computing cluster using 20 cores the use of 100 realizations to produce the results in fig 8 costs more by a factor of 100 to make such computations feasible for practical use one will have to apply techniques of mathematical model reduction or improved monte carlo schemes such research however is beyond the scope of our current study in general our suggested approach opens up new opportunities to play with the given whpa however if that whpa is too tight either due to uncertainty as shown here or due to too strong transients then it is not provided with enough freedom to play hence the given whpa should not be too restrictive to host at least the uncertainty at hand 5 7 final remarks the main focus of our study is to illustrate the possibility to control the influence of transient flow environments over whpa delineation by re adapting the current pumping rate management strategy according to some decision maker s preferences so that the expansion of the actual abstraction zone beyond the given whpa can be reduced or even avoided consequently we limited our moo analysis to a single transient flow scenario in such a way that it facilitates us to illustrate the suitability of our approach this assumption does not represent a limitation to our approach for practical applications where insufficient information exists about transient flow behavior additional uncertainty triggered by unknown future flow conditions can easily be included we are aware that the results and conclusions of our comparison are specific to the analyzed management scenarios and to the used selected decision criteria to manage the water well field over time hence our analysis serves mainly for illustration of the flexibility of our intended approach rather than recommending which optimal strategy to use furthermore in order to provide real time control of drinking water production within the assigned whpa outline our moo formulation can be extended by implementing data assimilation techniques marti 2014 in order to benefit from continuous monitoring of groundwater quality through the use of intelligent monitoring wirtz and nowak 2017 additionally we are aware that the results and conclusions of our study depend on the used decision criteria for selecting among pareto solutions of similar performance see section 2 4 obviously the imposition of such control policies would affect the performance of subsequent system states castelletti et al 2012 and might lead to sub optimal solutions not foreseen by the decision maker in the long term analysis therefore in future work one might investigate techniques that search for the optimal control policy so that the cumulated reward e g the overall groundwater production for one year simulation maximizes while correcting sub optimal solutions through simulation e g reinforcement learning techniques sutton and barto 2011 6 conclusions and outlook wellhead protection areas are frequently delineated assuming steady state capture areas at all times however the influence from nature s transient behavior or anthropogenic causes can lead to significant changes in the actual capture outline then the given whpa is not large enough to envelope the actual capture area at all times in this study we propose an engineered pumping management scheme that optimally adapts pumping rates based on multi objective optimization concepts its goal is to achieve robustness against transiency while at the same time considering additional management objectives thus steady state whpas be used as sufficient protection schemes in summary our findings are 1 whpa programs and pumping management can benefit from multi objective optimization concepts the competitiveness among the selected objectives lead to pareto optimal solutions from which a decision maker can select the well field management strategy that best suits to upcoming management necessities and transient groundwater flow conditions 2 an optimal pumping strategy that fulfills the overall groundwater demand can effectively reduce the expansion of the abstraction zone beyond the given whpa when compared to a non optimal management scheme optimal pumping reduces the influence of the time variant flow environment by pumping more at those wells that currently yield a smaller influence in the expansion of the current abstraction zone 3 optimal pumping stabilizes the dynamic changes of the groundwater abstraction zone leading to a densely utilized and more static core area that aligns better with the given whpa 4 inappropriate whpa delineations can not be treated even with our suggested approach thus to address geological uncertainties it is still preferable to use probabilistic whpa outlines that are large enough to compensate for uncertainties as an outlook for future research we aim to derive a methodology to reduce the computational cost of robust optimization analysis based on unsupervised learning techniques acknowledgments the authors would like to

12314,groundwater modelers usually delineate wellhead protection areas whpas assuming steady state flow conditions however time varying groundwater flow conditions dynamically change the area from which the water is actually pumped for instance seasonal changes in the ambient flow direction might bring locations with hazardous land use activities e g gas stations or agricultural lands into the actual abstraction zone for parts of the year thus steady state whpa solutions can become inadequate for reliable drinking water well protection of course one might simply enlarge the delineated whpa to account for all seasonal conditions but this could lead to a massive enlargement of required whpas the goal of this paper is to present a management scheme that reduces the influence of transient flow on the actual abstraction zone by optimally re distributing pumping rates within well fields we solve our management problem utilizing time dependent multiobjective optimization moo concepts to search for compromise solutions that consider three objectives 1 to minimize the risk of pumping water from outside a given whpa 2 to minimize the gap between groundwater supply and demand and 3 to minimize the involved costs of pumping additionally we address aquifer heterogeneity through scenarios representative of the uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity our results from a synthetic application case show that 1 the competitiveness among the objectives shows that the moo formulation is a valid approach 2 an optimal dynamic pumping scheme can indeed reduce the transient influence on the actual abstraction zone while still covering the groundwater demand 3 implementing optimal pumping rates leads to a more densely utilized and more static capture area 4 geological uncertainty has an important influence on the obtained optimal set of solutions and should be included via monte carlo simulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords well catchment delineation groundwater protection transient flow conditions risk assessment multiobjective optimization 1 introduction wellhead protection areas whpas are one of the most widespread strategies followed by many drinking water protection programs in order to prevent pollution of drinking water wells us epa 1993 in general the whpa approach consists on outlining time of travel capture areas around drinking water wells within these areas one restricts hazardous land use activities that have the potential to contaminate the groundwater flowing towards the wells one of the main assumptions usually taken by groundwater modelers is to neglect the impact of time varying flow conditions during whpa analysis instead the standard routine is to assume one single allegedly representative steady state flow condition however nature is transient and thus the actual time of travel capture area has a dynamic outline with no guarantee to remain within the delineated whpa transiency in groundwater flow can be triggered by several sources for instance the transition between dry and rainy seasons can lead to a dynamic water demand that increases and decreases respectively the required groundwater abstraction of a well field the influence of transient pumping conditions on whpa analysis has been analyzed by ramanarayanan et al 1995 they observed how unsteady pumping rate conditions expand the required whpa outline compared to its equivalent steady state delineation they concluded that transient pumping seems not to average out with time and thus should be included in whpa analysis furthermore seasonal dynamics and stochastically occurring weather conditions can also lead to changes in the outline of the actual abstraction area triggered by changes in both the regional flow direction and the regional hydraulic gradient festger and walter 2002 analyzed the influence of both conditions and concluded that such variations influence the size of the actual abstraction zone by shifting expanding or shrinking its outline recently rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 investigated the effects of uncertain transient flow conditions in probabilistic whpa delineation they showed through four selected transient drivers how the involved transience triggers significant changes in whpa delineation when compared to equivalent steady state solutions from this they concluded that working under steady state conditions is not enough instead they showed how a transient capture area calls for delineation of larger whpas to reduce the fraction of time per year where water is pumped from outside the delineated area they also provided a combined probabilistic frequentistic delineation rule as a way out however the obtained whpas are always larger than steady state based whpas enlarging a whpa might not be an issue in rural areas dominated by forests or with non intensive farming but in densely populated areas especially with industrial activities larger whpas become difficult to implement even in domestic areas oil tanks for heating or major motorways are an issue therefore alternative solution strategies to handle transience are required we argue that once one starts caring about transient flow one could just as well use tailored dynamic pumping schemes within the well field to counteract natural fluctuation and thus reduce the dynamic changes in the actual abstraction outline dynamically managed pumping schemes are the most straightforward way out since natural transient effects e g regional gradients cannot be brought under human control many research papers about optimal pumping management schemes can been found in the literature most of these studies address sustainable management of groundwater resources involving quantity and quality issues singh et al 2013 singh 2014 a and singh et al 2014 b gaur et al 2015 cyriac and rastogi 2016 or solutions for groundwater remediation kitanidis and kitanidis 1990 huang and mayer 1997 mays and neupauer 2012 li et al 2014 piscopo et al 2015 when adapting such schemes to whpa management one should consider at least three objectives 1 to minimize groundwater abstraction from outside of a predefined whpa 2 to minimize groundwater disparity between demand and supply and 3 to minimize the involved costs of pumping these three objectives seem to conflict with one another for example a pumping scheme that rigorously restricts the actual abstraction zone to an existing whpa may not meet the water demand additionally a strong redistribution of pumping rates can lead to locally stronger drawdown and hence increases the energy costs for pumping therefore we propose to utilize multi objective optimization moo concepts marler and arora 2004 using this formulation if a management solution improves at least one of the aforementioned objectives without being worse in any of the other objectives it is acknowledged as a so called non dominated solution the set of all non dominated solutions forms what is called a pareto front the pareto front is a list of all meaningful trade off options between the three selected objectives and the final selection for a specific solution is based on decision rules or discussions that reflect the preferences of the decision maker furthermore given the dynamic behavior of our groundwater system our dynamic multi objective optimization dmoo problem azzouz et al 2017 has to continuously search for new optimal pumping decisions that address the current state of a dynamic system so that the pareto front changes and has to be tracked over time hence our management scheme requires to solve the moo problem in a dynamic way e g by re optimizing at a sequence of time steps additionally it is essential to consider the impact that spatial variability and uncertainty of aquifer properties e g hydraulic conductivity have on whpa analysis the impact of geological uncertainty has been widely analyzed in the literature e g franzetti and guadagnini 1996 leeuwen et al 1998 vassolo et al 1998 stauffer et al 2004 enzenhoefer et al 2012 enzenhoefer et al 2014 consequently dynamic pumping strategies that would not consider uncertainty could not be considered robust instead they would represent over confident management strategies that perform worse in practice than what is expected during the optimization and decision making in our study we address robustness through monte carlo simulation over conditioned hydraulic conductivity fields the contribution of this paper is to formulate and develop a multi objective dynamic management model with the goal to reduce and deliver control to the decision maker of the changes in the actual abstraction outline compared to the delineated whpa caused by transient flow conditions thus model based steady state whpas together with analytic scheme outlines can represent a robust and still valid solution against unconsidered dynamics of the flow environment our proposed scheme achieves this via dynamically adapting and re distributing pumping rates of individual wells in a well field to avoid infeasible decisions it works with trade off solutions among aforementioned competitive three objectives the remainder of this study is structured as follows first in section 2 1 we describe our intended management scheme and we formulate the corresponding dynamic multiobjective optimization problem later we extend our moo problem to provide robustness over geological uncertainty see section 2 3 finally in section 2 4 we extend to a dynamic moo problem and explain the decision rules we use for selecting pareto solutions at each time interval in section 3 we present the used methodology to carry out our novel pumping management approach section 4 describes a 3d synthetic application model and provide implementation detail results and corresponding discussions are found in section 5 while the conclusion and outlook are presented in section 6 2 the proposed pumping rate management strategy 2 1 management problems in safe groundwater production due to transient flow conditions most groundwater protection programs use whpas to safeguard groundwater abstraction against pollution fig 1 highlights in black a typical whpa of a well field composed of eight drinking water wells that during whpa analysis assumes a complete knowledge about heterogeneous aquifer conditions hence the irregular whpa geometry and steady state conditions likewise fig 1 highlights in red a larger additional outline for the same well field that accounts for transient flow conditions influencing the whpa analysis rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 thus the goal of our suggested pumping management approach is to optimally re distribute pumping rates so that the adapted capture area remains within the original steady state whpa solution even in transient environment and so to avoid the whpa enlargement sketched in fig 1 to achieve this we investigate over a defined time horizon whether the predicted abstraction zone driven by transient flow and pumping rate conditions exceeds the given whpa if yes we counter this exceedance by re adjusting for the analyzed time horizon the pumping rates we use the indicator map i s x θ for the actually delineated whpa this indicator map marks all locations x inside the whpa with i s 1 and i s 0 otherwise θ are hydrogeological parameters influencing the whpa delineation such as hydraulic conductivity or porosity likewise for the predicted transient time of travel abstraction area we use the indicator map i d t x θ q τ α τ additional for being dependent on aquifer parameters θ the dynamic capture zone predicted at time t into the future depends on pumping rates at q τ and groundwater transient conditions α τ acting over some relevant time interval τ for the latter indicator map to simplify notation we use its shorter expression i d t x θ the predicted abstraction zone results from the combined influence of past ambient transient flow conditions and past pumping either optimally rearranged or not with forecasted ambient flow behavior and suggested pumping rate management thus the time interval τ starts in the past of t and extends into the future of t to evaluate whether the whpa currently delineated remains valid as protection measure for the forthcoming stress period our framework compares for any suggested future pumping rate i s x θ to i d t x θ in plain words we anew the extent of area in i d that is not protected by i s we base the evaluation of a suggested pumping management on three aspects of relevant interest in whpa analysis 1 its quality which describes the extent of area in i d t x θ that currently contributes with groundwater to the well field without being protected by i s 2 the quantity of actual groundwater demand not fulfilled by the suggested pumping strategy and 3 the efficiency of the suggested management scheme interpreted as the costs for pumping operation over the studied time horizon these three metrics are in fact competing among each other for example a pumping rate management strategy that always fulfills the actual groundwater demand will necessarily violate the given whpa outline when compared to a solution with lesser groundwater supply and of course it will represent a more expensive management strategy however different management strategies producing the same quantity of groundwater would not necessarily lead to the same size and shape of the actual abstraction zone as we can re distribute the pumping rate within the well field in order to find pumping management conditions that represent optimal management solutions in the face of transient flow behavior and geological uncertainty we use multi objective optimization moo concepts marler and arora 2004 searching for compromise solutions among the considered three aspects 2 2 multi objective optimization formulation based on the approach described above we formulate the following moo problem 1 q

α τ p a s t q τ p a s t t t 0 δ τ d e c here q o p t τ d e c is an optimal pumping rate solution q for the upcoming management period τ d e c starting at the current time t the suggested pumping rates q τ d e c are subject to the constraints q q such as being positive satisfying a minimal required groundwater supply or remaining below maximal admitted values each optimal pumping solution aims to reduce the influence of forecasted groundwater transient flow conditions α τ d e c e g regional changes in the hydraulic gradient or seasonal groundwater recharge while conditioned to past pumping rates q τ p a s t and past groundwater transient flow conditions α τ p a s t the sum of these two time intervals τ p a s t and τ d e c defines a time interval τ which we use for capture analysis for instance if we want to provide an optimal pumping rate management for the upcoming 30 days τ d e c 30 of a one year time of travel whpa outline τ 365 days τ p a s t 335 days represents the relevant past time interval of already experienced transient flow behavior these time intervals are illustrated in fig 2 hence in order to solve eq 1 we would run for each suggested pumping management alternative the same natural transient flow and pumping rates over time τ p a s t once each alternative reaches time τ p a s t the suggested pumping rate alternative would run over τ d e c 30 days until it reaches the total time simulation τ τ p a s t τ d e c then for each suggested pumping rate management we evaluate its performance through three objective functions f d e l f g w s and f c o s t which are explained in the following exceedance area f d e l eq 2 describes integrated over time the extent of area in the overall domain ω that is within the predicted transient groundwater abstraction area i d t x θ and exceeds the whpa outline highlighted by i s x θ to compute this exceedance area we solve a transport problem for the suggested pumping rate strategy using an available whpa transient simulator see section 4 2 for instance if f d e l 0 then the predicted capture zone will fully remain inside the given whpa during all of τ d e c minimizing f d e l corresponds to the

each well and to the prohibition of injection 0 q k τ d e c q m a x involved costs f c o s t we evaluate the energy costs of the management scheme over the considered time horizon τ d e c using the

predicted from the simulated groundwater flow conditions over time τ d e c as additional constraint within q q we constrain the dynamic drawdown at each well h k τ d e c to h k τ d e c h m a x at all times where h m a x is a maximum allowed drawdown the solution of eq 1 provides a set of all non dominated solutions that forms a pareto front each of these solutions depicts an optimal pumping management alternative because at least one of its objectives improves over other alternatives without sacrificing the performance of the remaining objectives marler and arora 2004 2 3 integrating model uncertainty into the multi objective optimization in the practice any optimal management strategy from eq 1 will represent an over confident management alternative that deviates from the expected performance this is due to the high sensitivity that capture analysis has towards geological uncertainty in order to achieve robustness against this uncertainty we evaluate our moo formulation over an ensemble of n monte carlo realizations that represents the uncertainty triggered by the limited knowledge we have about the model parameters θ after computing the objective function for each monte carlo realization we average over them and then solve the moo problem again to get a pareto front of expected goal attainment levels thus we replace the objective functions in eq 1 with their expected objectives functions f d e l θ f g w s θ f c o s t s θ 6 q o p t τ d e c θ argmin q q f d e l θ q τ d e c θ f g w s θ q τ d e c θ f c o s t θ q τ d e c θ t t 0 δ τ d e c although in this study the implemented concept of robustness rest on expected values alternative statistics such as percentiles or the use of extreme scenarios can be implemented 2 4 dynamic decision making within the dynamic multi objective optimization the obvious dynamic nature of our groundwater system makes the pareto front evolve over time resulting in dynamic optimal pumping rate management our moo formulation will permanently search for new pumping management alternatives whenever the groundwater flow conditions change therefore a decision maker will dynamically need to select from the evolving pareto front the pumping management strategy to use we discretize the dynamic decision making with piecewise constant pumping rates in each time horizon τ d e c to select from these pareto alternatives in every time step one possibility is to use the actual decision maker s preferences inside the simulation optimization loop to select the best ranked alternatives however for automation of our analysis we emulate four decision rules that allow us to construct dynamic decision paths that any decision maker can easily understand and implement 1 decision rule a meeting the demand to prioritize groundwater supply we select among pareto solutions with the smallest penalties for groundwater shortage the one that achieves the lowest penalty in exceedance area 2 decision rule b risk aversion we pick from all solutions that minimize penalty in exceedance area the pareto alternative that achieves the lowest penalty in supply shortage this decision criterion switches priorities with respect to the previous one this management alternative will inevitably require to rely on external water sources to cover the missing gap in water supply 3 decision rule c best compromise is to select the pareto solution with the so called best compromise alternative between the three considered objective values this optimal solution has the smallest euclidean distance to an idealistic unattainable scenario situated at the coordinates origin of the objective values talbi 2009 4 as decision rule d conventional we select the pareto solution that always follows the demand like a but uses spatially uniform pumping for all wells in the well field we use this management alternative for contrasting optimal pumping i e the previous decision rules with a management alternative considered as non optimal 3 methodology in the present section we describe the methodology we use to carry out our novel pumping management approach furthermore we explain how we achieve robust pareto fronts in the face of geological uncertainty 3 1 groundwater transient flow simulation to simulate transient groundwater flow we use the whpa transient simulator developed by rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 it solves the groundwater flow equation described by 7 s s ϕ t k ϕ q s x t in ω here k is hydraulic transmissivity ϕ is hydraulic head s s is specific storage and q s x t is the sink source term in the domain ω the boundary conditions for eq 7 are 8 k ϕ n q ˆ t on γ 1 ϕ ϕ ˆ t on γ 2 where q ˆ and ϕ ˆ are predefined fluxes and heads on neumann γ 1 and dirichlet γ 2 boundaries respectively and n is the outward directed unit normal to γ where γ γ 1 γ 2 3 2 transport simulation under transient flow conditions to simulate contaminant transport for conservative tracers the transient model solves the advection dispersion equation 9 c t v c d c 0 in ω here c is concentration t is time v q n e is velocity q is darcy velocity n e is effective porosity assumed constant in this study and d is the hydromechanic dispersion tensor scheidegger 1954 given by 10 d α t v d e i α l α t v v t v with longitudinal and transversal dispersivities α l and α t respectively effective diffusion coefficient d e and the identity matrix i eq 9 is subject to the boundary conditions 11 n v c n d c j ˆ on γ 1 12 c c ˆ on γ γ 1 here j ˆ is a prescribed normal flux density and c ˆ represents prescribed concentrations 3 3 optimal management of pumping rate conditions in groundwater production to start with our dmoo analysis we define and store a given whpa solution i s x θ that defines the quality compliance criterion f d e l then for each pumping scheme q τ i suggested by our dmoo at the current time interval t i we conduct the following steps first for the current stress period under analysis we solve a forward advective dispersive transport problem batches of particles are continuously injected at times t j in the entire domain outside the given whpa to save computational time of tracking particles injected over the entire domain rock and kupfersberger 2002 it is sufficient to restrict particle release to a compliance testing zone around the whpa then based on the grid used for flow discretization we inject one particle at the center of each grid cell in the buffer zone afterwards particles from previous times τ d e c and recently injected move throughout the domain for the current τ d e c or until they completed their life time τ i or when they reach the well field the transport of particles under transient conditions requires a brief explanation about the different time discretizations used for flow and transport simulation and how they couple with our dmoo formulation in comparison to steady state flow scenarios when particles are released under time varying flow conditions these particles experience during their life cycle sequences of different velocity fields hence to tailor our dmoo formulation with the available model we use δ t d e c to discretize the transient flow time domain thus states of transient boundary conditions are discretized into piecewise constant changes at points in time t d e c likewise we use times t j t t δ t d e c to discretize the continuous injection of particles in time at which we release a new batch of particles each batch of particles is tracked until it reaches a maximum relevant life time which for purposes of our optimization analysis it is the time of travel capture distance τ or δ t d e c for a deeper explanation about the mathematical treatment and the assumptions taken by the whpa transient model to simulate transient groundwater flow as a consecutive set of steady state scenarios the interested reader is referred to rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 second using the information of the previous particle tracking analysis we generate the boolean yes no capture map representation i d t x θ of the predicted transient groundwater abstraction area within this boolean capture map each map pixel x i receives an indicator value of one if a particle released in it at time t j reaches the well field within the current τ d e c third we compute the respective objective values according to the suggested pumping rate and obtained capture map see section 2 2 fourth we solve a moo problem using eq 1 to find compromise solutions between the three considered objective functions this uses the algorithm to be explained in section 4 2 and requires to repeat steps 1 2 and 3 many times finally as the fifth step we select using the decision criteria explained in 2 4 and implement the preferred optimal pumping strategy then the whpa transient simulation continues with the evaluation of the next time interval τ d e c until is completed the total simulation time 4 test case scenario and numerical implementation for the sake of clarity we demonstrate and discuss our proposed methodology using a synthetic model scenario first we describe the model domain then we introduce the numerical methods and implementation used in our novel dmoo formulation 4 1 test case scenario our model scenario resembles a rectangular 3d domain that is confined by a leaky aquifer on top that permits recharge see fig 3 our synthetic model is equally discretized by d x d y d z 15 m and has an extent of 5 250 m 5 250 m 60 m we represent a well field located in the eastern part of the model with a row of eight fully penetrating wells depicted in fig 3 as blue circles with 160 m separation distance between each other in our approach we do not infer transient flow behavior from observed data neither do we forecast future transient flow conditions both are beyond of the scope of this study instead we assume that there is an accurate characterization of transient drivers sufficient knowledge of transient drivers is an acceptable assumption for whpa programs that actively survey groundwater flow behavior our model represents transiency via three transient conditions that are often observed on seasonal scale i changes in the regional groundwater flow direction ii varying strength of the regional hydraulic gradient and iii changing natural recharge to the groundwater for simplicity all three transient drivers will follow sinusoidal patterns of given frequency ω π year and phase shift values φ n 0 likewise we address the time variant groundwater demand following a sinusoidal behavior but using a phase shift value of opposite magnitude to groundwater recharge φ n 180 with stronger pumping taking place during the dry season and vice versa conlon et al 2005 the model uses prescribed fluxes and heads for the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions see fig 3 we set the total simulation time for the dmoo formulation to 720 days with τ 360 days thus outlining whpas of 360 days of total travel time the time length of every decision time step is τ d e c 40 days we release every four days δ t j a new batch of particles into a delimited area to reconcile our model with the time discretization of our optimization approach see sections 2 2 and 2 3 we set each aquifer stress period used to approximate the transient environment to last time τ d e c ergo each decision interval τ d e c represents a stress period influenced by different transient flow and pumping rate conditions at which we search for optimal pumping rate management in fig 3 the black outline depicts the fixed steady state whpa delineation using the mean magnitude of pumping and transient drivers while the red outline defines the whpa that account for transient flow conditions computed according to rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 with 100 time reliability due to transient influence the total area of the red transient delineation is 30 bigger than the fixed steady state whpa solution the goal of our dmoo framework is to cope with the fixed too small whpa we treat hydraulic conductivity as a random space function described by a matérn covariance function minasny and mcbratney 2005 using the parameters listed in table 1 fig 3 shows the realization of the hydraulic conductivity field used as synthetic truth scenario in order to evaluate our dmoo formulation see section 5 1 then to analyze our dmoo problem against geological uncertainty conditions see section 5 3 we use the same set of geostatistical covariance parameters to generate an ensemble of 100 hydraulic conductivity realizations each hydraulic conductivity field is conditioned to a set of 40 hydraulic conductivity measurements which were taken at ten different locations 4 measurements per location each measurement is taken at each of the four grid cells representing depth of our initial synthetic truth realization the position of each taken measurement is highlighted with black squares in fig 3 to generate our ensemble of conditioned hydraulic conductivity fields we use the fft based geostatistical tool described in fritz et al 2009 fritz et al 2009 4 2 numerical implementation to simulate groundwater transient flow conditions see section 3 1 the available whpa transient simulator uses a dynamic superposition of steady state flow solutions to get each steady state scenario the transient simulator solves eq 7 using the standard galerkin finite element code as introduced by nowak et al 2008 to simulate contaminant transport see section 3 2 we use a lagrangian particle tracking approach with continuous injection we choose a particle tracking random walk scheme due to its absence of numerical dispersion kinzelbach 1988 salamon and fern 2006 we obtain the set of pareto optimal solutions see section 2 3 in each of the dmoo decision time steps using a multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso algorithm for the sake of brevity we refer to reyes sierra and coello coello 2006 coello coello and reyes sierra 2006 for a detailed review and explanation of the algorithm and different existing mopsos techniques in our analysis we use the optimal mopso algorithm omopso developed by reyes sierra and coello coello 2005 sierra and coello coello 2005 which is acknowledged as a prominent and competitive formulation among their mopso peers and with respect to evolutionary formulations hadka and reedborg 2012 5 results and discussion 5 1 management scenarios to analyze the use of multiobjective concepts for optimal control of pumping rates and to evaluate the impact of the different dynamic decision rules we set up four different test cases a b c and d in each of these cases at each time horizon we select pumping rates following the corresponding dynamic decision rules described in section 5 2 thus we obtain dynamic decision paths for each rule a b c and d for simplicity we prefer to keep the application scenarios straightforward and will not look at a possible change of decision preference over time for each decision rule we analyze two scenarios 1 assuming well known hydraulic conductivity conditions and 2 admitting geological uncertainty in the first version we evaluate the four management scenarios over time see section 5 2 contrast the different decision rules 5 3 compare the performance to a simple satisfying all demand rule 5 4 and scrutiny the resulting capture maps 5 5 in the second version we investigate the impact of geological uncertainty for a fixed time horizon 5 6 remarks concerning the assumptions made in our scenarios their influence possible generalizations and remaining restrictions will be bundled in section 5 7 5 2 trade offs in the multi objective single decision horizon problem as a first result we present and discuss what are the achievable goal attainment levels and their trade offs in a single decision horizon to investigate this aspect we show in fig 4 the three dimensional pareto front for the initial time horizon here each sphere represents a multi objective compromise solution over the considered three objective functions fig 4 shows additionally the projections of the pareto front onto the planes of the coordinate system for easier analysis of the trade offs the goal attainment levels are normalized to an interval 0 1 that spans the lowest and highest goal attainment levels found in the current decision period for each objective function axis in addition for reasons of clarity we add to each axis label the obtained maximum and minimum values for instance the gw shortage axis in fig 4 denotes 90 of groundwater shortage as the largest value found during the optimization analysis just 10 of the current groundwater demand is fulfilled in the most extreme solution when looking at fig 4 we can observe the apparent conflict among the three selected objectives pareto solutions achieving a lower groundwater shortage entail larger pumping costs and a larger exceedance area in the following we will walk through the pairwise trade offs one by one in the tension between meeting the groundwater demand and complying with the given whpa the actual groundwater demand can be virtually fulfilled 0 of groundwater shortage by a wide range of pareto solutions all located at the upper part of the pareto front this set of pareto solutions represents the ability of the well field to supply the actual groundwater demand through different pumping rate management strategies that re distribute the overall pumping across the well field in this specific time step this leads to different sizes and shapes of the expected capture zone that all comply with the given whpa compare section 5 5 among these pareto solutions we can find the management strategy based on average fixed pumping rates decision rule d highlighted with the smaller blue sphere solution d is always a low cost solution among all solutions with the same total pumping rate because spatially uniform pumping leads to a quite uniform drawdown and costs rise with deeper drawdown however this strategy does not achieve the lowest possible penalty in exceedance area among all solutions that satisfy demand instead solution a according to decision rule a depicted in fig 4 with the large blue sphere minimizes exceedance area while satisfying the demand it achieves this trade off by spatially re distributing the pumping values in an optimal manner the reduced exceedance area is a first benefit of spatial redistribution of pumping now we look at the trade offs between costs and exceedance area rear plane of fig 4 here the trade off reveals a similar behavior to the aforementioned pareto front similar low penalty values of area exceedance can be reached when adopting different cost related pumping management strategies following decision rule b the black sphere in fig 4 depicts the opposite alternative to solution a big blue sphere the black sphere represents the solution that risk averse decision makers would select totally avoiding the exceedance area while searching for the maximum possible groundwater supply when looking at the two dimensional projection between costs and groundwater shortage right face of fig 4 it shows a narrow range of behavior in principle it follows the energy cost versus pumping equation katsifarakis et al 2018 which would be a clear parabola in homogeneous aquifers with identical pumping at all wells the small scatter of the points is the consequence of spatially redistributed pumping finally we highlight the management alternative representing the best compromise solution green sphere in fig 4 or decision rule c between all three objectives this solution is defined by the shortest distance to the origin of the normalized coordinates highlighted with a white sphere for many moo problems the best compromise solution might be suggested however in our case the necessity for external water supply may suggest to select a compromise solution like a or d unless when accompanied by demand side management strategies to conclude the use of spatially adaptive pumping within multi objective concepts can provide a valuable set of decision options from which a decision maker can select the upcoming management strategy according to her his preferences while considering three objectives of interest in whpa management 5 3 dynamic decision paths following distinct decision rules here we investigate how our dynamic moo approach provides dynamic pumping schemes that react to a transient environment to demonstrate this we show in fig 5 the dynamic pumping rates of the eight wells composing the well field plotted over the decision intervals τ d e c of 40 days each color in the stacked bars depicts the individual pumping rate of each well and the sinusoidal function black shows the time dependent groundwater demand the figure shows the results of decision paths obtained by following decision rules a left b center and c right first we analyze scenario a apparently as prescribed by rule a the demand is satisfied at all times however the colors show that different wells contribute different fractions of demand at different times the reason is as follows in some time intervals the mean flow direction extends the current abstraction zone to areas outside the given whpa then the optimal strategy reduces this expansion by assigning higher pumping rates to wells located in the opposite direction of the current flow direction for instance for time interval 8 with a mean flow direction coming from the north west southern wells yellow and red colors contribute more to groundwater supply on the other hand for time intervals with lower groundwater demand pumping rate conditions are more evenly distributed e g time intervals 4 and 13 this is because the low demand leads to a buffer area between abstraction zone and whpa that allows to use cost optimal uniform pumping rates across all wells the lower row of fig 5 summarizes for each decision path the pumping rates at each well in general the intermediate wells would provide most of the drinking well this is expected since most of the violation of the given whpa is located in the transversal section next we look at the risk averse pumping strategy of scenario b center of fig 5 apparently there is a situation of undersupply at almost each time interval the overall performance of this strategy would depend on the existing buffer area between actual abstraction zones and the given whpa the size of this buffer area depends on the demand the whpa size and geometry and the position of wells inside the whpa possible remedies are water import or an enlarged whpa which is either costly or perhaps impossible to implement finally in fig 5c we look at the re distribution of pumping rates for scenario c here the decision path is a best compromise between all three objectives accordingly we observe a mixture of the effects discussed above groundwater demand is satisfied at most times except for high demand periods in those periods spatially adaptive pumping is used to comply as good as reasonably possible with the given whpa in periods of low demand energy costs are minimized also we observe that there is the possibility to shut down groundwater abstraction in well 8 for most of the time intervals the periodically unsatisfied demand could be addressed by demand side management water import or enlarged whpa delineation if none of these options are available one should choose a decision path like in scenario a in summary these results demonstrate that optimal re distribution of pumping can adapt to a transient environment by pumping more in those wells with best compliance to the given whpa outline 5 4 overall performance of transient well field management how does the overall performance of our optimal pumping approach compare to a conventional pumping scheme to address this question we compare in fig 6 the performances of transient optimization decision scenarios a b and c in blue black and green respectively with the performance of a spatially uniform pumping that simply follows the demand decision scenario d in red in the upper row fig 6a shows the exceedance area growing over time while fig 6b c show the objective function values over time for groundwater shortage b and costs c the exceedance area rises over time wherever the whpa is exceeded at a new location the lower row fig 6d f shows the obtained total performance for exceedance area we show in fig 6d the worst i e the final value occurring over time in fig 6a and call it total exceedance for total groundwater shortage we compute the sum of shortage over time and normalize it by total demand total costs in fig 6f are simply the sum of pumping costs at all time steps in fig 6c first we evaluate the exceedance area using fig 6a and d the groundwater production in scenario a satisfies the dynamic demand just like scenario d however it reduces the exceedance of the whpa at all time intervals thus by using rule a we can reduce the total penalty in exceedance area from about 30 to above 20 fig 6d once we accept an optimal compromise between groundwater shortage and exceedance area scenario c we can reduce exceedance area down to 4 now we analyze the groundwater shortage versus time using fig 6b and e obviously scenarios a and d fulfill the groundwater demand at all times 0 total shortage here scenario c green fulfills roughly 87 of the total water demand while scenario b is only capable of supplying 30 finally fig 6c and e present the energy costs for the four considered scenarios comparing to the cost of the conventional scheme d scenario a supply first safety later is slightly more expensive but the best compromise scenario c brings the cost back down to the costs of d b is cheapest because it puts safety first and so leads to very low groundwater abstraction and related energy costs in general scenario c would be the recommended strategy if additional sources of water supply were available with a similar cost as the conventional solution scenario d scenario c is safer half the exceedance area but still provides 87 of the total groundwater demand scenario a provides full water supply 0 of groundwater shortage but is more expensive than d apparently these are the costs of increased safety in both a and c one could consider mitigating the remaining safety issue a or the remaining shortage c by seeking to enlarge the existing whpa such a decision however may be constrained by the land use activities around the existing whpa therefore a and c are valuable decision alternatives for well field management in densely populated areas finally scenario b shows that in our test case the consequences of maximal safety are too high in water shortage to conclude we could show that the optimal dynamic spatial re distribution of pumping rates can effectively reduce the expansion of the current abstraction zone caused by transiency driven scenarios however the energy costs for pumping operation increases or one has to import some fraction of water 5 5 impact of dynamic re distribution on the capture maps in this section we compare the different pumping rate strategies on a map that shows capture areas in order to visually illustrate the resulting differences we show in fig 7 the dynamic capture map for each decision path from left to right scenarios a b c and d respectively for purposes of comparison each figure highlights in white the total capture area of the corresponding strategy in red the total capture area of the conventional case scenario d and in green the actually delineated whpa the color shading in the background shows the percentage of the year in which each location on the map is part of the corresponding capture area this kind of map has been called time reliability map by rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 the white outlines envelope all locations that belong to the capture area on any day of the year it would be the whpa one would need to have full protection over the entire year in principle we can see two effects of adaptive pumping 1 the total capture area can be smaller due to restricted pumping as in scenarios b and c and 2 the utilization of the whpa is more dense in a and c allowing to pump almost the same water from a more compact and smaller total capture area the first effect is trivial and we will not pay further attention to it instead we have a closer look at the second one as mentioned previously scenarios a and d fulfill the groundwater demand at all time intervals if we look at fig 6a we see that most of the reduction in the total capture area due to optimal pumping in scenario a took place at the extremes in the transverse direction this is because a pumps in the south when groundwater flow comes from the north east and vice versa also it reacts to the effect of aquifer heterogeneity on capture area this leads to a stabilization of the dynamic capture zone within the more densely utilized core area that aligns better with the given whpa 5 6 robust optimization benefits when introducing geological uncertainties in the previous sections we discussed how an optimal re distribution of pumping rates can provide flexible control to limit the expansion of the actual abstraction zone however we assumed a complete characterization of the hydraulic conductivity field now we investigate the impact of geological uncertainty on our suggested approach for this purpose we repeat the entire moo exercise but now using eq 6 as objective function i e the mean effective objective value over 100 conditioned hydraulic conductivity fields see section 4 1 the resulting trade off solutions now account for geological uncertainty rather than relying on a single hydraulic conductivity assumption for the purpose of discussion we show in fig 8 the pareto fronts from three distinctive uncertainty scenarios within moo for simplicity we show only the projection onto the shortage exceedance plane scenario i red resembles full ignorance of the decision maker about geological uncertainty i e we see the pareto front from section 5 2 scenario ii blue shows the performance of the same solutions but evaluated on average over 100 realizations this shows how a deterministic planner must expect to perform when confronted with an uncertain environment finally scenario iii black considers uncertainty in planning i e it uses eq 6 as objective function the loss of performance from i to ii shows the disadvantage of ignoring uncertainty as a deterministic planner the gap in performance from ii to iii is the benefit of considering uncertainty in planning this demonstrates that our suggested dynamic pumping can be used to reduce the impact of uncertainty the loss from i to iii are the plain consequences of being in an uncertain situation and is not a problem of our specific approach we can demonstrate this by looking at the conventional pumping scheme scenario d green spheres in the three pareto fronts it suffers to the same degree from scenario i red to scenario ii blue and it benefits to the same degree from ii blue to iii black instead it is the problem of trying to use a given whpa that is too small to cope with uncertainty for considering uncertainty more successfully one could use methods like probabilistic delineation of whpas enzenhoefer et al 2012 rodriguez pretelin and nowak 2018 that eventually lead to a larger more robust assessment of capture areas under geological uncertainty this would provide our suggested approach with more freedom to adapt to uncertainties however we do not show corresponding results of a combined approach because the computational cost is already high enough while the deterministic moo in the previous sections took only 50 h per decision horizon on a small computing cluster using 20 cores the use of 100 realizations to produce the results in fig 8 costs more by a factor of 100 to make such computations feasible for practical use one will have to apply techniques of mathematical model reduction or improved monte carlo schemes such research however is beyond the scope of our current study in general our suggested approach opens up new opportunities to play with the given whpa however if that whpa is too tight either due to uncertainty as shown here or due to too strong transients then it is not provided with enough freedom to play hence the given whpa should not be too restrictive to host at least the uncertainty at hand 5 7 final remarks the main focus of our study is to illustrate the possibility to control the influence of transient flow environments over whpa delineation by re adapting the current pumping rate management strategy according to some decision maker s preferences so that the expansion of the actual abstraction zone beyond the given whpa can be reduced or even avoided consequently we limited our moo analysis to a single transient flow scenario in such a way that it facilitates us to illustrate the suitability of our approach this assumption does not represent a limitation to our approach for practical applications where insufficient information exists about transient flow behavior additional uncertainty triggered by unknown future flow conditions can easily be included we are aware that the results and conclusions of our comparison are specific to the analyzed management scenarios and to the used selected decision criteria to manage the water well field over time hence our analysis serves mainly for illustration of the flexibility of our intended approach rather than recommending which optimal strategy to use furthermore in order to provide real time control of drinking water production within the assigned whpa outline our moo formulation can be extended by implementing data assimilation techniques marti 2014 in order to benefit from continuous monitoring of groundwater quality through the use of intelligent monitoring wirtz and nowak 2017 additionally we are aware that the results and conclusions of our study depend on the used decision criteria for selecting among pareto solutions of similar performance see section 2 4 obviously the imposition of such control policies would affect the performance of subsequent system states castelletti et al 2012 and might lead to sub optimal solutions not foreseen by the decision maker in the long term analysis therefore in future work one might investigate techniques that search for the optimal control policy so that the cumulated reward e g the overall groundwater production for one year simulation maximizes while correcting sub optimal solutions through simulation e g reinforcement learning techniques sutton and barto 2011 6 conclusions and outlook wellhead protection areas are frequently delineated assuming steady state capture areas at all times however the influence from nature s transient behavior or anthropogenic causes can lead to significant changes in the actual capture outline then the given whpa is not large enough to envelope the actual capture area at all times in this study we propose an engineered pumping management scheme that optimally adapts pumping rates based on multi objective optimization concepts its goal is to achieve robustness against transiency while at the same time considering additional management objectives thus steady state whpas be used as sufficient protection schemes in summary our findings are 1 whpa programs and pumping management can benefit from multi objective optimization concepts the competitiveness among the selected objectives lead to pareto optimal solutions from which a decision maker can select the well field management strategy that best suits to upcoming management necessities and transient groundwater flow conditions 2 an optimal pumping strategy that fulfills the overall groundwater demand can effectively reduce the expansion of the abstraction zone beyond the given whpa when compared to a non optimal management scheme optimal pumping reduces the influence of the time variant flow environment by pumping more at those wells that currently yield a smaller influence in the expansion of the current abstraction zone 3 optimal pumping stabilizes the dynamic changes of the groundwater abstraction zone leading to a densely utilized and more static core area that aligns better with the given whpa 4 inappropriate whpa delineations can not be treated even with our suggested approach thus to address geological uncertainties it is still preferable to use probabilistic whpa outlines that are large enough to compensate for uncertainties as an outlook for future research we aim to derive a methodology to reduce the computational cost of robust optimization analysis based on unsupervised learning techniques acknowledgments the authors would like to
