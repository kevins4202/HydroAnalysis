7975,study region zamra catchment upper tekeze basin northern ethiopia study focus direct field estimates of potential evapotranspiration pet remain a challenge because they are expensive and have limited spatial representativeness an alternative is to derive pet by remote sensing as a product of reference evapotranspiration eto and land use land cover lulc factor kc the aims of this study were to i validate satellite derived daily reference evapotranspiration dmetref etos ii correct the advection bias of dmetref etos as compared to in situ fao penman monteith eto fao etog and iii convert the bias corrected dmetref etos into pet four atmos 41 weather stations were installed and 1 year daily data was used to validate the dmetref etos the wet season actual evapotranspiration from fao water productivity open access portal wapor was used to validate pet new hydrological insights for the region evaluation of dmetref etos showed large underestimation biases when compared to fao etog derived from in situ weather stations particularly in warm conditions due to unaccounted advection bias the bias correction was performed as a function of near surface air temperature obtained from era5 land merged with in situ air temperature the results showed substantial improvement of eto finally the daily pet was estimated by multiplying the corrected dmetref etos by a spatio temporally variable kc defined as linearly dependent on the ndvi obtained from sentinel 2 this study emphasized substantial difference between eto and pet implying that the eto cannot substitute pet which in many hydrological studies is still a common practice keywords reference evapotranspiration dmetref etos bias correction lulc factor potential evapotranspiration 1 introduction quantifying potential evapotranspiration pet remains a major research gap and as such also a challenge in hydrology because i there is confusion related to the definition of that term and in the way it should be calculated ii of its large spatio temporal variability particularly distinct in arid and semi arid regions iii difficulty of data acquisition however the pet estimate is indispensable in drought assessment in rainfall runoff models and in integrated hydrological models the latter recently becoming a standard tool in water management different contextual pet definitions have been proposed throughout several decades seiller and anctil 2016 the concept of pet different from actual evapotranspiration was first introduced by thornthwaite 1948 as a maximum evapotranspiration that depends on climate soil moisture supply plant cover and land management despite the only variable used to calculate pet was monthly temperature at the same time penman 1948 outlined theoretical approaches to estimate evaporation from an open water body bare soil and grass and this method was later associated with the pet concept by penman 1956 who defined it as the amount of water transpired in a given time by a short green crop completely shading the ground of uniform height and with adequate water status in the soil profile note that definition did not specify crop type later jensen 1968 defined pet as the upper limit of evapotranspiration that occurs with a well watered agricultural crop that has an aerodynamically rough surface such as alfalfa with 30 50 cm of top growth finally the fao penman monteith method by allen et al 1998 stated a crop coefficient as multiplicative factor to a grass reference evapotranspiration eto in order to compute crop evapotranspiration because the ground cover canopy properties and aerodynamic resistance of a crop were different from a grass the pet concept has recently been precised and extended by defining it as the maximum evapotranspiration from a large area with different cover not related to a specific crop mcmahon et al 2013 xiang et al 2020 in this study the pet is defined as the maximum amount of water that can be evaporated from soil surface features from subsurface and also transpired by plants under unlimited water availability condition different methods which claim to estimate pet behave differently and the estimated magnitudes are not always in agreement with each other because of different assumptions and input requirements generally the pet methods can be grouped into mass transfer based temperature based radiation based and combination based bai et al 2016 xiang et al 2020 the mass transfer methods were mainly applied several decades ago to investigate variations and patterns of pet but they clearly showed the ambiguity between pet and evaporation during the early stages of pet studies xiang et al 2020 the temperature based methods require only temperature as input to compute evapotranspiration shaw and riha 2011 sheffield et al 2012 the radiation based methods are based on the energy balance and require solar radiation and temperature as inputs xu and singh 2000 the combination based methods compute evapotranspiration based on more comprehensive physical processes and lead to the most reliable estimates if all input variables are well measured singh and xu 1997 for a long time the pet and eto have shared concepts helm et al 2016 confusing many researchers who used to mix the utilization and equations of the two xiang et al 2020 for example ahmadi and fooladmand 2008 used thornthwaite 1948 method of estimating pet to derive the eto also joo et al 2018 and tian et al 2015 suggested penman monteith fao eto method to estimate pet i e pet eto such pet assumption was strongly discouraged by allen et al 1998 the initiators of the eto concept who pointed out differences between the two also chin et al 2011 stated that pet and eto vary substantially in space and time according to xiang et al 2020 the pet is more applicable for large areas with different land use land cover lulc while the eto refers to a reference grass specific crop for areas other than the reference grass the most appropriate and the most common estimate of pet also implemented in this study utilizes a product of the eto and the spatio temporally variable multiplication factor typically addressed as the kc crop factor verstraeten et al 2008 el zehairy et al 2018 dassargues 2018 xiang et al 2020 however as the kc does not necessarily refer to crops but also to semi natural vegetation hereafter the kc is addressed as lulc factor not crop factor the eto can be computed from climatic measurements peng et al 2017 grouped methods to compute eto into temperature based radiation based pan evaporation based and combination based the combination method is perceived as the most accurate xiang et al 2020 the fao penman monteith fao eto combination method is widely recommended as the standard method to compute eto oudin et al 2010 yadeta et al 2020 the fao penman monteith defines the reference surface as a hypothetical grass reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing and adequately watered allen et al 1998 a typical way to determine fao eto is based on five data types solar radiation wind speed air temperature relative humidity and atmospheric pressure allen et al 1998 all obtained from weather station sensors installed at 2 m height above ground surface however as the eto is spatio temporally variable large areas would require measurements recorded by multiple stations which is expensive moreover their representativeness is spatially limited this is why recently the eto is also derived from satellite measurements representing alternative source of eto ghilain et al 2011 senatore et al 2015 the famine early warning systems network fewsnet the fao water productivity open access portal wapor and the daily reference evapotranspiration dmetref etos from satellite application facility on land surface analysis lsa saf provide three different satellite based eto products the fewsnet and dmetref etos claim to be standardized in accordance with the fao eto allen et al 1998 while the wapor defines eto as the evapotranspiration from a hypothetical reference crop simulating the behaviour of a well watered grass surface fao 2020 the fewsnet 111 km and the wapor 20 km have coarser spatial resolution than the dmetref etos 3 km therefore they are mainly suitable for large regional scale studies lekula and lubczynski 2019 the dmetref etos is more suitable for finer scale studies trigo et al 2018 according to the lsa saf team 2016 the dmetref etos concept closely resembles the fao eto concept trigo et al 2018 validated the satellite dmetref etos using tower and lysimeter in situ measurements in diverse climatic regimes and also compared it with the following estimates of eto i priestley and taylor 1972 ii makkink de bruin et al 2010 and iii fao eto allen et al 1998 in the first two methods the net radiation input i e daily downward surface shortwave flux was obtained from lsa saf while in the third method all estimates were obtained using in situ measurements the dmetref etos applied to the cabauw experimental area in the netherlands very similar to the hypothetical fao reference grass area without advection showed similar results as compared to the tower eto the dmetref etos showed the best correlation with makkink while a conditional bias underestimation overestimation of low high eto as compared to priestley taylor eto and slight underestimation with respect to fao eto however at validation sites situated in semi arid areas characterized by the impact of local advection the dmetref etos as well as the priestley taylor and the makkink methods substantially underestimated the lysimeter eto in such areas the fao eto estimates were found much closer to the lysimeter eto measurements that underestimation was attributed by trigo et al 2018 to the heat advection effect therefore they recommended the underestimation of dmetref etos in semi arid areas to be corrected as a function of near surface air temperature in order to include the extra energy due to the advection effect the kc is the ratio of pet of a specific lulc surface to eto allen et al 1998 the kc is spatio temporally variable and can range from less than 1 to more than 1 depending on lulc bos et al 2009 the most accurate method to directly measure kc is by using lysimeters lorite et al 2012 however installation of lysimeters is expensive and cumbersome the kc of crops can be assigned from the predefined listed values in allen et al 1998 but that collection does not cover kc of diverse lulcs of natural vegetation which differ depending on catchment basin conditions recent studies focus on deriving kc of various lulc not only by field estimates but also by remote sensing based vegetation indices carpintero et al 2020 pôças et al 2020 available from diverse remote sensing satellite products at relatively high spatial resolution the most commonly used index for the remote sensing kc assessment is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which shows a linear relation with kc gontia and tiwari 2010 mutiibwa and irmak 2013 zhang et al 2019 de oliveira et al 2020 a recent study by marcial pablo et al 2021 compared ndvi wide dynamic range vegetation index and 2 band enhanced vegetation index to estimate kc from uav based multi spectral images and these results also indicated that ndvi outperformed other indices moreover the relationships between kc and ndvi for different vegetation covers provided by multiple studies are all linear and very similar e g choudhury et al 1994 gonzalez piqueras et al 2004 campos et al 2010 lópez urrea et al 2016 therefore the ndvi based kc linear equations derived for a certain study area can be applied to other similar study areas rafn et al 2008 the pet is also provided as readily available satellite product from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis at 500 m spatial and 8 day temporal resolution however there is no clear explanation on how that pet is calculated moreover its input data is derived from the global modeling and assimilation office gmao meteorological data at 1 x 1 25 111 km x 138 75 km spatial resolution applying spatial smoothing mu et al 2007 such coarse resolution smoothing may be applicable on a global or regional scale but at the catchment scale it can lead to large biases especially in catchments with complex topography mu et al 2011 such as the catchment of this study the objectives of this study were to i validate the performance of satellite dmetref etos product at daily time step ii correct the advection bias of dmetref etos as compared to in situ fao etog and iii convert the bias corrected dmetref etos into pet the main originalities of this study are in i evaluation parameterization and bias correction of satellite based dmetref etos converted to dmetref etosa ii derivation of daily pet from daily dmetref etosa and ndvi based kc in a topographically complex semi arid area and its wet season validation using wapor actual evapotranspiration 2 study area and data acquisition 2 1 study area the zamra catchment study area situated in the upper tekeze basin is located between latitudes 12 57 42 and 13 20 18 n and longitudes 39 0 8 and 39 40 05 e it covers an area of 1588 km2 fig 1 based on the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm derived digital elevation model dem with a spatial pixel resolution of 30 m the elevation of the study area ranges from 1244 m a s l at the western catchment outlet to 3550 m a s l in the eastern mountainous area about 70 of the study area has slopes smaller than 15 while 6 4 larger than 30 the study area characterized by large spatio temporal rainfall variability experiences two main seasons wet and dry seasons the wet season lasts from june to september and accumulates more than 80 of the total yearly rainfall the maximum and most intensive rainfall events occur in august gebremedhin et al 2020 the months from october to may represent the dry season the temperature of the study area is also largely spatially and temporally variable being dependent on the altitude as indicated by the four weather stations established in this study fig 1 table 1 according to one year observations extending from 01 september 2019 to 31 august 2020 i the daily minimum and maximum temperatures varied from 13 0 c to 29 4 c in the north eastern highland station hagereselam and from 19 2 c to 36 6 c in the western lowland station finarawa respectively ii the average daily solar radiation ranged from 19 0 mj m 2 at the high elevated station hagereselam to 20 2 mj m 2 at the low elevated station finarawa iii the average daily wind speed ranged from 1 58 ms 1 maynebri to 2 76 ms 1 lemlemarena with the latter being much higher because of the gust wind speed during the dry season 2 2 data acquisition in situ based meteorological variables from the established in this study weather stations and satellite dmetref etos data from lsa saf archive were obtained for one year from 01 september 2019 to 31 august 2020 2 2 1 in situ data four atmos 41 all in one weather station meter 2021 were installed in four sites at the zamra catchment presented in fig 1 and table 1 the atmos 41 weather station measures 12 climatic variables including air temperature relative humidity vapor pressure barometric pressure wind speed gust speed wind direction solar radiation shortwave incoming radiation precipitation lightning strike counter and distance all these climatic variables were sampled and recorded every 15 minutes the atmos 41 time was setup to coincide with the coordinated universal time utc 00 time zone of the dmetref etos satellite product sites for installation of the atmos 41 stations were selected mainly based on their representativeness of different land cover types and different altitudes implying different climatic conditions but also considering security reason to prevent vandalism three stations were installed in different croplands while the fourth maynebri within a grassland area fig 2 the lowest elevated station finarawa is mainly cropped with peanut the lemlemarena with teff and peanut and the hagereselam with wheat and barley all the crops are grown during the wet season while during the dry season all are transformed in to bare lands 2 2 2 remote sensing data the daily dmetref etos is estimated based on daily estimations of downward surface shortwave flux didssf product generated by the lsa saf from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri meteosat second generation lsa saf team 2016 the meteosat second generation satellite meteosat 8 with its relatively high spatial 3 km and temporal 15 min resolution is particularly interesting to monitor quickly evolving variables as a function of diurnal cycle and cloudiness the meteosat 8 currently delivers the operational indian ocean data coverage service positioned at 41 5 degree east as such ethiopia is situated nearly sub satellite the concept of dmetref etos was introduced to allow the estimation of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere independently of crop type crop development or management practices it claims to be corresponding to the eto definition by allen et al 1998 the dmetref etos product can be obtained from the lsa saf after free registration at https landsaf ipma pt en data catalogue for this study the dmetref etos product was retrieved from the international institute for geo information science and earth observation itc file transfer server receiving data transmitted by eumetcast to classify lulc and derive its spatial distribution and temporal variability of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi with 10 m spatial resolution was used the sentinel 2 level 1 c toa top of atmosphere product obtained free of charge from https earthexplorer usgs gov was converted to level 2a boa bottom of atmosphere using the sen2cor processor plugin of the sentinel applications platform snap which performs the tasks of atmospheric terrain and cirrus correction 3 methodology 3 1 in situ based reference evapotranspiration to compare dmetref eto algorithm of the lsa saf team 2016 with the fao eto algorithm allen et al 1998 both algorithms are presented and compared using the same in situ data 3 1 1 fao eto algorithm the fao eto requires solar radiation air temperature air humidity wind speed and atmospheric pressure all at 2 m height above ground surface and is calculated according to eq 1 as follows 1 eto 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0

the constant pressure assumed as 1 013 10 3 mj kg 1 c 1 ε is ratio of molecular weight of water vapour dry air assumed as 0 622 all the assumptions of eq 2 follow allen et al 1998 the saturated vapour pressure es is related to air temperature t in c and was calculated using the following equation 3 e s e o t max e o t min 2 where e t is saturation vapour pressure in kpa at the air temperature t tmax is daily maximum air temperature and tmin is daily minimum air temperature 4 e o t 0 6108 exp 17 27 t t 237 3 where t is current air temperature in c the actual vapour pressure ea was calculated as follows 5 e a e o t min rh max 100 e o t max rh min 100 2 where rhmin is daily minimum relative humidity in and rhmax is daily maximum relative humidity in both obtained from automatic weather stations the slope of saturation vapour pressure δ at a given air temperature t was calculated by 6 4098 0 6108 exp 17 27 t t 237 3 t 237 3 2 the net radiation rn was calculated as the difference between shortwave net solar radiation and longwave net solar radiation eq 7 7 r n r ns r nl 1 α r s r nl 8 r nl σ t max 273 16 4 t min 273 16 4 2 0 34 0 14 e a 1 35 r s r so 0 35 where rns is

of allen et al 1998 the total daily net radiation is almost always positive except in extreme conditions at high latitudes as also confirmed in this study 3 1 2 dmetref eto algorithm the dmetref eto algorithm assumes a hypothetical well watered reference grass surface and is calculated according to eq 9 9 eto 1 λ γ q β where λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2 5 which similar to the λ value in fao eto δ is the slope of saturation water vapour pressure versus temperature γ is the psychometric constant eq 2 q is the net radiation over the grass reference surface with an albedo of 0 23 computed using eq 10 and β is a constant assumed as 20 wm 2 which has been introduced to compensate the deviation of near surface conditions from fully saturated air 10 q 1 0 23 k c s k k ext where k

temperature in c esat is saturation water vapour pressure in hpa for details about dmetref eto algorithm the reader is referred to the annex of lsa saf team 2016 3 1 3 comparison of dmetref eto with fao eto applying in situ data the dmetref eto algorithm eq 9 and the fao eto algorithm eq 1 are similar for well watered reference surfaces without advection de bruin et al 2016 but in areas strongly influenced by local advection extra energy e g from dry upwind terrain as typically occur in semi arid regions the dmetref eto algorithm does not account for advection effect the wind climatic variable included in the fao eto algorithm eq 1 is not included in the dmetref eto algorithm eq 9 to investigate the impact of the advection bias on eto estimated by both algorithms the same in situ data monitored at the four weather station sites fig 1 table 1 were inserted to eq 9 to obtain dmetref etog and to eq 1 to obtain fao etog finally the two were compared and conclusions drawn 3 2 satellite dmetref etos the dmetref etos combines daily global radiation data derived from geostationary satellite and daily average air temperature at the 2 m height above ground surface with 31 km spatial resolution obtained from european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf is demonstrated in fig 3 the ecmwf is an operational weather forecast which periodically uses its models and data assimilation systems to re analyze archived observations creating global data sets describing the recent history of the atmosphere land surface and oceans https www ecmwf int en research climate reanalysis 3 3 evaluation of satellite dmetref etos pre processing of the satellite dmetref etos product was performed using the open source water and food security ethiopia toolbox under integrated land and water information system ilwis software maathuis et al 2018 that satellite dmetref etos was compared with in situ dmetref etog and then both dmetref etos and dmetref etog estimates were evaluated against the fao etog the performance evaluation was carried out on daily basis using descriptive statistics which included i pearson s product moment correlation coefficient r ii mean error me iii mean absolute error mae iv root mean square error rmse v normalized mean absolute error nmae and vi normalized root mean square error nrmse the latter two introduced by gebremedhin et al 2020 the equations of the descriptive statistics are presented as follow 13 r i 1 t eto g i eto g eto s i eto s i 1 t eto g i eto g 2 i 1 t eto s i eto s 2 14 me 1 t i 1 t eto s i eto g i 15 mae 1 t i 1 t

evapotranspiration at a day i eto g is the 1 year daily average of eto g i eto s is the 1 year daily average of eto s i t is the total number of daily data pairs 3 4 bias correction approach of satellite dmetref etos raw dmetref etos data is affected by bias due to unaccounted advection energy however trigo et al 2018 stated that there is no need for universal parametrization of this extra energy as the advection is also a function of an air temperature in this study the correction of dmetref etos advection bias was performed as a function of near surface air temperature of the ecmwf reanalysis version 5 land era5 land merged with in situ temperature measurements both at 2 m above ground surface the era5 land data in contrast to forecasted temperature data used in the dmetref etos fig 3 has better 9 km spatial resolution but is available only 2 3 months behind real time although preliminary data is available 5 days behind real time muñoz sabater et al 2021 the era5 land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ecmwf era5 climate reanalysis which combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics including elevation correction the era5 land air temperature data was obtained from the copernicus climate change service climate date store https cds climate copernicus eu the in situ temperature measurements were obtained from four weather stations installed in this study the merging of era5 land temperature with the in situ temperature was carried out using geographically weighted regression gwr method adopting gebremedhin et al 2020 approach in that approach the elevation was considered as independent explanatory variable and the biases of the era5 land as dependent variable considering that the temperature biases between era5 land and in situ observations are linearly dependent on elevation the gwr model was applied because of its suitability to predict near surface air temperature wang et al 2017 the pre processing of the era5 land air temperature was carried out using the integrated land and water information system ilwis arcgis model builder was used to derive the bias corrected satellite dmetref etos dmetref etosa as per eq 19 the dmetref etosa was finally evaluated by descriptive statistics eqs 13 18 19 dmetref eto s a dmetref eto s i f t a i r t t h dmetref eto s a c t a i r t t h λ i f t a i r t t h where dmetref etosa is the bias corrected satellite dmetref etos in mm day 1 ac is adjustable coefficient tair is mean air temperature in c tth is the temperature threshold which corresponds to the maximum air temperature below which the satellite dmetref etos and the in situ fao etog are found to have negligible difference in this study assigned as 15 c λ is latent heat of vaporization in mj kg 1 note that the bias correction of the dmetref etos performed in this study assumes the fao etog as true computation algorithm of the reference evapotranspiration 3 5 deriving pet the pet was derived in this study as the product of the bias corrected satellite dmetref etosa and satellite based kc the kc accounts for different impacts of plants and soils on pet there are two methods to define kc allen et al 1998 applying single lulc factor eq 20a and dual lulc factor eq 20b where in the latter case the kc splits into soil evaporation factor ke and basal transpiration factor kcb 20a pet k c et o 20b pet k e k cb et o the kc is spatially and temporally variable depending on lulc type and its seasonal change the lulc map of the zamra catchment was derived from sentinel 2 level 2a ground truth samples of the lulc were collected from field works and additional samples were also collected from google earth using the author s expert knowledge on the land use of the study area a supervised classification was performed using snap and the random forest rf classifier applied because it is a robust method with no assumptions of normality which can deal with highly correlated variables being also relatively insensitive to overfitting breiman 2001 this study followed the dual lulc factor approach eq 20b considering kcb the eq 21 was lysimetrically validated for crops and later for natural vegetation by campos et al 2013 in similar environmental condition as the zamra catchment very similar kcb relationship was also validated using lysimeter for crops in semi arid central spain by lópez urrea et al 2016 considering ke the eq 22 was applied after simonneaux et al 2008 who validated it in an irrigated area the same equation was also applied by er raki et al 2010 the fraction of vegetation cover fc in eq 22 was derived in this study as a function of ndvi in the linear model as per eq 23 proposed by gutman and ignatov 1998 for national centers for environmental prediction ncep forecast and since then applied as a common method of deriving fraction of vegetation cover zhang et al 2013 gao et al 2020 21 k cb 1 44 ndvi 0 1 22 k e k e max 1 f c 0 25 1 f c 23 f c ndvi ndvi s ndvi v ndvi s where ndvis is the minimum ndvi at bare soil ndviv is the maximum ndvi at dense vegetation fully vegetated area note the ke decreases with the increase of fc as such the ke 0 when fc 1 i e when a crop or natural plant is well developed and completely covers the soil and ke ke max when fc 0 i e when a soil is bare in this study the ke max 0 25 was assigned after er raki et al 2010 and akdim et al 2014 both applied and validated in morocco in similar condition of low fc as in this study the ndvi was derived from sentinel 2 level 2a products as a function of the reflectance of the near infra red and red spectral bands eq 24 24 ndvi ρ nir ρ r ρ nir ρ r where ρ nir is the reflectance in sentinel 2 msi near infra red band band 8 and ρ r is the reflectance sentinel 2 msi red band band 4 considering sentinel 2 data availability despite its high temporal revisit every 5 days lots of images were contaminated with cloud cover particularly during the wet season hence only one cloud free image of each month was selected and converted to kc the twelve kc catchment distributions representing specific days of a month were then interpolated to daily kc using the linear relationship method of pandas package in python and afterwards smoothed with other scipy package in python the daily pet was derived by multiplying the daily bias corrected satellite dmetref etosa by the corresponding daily satellite kc using the raster iterator in the model builder of arcgis environment the final daily pet was produced with a spatial resolution of 10 m the same as the kc resolution the pet validation was carried out comparing it with the wapor actual evapotranspiration product fao 2020 within the two wet season dekads from 11 to 31 august 2020 see the discussion 4 results 4 1 satellite dmetref etos performance evaluation the pearson s product moment paired correlations between satellite dmetref etos with in situ fao etog and in situ dmetref etog the latter two using data of the four weather stations are presented in fig 4 the high correlations between dmetref etos and dmetref etog fig 4a indicate that dmetref etos is well captured by the dmetref etog but does not provide information on how well the dmetref eto algorithm eq 9 resembles the fao eto algorithm eq 1 this is investigated by other two correlations fig 4b c which are similar both with regression slopes substantially deviating from 45 deg particularly starting from 3 mm day 1 towards the higher values the largest slope deviation has lemlemarena site while the lowest maynebri site the observed deviations in combination with the large correlation coefficients suggest systematic differences biases between dmetref etos and fao etog pairs fig 4b the time series comparing the dmetref etos dmetre etog and fao etog for the four weather stations are presented in fig 5 the agreement between the satellite dmetref etos and in situ dmetref etog is pretty good in contrast to dmetref etos agreements with in situ fao etog which are better for the higher elevated weather stations maynebri and hagereselam than for the lower elevated stations finarawa and lemlemarena moreover these agreements are better in the colder wet season than in the hot dry season when the dmetref etos does not capture the maximum reference evapotranspiration demand by the atmosphere the descriptive statistics of error estimates between dmetref etos and fao etog at the four weather stations is presented in table 2 the me of dmetref etos compared to fao etog shows underestimations at all weather stations the me is relatively small at the highland stations maynebri and hagereselam but substantial at the lowland stations finarawa and lemlemarena the mae and rmse showed similar trends at all four weather stations the normalized with respect to fao etog nmae and nrmse demonstrated large biases for the lowland stations finarawa and lemlemarena and lower for highland stations maynebri and hagereselam 4 2 bias correction of satellite dmetref etos the temporal pattern of daily era5 land air temperature at the 2 m height above the ground surface show a good relationship with the in situ air temperature measurements at the 2 m height acquired from the four weather stations fig 6 the average pearson s product moment correlation coefficient between era5 land and in situ temperature measurements is greater than 0 85 and the daily mean absolute error is less than 2 c day 1 with better agreement at the high elevated stations maynebri and hagereselam compared to the low elevated stations finarawa and lemlemarena as such the era5 land can be directly used for bias correction of the satellite dmetref etos in this study the era5 land temperature was merged with the in situ observed at the 2 m height air temperatures and that merging provided a substantially improved near surface air temperature product merged temp in fig 6 further used to improve the dmetref etos the pearson s product moment correlations r and regression between bias corrected satellite dmetref etosa according to eq 19 using gwr merged temperature as input and fao etog are presented in fig 7 these graphs particularly when comparing them to the graphs presented in fig 4 satellite dmetref etos indicate that after bias correction as a function of air temperature the dmetref etosa well resembles the daily in situ fao etog the time series comparing the bias corrected satellite dmetref etosa with the in situ fao etog at the four weather stations are presented in fig 8 the time series show much better agreement than before correction especially for the two lower elevated stations finarawa and lemlemarena this indicates that the bias corrected dmetref etosa well captures the discrepancies even in the dry periods of the largest advection and also largest eto demand by the atmosphere the descriptive statistics of error between the dmetref etosa and fao etog at the four weather stations is presented in table 3 all the error measures show that the correction of advection effect carried out as a function of air temperature substantially improved the accuracy of dmetref etos comparing to the statistics prior the correction table 2 the largest improvement is observed for the lowland stations finarawa and lemlemrena although after bias correction they still have larger mae and rmse than highland stations maynebri and hagereselam but their normalized errors nmae and nrmse became comparable the me is generally small and well distributed showing either slight overestimation positives or slight underestimation negatives of eto which confirms that there is no more systematic trend observed prior the correction also the mae and rmse show substantial improvement of accuracy at all weather stations particularly distinct at the lower elevated finarawa and lemlemarena stations table 2 finally the daily average discrepancy between dmetref etos and fao etog estimated as the mean of the four stations reduced from 2 12 mm day 1 before the bias correction to 0 02 mm day 1 after 4 3 derived pet the main land use classes of zamra catchments as defined by sentinel 2 level 2a are cultivated land 45 shrubland 38 bare land 14 forest 1 9 and grassland 0 8 the ndvi also derived from sentinel 2 level 2a is presented in fig 9 for the dry season month may and for the wet season month august while the monthly ndvi is presented in appendix 1 during the wet period the ndvi values are substantially higher than during the dry period the high ndvi values dark green spots observed at the south eastern part of the study area in the wet and dry season represent evergreen forest the negative ndvi red spots represent small dams and are attributed to pure water where ndvi gets close to 1 the kc is dependent on ndvi so also spatially and temporally variable the kc difference between wet and dry seasons can be observed in fig 10 the monthly kc variability is presented in appendix 2 during the wet month the eastern part of the study area which represents dominantly cultivated area with high ndvi fig 9 has also high kc fig 10 in the dry month the cultivated area is converted to bare land so the kc becomes much smaller the highest kc values all year long are observed in the south eastern part of the study area covered by evergreen forest the bias corrected satellite dmetref etosa of the zamra catchment is presented in fig 11 as daily averages for the dry season month may and for the wet season month august the monthly dmetref etosa variability is presented in appendix 3 the dmetref etosa ranges from 4 4 mm day 1 to 7 5 mm day 1 and from 2 8 mm day 1 to 4 7 mm day 1 in the dry and wet months respectively the dry month dmetref etosa minima are comparable with the wet month maxima the dmetref etosa is also larger in the low elevated areas western part than in the high elevated areas eastern part during both the dry and wet year months fig 11 because of generally higher temperatures in the lower western part of the zamra catchment the pet of the zamra catchment is presented in fig 12 as daily averages for the dry season month may and for the wet season month august the monthly pet variability is presented in appendix 4 the pet ranges from 0 7 mm day 1 to 8 5 mm day 1 and from 0 5 mm day 1 to 5 1 mm day 1 in the dry and wet months respectively the maxima of pet are higher than the maxima of dmetref etosa fig 11 in both dry and wet periods and they occur in locations where kc 1 the spatial pet distribution in the dry month may has larger pet differences than in the wet month august which is attributed to lulc specific kc enhancement of pet in the dry season for example cultivated land in the north eastern part of the study area in the dry season converts to bare land having very low pet 0 5 mm day 1 while the linear shape river valleys and the south eastern part of the study area all covered by evergreen forest have large pet exceeding 5 mm day 1 5 discussion the lsa saf team 2016 claims that the satellite dmetref etos product provides the reference evapotranspiration as proposed by fao allen et al 1998 i e eto corresponding to weather station measurements at the 2 m height above the ground surface as such the satellite dmetref etos was first compared with the in situ dmetref etog i e applying input data of the four weather stations installed in the study area fig 4a that test provided high correlation coefficients ranging from 0 93 to 0 96 which emphasized good correspondence between satellite and in situ based estimates but provided no information about correspondence between dmetref eto algorithm eq 9 and fao eto algorithm eq 1 therefore next the satellite dmetref etos and in situ dmetref etog were compared with the in situ fao etog fig 4b c these comparisons provided still relatively large correlation coefficient r but associated with regression equations indicating biases increasing with the increase of fao etog larger for higher elevated stations maynebri and hagereselam and smaller for lower elevated stations finarawa and lemlemarena these biases evidenced systematic underestimation bias of dmetref etos as compared to fao etog larger in dry season with high temperatures than in wet season with lower temperatures fig 5 the latter representing conditions closer to the fao hypothetical assumptions of reference evapotranspiration these discrepancies were attributed to heat advection effect not accounted by dmetref etos although the me is not always conclusive because underestimation and overestimation errors can cancel out in this study the negative me across all days and all the four stations analyzed clearly evidenced systematic dmetref etos underestimations table 2 larger in hotter lowlands finarawa and lemlemarena more affected by advection and smaller in cooler highlands maynebri and hagereselam less affected by advection these underestimations were successfully corrected as can be seen by comparing tables 2 with 3 not only me was improved but also mae and rmse the two provide similar information although rmse is more sensitive to large errors as such the difference between the two reflect the relative impact of large errors on the assessed eto which is the largest for lemlemarena 7 and the lowest for maynebri 2 the low averages of nmae and nrmse confirmed observations made by mae and rmse respectively but also concluded that after bias correction the normalized errors were nearly the same for all stations regardless of elevation being slightly larger for the lemlemarena than for the other three stations table 3 although the dmetref eto algorithm lsa saf team 2016 of eq 9 has similar concept as the fao eto algorithm allen et al 1998 of eq 1 for a reference grass with no advection effect both algorithms are formulated differently use different inputs in computing eto and therefore respond differently to the advection the discrepancy between the two algorithms increases with temperature rise which stimulates advection enhanced by strong winds not accounted for by the dmetref etog while accounted by fao etog the heat advection effect responsible for underestimation of dmetref etos as compared to in situ fao etog table 2 is due to an extra source of energy for evapotranspiration ignored by dmetref etos this observation agrees with trigo et al 2018 who also noted in the semi arid area near cordoba spain that dmetref etos was underestimated as compared to fao eto due to strong influence of local advection in their case that effect was also the most distinct when dry and very warm conditions prevailed therefore the discrepancy bias between the dmetref etog and the fao etog experienced in the zamra catchment required correction of the advection effect ignored by dmetref etog that advection effect could have been parameterized and corrected in this study using locally observed air temperature the experiments of trigo et al 2018 in the semi arid environment near cordoba spain showed that the impact of advection effect ignored by dmetref etos was negligible when air temperature was below 15 c indeed days at maynebri and hagereselam weather stations with air temperature less than 15 c showed the bias between dmetref etos and in situ fao etog of less than 0 2 mm day 1 that bias was close to the similar bias 0 1 mm day 1 observed by trigo et al 2018 in cordoba area during days with temperature below 15 c therefore this study used 15 c air temperature threshold in eq 19 to correct satellite dmetref etos the adjustable coefficient ac in eq 19 was also tested for the possible lowest difference between satellite dmetref etos and the in situ fao etog and its optimized values of 0 6 and 0 3 for dry and wet seasons respectively showed the lowest bias the bias correction substantially improved the accuracy of dmetref etos product resulting in more than 50 reduction of mae and rmse and removal of systematic underestimation error note consistently negative me in the table 2 and improvement in table 3 but also in removal of the offset bias between dmetref etos and fao etog time series fig 5 vs fig 8 the ndvi based kc extracted from 100 m2 plot area 13 16 5 n 39 30 50 e of a wheat crop is in pretty good agreement with kc of wheat suggested by livelihoods early assessment and protection leap system for ethiopian agriculture hoefsloot 2012 and with kc of wheat recommended by fao allen et al 1998 all three presented in fig 13 it can be seen that all the three kc estimates have similar trends the slight differences between the ndvi kc and other two are because the method proposed in this study throughout its spatio temporal ndvi variability accounts for local temporally variable condition of the crop while the other two methods provide generalized value of kc not directly attributed to the particular site assessed the ndvi kc is also better temporally attributed the magnitudes of dmetref etosa and pet figs 11 and 12 are different in the dry and wet seasons this is in contrast with tian et al 2015 and joo et al 2018 studies that suggested fao eto as a reliable method to estimate pet for integrated hydrological modelling in arid and semi arid areas the fao eto addresses just one specific land cover type of hypothetical grass at specific climate and well watered conditions which for example in dry season reveals overestimation of a grass eto but underestimation of an evergreen forest eto in contrast the pet considers true lulc and realistic climate dependent temporal variability of vegetation status spatio temporally monitored by ndvi as such this study agrees with chin et al 2011 who stated that because eto and pet differ by location and season they should not substitute one another to investigate the difference between time series of bias corrected satellite dmetref etosa and pet the two were compared over the 1 year period 01 september 2019 31 august 2020 of measurements at the short grass plot 13 14 20 n 39 27 18 e as presented in fig 14 it can be seen that the dmetref etosa and pet well agreed during the wet season especially during the wettest month august when the grass was not water stressed and not disturbed by cattle in that wet period the pet was slightly larger than dmetref etosa likely because the zamra catchment grass was taller than the fao reference grass during the dry season the dmetref etosa was much larger than the pet because the grass during dry season was water stressed and disturbed so the kc 1 and therefore pet dmetref etosa the kc was derived in this study applying a dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 where the kcb and ke were defined based on published linear relations with ndvi developed elsewhere although in similar semi arid conditions this was permitted because 1 it has been proven experimentally that kc but also kcb and ke are linearly dependent on ndvi rafn et al 2008 2 as stated by choudhury et al 1994 spatial heterogeneity of vegetation does not affect the relationship between kcb and vegetation indices meaning that slope and intercept in the linear relation of kcb with ndvi in this study eq 21 differ very little between different plants at given climatic condition and as such the spatio temporally variable spectral reflectance of vegetation constraining ndvi well represents the kcb variability 3 it has been shown by various studies that kcb ndvi relationships developed on crops e g eq 21 were also validated on natural vegetation at the same or similar climatic condition for example the wheat kcb ndvi relationship of choudhury et al 1994 campos et al 2010 used successfully for irrigated grapes and later campos et al 2013 for deriving kcb of holm oak savanna in south western spain 4 the relation ke ndvi eq 22 through its fraction canopy cover fc of eq 22 regulates proportion of vegetated land to bare land in a given pixel analyzed e g eq 22 the ke max 0 25 proposed by er raki et al 2010 and used in this study eq 22 was validated in various locations in morocco akdim et al 2014 characterized by similar environmental condition as the zamra catchment standard lysimetric pet validation experiments were impossible to address in this study however reliable remote sensing based estimates of actual evapotranspiration eta can also be used to validate pet but only in unlimited water availability condition wettest period when pet and eta quantify the same water loss pet eta hence for the validation of pet remote sensing based eta product from fao water productivity open access portal wapor etas provided at 100 m spatial resolution and on dekadal basis was used the wapor etas is calculated based on the etlook model bastiaanssen et al 2012 which uses penman monteith equation monteith 1965 adapted to remote sensing input data fao 2020 from goddard earth observing system model geos 5 and biophysical parameters from sentinel 2 the validation conducted by blatchford et al 2020 confirmed high quality and reliability of the wapor etas estimates across africa in order to validate pet the wapor etas of the two wettest dekads i e from 11 august to 31 august 2020 was aggregated and converted to daily means for the same period daily means of pet following this study protocol were defined fig 15 the pet spatial variability ranging from 0 18 mm to 5 6 mm day 1 fig 15a while the corresponding wapor etas from 0 1 mm to 5 mm day 1 fig 15b the me and mae estimates of differences between the derived pet and wapor etas over all the pixels of the study area were 0 1 mm day 1 pet wapor etas and 0 59 mm day 1 respectively this indicates that the pet derived as a product of kc and dmetref etosa shows pretty good correspondence with the wapor etas during the wettest season the validated during the wet season pet can also be regarded as reliable during the dry season because after bias correction as proposed in this study the dmetref etosa is well defined and reliable while the kc is linearly dependent on the ndvi figs 9 10 and that dependence has low sensitivity with respect to different lulc types therefore spatio temporal variability of ndvi well reflects the spatio temporal variability of the kc nevertheless the kc approach should still be tested and improved the general direction of using the kc linear dependence on ndvi seem to be highly appropriate although it should be lysimetrically validated at various environmental conditions 6 conclusion this study derived pet of the zamra catchment in ethiopia as a product of reference evapotranspiration eto and lulc dependent factor kc both the eto and kc were derived from remote sensing products the satellite dmetref etos product was evaluated and bias corrected towards fao etog using in situ data collected by 4 weather stations installed in the study area while the kc based on linear relationship with ndvi was obtained from sentinel 2 for the pet validation wapor etas product was used the following main conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 in the complex terrains with various lulc as is the case of the zamra catchment cumbersome costly and spatially limited lysimetric measurements of pet are not optimal and also were not possible to carry in this study hence deriving spatial variability daily pet as a product of satellite based eto and a lulc factor was a valuable alternative but also a challenge 2 the correlation between satellite dmetref etos and in situ fao etog was poor in warm conditions due to unaccounted heat advection effect being the reason of a bias 3 the dmetref etos was well improved after applying a bias correction carried out as a function of near surface air temperature derived from era5 land remote sensing product and merged with in situ air temperature applying geographically weighted regression method 4 satellite dmetref etos if bias corrected represents a valuable source of eto 5 both kcb ndvi and ke ndvi relationships are linear and involve empirical parameters in these relations the spatio temporally variable ndvi plays the major role the parameters of these equations are well defined and validated for crops under semi arid conditions but their application on natural lulc is uncertain although the low sensitivity of these parameters when comparing different crops and or different natural vegetation as evidenced by various published validation studies suggest that they can also be used on natural lulcs nevertheless more research is recommended to address that kc challenge 6 the zamra study emphasized substantial difference between eto and pet implying that the eto cannot

7975,study region zamra catchment upper tekeze basin northern ethiopia study focus direct field estimates of potential evapotranspiration pet remain a challenge because they are expensive and have limited spatial representativeness an alternative is to derive pet by remote sensing as a product of reference evapotranspiration eto and land use land cover lulc factor kc the aims of this study were to i validate satellite derived daily reference evapotranspiration dmetref etos ii correct the advection bias of dmetref etos as compared to in situ fao penman monteith eto fao etog and iii convert the bias corrected dmetref etos into pet four atmos 41 weather stations were installed and 1 year daily data was used to validate the dmetref etos the wet season actual evapotranspiration from fao water productivity open access portal wapor was used to validate pet new hydrological insights for the region evaluation of dmetref etos showed large underestimation biases when compared to fao etog derived from in situ weather stations particularly in warm conditions due to unaccounted advection bias the bias correction was performed as a function of near surface air temperature obtained from era5 land merged with in situ air temperature the results showed substantial improvement of eto finally the daily pet was estimated by multiplying the corrected dmetref etos by a spatio temporally variable kc defined as linearly dependent on the ndvi obtained from sentinel 2 this study emphasized substantial difference between eto and pet implying that the eto cannot substitute pet which in many hydrological studies is still a common practice keywords reference evapotranspiration dmetref etos bias correction lulc factor potential evapotranspiration 1 introduction quantifying potential evapotranspiration pet remains a major research gap and as such also a challenge in hydrology because i there is confusion related to the definition of that term and in the way it should be calculated ii of its large spatio temporal variability particularly distinct in arid and semi arid regions iii difficulty of data acquisition however the pet estimate is indispensable in drought assessment in rainfall runoff models and in integrated hydrological models the latter recently becoming a standard tool in water management different contextual pet definitions have been proposed throughout several decades seiller and anctil 2016 the concept of pet different from actual evapotranspiration was first introduced by thornthwaite 1948 as a maximum evapotranspiration that depends on climate soil moisture supply plant cover and land management despite the only variable used to calculate pet was monthly temperature at the same time penman 1948 outlined theoretical approaches to estimate evaporation from an open water body bare soil and grass and this method was later associated with the pet concept by penman 1956 who defined it as the amount of water transpired in a given time by a short green crop completely shading the ground of uniform height and with adequate water status in the soil profile note that definition did not specify crop type later jensen 1968 defined pet as the upper limit of evapotranspiration that occurs with a well watered agricultural crop that has an aerodynamically rough surface such as alfalfa with 30 50 cm of top growth finally the fao penman monteith method by allen et al 1998 stated a crop coefficient as multiplicative factor to a grass reference evapotranspiration eto in order to compute crop evapotranspiration because the ground cover canopy properties and aerodynamic resistance of a crop were different from a grass the pet concept has recently been precised and extended by defining it as the maximum evapotranspiration from a large area with different cover not related to a specific crop mcmahon et al 2013 xiang et al 2020 in this study the pet is defined as the maximum amount of water that can be evaporated from soil surface features from subsurface and also transpired by plants under unlimited water availability condition different methods which claim to estimate pet behave differently and the estimated magnitudes are not always in agreement with each other because of different assumptions and input requirements generally the pet methods can be grouped into mass transfer based temperature based radiation based and combination based bai et al 2016 xiang et al 2020 the mass transfer methods were mainly applied several decades ago to investigate variations and patterns of pet but they clearly showed the ambiguity between pet and evaporation during the early stages of pet studies xiang et al 2020 the temperature based methods require only temperature as input to compute evapotranspiration shaw and riha 2011 sheffield et al 2012 the radiation based methods are based on the energy balance and require solar radiation and temperature as inputs xu and singh 2000 the combination based methods compute evapotranspiration based on more comprehensive physical processes and lead to the most reliable estimates if all input variables are well measured singh and xu 1997 for a long time the pet and eto have shared concepts helm et al 2016 confusing many researchers who used to mix the utilization and equations of the two xiang et al 2020 for example ahmadi and fooladmand 2008 used thornthwaite 1948 method of estimating pet to derive the eto also joo et al 2018 and tian et al 2015 suggested penman monteith fao eto method to estimate pet i e pet eto such pet assumption was strongly discouraged by allen et al 1998 the initiators of the eto concept who pointed out differences between the two also chin et al 2011 stated that pet and eto vary substantially in space and time according to xiang et al 2020 the pet is more applicable for large areas with different land use land cover lulc while the eto refers to a reference grass specific crop for areas other than the reference grass the most appropriate and the most common estimate of pet also implemented in this study utilizes a product of the eto and the spatio temporally variable multiplication factor typically addressed as the kc crop factor verstraeten et al 2008 el zehairy et al 2018 dassargues 2018 xiang et al 2020 however as the kc does not necessarily refer to crops but also to semi natural vegetation hereafter the kc is addressed as lulc factor not crop factor the eto can be computed from climatic measurements peng et al 2017 grouped methods to compute eto into temperature based radiation based pan evaporation based and combination based the combination method is perceived as the most accurate xiang et al 2020 the fao penman monteith fao eto combination method is widely recommended as the standard method to compute eto oudin et al 2010 yadeta et al 2020 the fao penman monteith defines the reference surface as a hypothetical grass reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing and adequately watered allen et al 1998 a typical way to determine fao eto is based on five data types solar radiation wind speed air temperature relative humidity and atmospheric pressure allen et al 1998 all obtained from weather station sensors installed at 2 m height above ground surface however as the eto is spatio temporally variable large areas would require measurements recorded by multiple stations which is expensive moreover their representativeness is spatially limited this is why recently the eto is also derived from satellite measurements representing alternative source of eto ghilain et al 2011 senatore et al 2015 the famine early warning systems network fewsnet the fao water productivity open access portal wapor and the daily reference evapotranspiration dmetref etos from satellite application facility on land surface analysis lsa saf provide three different satellite based eto products the fewsnet and dmetref etos claim to be standardized in accordance with the fao eto allen et al 1998 while the wapor defines eto as the evapotranspiration from a hypothetical reference crop simulating the behaviour of a well watered grass surface fao 2020 the fewsnet 111 km and the wapor 20 km have coarser spatial resolution than the dmetref etos 3 km therefore they are mainly suitable for large regional scale studies lekula and lubczynski 2019 the dmetref etos is more suitable for finer scale studies trigo et al 2018 according to the lsa saf team 2016 the dmetref etos concept closely resembles the fao eto concept trigo et al 2018 validated the satellite dmetref etos using tower and lysimeter in situ measurements in diverse climatic regimes and also compared it with the following estimates of eto i priestley and taylor 1972 ii makkink de bruin et al 2010 and iii fao eto allen et al 1998 in the first two methods the net radiation input i e daily downward surface shortwave flux was obtained from lsa saf while in the third method all estimates were obtained using in situ measurements the dmetref etos applied to the cabauw experimental area in the netherlands very similar to the hypothetical fao reference grass area without advection showed similar results as compared to the tower eto the dmetref etos showed the best correlation with makkink while a conditional bias underestimation overestimation of low high eto as compared to priestley taylor eto and slight underestimation with respect to fao eto however at validation sites situated in semi arid areas characterized by the impact of local advection the dmetref etos as well as the priestley taylor and the makkink methods substantially underestimated the lysimeter eto in such areas the fao eto estimates were found much closer to the lysimeter eto measurements that underestimation was attributed by trigo et al 2018 to the heat advection effect therefore they recommended the underestimation of dmetref etos in semi arid areas to be corrected as a function of near surface air temperature in order to include the extra energy due to the advection effect the kc is the ratio of pet of a specific lulc surface to eto allen et al 1998 the kc is spatio temporally variable and can range from less than 1 to more than 1 depending on lulc bos et al 2009 the most accurate method to directly measure kc is by using lysimeters lorite et al 2012 however installation of lysimeters is expensive and cumbersome the kc of crops can be assigned from the predefined listed values in allen et al 1998 but that collection does not cover kc of diverse lulcs of natural vegetation which differ depending on catchment basin conditions recent studies focus on deriving kc of various lulc not only by field estimates but also by remote sensing based vegetation indices carpintero et al 2020 pôças et al 2020 available from diverse remote sensing satellite products at relatively high spatial resolution the most commonly used index for the remote sensing kc assessment is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which shows a linear relation with kc gontia and tiwari 2010 mutiibwa and irmak 2013 zhang et al 2019 de oliveira et al 2020 a recent study by marcial pablo et al 2021 compared ndvi wide dynamic range vegetation index and 2 band enhanced vegetation index to estimate kc from uav based multi spectral images and these results also indicated that ndvi outperformed other indices moreover the relationships between kc and ndvi for different vegetation covers provided by multiple studies are all linear and very similar e g choudhury et al 1994 gonzalez piqueras et al 2004 campos et al 2010 lópez urrea et al 2016 therefore the ndvi based kc linear equations derived for a certain study area can be applied to other similar study areas rafn et al 2008 the pet is also provided as readily available satellite product from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis at 500 m spatial and 8 day temporal resolution however there is no clear explanation on how that pet is calculated moreover its input data is derived from the global modeling and assimilation office gmao meteorological data at 1 x 1 25 111 km x 138 75 km spatial resolution applying spatial smoothing mu et al 2007 such coarse resolution smoothing may be applicable on a global or regional scale but at the catchment scale it can lead to large biases especially in catchments with complex topography mu et al 2011 such as the catchment of this study the objectives of this study were to i validate the performance of satellite dmetref etos product at daily time step ii correct the advection bias of dmetref etos as compared to in situ fao etog and iii convert the bias corrected dmetref etos into pet the main originalities of this study are in i evaluation parameterization and bias correction of satellite based dmetref etos converted to dmetref etosa ii derivation of daily pet from daily dmetref etosa and ndvi based kc in a topographically complex semi arid area and its wet season validation using wapor actual evapotranspiration 2 study area and data acquisition 2 1 study area the zamra catchment study area situated in the upper tekeze basin is located between latitudes 12 57 42 and 13 20 18 n and longitudes 39 0 8 and 39 40 05 e it covers an area of 1588 km2 fig 1 based on the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm derived digital elevation model dem with a spatial pixel resolution of 30 m the elevation of the study area ranges from 1244 m a s l at the western catchment outlet to 3550 m a s l in the eastern mountainous area about 70 of the study area has slopes smaller than 15 while 6 4 larger than 30 the study area characterized by large spatio temporal rainfall variability experiences two main seasons wet and dry seasons the wet season lasts from june to september and accumulates more than 80 of the total yearly rainfall the maximum and most intensive rainfall events occur in august gebremedhin et al 2020 the months from october to may represent the dry season the temperature of the study area is also largely spatially and temporally variable being dependent on the altitude as indicated by the four weather stations established in this study fig 1 table 1 according to one year observations extending from 01 september 2019 to 31 august 2020 i the daily minimum and maximum temperatures varied from 13 0 c to 29 4 c in the north eastern highland station hagereselam and from 19 2 c to 36 6 c in the western lowland station finarawa respectively ii the average daily solar radiation ranged from 19 0 mj m 2 at the high elevated station hagereselam to 20 2 mj m 2 at the low elevated station finarawa iii the average daily wind speed ranged from 1 58 ms 1 maynebri to 2 76 ms 1 lemlemarena with the latter being much higher because of the gust wind speed during the dry season 2 2 data acquisition in situ based meteorological variables from the established in this study weather stations and satellite dmetref etos data from lsa saf archive were obtained for one year from 01 september 2019 to 31 august 2020 2 2 1 in situ data four atmos 41 all in one weather station meter 2021 were installed in four sites at the zamra catchment presented in fig 1 and table 1 the atmos 41 weather station measures 12 climatic variables including air temperature relative humidity vapor pressure barometric pressure wind speed gust speed wind direction solar radiation shortwave incoming radiation precipitation lightning strike counter and distance all these climatic variables were sampled and recorded every 15 minutes the atmos 41 time was setup to coincide with the coordinated universal time utc 00 time zone of the dmetref etos satellite product sites for installation of the atmos 41 stations were selected mainly based on their representativeness of different land cover types and different altitudes implying different climatic conditions but also considering security reason to prevent vandalism three stations were installed in different croplands while the

crops are grown during the wet season while during the dry season all are transformed in to bare lands 2 2 2 remote sensing data the daily dmetref etos is estimated based on daily estimations of downward surface shortwave flux didssf product generated by the lsa saf from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri meteosat second generation lsa saf team 2016 the meteosat second generation satellite meteosat 8 with its relatively high spatial 3 km and temporal 15 min resolution is particularly interesting to monitor quickly evolving variables as a function of diurnal cycle and cloudiness the meteosat 8 currently delivers the operational indian ocean data coverage service positioned at 41 5 degree east as such ethiopia is situated nearly sub satellite the concept of dmetref etos was introduced to allow the estimation of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere independently of crop type crop development or management practices it claims to be corresponding to the eto definition by allen et al 1998 the dmetref etos product can be obtained from the lsa saf after free registration at https landsaf ipma pt en data catalogue for this study the dmetref etos product

lsa saf team 2016 with the fao eto algorithm allen et al 1998 both algorithms are presented and compared using the same in situ data 3 1 1 fao eto algorithm the fao eto requires solar radiation air

fao eto applying in situ data the dmetref eto algorithm eq 9 and the fao eto algorithm eq 1 are similar for well watered reference surfaces without advection de bruin et al 2016 but in areas strongly influenced by local advection extra energy e g from dry upwind terrain as typically occur in semi arid regions the dmetref eto algorithm does not account for advection effect the wind climatic variable included in the fao eto algorithm eq 1 is not included in the dmetref eto algorithm eq 9 to investigate the impact of the advection bias on eto estimated by both algorithms the same in situ data monitored at the four weather station sites fig 1 table 1 were inserted to eq 9 to obtain dmetref etog and to eq 1 to obtain fao etog finally the two were compared and conclusions drawn 3 2 satellite dmetref etos the dmetref etos combines daily global radiation data derived from geostationary satellite and daily average air temperature at the 2 m height above ground surface with 31 km spatial resolution obtained from european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf is demonstrated in fig 3 the ecmwf is an operational weather forecast which periodically uses its models and data assimilation systems to re analyze archived observations creating global data sets describing the recent history of the atmosphere land surface and oceans https www ecmwf int en research climate reanalysis 3 3 evaluation of satellite dmetref etos pre processing of the satellite dmetref etos product was performed using the open source water and food security ethiopia toolbox under integrated land and water information system ilwis software maathuis et al 2018 that satellite dmetref etos was compared with in situ dmetref etog and then both dmetref etos and dmetref etog estimates were evaluated against the fao etog the performance evaluation was carried out on daily basis using descriptive statistics which included i pearson s product moment correlation coefficient r ii mean error me iii mean absolute error mae iv root mean square error rmse v normalized mean absolute error nmae and vi normalized root mean square error nrmse the latter two introduced by gebremedhin et al 2020

satellite dmetref etos raw dmetref etos data is affected by bias due to unaccounted advection energy however trigo et al 2018 stated that there is no need for universal parametrization of this extra energy as the advection is also a function of an air temperature in this study the correction of dmetref etos advection bias was performed as a function of near surface air temperature of the ecmwf reanalysis version 5 land era5 land merged with in situ temperature measurements both at 2 m above ground surface the era5 land data in contrast to forecasted temperature data used in the dmetref etos fig 3 has better 9 km spatial resolution but is available only 2 3 months behind real time although preliminary data is available 5 days behind real time muñoz sabater et al 2021 the era5 land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ecmwf era5 climate reanalysis which combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics including elevation correction the era5 land air temperature data was obtained from the copernicus climate change service climate date store https cds climate copernicus eu the in situ temperature measurements were obtained from four weather stations installed in this study the merging of era5 land temperature with the in situ temperature was carried out using geographically weighted regression gwr method adopting gebremedhin et al 2020 approach in that approach the elevation was considered as independent explanatory variable and the biases of the era5 land as dependent variable considering that the temperature biases between era5 land and in situ observations are linearly dependent on elevation the gwr model was applied because of its suitability to predict near surface air temperature wang et al 2017 the pre processing of the era5 land air temperature was carried out using the integrated land and water information system ilwis arcgis model builder was used to derive the bias corrected satellite dmetref etos dmetref etosa as per eq 19 the dmetref etosa was finally evaluated by descriptive statistics eqs 13 18 19 dmetref eto s a dmetref eto s i f t a i r t t h dmetref eto s a c t a i r t t h λ i f t a i r t t h where dmetref etosa is the bias corrected satellite dmetref etos in mm day 1 ac is adjustable coefficient tair is mean air temperature in c tth is the temperature threshold which corresponds to the maximum air temperature below which the satellite dmetref etos and the in situ fao etog are found to have negligible difference in this study assigned as 15 c λ is latent heat of vaporization in mj kg 1 note that the bias correction of the dmetref etos performed in this study assumes the fao etog as true computation algorithm of the reference evapotranspiration 3 5 deriving pet the pet was derived in this study as the product of the bias corrected satellite dmetref etosa and satellite based kc the kc accounts for different impacts of plants and soils on pet there are two methods to define kc allen et al 1998 applying single lulc factor eq 20a and dual lulc factor eq 20b where in the latter case the kc splits into soil evaporation factor ke and basal transpiration factor kcb 20a pet k c et o 20b pet k e k cb et o the kc is spatially and temporally variable depending on lulc type and its seasonal change the lulc map of the zamra catchment was derived from sentinel 2 level 2a ground truth samples of the lulc were collected from field works and additional samples were also collected from google earth using the author s expert knowledge on the land use of the study area a supervised classification was performed using snap and the random forest rf classifier applied because it is a robust method with no assumptions of normality which can deal with highly correlated variables being also relatively insensitive to overfitting breiman 2001 this study followed the dual lulc factor approach eq 20b considering kcb the eq 21 was lysimetrically validated for crops and later for natural vegetation by campos et al 2013 in similar environmental condition as the zamra catchment very similar kcb relationship was also validated using lysimeter for crops in semi arid central spain by lópez urrea et al 2016 considering ke the eq 22 was applied after simonneaux et al 2008 who validated it in an irrigated area the same equation was also applied by er raki et al 2010 the fraction of vegetation cover fc in eq 22 was derived in this study as a function of ndvi in the linear model as per eq 23 proposed by gutman and ignatov 1998 for national centers for environmental prediction ncep forecast and since then applied as a common method of deriving fraction of vegetation cover zhang et al 2013 gao et al 2020 21 k cb 1 44 ndvi 0 1 22 k e k e max 1 f c 0 25 1 f c 23 f c ndvi ndvi s ndvi v ndvi s where ndvis is the minimum ndvi at bare soil ndviv is the maximum ndvi at dense vegetation fully vegetated area note the ke decreases with the increase of fc as such the ke 0 when fc 1 i e when a crop or natural plant is well developed and completely covers the soil and ke ke max when fc 0 i e when a soil is bare in this study the ke max 0 25 was assigned after er raki et al 2010 and akdim et al 2014 both applied and validated in morocco in similar condition of low fc as in this study the ndvi was derived from sentinel 2 level 2a products as a function of the reflectance of the near infra red and red spectral bands eq 24 24 ndvi ρ nir ρ r ρ nir ρ r where ρ nir is the reflectance in sentinel 2 msi near infra red band band 8 and ρ r is the reflectance sentinel 2 msi red band band 4 considering sentinel 2 data availability despite its high temporal revisit every 5 days lots of images were contaminated with cloud cover particularly during the wet season hence only one cloud free image of each month was selected and converted to kc the twelve kc catchment distributions representing specific days of a month were then interpolated to daily kc using the linear relationship method of pandas package in python and afterwards smoothed with other scipy package in python the daily pet was derived by multiplying the daily bias corrected satellite dmetref etosa by the corresponding daily satellite kc using the raster iterator in the model builder of arcgis environment the final daily pet was produced with a spatial resolution of 10 m the same as the kc resolution the pet validation was carried out comparing it with the wapor actual evapotranspiration product fao 2020 within the two wet season dekads from 11 to 31 august 2020 see the discussion 4 results 4 1 satellite dmetref etos performance evaluation the pearson s product moment paired correlations between satellite dmetref etos with in situ fao etog and in situ dmetref etog the latter two using data of the four weather stations are presented in fig 4 the high correlations between dmetref etos and dmetref etog fig 4a indicate that dmetref etos is well captured by the dmetref etog but does not provide information on how well the dmetref eto algorithm eq 9 resembles the fao eto algorithm eq 1 this is investigated by other two correlations fig 4b c which are similar both with regression slopes substantially deviating from 45 deg particularly starting from 3 mm day 1 towards the higher values the largest slope deviation has lemlemarena site while the lowest maynebri site the observed deviations in combination with the large correlation coefficients suggest systematic differences biases between dmetref etos and fao etog pairs fig 4b the time series comparing the dmetref etos dmetre etog and fao etog for the four weather stations are presented in fig 5 the agreement between the satellite dmetref etos and in situ dmetref etog is pretty good in contrast to dmetref etos agreements with in situ fao etog which are better for the higher elevated weather stations maynebri and hagereselam than for the lower elevated stations finarawa and lemlemarena moreover these agreements are better in the colder wet season than in the hot dry season when the dmetref etos does not capture the maximum reference evapotranspiration demand by the atmosphere the descriptive statistics of error estimates between dmetref etos and fao etog at the four weather stations is presented in table 2 the me of dmetref etos compared to fao etog shows underestimations at all weather stations the me is relatively small at the highland stations maynebri and hagereselam but substantial at the lowland stations finarawa and lemlemarena the mae and rmse showed similar trends at all four weather stations the normalized with respect to fao etog nmae and nrmse demonstrated large biases for the lowland stations finarawa and lemlemarena and lower for highland stations maynebri and hagereselam 4 2 bias correction of satellite dmetref etos the temporal pattern of daily era5 land air temperature at the 2 m height above the ground surface show a good relationship with the in situ air temperature measurements at the 2 m height acquired from the four weather stations fig 6 the average pearson s product moment correlation coefficient between era5 land and in situ temperature measurements is greater than 0 85 and the daily mean absolute error is less than 2 c day 1 with better agreement at the high elevated stations maynebri and hagereselam compared to the low elevated stations finarawa and lemlemarena as such the era5 land can be directly used for bias correction of the satellite dmetref etos in this study the era5 land temperature was merged with the in situ observed at the 2 m height air temperatures and that merging provided a substantially improved near surface air temperature product merged temp in fig 6 further used to improve the dmetref etos the pearson s product moment correlations r and regression between bias corrected satellite dmetref etosa according to eq 19 using gwr merged temperature as input and fao etog are presented in fig 7 these graphs particularly when comparing them to the graphs presented in fig 4 satellite dmetref etos indicate that after bias correction as a function of air temperature the dmetref etosa well resembles the daily in situ fao etog the time series comparing the bias corrected satellite dmetref etosa with the in situ fao etog at the four weather stations are presented in fig 8 the time series show much better agreement than before correction especially for the two lower elevated stations finarawa and lemlemarena this indicates that the bias corrected dmetref etosa well captures the discrepancies even in the dry periods of the largest advection and also largest eto demand by the atmosphere the descriptive statistics of error between the dmetref etosa and fao etog at the four weather stations is presented in table 3 all the error measures show that the correction of advection effect carried out as a function of air temperature substantially improved the accuracy of dmetref etos comparing to the statistics prior the correction table 2 the largest improvement is observed for the lowland stations finarawa and lemlemrena although after bias correction they still have larger mae and rmse than highland stations maynebri and hagereselam but their normalized errors nmae and nrmse became comparable the me is generally small and well distributed showing either slight overestimation positives or slight underestimation negatives of eto which confirms that there is no more systematic trend observed prior the correction also the mae and rmse show substantial improvement of accuracy at all weather stations particularly distinct at the lower elevated finarawa and lemlemarena stations table 2 finally the daily average discrepancy between dmetref etos and fao etog estimated as the mean of the four stations reduced from 2 12 mm day 1 before the bias correction to 0 02 mm day 1 after 4 3 derived pet the main land use classes of zamra catchments as defined by sentinel 2 level 2a are cultivated land 45 shrubland 38 bare land 14 forest 1 9 and grassland 0 8 the ndvi also derived from sentinel 2 level 2a is presented in fig 9 for the dry season month may and for the wet season month august while the monthly ndvi is presented in appendix 1 during the wet period the ndvi values are substantially higher than during the dry period the high ndvi values dark green spots observed at the south eastern part of the study area in the wet and dry season represent evergreen forest the negative ndvi red spots represent small dams and are attributed to pure water where ndvi gets close to 1 the kc is dependent on ndvi so also spatially and temporally variable the kc difference between wet and dry seasons can be observed in fig 10 the monthly kc variability is presented in appendix 2 during the wet month the eastern part of the study area which represents dominantly cultivated area with high ndvi fig 9 has also high kc fig 10 in the dry month the cultivated area is converted to bare land so the kc becomes much smaller the highest kc values all year long are observed in the south eastern part of the study area covered by evergreen forest the bias corrected satellite dmetref etosa of the zamra catchment is presented in fig 11 as daily averages for the dry season month may and for the wet season month august the monthly dmetref etosa variability is presented in appendix 3 the dmetref etosa ranges from 4 4 mm day 1 to 7 5 mm day 1 and from 2 8 mm day 1 to 4 7 mm day 1 in the dry and wet months respectively the dry month dmetref etosa minima are comparable with the wet month maxima the dmetref etosa is also larger in the low elevated areas western part than in the high elevated areas eastern part during both the dry and wet year months fig 11 because of generally higher temperatures in the lower western part of the zamra catchment the pet of the zamra catchment is presented in fig 12 as daily averages for the dry season month may and for the wet season month august the monthly pet variability is presented in appendix 4 the pet ranges from 0 7 mm day 1 to 8 5 mm day 1 and from 0 5 mm day 1 to 5 1 mm day 1 in the dry and wet months respectively the maxima of pet are higher than the maxima of dmetref etosa fig 11 in both dry and wet periods and they occur in locations where kc 1 the spatial pet distribution in the dry month may has larger pet differences than in the wet month august which is attributed to lulc specific kc enhancement of pet in the dry season for example cultivated land in the north eastern part of the study area in the dry season converts to bare land having very low pet 0 5 mm day 1 while the linear shape river valleys and the south eastern part of the study area all covered by evergreen forest have large pet exceeding 5 mm day 1 5 discussion the lsa saf team 2016 claims that the satellite dmetref etos product provides the reference evapotranspiration as proposed by fao allen et al 1998 i e eto corresponding to weather station measurements at the 2 m height above the ground surface as such the satellite dmetref etos was first compared with the in situ dmetref etog i e applying input data of the four weather stations installed in the study area fig 4a that test provided high correlation coefficients ranging from 0 93 to 0 96 which emphasized good correspondence between satellite and in situ based estimates but provided no information about correspondence between dmetref eto algorithm eq 9 and fao eto algorithm eq 1 therefore next the satellite dmetref etos and in situ dmetref etog were compared with the in situ fao etog fig 4b c these comparisons provided still relatively large correlation coefficient r but associated with regression equations indicating biases increasing with the increase of fao etog larger for higher elevated stations maynebri and hagereselam and smaller for lower elevated stations finarawa and lemlemarena these biases evidenced systematic underestimation bias of dmetref etos as compared to fao etog larger in dry season with high temperatures than in wet season with lower temperatures fig 5 the latter representing conditions closer to the fao hypothetical assumptions of reference evapotranspiration these discrepancies were attributed to heat advection effect not accounted by dmetref etos although the me is not always conclusive because underestimation and overestimation errors can cancel out in this study the negative me across all days and all the four stations analyzed clearly evidenced systematic dmetref etos underestimations table 2 larger in hotter lowlands finarawa and lemlemarena more affected by advection and smaller in cooler highlands maynebri and hagereselam less affected by advection these underestimations were successfully corrected as can be seen by comparing tables 2 with 3 not only me was improved but also mae and rmse the two provide similar information although rmse is more sensitive to large errors as such the difference between the two reflect the relative impact of large errors on the assessed eto which is the largest for lemlemarena 7 and the lowest for maynebri 2 the low averages of nmae and nrmse confirmed observations made by mae and rmse respectively but also concluded that after bias correction the normalized errors were nearly the same for all stations regardless of elevation being slightly larger for the lemlemarena than for the other three stations table 3 although the dmetref eto algorithm lsa saf team 2016 of eq 9 has similar concept as the fao eto algorithm allen et al 1998 of eq 1 for a reference grass with no advection effect both algorithms are formulated differently use different inputs in computing eto and therefore respond differently to the advection the discrepancy between the two algorithms increases with temperature rise which stimulates advection enhanced by strong winds not accounted for by the dmetref etog while accounted by fao etog the heat advection effect responsible for underestimation of dmetref etos as compared to in situ fao etog table 2 is due to an extra source of energy for evapotranspiration ignored by dmetref etos this observation agrees with trigo et al 2018 who also noted in the semi arid area near cordoba spain that dmetref etos was underestimated as compared to fao eto due to strong influence of local advection in their case that effect was also the most distinct when dry and very warm conditions prevailed therefore the discrepancy bias between the dmetref etog and the fao etog experienced in the zamra catchment required correction of the advection effect ignored by dmetref etog that advection effect could have been parameterized and corrected in this study using locally observed air temperature the experiments of trigo et al 2018 in the semi arid environment near cordoba spain showed that the impact of advection effect ignored by dmetref etos was negligible when air temperature was below 15 c indeed days at maynebri and hagereselam weather stations with air temperature less than 15 c showed the bias between dmetref etos and in situ fao etog of less than 0 2 mm day 1 that bias was close to the similar bias 0 1 mm day 1 observed by trigo et al 2018 in cordoba area during days with temperature below 15 c therefore this study used 15 c air temperature threshold in eq 19 to correct satellite dmetref etos the adjustable coefficient ac in eq 19 was also tested for the possible lowest difference between satellite dmetref etos and the in situ fao etog and its optimized values of 0 6 and 0 3 for dry and wet seasons respectively showed the lowest bias the bias correction substantially improved the accuracy of dmetref etos product resulting in more than 50 reduction of mae and rmse and removal of systematic underestimation error note consistently negative me in the table 2 and improvement in table 3 but also in removal of the offset bias between dmetref etos and fao etog time series fig 5 vs fig 8 the ndvi based kc extracted from 100 m2 plot area 13 16 5 n 39 30 50 e of a wheat crop is in pretty good agreement with kc of wheat suggested by livelihoods early assessment and protection leap system for ethiopian agriculture hoefsloot 2012 and with kc of wheat recommended by fao allen et al 1998 all three presented in fig 13 it can be seen that all the three kc estimates have similar trends the slight differences between the ndvi kc and other two are because the method proposed in this study throughout its spatio temporal ndvi variability accounts for local temporally variable condition of the crop while the other two methods provide generalized value of kc not directly attributed to the particular site assessed the ndvi kc is also better temporally attributed the magnitudes of dmetref etosa and pet figs 11 and 12 are different in the dry and wet seasons this is in contrast with tian et al 2015 and joo et al 2018 studies that suggested fao eto as a reliable method to estimate pet for integrated hydrological modelling in arid and semi arid areas the fao eto addresses just one specific land cover type of hypothetical grass at specific climate and well watered conditions which for example in dry season reveals overestimation of a grass eto but underestimation of an evergreen forest eto in contrast the pet considers true lulc and realistic climate dependent temporal variability of vegetation status spatio temporally monitored by ndvi as such this study agrees with chin et al 2011 who stated that because eto and pet differ by location and season they should not substitute one another to investigate the difference between time series of bias corrected satellite dmetref etosa and pet the two were compared over the 1 year period 01 september 2019 31 august 2020 of measurements at the short grass plot 13 14 20 n 39 27 18 e as presented in fig 14 it can be seen that the dmetref etosa and pet well agreed during the wet season especially during the wettest month august when the grass was not water stressed and not disturbed by cattle in that wet period the pet was slightly larger than dmetref etosa likely because the zamra catchment grass was taller than the fao reference grass during the dry season the dmetref etosa was much larger than the pet because the grass during dry season was water stressed and disturbed so the kc 1 and therefore pet dmetref etosa the kc was derived in this study applying a dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 where the kcb and ke were defined based on published linear relations with ndvi developed elsewhere although in similar semi arid conditions this was permitted because 1 it has been proven experimentally that kc but also kcb and ke are linearly dependent on ndvi rafn et al 2008 2 as stated by choudhury et al 1994 spatial heterogeneity of vegetation does not affect the relationship between kcb and vegetation indices meaning that slope and intercept in the linear relation of kcb with ndvi in this study eq 21 differ very little between different plants at given climatic condition and as such the spatio temporally variable spectral reflectance of vegetation constraining ndvi well represents the kcb variability 3 it has been shown by various studies that kcb ndvi relationships developed on crops e g eq 21 were also validated on natural vegetation at the same or similar climatic condition for example the wheat kcb ndvi relationship of choudhury et al 1994 campos et al 2010 used successfully for irrigated grapes and later campos et al 2013 for deriving kcb of holm oak savanna in south western spain 4 the relation ke ndvi eq 22 through its fraction canopy cover fc of eq 22 regulates proportion of vegetated land to bare land in a given pixel analyzed e g eq 22 the ke max 0 25 proposed by er raki et al 2010 and used in this study eq 22 was validated in various locations in morocco akdim et al 2014 characterized by similar environmental condition as the zamra catchment standard lysimetric pet validation experiments were impossible to address in this study however reliable remote sensing based estimates of actual evapotranspiration eta can also be used to validate pet but only in unlimited water availability condition wettest period when pet and eta quantify the same water loss pet eta hence for the validation of pet remote sensing based eta product from fao water productivity open access portal wapor etas provided at 100 m spatial resolution and on dekadal basis was used the wapor etas is calculated based on the etlook model bastiaanssen et al 2012 which uses penman monteith equation monteith 1965 adapted to remote sensing input data fao 2020 from goddard earth observing system model geos 5 and biophysical parameters from sentinel 2 the validation conducted by blatchford et al 2020 confirmed high quality and reliability of the wapor etas estimates across africa in order to validate pet the wapor etas of the two wettest dekads i e from 11 august to 31 august 2020 was aggregated and converted to daily means for the same period daily means of pet following this study protocol were defined fig 15 the pet spatial variability ranging from 0 18 mm to 5 6 mm day 1 fig 15a while the corresponding wapor etas from 0 1 mm to 5 mm day 1 fig 15b the me and mae estimates of differences between the derived pet and wapor etas over all the pixels of the study area were 0 1 mm day 1 pet wapor etas and 0 59 mm day 1 respectively this indicates that the pet derived as a product of kc and dmetref etosa shows pretty good correspondence with the wapor etas during the wettest season the validated during the wet season pet can also be regarded as reliable during the dry season because after bias correction as proposed in this study the dmetref etosa is well defined and reliable while the kc is linearly dependent on the ndvi figs 9 10 and that dependence has low sensitivity with respect to different lulc types therefore spatio temporal variability of ndvi well reflects the spatio temporal variability of the kc nevertheless the kc approach should still be tested and improved the general direction of using the kc linear dependence on ndvi seem to be highly appropriate although it should be lysimetrically validated at various environmental conditions 6 conclusion this study derived pet of the zamra catchment in ethiopia as a product of reference evapotranspiration eto and lulc dependent factor kc both the eto and kc were derived from remote sensing products the satellite dmetref etos product was evaluated and bias corrected towards fao etog using in situ data collected by 4 weather stations installed in the study area while the kc based on linear relationship with ndvi was obtained from sentinel 2 for the pet validation wapor etas product was used the following main conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 in the complex terrains with various lulc as is the case of the zamra catchment cumbersome costly and spatially limited lysimetric measurements of pet are not optimal and also were not possible to carry in this study hence deriving spatial variability daily pet as a product of satellite based eto and a lulc factor was a valuable alternative but also a challenge 2 the correlation between satellite dmetref etos and in situ fao etog was poor in warm conditions due to unaccounted heat advection effect being the reason of a bias 3 the dmetref etos was well improved after applying a bias correction carried out as a function of near surface air temperature derived from era5 land remote sensing product and merged with in situ air temperature applying geographically weighted regression method 4 satellite dmetref etos if bias corrected represents a valuable source of eto 5 both kcb ndvi and ke ndvi relationships are linear and involve empirical parameters in these relations the spatio temporally variable ndvi plays the major role the parameters of these equations are well defined and validated for crops under semi arid conditions but their application on natural lulc is uncertain although the low sensitivity of these parameters when comparing different crops and or different natural vegetation as evidenced by various published validation studies suggest that they can also be used on natural lulcs nevertheless more research is recommended to address that kc challenge 6 the zamra study emphasized substantial difference between eto and pet implying that the eto cannot substitute pet which unfortunately in many hydrological studies is still a common practice credit authorship contribution statement gebremedhin m a and lubczynski m w conceptualization gebremedhin m a

multisource et products in streamflow simulation the swat model is calibrated with three strategies calibration using streamflow observations strategy i calibration using multisource et strategy ii and calibration by incorporating them strategy iii moreover the impact of using multisource et products at subbasin level on streamflow simulation is also investigated new hydrological insights for the region gleam tends to have the least relative uncertainty in the basin and perform the best in the comparison with cr et and water balance derived et as benchmark overall multisource et products are alternative variables for streamflow simulation in this basin the nse of the simulated streamflow can reach 0 73 0 70 0 68 in the validation period based on calibration strategy ii with mod16 gleam and gldas respectively which are slightly poorer than that based on strategy i but still good and the collocation of streamflow observations and gleam performs relatively better in strategy iii according to the three selected evaluation indices nse bias and kge it should be noted that when taking the spatial information of et products into parameter calibration the differences of the

streamflow is a rather important role among all components of the water cycle for it can be a domain water source for agriculture industry and human being whiles it can also result in a natural disaster to risk human life and property therefore accurate streamflow monitoring and simulation is vital for water resources and natural hazards management although there is a considerable amount of hydrological stations over the world the ground hydrological stations are still deficient in many regions to provide information for streamflow conditions primarily in developing countries fekete et al 2012 fortunately many physically based hydrological models are developed to simulate and predict streamflow for water resources management physically based hydrological models contain abundant parameters that describe the condition of the model domains however some parameters in hydrological models cannot be decided easily due to the complex actual environmental system therefore parameter calibration becomes a necessary step in hydrological modeling typically streamflow observations at the outlet are utilized for parameter calibration and evaluation in hydrological modeling because they can be measured more easily and accurately compared to other hydrological components wanders et al 2014 unfortunately high quality and large quantity streamflow observations are not always available which is the main limitation for hydrological modeling abbaspour et al 2019 lópez lópez et al 2017 wagener and montanari 2011 furthermore the single variable calibration generally only using streamflow observations often induces the remarkable streamflow simulation but poor simulation for other hydrological components which implies the great uncertainty and poor performance of the hydrological models mcmillan et al 2010 minville et al 2014 in order to address these issues using alternative variable to calibrate the parameters of hydrological models has been adopted as an option especially in ungauged and data poor regions meyer oliveira et al 2021 rajib et al 2016 evapotranspiration et is a promising alternative variable for parameter calibration in hydrological models for it is not only the second largest variable in the hydrological cycle but also is considered as an important role in the carbon cycle and energy cycle carter and liang 2019 fisher et al 2017 ma et al 2021 2019b zhang et al 2020 while due to the high cost and complex terrain environment the accurate measurement of et also remains lacking fortunately remote sensing technology has made a great contribution to improving the et estimates in the past decades martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 mu et al 2007 various regional or global et products have emerged and been applied in hydrological model calibration in case that streamflow observations are not available becker et al 2019 dembélé et al 2020 gui et al 2019 odusanya et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 some studies have proved that the hydrological model calibrated against et is potential to generate reasonable streamflow among them odusanya et al 2019 revealed that the water components including the outflow at the outlet simulated by the soil and water assessment tool swat using et calibration can capture the seasonal characteristic zhang et al 2020 conducted two lumped conceptual hydrological models with et calibration in 222 catchments across australia and monthly streamflow and mean annual streamflow were successfully simulated particularly in wetter catchments additionally huang et al 2020 incorporated the pml aet a global evapotranspiration product based on improved penman monteith leuning model and water storage data into hydrological model calibration in the 30 catchments within the yalong river basin successfully improving the streamflow simulation performance compared with which using traditional regionalization method furthermore whether incorporating streamflow observations with et can improve streamflow simulation attracts much attention with the booming of remote sensing based et datasets some studies have investigated the effect of multi variable calibration that incorporating remote sensing based et with other variable to improve the streamflow simulation with lumped semi distributed and fully distributed hydrological models kunnath poovakka et al 2016 pan et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 rientjes et al 2013 for instance among them herman et al 2018 utilized multi variable techniques incorporating streamflow with two different et datasets based on operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model and the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model for parameter calibration and it showed that the multi variable calibration was able to improve the et simulation on the condition of maintaining its performance on streamflow simulation pan et al 2018 found that the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm which is calibrated with streamflow and et dataset tended to provide more reasonable simulation for both streamflow and et but there are also some studies indicating that incorporating streamflow and et for hydrological model calibration results in poor performance of streamflow simulations parajuli et al 2017 rajib et al 2018 willem vervoort et al 2014 for instance parajuli et al 2017 calibrated the soil and water assessment tool swat model with streamflow observations and mod16 and it got a slightly poorer model performance of streamflow simulation compared with that calibrated with only streamflow observations therefore it is meaningful to investigate the effect of et in parameter calibration for streamflow simulation with different calibration strategies using as the alternative variable or being incorporated in multi variable calibration selecting a suitable remote sensing based et for a particular study area is also a great challenge for one key factor influencing the performance of streamflow simulation in multi variable calibration is the selection of the et dataset for instance herman et al 2020 tried to integrate streamflow with eight different remote sensing et products and an ensemble et product respectively in parameter calibration for swat and finally got different performances of streamflow simulation due to the variety of the structures and input datasets of the et estimation models et products tend to have different characteristics even in the same region which leads to their different performances in parameter calibration for hydrological simulation until now the studies integrating remote sensing based et products in parameter calibration for hydrological modeling over regions in china are still deficient the et estimates based on moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis global terrestrial evapotranspiration algorithm hereafter referred to as mod16 global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam and global land data assimilation system gldas are three representative et products which have been widely assessed for their accuracy using the eddy flux tower observations in many different regions over the world bai and liu 2018 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011 there are also many studies evaluating the accuracy of these three et products in china to be specific mod16 has been evaluated via the ground based eddy covariance ec measurements collocated from the seven sites in north and northwest china and gleam and gldas also have been evaluated via the eight sites from the chinese flux observation and research network chinaflux sun et al 2021 tang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 the evaluation results show that all of them are able to reproduce the spatial and the temporal patterns of the et in china but tend to underestimate or overestimate the observations at a varying degree in different sites mainly related to the different land use and some studies have applied mod16 and gleam as the calibration et datasets for hydrological models in some regions other than china and they achieved satisfactory performance on streamflow simulation at monthly scale odusanya et al 2019 sirisena et al 2020 tobin and bennett 2017 these studies proved that mod16 and gleam are alternative in parameter calibration in some regions however the capability of gldas in parameter calibration for hydrological modeling still remains to be investigated furthermore most previous studies investigating the role of remote sensing based et in hydrological model calibration were conducted in watersheds with an area of less than 10 000 km2 jiang et al 2020 and as mentioned above the studies integrating et products in hydrological model calibration in china are limited therefore it is one of the main aims in this study based on some previous studies e g zhang et al 2020 the et calibration plays a more significant role in wet regions for streamflow simulation the xiang river basin a humid region located in the middle part of the yangtze river basin is selected as the study area to investigate the applicability of et calibration for hydrological model in various topography and land use condition considering their potential impacts on the estimates of the et products in addition compare to et from flux observations the most prominent advantage of remote sensing based et products is that they can provide more detailed spatial features the impact of these spatial information brought by the et products on the streamflow simulation are worth exploring the overall objectives of this study are as follows 1 to quantify the relative uncertainties of the three selected remote sensing based et products and further evaluate them with the et from terrestrial evapotranspiration dataset across china hereafter referred to as cr et and water balance method as benchmarks 2 to investigate the role of remote sensing based et products in hydrological model calibration with three calibration strategies which are calibration using streamflow observations et estimates from mod16 gleam and gldas respectively and incorporating the two variables 3 to explore the value of the spatial information provided by remote sensing based et products on streamflow simulation through calibrating the parameters with et at each subbasin the following context is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and datasets section 3 presents the methodology used in this study section 4 presents the results and discussion of this study and the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area xiang river basin is located in the south part of china bordered geographically by latitudes 110 e and 114 5 e and longitudes 24 5 e and 28 5 e fig 1a xiang river basin is known as one of primary basins of yangtze river basin with a drainage area of 82 375 km2 above xiangtan discharge station which is the outlet of the basin the central and northern regions are relatively flat with lower elevation compare to the southern regions where is distributed with mountains and hills the study area is mainly affected by the east asian monsoon climate so it has obvious seasonal meteorological characteristics the annual precipitation 2009 2018 obtained from in situ observations in this basin ranges from 1077 to 1863 mm and the precipitation is unevenly distributed which concentrates from april to jun fig 1b the precipitation also has a noticeable spatial pattern showing a decreasing trend from the northeast to the southwest in the xiang river basin zhu et al 2020 the annual pet from 2009 to 2018 based on fao

property dynamics from modis products as inputs including land cover leaf area index lai fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar and albedo mu et al 2011 compare to the other two et products the spatial resolution of mod16 is the highest its accuracy has been proved globally and showed more reliable in lower altitude zones herman et al 2020 according to previous studies the correlation coefficients of mod16 with the in situ eddy covariance observations from north america can reach 0 86 and the mean absolute bias reach 0 31 mm day mu et al 2011 besides in comparison with the in situ eddy covariance observations in china the bias can reaches 0 2 mm 8d tang et al 2015 gleam can be accessed freely https www gleam eu and it is estimated with a set of algorithms targeting at the terrestrial evaporation and root zone soil moisture miralles et al 2011 this model is divided into four modules potential evaporation module rainfall interception module soil module and stress module then the et is computed as a function of the soil moisture stress and the priestley taylor equation based pet priestley and taylor 1972 gleam incorporates various reliable satellite observed geophysical variables as inputs containing radiation air temperature precipitation snow water equivalent vegetation optical depth surface soil moisture and vegetation fractions martens et al 2017 the gleam v3 3 is used in this study which is the lasted version released in 2019 compare to the last version the forcing datasets of gleam v3 3 are updated the gleam is available from 1980 to 2018 and its spatial and temporal resolution of this product is 0 25 and 1 day respectively the average correlation coefficients with in situ eddy covariance observations generally are higher than 0 7 in china and other regions which indicates the high accuracy of gleam li et al 2018 martens et al 2017 yang et al 2017 gldas https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas is developed jointly by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental prediction ncep it is generated by using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques to combine satellite based and ground based observation datasets for the goal of generating the optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 the et product selected in this study is gldas v2 2 which is the latest version released in february 2020 it assimilates the total terrestrial water anomaly data from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace into the catchment land surface model clsm li et al 2019 the spatial and temporal resolution of gldas is 0 25 and 1 day respectively and it is available from 2003 to 2020 considering the different temporal coverage of these three et products the time period from 2009 to 2018 is chosen to evaluate their accuracy and potential capability in parameter calibration for streamflow simulation the spatial distributions of the mean annual values of these three et products at their own spatial resolution are illustrated in fig 2 it shows that the mean annual et ranges in this study area are 485 1273 mm 712 959 mm 639 1148 mm for mod16 gleam and gldas respectively additionally in the southwest part of the basin compare to other two products gldas tends to have higher et estimations however gleam tends to have lower et estimations in the northeast part generally all three et estimations are increasing from northwest to southeast part of the basin but vary spatially 2 2 2 reference et product other meteorological variables and streamflow observations the cr et with the resolution of 0 1 and 1 month used as the reference et data for the

environmental and ecological science data center for west china national natural science foundation of china http westdc westgis ac cn 3 methodology as mentioned above mod16 gleam and gldas are evaluated before being applied in parameter calibration for hydrological simulation considering the absence of flux tower observations in this study three cornered hat tch method is firstly employed to quantify the relative uncertainties of these three et products in the xiang river basin for relative evaluation in addition the three et products are further assessed through comparing with the benchmark et from cr et and the water balance method then swat model is set up with datasets introduced above to investigate the applicability of et in swat calibration the calibration is realized under three strategies 1 calibration with streamflow only strategy i 2 calibration with et only strategy ii 3 calibration with both streamflow and et strategy iii furthermore the impact of the spatial information provided by the three et products on the streamflow simulation are explored through the calibration at subbasin level which differs from the above strategies 3 1 multisource et evaluation because of the inconsistency of the temporal resolutions of the three et estimates temporal downscaling is utilized for mod16 in this study in order to downscale mod16 from 8 day scale to daily scale to maintain the same temporal resolution with gleam and gldas jra 55 japanese 55 year is used as reference jra 55 is a global atmosphere reanalysis product containing the et estimates developed by the japan meteorological agency jma harada et al 2016 kobayashi et al 2015 it has achieved outstanding performance for drought monitoring in china chen et al 2019 the downscaling is conducted with the following equation 1 e t i μ e t t μ e t i j e t t j here m and j represent mod16 and jra 55 respectively t refers to the total 8 day et i refers to a particular day within that 8 day segment t 3 1 1 three cornered hat tch method the tch method is employed to quantify the uncertainties of the three et products without any prior knowledge of the true value of et tavella and premoli 1994 it has been applied to quantify the uncertainties of various remote sensing products over different regions in past studies liu et al 2021b long et al 2014 xu et al 2019 mod16 are preprocessed to the spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 through the inverse distance weighted interpolation method idw to keep consistent with gleam and gldas besides the nearest neighbor method is used to prevent the effect brought by the upscaling method similarly gleam and gldas are aggregated to 8 days to be consistent with the temporal resolution of mod16 the tch method is applied pixel by pixel in the study area to obtain the relative uncertainties of the three et products per pixel the details of the tch method are presented as follows 2 x i x t ε i i 1 2 n here x i 1 2 n is the time series of et extracted from each pixel in evaluated products here n 3 x t is the time series of the true value of et in each pixel ɛ i is the associated measurement error the difference between each series and the reference is taken as 3 y i n x i x r ε i ε n i 1 n 1 where y i n is an m n 1 matrix and m is the size of time samples x r is the reference data since the true value is unknown and the result of tch is insensitive to the selection of the reference data awange et al 2016 liu et al 2021c tavella and premoli 1994 here gleam is randomly selected as x r to obtain the error difference the covariance matrix of y i n and y j n is then computed by 4 s i j c o v y i n y j n i j 1 n 1 here the unknown n n covariance matrix of the individual noise q is introduced and is related to s as 5 s j q j t here j is n 1 n matrix represented as 6 j n 1 n 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 to resolve the target unknowns under the condition that the number of the unknown is larger than a number of equations the remaining free elements can be determined by defining the objective function f constrained by the function in kuhn tucker theorem galindo and palacio 1999 the objective function is as 7 f q 1 n q n n 1 k 2 i j n q i j 2 and its constraint function is as 8 h q 1 n q n n q s k 0 where q 1 n q n n are the elements of q and k det s n 1 the initial conditions for the iteration is set as 9 q i n 0 0 i n q n n 0 1 2 s s 1 1 s 1 1 1 t finally q is obtained when the objective function combined with eq 6 is minimized the square root of the ith diagonal elements of q q ii are considered to be the uncertainty of evaluated et the ratio of the uncertainty to the mean of the et value is the relative uncertainty the relative uncertainty is used to evaluate the performance of the three et products neglecting the influence of et magnitude 3 1 2 water balance method the annual et derived by the water balance method is also used as the benchmark to assess the et products at the basin scale velpuri et al 2013 the et derived with the water balance method is defined as 10 w b e t p r δ s where wbet is the et derived with water balance method p r and δ s are precipitation runoff and total water storage change respectively among which δ s is derived from the latest version of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace rl06 mascon solution released by the center for space research at the university of texas csr with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 1 month http www2 csr utexas edu grace considering the missing data of grace during 2017 7 2018 5 the evaluation with water balance method is conducted during 2009 2016 3 2 swat model set up and calibration the swat model is used to evaluate the applicability of et products in parameter calibration of hydrological simulation the swat model is a continuous semi distributed process based hydrological model which can simulate surface runoff sediment and nutrient loads in the catchment on a daily or sub daily time step abbaspour et al 2015 arnold et al 1998 the watershed delineation and the streamflow networks extraction are accomplished based on the dem based on the slope land use and the soil types the subbasin is further discretized into a number of hydrologic response units hrus which is the most basic computational unit for each hru water balance calculation is accomplished for hydrologic simulation swat estimates et based on pet which can be estimated from three methods according to the amount of available meteorological inputs in the model including the penman monteith method monteith 1965 the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 and the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 therefore considering the high accuracy of penman monteith method for pet estimation and the available meteorological data in this study penman monteith method is selected to simulate et in the swat set up period cai et al 2007 zhang et al 2018 the xiang river basin is delineated into 25 subbasins and 495 hrus the model is run at the daily time step the study period was divided into three period which are for warming up 2009 2010 calibration 2011 2014 and validation 2015 2018 respectively in this study the averaged et at the grids contained in each subbasin represents the et time series of each subbasin the model calibration and validation are accomplished with the help of the tool named swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup which is an auto calibration and uncertainty analysis module program based on the swat engine abbaspour 2015 sufi 2 sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm optimization algorithm in swat cup is employed here considering its advantage of easy calculation and short time spanning abbaspour et al 2004 before parameter calibration sensitive parameters have been selected through latin hypercube and one factor at a time sampling method in our previous study zhu et al 2016 a total of two iterations are run with 500 simulations in each strategy which means there are a total of 1000 simulations during the calibration the range of each parameter is narrowed down based on the suggested new parameters of the swat cup after the last iteration and their reasonable physical ranges the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is defined as the objective function in the calibration when there is more than one variable then the objective function is defined as 11 of i w i n s e i where w i and n s e i are the weight and the nse of ith variable 3 3 statistical analysis different statistical indices are used to quantitatively evaluate et products including pearson s correlation coefficient r bias and root mean square error rmse the other two indices namely nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge are employed to

discussion 4 1 evaluation of multisource et products 4 1 1 uncertainty analysis of multisource et products based on the tch method the uncertainties of the three et are quantified before the application for the parameter calibration in the hydrological simulation fig 3 shows the relative uncertainties of the three et products grid by grid in the xiang river basin it is obvious that gleam has the smallest relative uncertainty among the three et products the mean relative uncertainty of gleam is 11 52 and the lower relative uncertainty concentrate on the central area of the basin which indicates that gleam is the closest to those of the other two et estimates on average and shows more reliability however for both mod16 and gldas they all tend to have relative higher uncertainty at all grids in this basin with the mean relative uncertainty of 33 47 and 42 56 meanwhile to avoid the potential influence of using different upscaling method to process the mod16 the uncertainty quantification is also conducted with the et from mod16 which is preprocessed with nearest neighbor method as fig 4 shows the results of the relative uncertainty are overall similar with fig 3 but for the specific values of the relative uncertainty at each grid gleam still has the smallest relative uncertainty with the mean value of 8 75 in the basin followed by mod16 29 46 and gldas 49 18 in addition the biggest difference brought by the nearest neighbor upscaling method is the decreased uncertainty of gleam in the southeast of the basin in general the impact brought by the upscaling method is not significant as fig 3 and fig 4 illustrated the difference of the relative uncertainties among the three et products in the southern and western part of the basin is larger where a large number of agricultural lands exist fig 1c the differences of the forcing data and the algorithms to generate the three et products are the other dominant reasons accounting for the different relative uncertainties related to land use in the agricultural lands the natural hydrological cycle is heavily impacted by human behavior like irrigation however the irrigation in these croplands tends to be neglected in mod16 and gldas the estimation algorithm of mod16 lacks the soil moisture as input while the soil moisture can effectively reflect the irrigation condition and for gldas the built in land surface model does not have the special module about the irrigation these reasons mentioned above lead to the high relative uncertainties of et for mod16 and gldas in croplands tang et al 2015 xu et al 2019 however for gleam its separate soil module which uses observed precipitation to drive the multi layer soil model and simultaneously assimilate the reliable satellite surface soil moisture data can reduce the uncertainties over croplands to a great degree martens et al 2017 besides for the other factors like harvesting and crop growth influencing the et estimates gleam has its own advantages the forcing variable in gleam such as remote sensing based vegetation optimal depth and vegetation fractions can well represent the vegetation growth and can estimate the crop water requirements huang et al 2019 however the lai input in mod16 tends to mismatch the crop growth thus resulting higher relative uncertainty in the cropland souza et al 2019 4 1 2 accuracy of multisource et with the cr et and wbet as benchmarks the evaluation of et products with cr et as the benchmark is conducted firstly at the basin scale and then at the grid scale during 2009 2017 the time series of the areal mean et of mod16 gleam gldas and cr et are illustrated in fig 5 the seasonal characteristic of et in this basin is obvious with high et in summer jja and low et in winter djf it is consistent with the climate condition in this basin which has high precipitation and temperature in summer providing good conditions for evapotranspiration lu et al 2019 as shown in fig 5 all three products can reproduce the seasonal pattern well along with the areal mean cr et overall they are strongly correlated to the cr et which indicates that the three et products can capture the temporal variability of the cr et furthermore as table 2 shows the correlation coefficients of gleam and mod16 are very high which are 0 98 and 0 97 respectively and the correlation coefficient of gldas is the lowest with 0 87 but still highly correlated to the cr et in general all the three products overestimate et when comparing with cr et the overestimation of gldas is more obvious especially in the summer from 2009 to 2013 with a bias of 54 06 among the three et products gleam performs the best with the least bias 28 52 and rmse 16 30 mm followed by mod16 which has a bias of 37 73 and a rmse of 21 77 mm the evaluation is then conducted at the grid scale fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the evaluation induces it shows that gleam has high correlation coefficients with cr et which are above 0 9 at all grids the correlation coefficients of mod16 at grids range from 0 74 to 0 95 however the range of that for gldas is 0 60 0 94 with the high values concentrate on the central and east parts of the basin similarly gleam outperforms the other two et products with the relatively lower bias and rmse for the three et products they all underestimate et in the northwest part of the basin and overestimate the et in the southeast part there are significant overestimates for gldas in the central and east grids with bias value around 100 to further evaluate three et products quantitatively the water balance method is also employed the regional et of the three et products are compared with the wbet at annual scale during the study period 2009 2018 the bias and rmse values of three et products are listed in table 3 table 3 shows that all three et products have overestimations compared with the wbet which is consistent with that in the comparison with cr et the result is consistent with the conclusions discovered in previous studies bai and liu 2018 yang et al 2017 which indicate that the overestimation tends to be more apparent in humid regions since the precipitation in humid areas is relatively abundant the soil keeps wet for a long time however in those relatively arid areas due to the long term water shortage in soil the precipitation is quickly absorbed by vegetation roots zhang et al 2019 resulting in relatively less precipitation into runoff as exhibited in table 3 gleam has the slightest overestimation with the lowest bias 13 85 followed by mod16 bias 20 90 and gldas bias 36 21 meanwhile gleam has the lowest rmse 114 23 mm followed by mod16 rmse 153 37 mm and gldas rmse 294 54 mm based on the results of the water balance method gleam shows the best performance in the xiang river basin in general there are varying degrees of overestimation of et for the three et products which primarily attribute to the various input data both gleam and gldas rely on the precipitation as the input to generate et however these precipitation products not always have the satisfactory performances in china as the precipitation input of gleam mswep tends to slightly overestimate the precipitation in china deng et al 2018 similarly ecmwf used as the forcing data in gldas is proved that overestimate the precipitation in china to a large extent especially in the south area of china liu et al 2021a in addition the assimilation with the reliable soil moisture data in gleam can further explain its better performance 4 2 application of multisource et products in streamflow simulation 4 2 1 performance of streamflow simulation based on different calibration strategies to investigate the utility of mod16 gleam and gldas in streamflow simulation aforementioned three strategies are applied to calibrate the swat model in the xiang river basin respectively fig 7 presents the daily simulated hydrograph results of strategy i which only using the streamflow observations for parameter calibration nse bias and kge are used to assess the performance of the simulated streamflow the nse in the calibration and validation period are 0 83 and 0 78 respectively and the kge values are 0 90 and 0 88 in the calibration and validation period respectively overall the simulated streamflow is close to the observed streamflow of which almost all peak flows can be captured well while in the calibration period the model tends to underestimate the streamflow with a bias of 4 63 which is mostly resulted from the underestimation of the low flows however contrary to that in the calibration period the bias in the validation is 6 09 which indicates the overestimation of the streamflow which may be due to the extreme simulated peak flows during 2016 as fig 7 illustrated most peaks are slightly underestimated in the calibration period however for the peak flows during 2016 there are continuous overestimations even the model generates a simulated peak flow with 19 280 mm3 s which is far more than the observation with 8869 mm3 s fig 8 displays the daily hydrographs simulated under strategy ii which using the mod16 gleam gldas for parameter calibration in streamflow simulation respectively overall the swat model calibrated based on strategy ii can produce satisfactory simulated streamflow the nse of the streamflow simulation in the calibration period for the three et products are similar which are 0 81 0 80 0 79 respectively meanwhile all kge of the streamflow simulation in the calibration period are 0 88 although the reductions of the nse and kge are relatively large in the validation period compared with that in the calibration period the performances of the streamflow simulation based on strategy ii are still acceptable among them mod16 slightly outperforms gleam and gldas the streamflow simulated using mod16 based on strategy ii has the highest nse and kge in the validation period which is 0 73 and 0 84 respectively followed by that using gleam nse 0 70 kge 0 82 and gldas nse 0 68 kge 0 81 furthermore streamflow simulation which is calibrated with mod16 has the least absolute bias in the calibration period bias 0 08 followed by that calibrated with gleam bias 1 05 and gldas bias 6 57 while the bias of the streamflow simulation in the validation period are 7 43 7 77 and 4 56 respectively the mismatch of the better streamflow simulation with the less accurate et estimates derived from mod16 can be attribute to the uncertainty brought by the selection of the pet calculation method in the swat model which is considered as an impact on the et simulation of swat thus further influencing the streamflow simulation odusanya et al 2019 mod16 may benefit from the penman monteith equation embedded in its algorithm which is consistent with pet calculation method used in the swat model meanwhile for gldas and gleam their performance in the streamflow simulation is almost consistent with their accuracy evaluation overall the strategy ii is able to simulate reliable streamflow in the xiang river basin it indicates that in the case of high quality precipitation data reliable et product is potential to replace the streamflow observations to calibrate the hydrological model parameters for streamflow simulation in this strategy the optimal parameter set is obtained when the objective function as eq 12 is the highest in this case the et simulation of the basin is overall optimal however it cannot reach the best at each subbasin so in the calibration process the spatial heterogeneity of et tends to weaken the advantage of gleam got from the above evaluation and finally contribute to the similar streamflow simulation with other two et products the hydrographs simulated based on strategy iii which incorporates streamflow observations and et for calibration parameter in streamflow simulation are illustrated in fig 9 the figure shows that the swat model calibrated with strategy iii also can generate reliable streamflow simulation the streamflow simulated using gleam based on strategy iii has the highest nse 0 82 and kge 0 90 in the calibration period followed by which using mod16 nse 0 79 kge 0 89 and gldas nse 0 79 kge 0 89 and the simulation results in the validation are consistent with that in the calibration the strategy iii using gleam can produce the simulated streamflow with the highest nse 0 79 and kge 0 88 followed by that using gldas nse 0 68 kge 0 81 and that using mod16 nse 0 66 kge 0 79 besides the bias of the simulated streamflow based on strategy iii using gleam are the lowest which is 2 3 in the calibration period and 4 60 in the validation period respectively overall when calibrated the hydrological model based on strategy iii gleam outperforms the other two et products especially in the validation period the scatter plots of the streamflow simulation based on different calibration strategies are shown as fig 10 it is indicated that all three strategies can generate streamflow relatively closed to the observations especially in the calibration fig 10 a c e additionally the points in fig 10 b d f are relatively more discrete also indicating the worse simulation performances of streamflow in the validation table 4 summaries the statistical indices of the streamflow simulation above in general strategy ii is alternative to get the satisfactory simulated streamflow when the streamflow observations are unavailable the performances of the simulated streamflow based on strategy ii are comparable with that based on strategy i the nse of the simulated streamflow based on strategy ii are all above 0 79 in the calibration which are comparable with that based on strategy i and the bias in the validation can be slightly reduced except for that using gldas compare to the nse values in the calibration they are relatively lower in the validation among all the cases the reduction of the nse for the strategy ii using gldas is the largest among the three et products decreasing from 0 79 to 0 68 although the performance of the simulated streamflow based on strategy ii is slightly worse it is still acceptable in the comparison between strategy ii and strategy iii the addition of the streamflow observations in the strategy iii not always improves the streamflow simulation for mod16 the streamflow simulation based on strategy iii is worse than that based on strategy ii with decreasing nse and increasing bias on the contrary for gleam strategy iii can improve the streamflow simulation especially in the validation period compared with strategy ii where the nse is increased from 0 70 to 0 79 however for gldas there is no difference in streamflow simulation between strategy ii and strategy iii furthermore the performance of kge is generally consistent with nse the influence of the tradeoff relationship between et and streamflow as well as the algorithm used in the multi variable calibration is the main reason herman et al 2020 it is hard to keep a balance in the multi variable calibration since the nse of the streamflow is just part of the objective function in the multi variable calibration when the change of the nse from the simulated et is large the effect of the nse of the simulated streamflow tends to be little meanwhile the relationship between the change of the nse from simulated et and streamflow is not always positive correlated in our study the nse of the simulated et based on gleam calibration changes less significantly than that based on mod16 and gldas calibration which indicates the optimal simulation is largely affected by the streamflow instead of the et when calibrated based on gleam resulting in its improvement of streamflow simulation according to the optimal parameters shown in table 4 the optimal parameters using gldas based on strategy ii and iii are the same the large fluctuation of gldas during 2009 and 2013 fig 4 is considered as the potential reason with the larger change of nse from the simulated et larger weight was assigned to the et variable in the multi variable calibration in this study which results in the same simulation with that calibrated with et the hydrographs in the validation based on the different calibration strategies are further compared according to the corresponding et product overall the simulated streamflows are almost consistent with the observations however according to fig 11 it is obvious that the calibration based on strategy ii and iii are deficient in accurately simulating the peak flows they always tend to underestimate the peak flows to some extent comparing with that calibrated based on strategy i it is possible due to the overestimations of the three et products for gldas it is more likely to underestimate the peak flows because it has the largest overestimation as illustrated as fig 12a when calibrated based on strategy ii mod16 behaves slightly better than the other two et products in peak flow simulations nevertheless fig 12b shows that strategy iii using gleam can produce streamflow closer to the observations which indicates the good incorporation of streamflow and gleam in strategy iii comparing the hydrograph simulated based on all three strategies the other remarkable finding is that the addition of et in the calibration has the ability to lower the unreasonable flow peaks simulated based on strategy i during may and june 2016 fig 11 based on the optimal parameters in table 5 this phenomenon seems can be attributed to the big difference between the parameter surlag of strategy ii and iii compared with that of strategy i the lower value of surlag means needing less time to transport the runoff from the subbasin to the main channel neitsch et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 and in the case of the continuous precipitation for several days during may and june 2006 the high value of surlag in strategy i makes it more possible for the model to generate the extreme high streamflow 4 2 2 the value of the spatial information provided by et products on streamflow simulation on the basis of the above finding that all three et products in this study are alternative variables in the parameter calibration for streamflow simulation the role of their spatial distribution characteristics in the streamflow simulation is explored to achieve this goal the individual calibration of each subbasin differing from strategy ii is conducted which means each subbasin has its respective optimal parameter set via calibration the simulated hydrograph calibrated in each subbasin with three et products are presented as fig 13 for mod16 the nse and kge of the simulated streamflow are 0 71 and 0 81 in the calibration respectively while 0 67 and 0 80 in the validation respectively for gleam the nse of the simulated streamflow in the calibration and validation are 0 70 and 0 71 respectively the kge in the calibration and validation also reach to 0 81 and 0 82 respectively for gldas the nse is 0 66 and 0 69 in the calibration and validation respectively similar kge is obtained which is 0 78 in the calibration and 0 81 in the validation the values of bias are 5 32 5 58 8 56 in the calibration for mod16 gleam gldas while 6 69 6 66 4 20 in the validation generally in the case that using the three et products on parameter calibration at subbasin level the model tends to produce the streamflow with almost the same high nse and kge in the calibration and validation this phenomenon shows the stability of the model simulation performance it indicates the parameter sets obtained from the individual calibrations with the et targeting at each subbasin can better restore the real various conditions of each subbasin thus generating the stable and satisfactory streamflow simulation performance in the validation although the streamflow simulation performances in the calibration are worse than that of strategy ii using the corresponding et product they are comparable in the validation it implies that the spatial distribution of et products makes great contributions for the stable streamflow simulation in the validation the remote sensing based et products provides the great potential on the accurate simulation of the streamflow on those ungagged basins the application of the et calibration in the distributed hydrological model also deserves more investigation meanwhile to improve the streamflow simulation performance it puts forward higher requirements on the accuracy of the remote sensing based et products in the future 5 conclusions this study attempts to evaluate multisource et products namely mod16 gleam and gldas in the xiang river basin and further investigate the applicability of the three et products in swat model calibration for streamflow simulation firstly tch method is employed to quantify the relative uncertainties of the three et products then cr et and wbet are used as benchmarks to assess the three et products after that three calibration strategies incorporating different variables are utilized to calibrate the swat model respectively the calibration with et at the subbasin level is finally conducted to explore the value of the spatial information provided by the et products the main conclusions are as following 1 based on the tch method the gleam has the lowest relative uncertainties in the xiang river basin followed by mod16 and gldas 2 gleam performs the best in the comparison with cr et and wbet followed by mod16 and gldas all three et products overestimate et and gldas has the largest overestimation with a bias of 54 06 comparing with cr et at the basin scale and a bias of 36 21 comparing with wbet followed by mod16 and gleam 3 the et can be used as an alternative variable on parameter calibration for streamflow simulation in the xiang river basin the swat model calibrated with the three et products has comparable performance on streamflow simulation with that calibrated only using streamflow among them the calibration based on strategy ii incorporating mod16 has the best performance for streamflow simulation with a nse of 0 73 in the validation and a bias 7 43 but more satisfactory in the peak flow simulation according to the hydrographs however the calibration based on strategy iii incorporating gleam performs the best in simulating streamflow 4 the remote sensing et products can provide more spatial information for the parameter calibration which results in a more stable streamflow simulation and the hydrological model calibrated with et products at the subbasin level has robust performance in calibration and validation periods which can generate the simulated streamflow with almost equally high nse and kge in

7976,study region xiang river basin southern china study focus multisource et products namely mod16 gleam and gldas are evaluated for their accuracy furthermore to investigate the applicability of multisource et products in streamflow simulation the swat model is calibrated with three strategies calibration using streamflow observations strategy i calibration using multisource et strategy ii and calibration by incorporating them strategy iii moreover the impact of using multisource et products at subbasin level on streamflow simulation is also investigated new hydrological insights for the region gleam tends to have the least relative uncertainty in the basin and perform the best in the comparison with cr et and water balance derived et as benchmark overall multisource et products are alternative variables for streamflow simulation in this basin the nse of the simulated streamflow can reach 0 73 0 70 0 68 in the validation period based on calibration strategy ii with mod16 gleam and gldas respectively which are slightly poorer than that based on strategy i but still good and the collocation of streamflow observations and gleam performs relatively better in strategy iii according to the three selected evaluation indices nse bias and kge it should be noted that when taking the spatial information of et products into parameter calibration the differences of the streamflow simulation performances in the calibration and validation periods can be effectively reduced indicating its robust performance keywords evapotranspiration mod16 gleam gldas multi variable

streamflow is a rather important role among all components of the water cycle for it can be a domain water source for agriculture industry and human being whiles it can also result in a natural disaster to risk human life and property therefore accurate streamflow monitoring and simulation is vital for water resources and natural hazards management although there is a considerable amount of hydrological stations over the world the ground hydrological stations are still deficient in many regions to provide information for streamflow conditions primarily in developing countries fekete et al 2012 fortunately many physically based hydrological models are developed to simulate and predict streamflow for water resources management physically based hydrological models contain abundant parameters that describe the condition of the model domains however some parameters in hydrological models cannot be decided easily due to the complex actual environmental system therefore parameter calibration becomes a necessary step in hydrological modeling typically streamflow observations at the outlet are utilized for parameter calibration and evaluation in hydrological modeling because they can be measured more easily and accurately compared to other hydrological components wanders et al 2014 unfortunately high quality and large quantity streamflow observations are not always available which is the main limitation for hydrological modeling abbaspour et al 2019 lópez lópez et al 2017 wagener and montanari 2011 furthermore the single variable calibration generally only using streamflow observations often induces the remarkable streamflow simulation but poor simulation for other hydrological components which implies the great uncertainty and poor performance of the hydrological models mcmillan et al 2010 minville et al 2014 in order to address these issues using alternative variable to calibrate the parameters of hydrological models has been adopted as an option especially in ungauged and data poor regions meyer oliveira et al 2021 rajib et al 2016 evapotranspiration et is a promising alternative variable for parameter calibration in hydrological models for it is not only the second largest variable in the hydrological cycle but also is considered as an important role in the carbon cycle and energy cycle carter and liang 2019 fisher et al 2017 ma et al 2021 2019b zhang et al 2020 while due to the high cost and complex terrain environment the accurate measurement of et also remains lacking fortunately remote sensing technology has made a great contribution to improving the et estimates in the past decades martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 mu et al 2007 various regional or global et products have emerged and been applied in hydrological model calibration in case that streamflow observations are not available becker et al 2019 dembélé et al 2020 gui et al 2019 odusanya et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 some studies have proved that the hydrological model calibrated against et is potential to generate reasonable streamflow among them odusanya et al 2019 revealed that the water components including the outflow at the outlet simulated by the soil and water assessment tool swat using et calibration can capture the seasonal characteristic zhang et al 2020 conducted two lumped conceptual hydrological models with et calibration in 222 catchments across australia and monthly streamflow and mean annual streamflow were successfully simulated particularly in wetter catchments additionally huang et al 2020 incorporated the pml aet a global evapotranspiration product based on improved penman monteith leuning model and water storage data into hydrological model calibration in the 30 catchments within the yalong river basin successfully improving the streamflow simulation performance compared with which using traditional regionalization method furthermore whether incorporating streamflow observations with et can improve streamflow simulation attracts much attention with the booming of remote sensing based et datasets some studies have investigated the effect of multi variable calibration that incorporating remote sensing based et with other variable to improve the streamflow simulation with lumped semi distributed and fully distributed hydrological models kunnath poovakka et al 2016 pan et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 rientjes et al 2013 for instance among them herman et al 2018 utilized multi variable techniques incorporating streamflow with two different et datasets based on operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model and the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model for parameter calibration and it showed that the multi variable calibration was able to improve the et simulation on the condition of maintaining its performance on streamflow simulation pan et al 2018 found that the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm which is calibrated with streamflow and et dataset tended to provide more reasonable simulation for both streamflow and et but there are also some studies indicating that incorporating streamflow and et for hydrological model calibration results in poor performance of streamflow simulations parajuli et al 2017 rajib et al 2018 willem vervoort et al 2014 for instance parajuli et al 2017 calibrated the soil and water assessment tool swat model with streamflow observations and mod16 and it got a slightly poorer model performance of streamflow simulation compared with that calibrated with only streamflow observations therefore it is meaningful to investigate the effect of et in parameter calibration for streamflow simulation with different calibration strategies using as the alternative variable or being incorporated in multi variable calibration selecting a suitable remote sensing based et for a particular study area is also a great challenge for one key factor influencing the performance of streamflow simulation in multi variable calibration is the selection of the et dataset for instance herman et al 2020 tried to integrate streamflow with eight different remote sensing et products and an ensemble et product respectively in parameter calibration for swat and finally got different performances of streamflow simulation due to the variety of the structures and input datasets of the et estimation models et products tend to have different characteristics even in the same region which leads to their different performances in parameter calibration for hydrological simulation until now the studies integrating remote sensing based et products in parameter calibration for hydrological modeling over regions in china are still deficient the et estimates based on moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis global terrestrial evapotranspiration algorithm hereafter referred to as mod16 global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam and global land data assimilation system gldas are three representative et products which have been widely assessed for their accuracy using the eddy flux tower observations in many different regions over the world bai and liu 2018 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011 there are also many studies evaluating the accuracy of these three et products in china to be specific mod16 has been evaluated via the ground based eddy covariance ec measurements collocated from the seven sites in north and northwest china and gleam and gldas also have been evaluated via the eight sites from the chinese flux observation and research network chinaflux sun et al 2021 tang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 the evaluation results show that all of them are able to reproduce the spatial and the temporal patterns of the et in china but tend to underestimate or overestimate the observations at a varying degree in different sites mainly related to the different land use and some studies have applied mod16 and gleam as the calibration et datasets for hydrological models in some regions other than china and they achieved satisfactory performance on streamflow simulation at monthly scale odusanya et al 2019 sirisena et al 2020 tobin and bennett 2017 these studies proved that mod16 and gleam are alternative in parameter calibration in some regions however the capability of gldas in parameter calibration for hydrological modeling still remains to be investigated furthermore most previous studies investigating the role of remote sensing based et in hydrological model calibration were conducted in watersheds with an area of less than 10 000 km2 jiang et al 2020 and as mentioned above the studies integrating et products in hydrological model calibration in china are limited therefore it is one of the main aims in this study based on some previous studies e g zhang et al 2020 the et calibration plays a more significant role in wet regions for streamflow simulation the xiang river basin a humid region located in the middle part of the yangtze river basin is selected as the study area to investigate the applicability of et calibration for hydrological model in various topography and land use condition considering their potential impacts on the estimates of the et products in addition compare to et from flux observations the most prominent advantage of remote sensing based et products is that they can provide more detailed spatial features the impact of these spatial information brought by the et products on the streamflow simulation are worth exploring the overall objectives of this study are as follows 1 to quantify the relative uncertainties of the three selected remote sensing based et products and further evaluate them with the et from terrestrial evapotranspiration dataset across china hereafter referred to as cr et and water balance method as benchmarks 2 to investigate the role of remote sensing based et products in hydrological model calibration with three calibration strategies which are calibration using streamflow observations et estimates from mod16 gleam and gldas respectively and incorporating the two variables 3 to explore the value of the spatial information provided by remote sensing based et products on streamflow simulation through calibrating the parameters with et at each subbasin the following context is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and datasets section 3 presents the methodology used in this study section 4 presents the results and discussion of this study and the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area xiang river basin is located in the south part of china bordered geographically by latitudes 110 e and 114 5 e and longitudes 24 5 e and 28 5 e fig 1a xiang river basin is known as one of primary basins of yangtze river basin with a drainage area of 82 375 km2 above xiangtan discharge station which is the outlet of the basin the central and northern regions are relatively flat with lower elevation compare to the southern regions where is distributed with mountains and hills the study area is mainly affected by the east asian monsoon climate so it has obvious seasonal meteorological characteristics the annual precipitation 2009 2018 obtained from in situ observations in this basin ranges from 1077 to 1863 mm and the precipitation is unevenly distributed which concentrates from april to jun fig 1b the precipitation also has a noticeable spatial pattern showing a decreasing trend from the northeast to the southwest in the xiang river basin zhu et al 2020 the annual pet from 2009 to 2018 based on fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 ranges from 1000 to 1210 mm and it is rather high during the summer fig 1b 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 evapotranspiration as mentioned above three et products namely mod16 gleam and gldas are used in this study table 1 presents a brief description of these datasets including their spatial and temporal resolutions mod16 is a satellite based global et dataset available from 2000 to the present with 500 m spatial resolution and the 8 day interval which can be obtained from nasa https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov it assumes et as the sum of evaporation from the water intercepted by the canopy transpiration from the dry canopy surface and evaporation from the moist soil surface and saturated soil surface mu et al 2011 the et is estimated using a penman monteith equation based algorithm which uses the daily reanalysis meteorological datasets from nasa s merra global modeling and assimilation office gmao and 8 day remote sensing vegetation property dynamics from modis products as inputs including land cover leaf area index lai fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar and albedo mu et al 2011 compare to the other two et products the spatial resolution of mod16 is the highest its accuracy has been proved globally and showed more reliable in lower altitude zones herman et al 2020 according to previous studies the correlation coefficients of mod16 with the in situ eddy covariance observations from north america can reach 0 86 and the mean absolute bias reach 0 31 mm day mu et al 2011 besides in comparison with the in situ eddy covariance observations in china the bias can reaches 0 2 mm 8d tang et al 2015 gleam can be accessed freely https www gleam eu and it is estimated with a set of algorithms targeting at the terrestrial evaporation and root zone soil moisture miralles et al 2011 this model is divided into four modules potential evaporation module rainfall interception module soil module and stress module then the et is computed as a function of the soil moisture stress and the priestley taylor equation based pet priestley and taylor 1972 gleam incorporates various reliable satellite observed geophysical variables as inputs containing radiation air temperature precipitation snow water equivalent vegetation optical depth surface soil moisture and vegetation fractions martens et al 2017 the gleam v3 3 is used in this study which is the lasted version released in 2019 compare to the last version the forcing datasets of gleam v3 3 are updated the gleam is available from 1980 to 2018 and its spatial and temporal resolution of this product is 0 25 and 1 day respectively the average correlation coefficients with in situ eddy covariance observations generally are higher than 0 7 in china and other regions which indicates the high accuracy of gleam li et al 2018 martens et al 2017 yang et al 2017 gldas https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas is developed jointly by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental prediction ncep it is generated by using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques to combine satellite based and ground based observation datasets for the goal of generating the optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 the et product selected in this study is gldas v2 2 which is the latest version released in february 2020 it assimilates the total terrestrial water anomaly data from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace into the catchment land surface model clsm li et al 2019 the spatial and temporal resolution of gldas is 0 25 and 1 day respectively and it is available from 2003 to 2020 considering the different temporal coverage of these three et products the time period from 2009 to 2018 is chosen to evaluate their accuracy and potential capability in parameter calibration for streamflow simulation the spatial distributions of the mean annual values of these three et products at their own spatial resolution are illustrated in fig 2 it shows that the mean annual et ranges in this study area are 485 1273 mm 712 959 mm 639 1148 mm for mod16 gleam and gldas respectively additionally in the southwest part of the basin compare to other two products gldas tends to have higher et estimations however gleam tends to have lower et estimations in the northeast part generally all three et estimations are increasing from northwest to southeast part of the basin but vary spatially 2 2 2 reference et product other meteorological variables and streamflow observations the cr et with the resolution of 0 1 and 1 month used as the reference et data for the

environmental and ecological science data center for west china national natural science foundation of china http westdc westgis ac cn 3 methodology as mentioned above mod16 gleam and gldas are evaluated before being applied in parameter calibration for hydrological simulation considering the absence of flux tower observations in this study three cornered hat tch method is firstly employed to quantify the relative uncertainties of these three et products in the xiang river basin for relative evaluation in addition the three et products are further assessed through comparing with the benchmark et from cr et and the water balance method then swat model is set up with datasets introduced above to investigate the applicability of et in swat calibration the calibration is realized under three strategies 1 calibration with streamflow only strategy i 2 calibration with et only strategy ii 3 calibration with both streamflow and et strategy iii furthermore the impact of the spatial information provided by the three et products on the streamflow simulation are explored through the calibration at subbasin level which differs from the above strategies 3 1 multisource et evaluation because of the inconsistency of the temporal resolutions of the three et estimates temporal downscaling is utilized for mod16 in this study in order to downscale mod16 from 8 day scale to daily scale to maintain the same temporal resolution with gleam and gldas jra 55 japanese 55 year is used as reference jra 55 is a global atmosphere reanalysis product containing the et estimates developed by the japan meteorological agency jma harada et al 2016 kobayashi et al 2015 it has achieved outstanding performance for drought monitoring in china chen et al 2019 the downscaling is conducted with the following equation 1 e t i μ e t t μ e t i j e t t j here m and j represent mod16 and jra 55 respectively t refers to the total 8 day et i refers to a particular day within that 8 day segment t 3 1 1 three cornered hat tch method the tch method is employed to quantify the uncertainties of the three et products without any prior knowledge of the true value of et tavella and premoli 1994 it has been applied to quantify the uncertainties of various remote sensing products over different regions in past studies liu et al 2021b long et al 2014 xu et al 2019 mod16 are preprocessed to the spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 through the inverse distance weighted interpolation method idw to keep consistent with gleam and gldas besides the nearest neighbor method is used to prevent the effect brought by the upscaling method similarly gleam and gldas are aggregated to 8 days to be consistent with the temporal resolution of mod16 the tch method is applied pixel by pixel in the study area to obtain the relative uncertainties of the three et products per pixel the details of the tch method are presented as follows 2 x i x t ε i i 1 2 n here x i 1 2 n is the time series of et extracted from each pixel in evaluated products here n 3 x t is the time series of the true value of et in each pixel ɛ i is the associated measurement error the difference between each series and the reference is taken as 3 y i n x i x r ε i ε n i 1 n 1 where y i n is an m n 1 matrix and m is the size of time samples x r is the reference data since the true value is unknown and the result of tch is insensitive to the selection of the reference data awange et al 2016 liu et al 2021c tavella and premoli 1994 here gleam is randomly selected as x r to obtain the error difference the covariance matrix of y i n and y j n is then computed by 4 s i j c o v y i n y j n i j 1 n 1 here the unknown n n covariance matrix of the individual noise q is introduced and is related to s as 5 s j q j t here j is n 1 n matrix represented as 6 j n 1 n 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 to resolve the target unknowns under the condition that the number of the unknown is larger than a number of equations the remaining free elements can be determined by defining the objective function f constrained by the function in kuhn tucker theorem galindo and palacio 1999 the objective function is as 7 f q 1 n q n n 1 k 2 i j n q i j 2 and its constraint function is as 8 h q 1 n q n n q s k 0 where q 1 n q n n are the elements of q and k det s n 1 the initial conditions for the iteration is set as 9 q i n 0 0 i n q n n 0 1 2 s s 1 1 s 1 1 1 t finally q is obtained when the objective function combined with eq 6 is minimized the square root of the ith diagonal elements of q q ii are considered to be the uncertainty of evaluated et the ratio of the uncertainty to the mean of the et value is the relative uncertainty the relative uncertainty is used to evaluate the performance of the three et products neglecting the influence of et magnitude 3 1 2 water balance method the annual et derived by the water balance method is also used as the benchmark to assess the et products at the basin scale velpuri et al 2013 the et derived with the water balance method is defined as 10 w b e t p r δ s where wbet is the et derived with water balance method p r and δ s are precipitation runoff and total water storage change respectively among which δ s is derived from the latest version of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace rl06 mascon solution released by the center for space research at the university of texas csr with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 1 month http www2 csr utexas edu grace considering the missing data of grace during 2017 7 2018 5 the evaluation with water balance method is conducted during 2009 2016 3 2 swat model set up and calibration the swat model is used to evaluate the applicability of et products in parameter calibration of hydrological simulation the swat model is a continuous semi distributed process based hydrological model which can simulate surface runoff sediment and nutrient loads in the catchment on a daily or sub daily time step abbaspour et al 2015 arnold et al 1998 the watershed delineation and the streamflow networks extraction are accomplished based on the dem based on the slope land use and the soil types the subbasin is further discretized into a number of hydrologic response units hrus which is the most basic computational unit for each hru water balance calculation is accomplished for hydrologic simulation swat estimates et based on pet which can be estimated from three methods according to the amount of available meteorological inputs in the model including the penman monteith method monteith 1965 the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 and the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 therefore considering the high accuracy of penman monteith method for pet estimation and the available meteorological data in this study penman monteith method is selected to simulate et in the swat set up period cai et al 2007 zhang et al 2018 the xiang river basin is delineated into 25 subbasins and 495 hrus the model is run at the daily time step the study period was divided into three period which are for warming up 2009 2010 calibration 2011 2014 and validation 2015 2018 respectively in this study the averaged et at the grids contained in each subbasin represents the et time series of each subbasin the model calibration and validation are accomplished with the help of the tool named swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup which is an auto calibration and uncertainty analysis module program based on the swat engine abbaspour 2015 sufi 2 sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm optimization algorithm in swat cup is employed here considering its advantage of easy calculation and short time spanning abbaspour et al 2004 before parameter calibration sensitive parameters have been selected through latin hypercube and one factor at a time sampling method in our previous study zhu et al 2016 a total of two iterations are run with 500 simulations in each strategy which means there are a total of 1000 simulations during the calibration the range of each parameter is narrowed down based on the suggested new parameters of the swat cup after the last iteration and their reasonable physical ranges the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is defined as the objective function in the calibration when there is more than one variable then the objective function is defined as 11 of i w i n s e i where w i and n s e i are the weight and the nse of ith variable 3 3 statistical analysis different statistical indices are used to quantitatively evaluate et products including pearson s correlation coefficient r bias and root mean square error rmse the other two indices namely nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge are employed to assess the performance of hydrological simulation 12 r i 1 n s i s 2 g i g 2 i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n g i g 2 13 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i g i 2 14 b i a s i 1 n s i g i i 1 n g i 100 15 n s e 1 t 1 t q o t q

discussion 4 1 evaluation of multisource et products 4 1 1 uncertainty analysis of multisource et products based on the tch method the uncertainties of the three et are quantified before the application for the parameter calibration in the hydrological simulation fig 3 shows the relative uncertainties of the three et products grid by grid in the xiang river basin it is obvious that gleam has the smallest relative uncertainty among the three et products the mean relative uncertainty of gleam is 11 52 and the lower relative uncertainty concentrate on the central area of the basin which indicates that gleam is the closest to those of the other two et estimates on average and shows more reliability however for both mod16 and gldas they all tend to have relative higher uncertainty at all grids in this basin with the mean relative uncertainty of 33 47 and 42 56 meanwhile to avoid the potential influence of using different upscaling method to process the mod16 the uncertainty quantification is also conducted with the et from mod16 which is preprocessed with nearest neighbor method as fig 4 shows the results of the relative uncertainty are overall similar with fig 3 but for the specific values of the relative uncertainty at each grid gleam still has the smallest relative uncertainty with the mean value of 8 75 in the basin followed by mod16 29 46 and gldas 49 18 in addition the biggest difference brought by the nearest neighbor upscaling method is the decreased uncertainty of gleam in the southeast of the basin in general the impact brought by the upscaling method is not significant as fig 3 and fig 4 illustrated the difference of the relative uncertainties among the three et products in the southern and western part of the basin is larger where a large number of agricultural lands exist fig 1c the differences of the forcing data and the algorithms to generate the three et products are the other dominant reasons accounting for the different relative uncertainties related to land use in the agricultural lands the natural hydrological cycle is heavily impacted by human behavior like irrigation however the irrigation in these croplands tends to be neglected in mod16 and gldas the estimation algorithm of mod16 lacks the soil moisture as input while the soil moisture can effectively reflect the irrigation condition and for gldas the built in land surface model does not have the special module about the irrigation these reasons mentioned above lead to the high relative uncertainties of et for mod16 and gldas in croplands tang et al 2015 xu et al 2019 however for gleam its separate soil module which uses observed precipitation to drive the multi layer soil model and simultaneously assimilate the reliable satellite surface soil moisture data can reduce the uncertainties over croplands to a great degree martens et al 2017 besides for the other factors like harvesting and crop growth influencing the et estimates gleam has its own advantages the forcing variable in gleam such as remote sensing based vegetation optimal depth and vegetation fractions can well represent the vegetation growth and can estimate the crop water requirements huang et al 2019 however the lai input in mod16 tends to mismatch the crop growth thus resulting higher relative uncertainty in the cropland souza et al 2019 4 1 2 accuracy of multisource et with the cr et and wbet as benchmarks the evaluation of et products with cr et as the benchmark is conducted firstly at the basin scale and then at the grid scale during 2009 2017 the time series of the areal mean et of mod16 gleam gldas and cr et are illustrated in fig 5 the seasonal characteristic of et in this basin is obvious with high et in summer jja and low et in winter djf it is consistent with the climate condition in this basin which has high precipitation and temperature in summer providing good conditions for evapotranspiration lu et al 2019 as shown in fig 5 all three products can reproduce the seasonal pattern well along with the areal mean cr et overall they are strongly correlated to the cr et which indicates that the three et products can capture the temporal variability of the cr et furthermore as table 2 shows the correlation coefficients of gleam and mod16 are very high which are 0 98 and 0 97 respectively and the correlation coefficient of gldas is the lowest with 0 87 but still highly correlated to the cr et in general all the three products overestimate et when comparing with cr et the overestimation of gldas is more obvious especially in the summer from 2009 to 2013 with a bias of 54 06 among the three et products gleam performs the best with the least bias 28 52 and rmse 16 30 mm followed by mod16 which has a bias of 37 73 and a rmse of 21 77 mm the evaluation is then conducted at the grid scale fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the evaluation induces it shows that gleam has high correlation coefficients with cr et which are above 0 9 at all grids the correlation coefficients of mod16 at grids range from 0 74 to 0 95 however the range of that for gldas is 0 60 0 94 with the high values concentrate on the central and east parts of the basin similarly gleam outperforms the other two et products with the relatively lower bias and rmse for the three et products they all underestimate et in the northwest part of the basin and overestimate the et in the southeast part there are significant overestimates for gldas in the central and east grids with bias value around 100 to further evaluate three et products quantitatively the water balance method is also employed the regional et of the three et products are compared with the wbet at annual scale during the study period 2009 2018 the bias and rmse values of three et products are listed in table 3 table 3 shows that all three et products have overestimations compared with the wbet which is consistent with that in the comparison with cr et the result is consistent with the conclusions discovered in previous studies bai and liu 2018 yang et al 2017 which indicate that the overestimation tends to be more apparent in humid regions since the precipitation in humid areas is relatively abundant the soil keeps wet for a long time however in those relatively arid areas due to the long term water shortage in soil the precipitation is quickly absorbed by vegetation roots zhang et al 2019 resulting in relatively less precipitation into runoff as exhibited in table 3 gleam has the slightest overestimation with the lowest bias 13 85 followed by mod16 bias 20 90 and gldas bias 36 21 meanwhile gleam has the lowest rmse 114 23 mm followed by mod16 rmse 153 37 mm and gldas rmse 294 54 mm based on the results of the water balance method gleam shows the best performance in the xiang river basin in general there are varying degrees of overestimation of et for the three et products which primarily attribute to the various input data both gleam and gldas rely on the precipitation as the input to generate et however these precipitation products not always have the satisfactory performances in china as the precipitation input of gleam mswep tends to slightly overestimate the precipitation in china deng et al 2018 similarly ecmwf used as the forcing data in gldas is proved that overestimate the precipitation in china to a large extent especially in the south area of china liu et al 2021a in addition the assimilation with the reliable soil moisture data in gleam can further explain its better performance 4 2 application of multisource et products in streamflow simulation 4 2 1 performance of streamflow simulation based on different calibration strategies to investigate the utility of mod16 gleam and gldas in streamflow simulation aforementioned three strategies are applied to calibrate the swat model in the xiang river basin respectively fig 7 presents the daily simulated hydrograph results of strategy i which only using the streamflow observations for parameter calibration nse bias and kge are used to assess the performance of the simulated streamflow the nse in the calibration and validation period are 0 83 and 0 78 respectively and the kge values are 0 90 and 0 88 in the calibration and validation period respectively overall the simulated streamflow is close to the observed streamflow of which almost all peak flows can be captured well while in the calibration period the model tends to underestimate the streamflow with a bias of 4 63 which is mostly resulted from the underestimation of the low flows however contrary to that in the calibration period the bias in the validation is 6 09 which indicates the overestimation of the streamflow which may be due to the extreme simulated peak flows during 2016 as fig 7 illustrated most peaks are slightly underestimated in the calibration period however for the peak flows during 2016 there are continuous overestimations even the model generates a simulated peak flow with 19 280 mm3 s which is far more than the observation with 8869 mm3 s fig 8 displays the daily hydrographs simulated under strategy ii which using the mod16 gleam gldas for parameter calibration in streamflow simulation respectively overall the swat model calibrated based on strategy ii can produce satisfactory simulated streamflow the nse of the streamflow simulation in the calibration period for the three et products are similar which are 0 81 0 80 0 79 respectively meanwhile all kge of the streamflow simulation in the calibration period are 0 88 although the reductions of the nse and kge are relatively large in the validation period compared with that in the calibration period the performances of the streamflow simulation based on strategy ii are still acceptable among them mod16 slightly outperforms gleam and gldas the streamflow simulated using mod16 based on strategy ii has the highest nse and kge in the validation period which is 0 73 and 0 84 respectively followed by that using gleam nse 0 70 kge 0 82 and gldas nse 0 68 kge 0 81 furthermore streamflow simulation which is calibrated with mod16 has the least absolute bias in the calibration period bias 0 08 followed by that calibrated with gleam bias 1 05 and gldas bias 6 57 while the bias of the streamflow simulation in the validation period are 7 43 7 77 and 4 56 respectively the mismatch of the better streamflow simulation with the less accurate et estimates derived from mod16 can be attribute to the uncertainty brought by the selection of the pet calculation method in the swat model which is considered as an impact on the et simulation of swat thus further influencing the streamflow simulation odusanya et al 2019 mod16 may benefit from the penman monteith equation embedded in its algorithm which is consistent with pet calculation method used in the swat model meanwhile for gldas and gleam their performance in the streamflow simulation is almost consistent with their accuracy evaluation overall the strategy ii is able to simulate reliable streamflow in the xiang river basin it indicates that in the case of high quality precipitation data reliable et product is potential to replace the streamflow observations to calibrate the hydrological model parameters for streamflow simulation in this strategy the optimal parameter set is obtained when the objective function as eq 12 is the highest in this case the et simulation of the basin is overall optimal however it cannot reach the best at each subbasin so in the calibration process the spatial heterogeneity of et tends to weaken the advantage of gleam got from the above evaluation and finally contribute to the similar streamflow simulation with other two et products the hydrographs simulated based on strategy iii which incorporates streamflow observations and et for calibration parameter in streamflow simulation are illustrated in fig 9 the figure shows that the swat model calibrated with strategy iii also can generate reliable streamflow simulation the streamflow simulated using gleam based on strategy iii has the highest nse 0 82 and kge 0 90 in the calibration period followed by which using mod16 nse 0 79 kge 0 89 and gldas nse 0 79 kge 0 89 and the simulation results in the validation are consistent with that in the calibration the strategy iii using gleam can produce the simulated streamflow with the highest nse 0 79 and kge 0 88 followed by that using gldas nse 0 68 kge 0 81 and that using mod16 nse 0 66 kge 0 79 besides the bias of the simulated streamflow based on strategy iii using gleam are the lowest which is 2 3 in the calibration period and 4 60 in the validation period respectively overall when calibrated the hydrological model based on strategy iii gleam outperforms the other two et products especially in the validation period the scatter plots of the streamflow simulation based on different calibration strategies are shown as fig 10 it is indicated that all three strategies can generate streamflow relatively closed to the observations especially in the calibration fig 10 a c e additionally the points in fig 10 b d f are relatively more discrete also indicating the worse simulation performances of streamflow in the validation table 4 summaries the statistical indices of the streamflow simulation above in general strategy ii is alternative to get the satisfactory simulated streamflow when the streamflow observations are unavailable the performances of the simulated streamflow based on strategy ii are comparable with that based on strategy i the nse of the simulated streamflow based on strategy ii are all above 0 79 in the calibration which are comparable with that based on strategy i and the bias in the validation can be slightly reduced except for that using gldas compare to the nse values in the calibration they are relatively lower in the validation among all the cases the reduction of the nse for the strategy ii using gldas is the largest among the three et products decreasing from 0 79 to 0 68 although the performance of the simulated streamflow based on strategy ii is slightly worse it is still acceptable in the comparison between strategy ii and strategy iii the addition of the streamflow observations in the strategy iii not always improves the streamflow simulation for mod16 the streamflow simulation based on strategy iii is worse than that based on strategy ii with decreasing nse and increasing bias on the contrary for gleam strategy iii can improve the streamflow simulation especially in the validation period compared with strategy ii where the nse is increased from 0 70 to 0 79 however for gldas there is no difference in streamflow simulation between strategy ii and strategy iii furthermore the performance of kge is generally consistent with nse the influence of the tradeoff relationship between et and streamflow as well as the algorithm used in the multi variable calibration is the main reason herman et al 2020 it is hard to keep a balance in the multi variable calibration since the nse of the streamflow is just part of the objective function in the multi variable calibration when the change of the nse from the simulated et is large the effect of the nse of the simulated streamflow tends to be little meanwhile the relationship between the change of the nse from simulated et and streamflow is not always positive correlated in our study the nse of the simulated et based on gleam calibration changes less significantly than that based on mod16 and gldas calibration which indicates the optimal simulation is largely affected by the streamflow instead of the et when calibrated based on gleam resulting in its improvement of streamflow simulation according to the optimal parameters shown in table 4 the optimal parameters using gldas based on strategy ii and iii are the same the large fluctuation of gldas during 2009 and 2013 fig 4 is considered as the potential reason with the larger change of nse from the simulated et larger weight was assigned to the et variable in the multi variable calibration in this study which results in the same simulation with that calibrated with et the hydrographs in the validation based on the different calibration strategies are further compared according to the corresponding et product overall the simulated streamflows are almost consistent with the observations however according to fig 11 it is obvious that the calibration based on strategy ii and iii are deficient in accurately simulating the peak flows they always tend to underestimate the peak flows to some extent comparing with that calibrated based on strategy i it is possible due to the overestimations of the three et products for gldas it is more likely to underestimate the peak flows because it has the largest overestimation as illustrated as fig 12a when calibrated based on strategy ii mod16 behaves slightly better than the other two et products in peak flow simulations nevertheless fig 12b shows that strategy iii using gleam can produce streamflow closer to the observations which indicates the good incorporation of streamflow and gleam in strategy iii comparing the hydrograph simulated based on all three strategies the other remarkable finding is that the addition of et in the calibration has the ability to lower the unreasonable flow peaks simulated based on strategy i during may and june 2016 fig 11 based on the optimal parameters in table 5 this phenomenon seems can be attributed to the big difference between the parameter surlag of strategy ii and iii compared with that of strategy i the lower value of surlag means needing less time to transport the runoff from the subbasin to the main channel neitsch et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 and in the case of the continuous precipitation for several days during may and june 2006 the high value of surlag in strategy i makes it more possible for the model to generate the extreme high streamflow 4 2 2 the value of the spatial information provided by et products on streamflow simulation on the basis of the above finding that all three et products in this study are alternative variables in the parameter calibration for streamflow simulation the role of their spatial distribution characteristics in the streamflow simulation is explored to achieve this goal the individual calibration of each subbasin differing from strategy ii is conducted which means each subbasin has its respective optimal parameter set via calibration the simulated hydrograph calibrated in each subbasin with three et products are presented as fig 13 for mod16 the nse and kge of the simulated streamflow are 0 71 and 0 81 in the calibration respectively while 0 67 and 0 80 in the validation respectively for gleam the nse of the simulated streamflow in the calibration and validation are 0 70 and 0 71 respectively the kge in the calibration and validation also reach to 0 81 and 0 82 respectively for gldas the nse is 0 66 and 0 69 in the calibration and validation respectively similar kge is obtained which is 0 78 in the calibration and 0 81 in the validation the values of bias are 5 32 5 58 8 56 in the calibration for mod16 gleam gldas while 6 69 6 66 4 20 in the validation generally in the case that using the three et products on parameter calibration at subbasin level the model tends to produce the streamflow with almost the same high nse and kge in the calibration and validation this phenomenon shows the stability of the model simulation performance it indicates the parameter sets obtained from the individual calibrations with the et targeting at each subbasin can better restore the real various conditions of each subbasin thus generating the stable and satisfactory streamflow simulation performance in the validation although the streamflow simulation performances in the calibration are worse than that of strategy ii using the corresponding et product they are comparable in the validation it implies that the spatial distribution of et products makes great contributions for the stable streamflow simulation in the validation the remote sensing based et products provides the great potential on the accurate simulation of the streamflow on those ungagged basins the application of the et calibration in the distributed hydrological model also deserves more investigation meanwhile to improve the streamflow simulation performance it puts forward higher requirements on the accuracy of the remote sensing based et products in the future 5 conclusions this study attempts to evaluate multisource et products namely mod16 gleam and gldas in the xiang river basin and further investigate the applicability of the three et products in swat model calibration for streamflow simulation firstly tch method is employed to quantify the relative uncertainties of the three et products then cr et and wbet are used as benchmarks to assess the three et products after that three calibration strategies incorporating different variables are utilized to calibrate the swat model respectively the calibration with et at the subbasin level is finally conducted to explore the value of the spatial information provided by the et products the main conclusions are as following 1 based on the tch method the gleam has the lowest relative uncertainties in the xiang river basin followed by mod16 and gldas 2 gleam performs the best in the comparison with cr et and wbet followed by mod16 and gldas all three et products overestimate et and gldas has the largest overestimation with a bias of 54 06 comparing with cr et at the basin scale and a bias of 36 21 comparing with wbet followed by mod16 and gleam 3 the et can be used as an alternative variable on parameter calibration for streamflow simulation in the xiang river basin the swat model calibrated with the three et products has comparable performance on streamflow simulation with that calibrated only using streamflow among them the calibration based on strategy ii incorporating mod16 has the best performance for streamflow simulation with a nse of 0 73 in the validation and a bias 7 43 but more satisfactory in the peak flow simulation according to the hydrographs however the calibration based on strategy iii incorporating gleam performs the best in simulating streamflow 4 the remote sensing et products can provide more spatial information for the parameter calibration which results in a more stable streamflow simulation and the hydrological model calibrated with et products at the subbasin level has robust performance in calibration and validation periods which can generate the simulated streamflow with almost equally high nse and kge in

seasonal displacement due to the phase biases we adjust the phases of displacement time series from atml and hydl by referring to irc1 and irc2 respectively the average weighted root mean squares wrms reduction after phase adjustment is 12 14 higher than that before adjustment significantly improving the consistency between gps and mass loading measurements moreover quantitative estimates of the secular displacement trends induced by hydrological mass changes suggest that extensive exploitation of groundwater causes severe land subsidence especially in the east central plain keywords north china ssa ica driving sources phase biases groundwater 1 introduction north china nc consisting of beijing tianjin shanxi and hebei has played a crucial role in china for the aspect of politics economy and culture feng et al 2013 li et al 2021 however due to the natural and anthropogenic activities such as the tectonic motion and over exploitation of groundwater and coal mine tang et al 2013 nc is suffering from obvious land deformation and in turn hinders the socio economic sustainable development for example some disastrous land subsidence bowls formed in tianjin cangzhou and hengshui feng et al 2013 guo et al 2015 wang et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to monitor the surface displacement effectively and timely which can provide data basis for understanding the deformation mechanism and predicting disasters the global positioning system gps has become one of the most effective means of monitoring the earth s surface deformation hao et al 2016 milliner et al 2018 however gps vertical displacement is the sum of tectonic and non tectonic processes the former is generally featured with the secular trend while the latter with more seasonal variations induced by environmental mass redistribution van dam et al 1994 2007 heki et al 2001 liu et al 2017 and common mode error cme dong et al 2006 zhou et al 2020 accurate estimation of the seasonal displacements and correct identification of the corresponding driving sources are conducive to understanding the interactions between the solid earth deformation and outermost mass variations and to the investigations associated with plate motion since seasonal displacements will bias the velocity quantification if unaccounted for and impede the establishment of the coordinate frame blewitt and lavallée 2002 conventionally the amplitudes of seasonal signals are assumed constant and estimated by least squares fitting however constant amplitude violates the non uniform variations of the actual seasonal excitation sources khazraei and amiri simkooei 2019 moreover it is unable to discriminate the contributions of different mass loading sources therefore later some independent mass loading models have been developed to optimally identify and model such time variable seasonal displacement the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on gfo can quantitatively measure the large scale hydrological change and in turn estimate the elastic displacement caused by hydrological loading hydl using the grace model as long as the rheological property of earth is known kusche and schrama 2005 in addition the displacements due to atmospheric loading atml and non tide ocean loading ntol can also be derived from other independent loading models van dam et al 1994 dill and dobslaw 2013 in the nc region these loading models in conjunction with gps have been applied to investigate the evident seasonal vertical displacement and its driven sources liu et al 2014 2018 wang et al 2017 gong et al 2018 li et al 2020 therein liu et al 2014 and wang et al 2017 compared the gps derived displacements with those from grace models and verified the significant contribution of the hydl source to gps nevertheless they observed inconsistent annual phases of seasonal displacement derived from two geodetic techniques and attributed to different spatial resolutions and temporal sampling rates wang et al 2017 meanwhile when grace model based seasonal displacements are removed from the gps time series the weighted root mean squared wrms are reduced by less than 20 liu et al 2014 similar situations were also found by liu et al 2018 and yan et al 2019 through these investigations independent mass loading models have the potential to simulate gps seasonal displacement as well as identify the driving sources however the differences in displacements between loading models and gps should be reasonably addressed to achieve better coupling levels otherwise counterfeit information will be introduced to the gps time series recently some data driven approaches such as empirical orthogonal function eof xu 2016 principal component analysis pca shen et al 2014 karhunen loeve expansion kle dong et al 2006 multi channel singular spectrum analysis mssa zhou et al 2020 independent component analysis ica ming et al 2017 yan et al 2019 have received considerable attention in the gps time series analysis these statistical techniques have proved to be superior to the aforementioned methods since they can directly recover the time variable seasonal components that represent the mass loading displacements without prior knowledge from another perspective the heterogeneity between gps and other geodetic techniques is also avoided singular spectrum analysis ssa broomhead and king 1986 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 which is also a data driven approach that decomposes the original time series into a sum of several interpretable components based on the singular value decomposition svd more importantly neither a parametric model nor stationarity type conditions have to be assumed for the time series golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 these hence make ssa a model free method and enable ssa to have a wide application in gps time series analysis chen et al 2013 xu 2016 khazraei and amiri simkooei 2019 basic ssa is very useful to identify and separate the seasonal signals and noise for gps time series however if several mass loading components are mixed in such a way that their contributions are very similar these mass loading sources are hard to be discriminated by ssa alone golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 in other words ssa is powerless in the case where the components possess weak separability ica also known as a powerful blind source separation approach comon 1994 hyvärinen and oja 2000 guo et al 2014 liu et al 2020 li et al 2021 can provide a proper projection direction for those mixed components based on minimizing their mutual information or maximizing non gaussianity therefore ica is worthwhile to consider as a supplement for ssa to find proper rotations for the mixed components with weak separability for this reason we thus combine ssa and ica to develop an ensemble method to analyze gps time series which is henceforth abbreviated to ssa ica the main objectives of this paper include 1 to introduce the ssa ica method and extract the physical source signals from gps seasonal vertical time series 2 to determine the mass loading driving sources of seasonal displacement in nc 3 to quantitatively estimate the secular displacement trend caused by hydrological mass change 2 methodology and data 2 1 methodology 2 1 1 vertical displacement due to the changing mass loading the earth is not strictly a rigid body assuming that large scale mass transport and redistribution occurs in a thin layer on the earth s surface it will lead to the surface vertical displacement as well as the change of earth s gravity field meanwhile the love number can characterize the earth s viscoelasticity property and is used to compute the surface deformation under the mass loading therefore with the spherical harmonic coefficients for gravity field and loading love numbers the elastic vertical displacement induced by the changes of mass loading can be reasonably expressed as follows kusche and schrama 2005 van dam et al 2007 1 δ h θ λ r l 1 l max m 0 l p l m cos θ δ c l m cos m λ δ s l m sin m λ h l 1 k l where r is earth s mean radius p l m is the fully normalized legendre function at degree l and order m c lm and s lm are residual spherical harmonic coefficients after being removed mean gravity field θ and λ denote latitude and longitude of the displacement point h l and k l are the loading love numbers wang et al 2012 2 1 2 ssa and ssa ica broomhead and king 1986 introduced the ssa method to analyze univariate time series this method can be outlined in two complementary stages decomposition and reconstruction the thorough descriptions of the procedure can refer to the literature e g chen et al 2013 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 khazraei and amiri simkooei 2019 the ssa ica method determines the principal components pcs from the one dimensional time series using ssa and further separates the independent components ics with a unitary matrix of ica for a stationary time series x i i 1 2 n with missing data we map this time series into a sequence of lagged vectors with the window size l and then construct a k l k n l 1 trajectory matrix x as follows 2 x x 1 x 2 x l x 2 x 3 x l 1 x k x k 1 x n the window size l has better be proportional to the period of raw time series and less than n 2 however if one is just interested in total signals rather than the separability among the signal components the selection of l is not much important wang et al 2018 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 then the incomplete matrix x is decomposed as shen et al 2015 3 x k l p k l e l l t where p is the pc matrix and e contains the orthogonal eigenvectors of x both pcs and eigenvectors are sorted in descending order of eigenvalues shen et al 2014 2015 by which the first few pcs contain a large amount of variance thus the first r r l pcs explaining the maximum amount of variability presented in the observations are selected for further analysis then eq 3 is reformulated with the first r components as 4 x k l p k r e r l t the number r can be identified by some indexes such as the cumulative variance percentages of dominant pcs figueiredo et al 2011 f test shen et al 2014 and w correlation golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 nevertheless the derived pcs are uncorrelated but not mutually independent thus a unitary matrix w w 1 w 2 w r is introduced to further rotate the pc matrix to make its column vectors are as independent as possible eq 4 is extended as 5 x k l p k r w r r w r r t e r l t s k r a r l t where s pw and a ew represent the ic matrix and spatial mode matrix viz mixing matrix respectively forootan and kusche 2012 feng et al 2021 2022 once an appropriate w is given the ics can be uniquely determined here w is estimated by the joint approximate diagonalization of eigenmatrices jade forootan and kusche 2012 that shows good separability and robustness actually mathematically independent components are not guaranteed to be physically independent so the number of ics sometimes exceeds the number of physical sources yan et al 2019 under such circumstances the ics belonging to the same physical sources need to be artificially split into a group y by using correlation analysis therefore the original multi dimensional trajectory matrix x is the sum of all physically independent groups 6 x y 1 y 2 y m 7 y i j y i s j a j where y i denotes the ith group of physical sources and m is the number of groups finally the time series of independent reconstructed component irc for each group is calculated as 8 y i 1 i j 1 i y i j 1 j 1 i l 1 1 l j 1 l y i j 1 j l i k 1 n i 1 j i n l l y i j 1 j k 1 i n in fact the difference between ssa and ssa ica is that we introduce the unitary matrix w viz eq 5 into the decomposed pc to improve the independence of the components with weak separability we will show the impact of this special rotation in subsequent experiments moreover it should be pointed out that the cooperation between ssa and ica had been preliminarily considered and applied in the medical and economic fields see pietilä et al 2006 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 in our ssa ica method however we directly rotate the truncated pcs to obtain ics besides we adopt improved ssa shen et al 2015 to process the incomplete time series without interpolation which can improve the accuracy of solved pcs to some extent eventually the ssa ica algorithm for extracting independent physical source from the time series data is shown in fig 1 2 1 3 evaluation indices as a natural measure of independence the mutual information takes into account the whole dependence structure of the variable let u and v are two continuous random variables the mutual information between them can be computed as follows comon 1994 hyvärinen and oja 2000 9 ι u v u v p u v log p u v p u p v d u d v where p u v is the joint density of the two variables p u and p v are the marginal densities log denotes the natural logarithm from eq 9 the mutual information value is always non negative and will vanish if the two variables are completely independent pearson s correlation coefficient pr is used to quantitatively assess the degree of correlation between the two variables u and v which is defined as follows 10 p r i 1 n u i u v i v i 1 n u i u 2 i 1 n v i v 2 where u and v are the mean of two variables respectively n is the number of epochs j denotes the jth station we adopted the widely used index of wrms reduction to evaluate the consistency of seasonal displacement variation between gps and mass loading the reduction of wrms for a station is calculated as follows van dam et al 2007 fu and freymueller 2012 jiang et al 2013 11 w r m s r e d u c t i o n w r m s g w r m s g l w r m s g 100 where g and l represent seasonal displacement time

fig 2 a data spanning the period from january 2011 to november 2019 in nc were publicly downloaded from the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc http www cgps ac cn in the data preprocessing the gamit and globk version 10 4 herring et al 2010 software were used to derive loosely constrained daily solutions for satellite orbits and positions and to estimate daily coordinates and covariance and to transform the daily free network solutions into international terrestrial reference frame 2008 corrections for solid earth tide and pole tide effects were implemented and ocean tide was corrected using the ocean tide model fes2004 hao et al 2016 non geophysical offsets caused by metadata changes and equipment malfunctions were corrected according to the station log files ming et al 2017 geophysical offsets owing to coseismic and post seismic displacements earthquake records are available at http www csi ac cn were updated with the differences of the seven day s means before and after offsets wang et al 2017 the ice6g d model was adopted to remove the glacial isostatic adjustment gia effects for all gps stations a et al 2013 peltier et al 2018 interquartile range iqr statistic was used to detect and remove the outliers and all deleted outliers were tagged as missing data the percentages of missing data are shown in fig 2 b for 20 stations with a mean of 6 2 as shown in fig 2 c significant long term trends and seasonal variations exist in the time series of station sxkl 2 2 2 grace gfo model the hydrological signal is an integrated measure of all forms of water stored on and below the earth s surface feng et al 2013 tang et al 2013 which is derived in this paper from the monthly rl06 solutions of grace spanning january 2011 to june 2017 and gfo spanning june 2018 to november 2019 provided by the center for space research at the university of texas http icgem gfz potsdam de home the rl06 solutions were expressed in the form of spherical harmonic coefficients truncated to degree and order d o 96 degree one coefficients were added back with those from grace technical note 13 landerer 2019 the c20 coefficients of grace gfo and c30 coefficients of gfo were replaced with those from satellite laser ranging solutions grace technical note 14 loomis et al 2020 the p4m6 de correlation filtering chen et al 2009 and the gaussian smoothing with an averaging radius of 300 km wahr and molenaar 1998 were combined used to remove north south stripes and suppress high frequency noise the gia effects were removed via the ice6g d model peltier et al 2018 to keep comparability with gps in addition for the subsequent time series of vertical displacement and terrestrial water change solved by grace gfo the data gap is filled by an improved ssa method proposed by shen et al 2015 2 2 3 surface mass models the monthly grid data of the noah model 0 25 0 25 and daily grid data of the catchment model 0 25 0 25 from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets keywords gldas page 1 were adopted to obtain the soil moisture since the catchment model also contains terrestrial water we thus compared the vertical displacement derived from the catchment model with that from grace gfo model therein the time series derived from grace gfo is directly calculated by using eq 1 with the post processed data the grid data of the catchment model were firstly transformed to the spherical harmonic coefficients truncated to degree and order 96 after being implemented the de correlation and gaussian filtering these spherical harmonic coefficients were input to eq 1 to calculate the vertical displacement in each station meanwhile the daily catchment model derived vertical displacements were resampled to monthly time series the average vertical displacement time series of all stations from the two models are shown in fig 3 with a correlation coefficient of 0 66 the discrepancy is mainly because the terrestrial water constituents estimated by the catchment model are incomplete such as the deep groundwater variation is not considered dill and dobslaw 2013 therefore hydl only refers to the loading from the grace gfo model in the remainder of this paper the time series of elastic vertical displacements due to the atml and ntol produced by deutsches geoforschungszentrum http rz vm115 gfz potsdam de 8080 repository were used the two datasets were calculated through the patched green s function approach with non tidal atmospheric surface pressure data 3 hour resolution and non tidal ocean bottom pressure data 3 hour resolution respectively dill and dobslaw 2013 moreover both datasets were resampled to daily temporal resolution same as the gps time series the time series of average vertical displacements of all stations derived from three kinds of mass loadings are shown in fig 4 from which we can see significant seasonal variations but small long term trends atml displacements have the largest seasonal fluctuation with an annual amplitude of 4 04 mm while the ntol displacements are negligibly small compared to the two others 3 results the flowchart for determining the results of this section is briefly presented in fig 5 including the seasonal and secular displacements and the correspondent driving sources overall fig 5 consists of two major columns according to the goals to be achieved in the first column gps vertical time series and mass loading displacement time series including atml and hydl are separated into the trend and the seasonal terms the seasonal term of gps is analyzed via ssa and ssa ica respectively and the significant components are determined and used to reconstruct gps displacement signals then the seasonal terms of mass loading displacement time series are processed via ssa ica to extract the displacement signals at the bottom of the first columns correlation analysis is employed to identify the driving sources of gps seasonal displacement and the phases of mass loading displacements are adjusted to improve the consistency between the displacement signals from gps and mass loadings in the second column the mass changes of terrestrial water and soil moisture are used to estimate the groundwater mass change then the long term trends of the three hydrological loading displacements are determined further the internal relations of the long term trends between land subsidence uplift and hydrological mass change in nc are explored 3 1 decomposition for gps seasonal displacement with ssa and ssa ica the long term trends of 20 gps vertical displacement time series in nc were determined by using least squares fitting with the following function yan et al 2019 14 y t y 0 b t f 1 2 c f sin 2 π f t d f cos 2 π f t ε t where y 0 denotes an offset bias b is the trend f 1 2 c f sin 2 π f t d f cos 2 π f t denote the seasonal terms including annual f 1 and semi annual f 2 variations the amplitude is calculated as c f 2 d f 2 ε is the residual after the trends were removed the time series in nc reflect significant seasonal variations fig 6 from which the amplitudes of least squares fitted the annual and semi annual terms are 1 67 4 46 and 0 18 1 27 mm respectively we successfully decomposed each detrended gps vertical time series by the ssa and ssa ica methods respectively we conducted several tests and found that the choice of window length l in a certain range has little effect on our final result considering the computational efficiency l was eventually set to 30 taking station bjyq as an example with the f test at a 95 significance level the first six pcs contain about 89 of the total variance which can sufficiently represent required seasonal signals thus the first six pcs were retained for further resolving six ics that are ranked in descending order according to the contribution ratios defined by liu et al 2017 and milliner et al 2018 since the difference between ssa and ssa ica can be fully reflected by comparing the pc and ic we thus plot the first six pcs and ics in figs 7 and 8 respectively from fig 7 pc1 represents the annual variation pc2 and pc3 contain some intra annual cycles and the rest pcs pc4 pc6 are almost random contrastively from fig 8 the annual cycles are scattered over the first three ics among which ic1 is a clear annual signal but the amplitude is smaller than pc1 both ic2 and ic3 are composed primarily of annual and intra annual signals the rest ics do not possess strong periodic features but have many higher frequency peaks we calculated the mutual information between any pair of column vectors in the pc and ic matrixes respectively and showed the mean value for each station in fig 9 where the mean mutual information of ics are all significantly smaller than those of pcs in all stations hence the ssa ica method derived more independent components than the ssa method particularly all mutual information values of ic are quite close to zero indicating that the components decomposed by ssa ica are mutually independent to a large extent 3 2 determination and adjustment for the driving sources of gps seasonal displacement we respectively grouped the pcs and ics to derive reconstructed components rcs for ssa and independent reconstructed components ircs for ssa ica therein ic1 or pc1 was classified into irc1 or rc1 the abundant intra annual variations for both ic2 and ic3 are inferred to be induced by different types of hydrological mass loading variations however when we compared them with the displacements derived from groundwater soil moisture and surface water loadings there had no compelling correspondence therefore we classified ic2 and ic3 or pc2 and pc3 into irc2 or rc2 to characterize the whole hydl displacement the rest ics and pcs are not considered because of the poorly seasonal characteristics then we compared atml displacement with irc1 and rc1 fig 10 hydl displacement with irc2 and rc2 fig 11 both irc2 and rc2 were resampled as the monthly resolution to allow a direct comparison with hydl displacement respectively the ntol displacement was excluded because of its low amplitude and complex temporal function in nc which was too difficult to find the corresponding component in the gps time series liu et al 2017 yan et al 2019 it should be noted that both atml and hydl displacements were also denoised by ssa ica aforehand chen et al 2013 as shown in fig 10 the time series of irc1 are basically consistent with those of atml displacements while the time series of rc1 show a little larger amplitudes which are because of the mixed annual signals in pc1 contrastively in fig 11 obvious differences can be found for three kinds of time series the main discrepancies between hydl displacements and irc2 are reflected in phases rc2 however largely loses the variation characteristics of hydl displacements the prs between the mass loading displacements and rcs ircs are shown in fig 12 from fig 12 a and c both rc1 and irc1 are in good agreement with atml displacement with the average prs of 0 57 and 0 60 respectively moreover the distribution characteristics of prs between rc1 based and irc1 based are quite similar and the former is slightly less than the latter at most stations indicating that atml plays a leading role in the gps seasonal displacement from fig 12 b and d the average pr between hydl displacement with irc2 is 0 53 while that with rc2 is as low as 0 17 the reason is that the predominantly annual variations of atml and hydl displacement are mixed in rc1 and thus interestingly the average pr between hydl displacement with rc1 0 43 is greatly larger than that with rc2 consequently our ssa ica succeeds in extracting the mass loading source signals from gps seasonal vertical displacements while ssa fails to achieve it therefore the source signal separation ability of ssa ica outperforms ssa it should be noted that the prs at stations hecd and hecx marked with the green dotted box are distinctly lower than others possibly due to the impacts of local effects ming et al 2017 which require further analysis through the correlation analysis we confirm that the primary driving sources of gps seasonal displacement in nc are atml and hydl however the correlations are not very significant especially for hydl to identify the causes we computed the annual amplitude a and phase φ by using the least squares estimation with a sin ω t t 0 φ where t 0 refers to 2011 0 and ω is the annual angular frequency noting that here we only consider the ircs of ssa ica since ssa fails to separate mass loading sources as shown in fig 13 a the annual amplitudes of atml displacements agree well with those of irc1 but the annual phases are slightly different with the shift of several days from fig 13 b hydl displacements are quite consistent with irc2 in amplitudes while phases of irc2 are shifted to about 2 3 months later than those of hydl displacements besides the different temporal resolutions for gps and grace gfo wang et al 2017 another salient reason may be the different detection strategies of surface displacement the growth peak of winter wheat in nc is in may yang et al 2010 due to the high demand for water and low precipitation groundwater is intensively pumped for irrigation resulting in a rapid decline of terrestrial water storage at that time grace gfo can detect the terrestrial water changes accurately within temporal resolution allowed so displacement derived from grace gfo models will undoubtedly reach the peak when terrestrial water storage change achieves the largest however the earth s response to the mass redistribution on its surface behaves as a viscoelastic adjustment process fu and freymueller 2012 guo et al 2015 also declared that deformation will continue even though the water level change stops therefore gps observed displacement will be delayed for a period in fact phase differences have been already found in previous studies wang et al 2017 liu et al 2018 yan et al 2019 li et al 2020 which will undoubtedly hinder the in depth analysis for gps time series but without drawing enough attention therefore this study attempted to adjust the phases of atml and hydl seasonal displacements respectively by shifting the phase difference values between irc1 and atml displacement irc2 and hydl displacement the wrms reduction is used to evaluate the consistency of seasonal displacement variation between gps and mass loadings before and after phase adjustment as presented in fig 14 before adjustment all stations show positive wrms reductions with a mean of 52 74 which is slightly better than those from the previous researches wang et al 2017 li et al 2020 probably due to the differences in mass loading models research periods and gps processing strategies after adjustment the mean wrms reduction reaches 64 88 which is 12 14 higher than that before adjustment indicating that the consistency between adjusted mass loading displacement and gps is significantly improved which has the potential for guiding the construction of the mass loading model in the future however stations bjyq and sxyc present marginally lower wrms reductions after adjustment possibly because the phase differences between mass loading displacements and ircs are too small to distinguish at these two stations so we performed some misadjustments 3 3 long term displacement trend due to hydrological mass change surface displacement of hydl certainly results from the storage changes of various types of water bodies therefore we evaluated the hydrological mass changes at first among which the terrestrial water storage tws change was estimated based on grace gfo models with the well known formula proposed by wahr and molenaar 1998 and expressed with 0 25 0 25 grid in the form of equivalent water height ewh soil moisture sm change was determined as the mean output from noah and catchment models rodell et al 2004 surface water storage sws in nc was reported to be extremely limited due to the massive building of dams as was snow water equivalent sws which can be ignored in terrestrial based water resource analysis huang et al 2015 feng et al 2022 thus groundwater storage gws change was estimated by deducting sm from tws change feng et al 2013 in addition monthly precipitation data from the china metrological administration cma available at http data cma cn was collected to characterize the links between hydrological variables and precipitation the area weighted average time series of tws sm gws and precipitation are shown in fig 15 and the spatial distributions of the trends of gws and sm are displayed in the form of color background in fig 16 from fig 15 changeable rates can be observed in different sub periods therein tws and gws increase slowly from the initiation of 2011 to the second half year of 2013 then decrease rapidly until the first half year of 2016 after a brief rebound during the second half year of 2016 both decrease again in the remaining time such changes are closely related to the temporal change pattern of precipitation tws and gws change in the wake of the fluctuation of precipitation and the changes slightly lag behind precipitation because precipitation must experience a slowly ground penetration process to recharge groundwater for the whole study period tws and gws decreased with the rate of 12 99 0 90 and 10 00 0 90 mm yr respectively sm change is basically consistent with tws before 2017 but it becomes relatively stable thereafter which may be benefited from the replenishment of the south to north water diversion project zhang et al 2021 the sm change rate during the whole period is 3 00 0 90 mm yr however the spatial distribution of the trends indicates that the rates of sm are not negative everywhere with slightly increasing trends in northern nc fig 16 subsequently we calculated the vertical displacements time series induced by tws gws and sm loadings their secular trends were fitted and illustrated in fig 16 from fig 16 a the trends of gws displacements during the period from january 2011 to november 2019 for all stations are negative with the range of 0 28 0 03 mm yr and the mean of 0 17 mm yr indicating that the porous response cause land subsidence guo et al 2015 due to the groundwater depletion is more significant than viscoelastic response cause land uplift wang et al 2017 which is because the huge groundwater aquifer in nc is filled with porous gravel sand and silt guo et al 2015 the stations with larger trends are mainly located in the east central plain 0 24 mm yr ecp defined by huang et al 2015 and marked in fig 16 a by the yellow dotted box where the groundwater depletion occurs in the deep confined aquifers huang et al 2015 conversely those stations in other zones mainly exploiting groundwater from the shallow unconfined aquifers huang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 present a relatively small ground subsidence rate 0 12 mm yr the reasons on the one hand compared with the shallow unconfined aquifer the water level in the deep confined aquifer will decrease much more when an equivalent amount of groundwater is consumed and it is more difficult to replenishment due to the multi layer aquifer systems liu et al 2018 as a result land subsidence is generally easier to achieve when abstracting groundwater from the deep confined aquifer on the other hand the fine clays and silts in deep confined aquifer possess high compressibility which can trigger more acute land subsidence guo et al 2015 therefore not only the quantity of groundwater consumption but the hydrogeological environment is also a key factor for the development of land subsidence from fig 16 b the displacement directions caused by sm loading are inconsistent over the region stations in northern nc show negative trends with a range of 0 17 0 02 mm yr while others in southern nc show positive trends with a range of 0 01 0 14 mm yr it is not hard to find that sm displacement directions depend on the changes in sm storage when sm storage is consumed southern nc the surface loading decreases and will result in land uplift conversely increased sm loading northern nc will compress deeper strata and then lead to land subsidence guo et al 2015 wang et al 2017 for the tws displacements obvious negative trends can be seen with a range of 0 32 0 02 mm yr and a mean of 0 18 mm yr although the trends of tws displacements are partly affected by those of sm displacements such as the stations sxlf and sxxx gws displacements from the perspective of the overall average level are undoubtedly the largest contributor accordingly we can conclude that extensive extraction of groundwater from the confined and unconfined aquifers has caused extraordinary serious groundwater loss and consequently induced severe land subsidence 4 discussion 4 1 knotty issues for ssa ica the components respectively reconstructed by ic2 and ic3 are not matched well with the displacements from groundwater soil moisture and surface water loadings but when ic2 and ic3 are jointly reconstructed the irc2 a good correlation has presented between irc2 and hydl displacement hence what extent of the mathematical independence can reflect the independence of physical loading sources in the real world is still unclear yan et al 2019 under the situation that more physical source signals are mixed it is very important but difficult to classify the ics into independent physical source groups for ssa ica currently we identify the group simply relying on the correlation analysis between ic and mass loading model derived displacement which will undoubtedly cause some deviations and require further investigation 4 2 comparison of the extracted source signals by ssa ica and ica ica has been widely applied to extract various geophysical source signals forootan and kusche 2012 guo et al 2014 liu et al 2017 2020 ming et al 2017 feng et al 2021 2022 jiang et al 2021 li et al 2021 therefore we employed the modified ica method developed by feng et al 2021 to extract the modified reconstructed components mrcs noting that we used the jade algorithm instead of fastica to estimate the unitary matrix the correlations between ircs from ssa ica and mrcs from modified ica are shown in fig 17 where the average prs are 0 71 and 0 70 for the first and second components respectively although the two kinds of reconstructed components are close however what should be emphasized is that the ica and ssa ica are intrinsically different the former requires the dimension of original data must be more than the number of potential source signals and it resolves a common temporal pattern for all stations then the source signal for each station is derived by assigning a different weight to the common temporal pattern thereby the source signal is inevitably affected by all stations the temporal pattern decomposed by ssa ica is only constrained by a single station without interference from other stations therefore we can conclude that the ssa ica can not only effectively extract physical source signals from gps time series but also remove the dimension restriction of ica which can be a supplement to ica associated theories 4 3 tectonic interpretation for gps vertical velocity the vertical velocity of the gps time series is constrained by both tectonic and non tectonic effects for those who are committed to giving an accurate interpretation of the secular crust motion it is crucially important to obtain a purer linear rate of tectonic movement van dam et al 2007 we thus removed the trend of non tectonic loading displacement from that of the gps time series to estimate the velocity of tectonic displacement roughly fu and freymueller 2012 non tectonic loading here includes hydl equal to tws loading and atml though the trends of the latter are very small with a mean of 0 01 mm yr for all stations the trends of gps tectonic and non tectonic displacements are illustrated in fig 18 from which we can see that the tectonic movement is active at a high rate mainly because nc has experienced large scale crustal extension and lithosphere thinning since the mesozoic stations located in shanxi province and along the taihang yanshan mountains reflect significant crustal uplift possibly caused by intense orogenic activity and compression of the tibetan plateau on the ordos block in western nc wang et al 2017 in addition it needs to pay close attention to two special stations which are built on soft sediment liu et al 2018 and show serious subsidence viz tjbd and hecx with the trends of 0 14 and 31 13 mm yr respectively the cause for such subsidence is attributed to the over exploitation of groundwater during the past several decades effective stresses within the strata have been increased as the continuous drop of groundwater levels thus aquifer system has experienced a long term depressurization as a result several huge groundwater depression cones have been formed in tianjin and cangzhou the locations and sizes of depression cones can be found in guo et al 2015 bawden et al 2001 also demonstrated that localized subsidence by groundwater abstraction can be large relative to tectonic deformation 5 conclusions land deformation has caused huge impacts on socio economic stability and sustainable development in nc in this study seasonal driving source and long term trend of vertical displacement in nc over the period from january 2011 to november 2019 are investigated by combining gps daily time series grace gfo models and atmospheric loading product the unitary matrix of ica is introduced to ssa to construct the ssa ica method comparing the pcs of ssa and ics of ssa ica annual cycles are concentrated in the pc1 while scattered over the first three ics the mutual information value of the pc matrix is much larger than that of the ic matrix in each station indicating that the ics are more independent than the pcs after grouping the pcs and ics respectively we compare the mass loading displacements with the rcs and ircs the average prs between atml displacement with rc1 and irc1 are 0 57 and 0 60 respectively and those between hydl displacement with rc2 and irc2 are 0 17 and 0 53 demonstrating that ssa ica successfully extracts the real mass loading displacements while ssa cannot identify them which highlight the powerful signal separation ability of ssa ica also the results indicate that atml and hydl are the primary contributors to gps seasonal displacement in nc furthermore due to the phase biases we adjust the phases of atml and hydl displacements by irc1 and irc2 the average wrms reduction reaches 64 88 after adjustment which is 12 14 higher than that before adjustment suggesting that the consistency between mass loading displacement and gps is significantly improved these outcomes are conducive to calibrating the products related to surface mass loading however the amplitudes of vertical displacements caused by the non tidal ocean loading and thermal expansion effect of bedrock and observation pillar are both extremely low and their temporal functions are complex in nc hence the corresponding components are not extracted by ssa ica which requires further analysis quantitative estimation of the hydrological change shows that gws decreasing rate from january 2011 to november 2019 in nc is 10 00 mm yr consequently the land subsidence due to gws depletion with an average trend of 0 17 mm yr during the same period plays a dominant role in the non tectonic displacement trend the stations with larger subsidence rates are mainly located in ecp especially in tianjin and cangzhou indicating that groundwater abstraction from deep confined aquifer results in extremely serious land subsidence the governments thus should pay enough attention to improving the utilization efficiency of deep groundwater in addition the tectonic movements behave actively in nc due to the orogenic activity and the compression of the ordos block which induce obvious land uplift credit authorship contribution statement tengfei feng methodology validation formal analysis writing original draft yunzhong shen

7977,study region north china nc is an important social and economic center in china study focus nc is suffering from obvious land deformation the vertical time series of 20 global positioning system gps stations are explored to determine the seasonal driving sources and hydrological induced displacement trends together with the mass loading models a method named ssa ica is developed to extract the source signal using singular spectrum analysis ssa in conjunction with independent component analysis ica new hydrological insights the independence of extracted components by ssa ica is significantly stronger than that by ssa alone through the mutual information evaluation and the separation ability of source signals by ssa ica is greatly superior to ssa the good agreements between ssa ica derived independent reconstructed components ircs and mass loading displacements confirm that the atmospheric loading atml and hydrological loading hydl are the primary driving sources of gps seasonal displacement due to the phase biases we adjust the phases of displacement time series from atml and hydl by referring to irc1 and irc2 respectively the average weighted root mean squares wrms reduction after phase adjustment is 12 14 higher than that before adjustment significantly improving the consistency between gps and mass loading measurements moreover quantitative estimates of the secular displacement trends induced by hydrological mass changes suggest that extensive exploitation of groundwater causes severe land subsidence especially in the east central plain keywords north china ssa ica driving sources phase biases groundwater 1 introduction north china nc consisting of beijing tianjin shanxi and hebei has played a crucial role in china for the aspect of politics economy and culture feng et al 2013 li et al 2021 however due to the natural and anthropogenic activities such as the tectonic motion and over exploitation of groundwater and coal mine tang et al 2013 nc is suffering from obvious land deformation and in turn hinders the socio economic sustainable development for example some disastrous land subsidence bowls formed in tianjin cangzhou and hengshui feng et al 2013 guo et al 2015 wang et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to monitor the surface displacement effectively and timely which can provide data basis for understanding the deformation mechanism and predicting disasters the global positioning system gps has become one of the most effective means of monitoring the earth s surface deformation hao et al 2016 milliner et al 2018 however gps vertical displacement is the sum of tectonic and non tectonic processes the former is generally featured with the secular trend while the latter with more seasonal variations induced by environmental mass redistribution van dam et al 1994 2007 heki et al 2001 liu et al 2017 and common mode error cme dong et al 2006 zhou et al 2020 accurate estimation of the seasonal displacements and correct identification of the corresponding driving sources are conducive to understanding the interactions between the solid earth deformation and outermost mass variations and to the investigations associated with plate motion since seasonal displacements will bias the velocity quantification if unaccounted for and impede the establishment of the coordinate frame blewitt and lavallée 2002 conventionally the amplitudes of seasonal signals are assumed constant and estimated by least squares fitting however constant amplitude violates the non uniform variations of the actual seasonal excitation sources khazraei and amiri simkooei 2019 moreover it is unable to discriminate the contributions of different mass loading sources therefore later some independent mass loading models have been developed to optimally identify and model such time variable seasonal displacement the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on gfo can quantitatively measure the large scale hydrological change and in turn estimate the elastic displacement caused by hydrological loading hydl using the grace model as long as the rheological property of earth is known kusche and schrama 2005 in addition the displacements due to atmospheric loading atml and non tide ocean loading ntol can also be derived from other independent loading models van dam et al 1994 dill and dobslaw 2013 in the nc region these loading models in conjunction with gps have been applied to investigate the evident seasonal vertical displacement and its driven sources liu et al 2014 2018 wang et al 2017 gong et al 2018 li et al 2020 therein liu et al 2014 and wang et al 2017 compared the gps derived displacements with those from grace models and verified the significant contribution of the hydl source to gps nevertheless they observed inconsistent annual phases of seasonal displacement derived from two geodetic techniques and attributed to different spatial resolutions and temporal sampling rates wang et al 2017 meanwhile when grace model based seasonal displacements are removed from the gps time series the weighted root mean squared wrms are reduced by less than 20 liu et al 2014 similar situations were also found by liu et al 2018 and yan et al 2019 through these investigations independent mass loading models have the potential to simulate gps seasonal displacement as well as identify the driving sources however the differences in displacements between loading models and gps should be reasonably addressed to achieve better coupling levels otherwise counterfeit information will be introduced to the gps time series recently some data driven approaches such as empirical orthogonal function eof xu 2016 principal component analysis pca shen et al 2014 karhunen loeve expansion kle dong et al 2006 multi channel singular spectrum analysis mssa zhou et al 2020 independent component analysis ica ming et al 2017 yan et al 2019 have received considerable attention in the gps time series analysis these statistical techniques have proved to be superior to the aforementioned methods since they can directly recover the time variable seasonal components that represent the mass loading displacements without prior knowledge from another perspective the heterogeneity between gps and other geodetic techniques is also avoided singular spectrum analysis ssa broomhead and king 1986 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 which is also a data driven approach that decomposes the original time series into a sum of several interpretable components based on the singular value decomposition svd more importantly neither a parametric model nor stationarity type conditions have to be assumed for the time series golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 these hence make ssa a model free method and enable ssa to have a wide application in gps time series analysis chen et al 2013 xu 2016 khazraei and amiri simkooei 2019 basic ssa is very useful to identify and separate the seasonal signals and noise for gps time series however if several mass loading components are mixed in such a way that their contributions are very similar these mass loading sources are hard to be discriminated by ssa alone golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 in other words ssa is powerless in the case where the components possess weak separability ica also known as a powerful blind source separation approach comon 1994 hyvärinen and oja 2000 guo et al 2014 liu et al 2020 li et al 2021 can provide a proper projection direction for those mixed components based on minimizing their mutual information or maximizing non gaussianity therefore ica is worthwhile to consider as a supplement for ssa to find proper rotations for the mixed components with weak separability for this reason we thus combine ssa and ica to develop an ensemble method to analyze gps time series which is henceforth abbreviated to ssa ica the main objectives of this paper include 1 to introduce the ssa ica method and extract the physical source signals from gps seasonal vertical time series 2 to determine the mass loading driving sources of seasonal displacement in nc 3 to quantitatively estimate the secular displacement trend caused by hydrological mass change 2 methodology and data 2 1 methodology 2 1 1 vertical displacement due to the changing mass loading the earth is not strictly a rigid body assuming that large scale mass transport and redistribution occurs in a thin layer on the earth s surface it will lead to the surface vertical displacement as well as the change of earth s gravity field meanwhile the love number can characterize the earth s viscoelasticity property and is used to compute the surface deformation under the mass loading therefore with the spherical harmonic coefficients for gravity field and loading love numbers the elastic vertical displacement induced by the changes of mass loading can be reasonably expressed as follows kusche and schrama 2005 van dam et al 2007 1 δ h θ λ r l 1 l max m 0 l p l m cos θ δ c l m cos m λ δ s l m sin m λ h l 1 k l where r is earth s mean radius p l m is the fully normalized legendre function at degree l and order m c lm and s lm are residual spherical harmonic coefficients after being removed mean gravity field θ and λ denote latitude and longitude of the displacement point h l and k l are the loading love numbers wang et al 2012 2 1 2 ssa and ssa ica broomhead and king 1986 introduced the ssa method to analyze univariate time series this method can be outlined in two complementary stages decomposition and reconstruction the thorough descriptions of the procedure can refer to the literature e g chen et al 2013 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 khazraei and amiri simkooei 2019 the ssa ica method determines the principal components pcs from the one dimensional time series using ssa and further separates the independent components ics with a unitary matrix of ica for a stationary time series x i i 1 2 n with missing data we map this time series into a sequence of lagged vectors with the window size l and then construct a k l k n l 1 trajectory matrix x as follows 2 x x 1 x 2 x l x 2 x 3 x l 1 x k x k 1 x n the window size l has better be proportional to the period of raw time series and less than n 2 however if one is just interested in total signals rather than the separability among the signal components the selection of l is not much important wang et al 2018 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 then the incomplete matrix x is decomposed as shen et al 2015 3 x k l p k l e l l t where p is the pc matrix and e contains the orthogonal eigenvectors of x both pcs and eigenvectors are sorted in descending order of eigenvalues shen et al 2014 2015 by which the first few pcs contain a large amount of variance thus the first r r l pcs explaining the maximum amount of variability presented in the observations are selected for further analysis then eq 3 is reformulated with the first r components as 4 x k l p k r e r l t the number r can be identified by some indexes such as the cumulative variance percentages of dominant pcs figueiredo et al 2011 f test shen et al 2014 and w correlation golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 nevertheless the derived pcs are uncorrelated but not mutually independent thus a unitary matrix w w 1 w 2 w r is introduced to further rotate the pc matrix to make its column vectors are as independent as possible eq 4 is extended as 5 x k l p k r w r r w r r t e r l t s k r a r l t where s pw and a ew represent the ic matrix and spatial mode matrix viz mixing matrix respectively forootan and kusche 2012 feng et al 2021 2022 once an appropriate w is given the ics can be uniquely determined here w is estimated by the joint approximate diagonalization of eigenmatrices jade forootan and kusche 2012 that shows good separability and robustness actually mathematically independent components are not guaranteed to be physically independent so the number of ics sometimes exceeds the number of physical sources yan et al 2019 under such circumstances the ics belonging to the same physical sources need to be artificially split into a group y by using correlation analysis therefore the original multi dimensional trajectory matrix x is the sum of all physically independent groups 6 x y 1 y 2 y m 7 y i j y i s j a j where y i denotes the ith group of physical sources and m is the number of groups finally the time series of independent reconstructed component irc for each group is calculated as 8 y i 1 i j 1 i y i j 1 j 1 i l 1 1 l j 1 l y i j 1 j l i k 1 n i 1 j i n l l y i j 1 j k 1 i n in fact the difference between ssa and ssa ica is that we introduce the unitary matrix w viz eq 5 into the decomposed pc to improve the independence of the components with weak separability we will show the impact of this special rotation in subsequent experiments moreover it should be pointed out that the cooperation between ssa and ica had been preliminarily considered and applied in the medical and economic fields see pietilä et al 2006 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 in our ssa ica method however we directly rotate the truncated pcs to obtain ics besides we adopt improved ssa shen et al 2015 to process the incomplete time series without interpolation which can improve the accuracy of solved pcs to some extent eventually the ssa ica algorithm for extracting independent physical source from the time series data is shown in fig 1 2 1 3 evaluation indices as a natural measure of independence the mutual information takes into account the whole dependence structure of the variable let u and v are two continuous random variables the mutual information between them can be computed as follows comon 1994 hyvärinen and oja 2000 9 ι u v u v p u v log p u v p u p v d u d v where p u v is the joint density of the two variables p u and p v are the marginal densities log denotes the natural logarithm from eq 9 the mutual information value is always non negative and will vanish if the two variables are completely independent pearson s correlation coefficient pr is used to quantitatively assess the degree of correlation between the two variables u and v which is defined as follows 10 p r i 1 n u i u v i v i 1 n u i u 2 i 1 n v i v 2 where u and v are the mean of two variables respectively n is the number of epochs j denotes the jth station we adopted the widely used index of wrms reduction to evaluate the consistency of seasonal displacement variation between gps and mass loading the reduction of wrms for a station is calculated as follows van dam et al 2007 fu and freymueller 2012 jiang et al 2013 11 w r m s r e d u c t i o n w r m s g w r m s g l w r m s g 100 where g and l represent seasonal displacement time series of gps and mass loading respectively wrms g and wrms g l are calculated with 12 w r m s g i 1 n p i g i i 1 n p i g i i 1 n p i 2 i 1 n p i 13 w r m s g l i 1 n p i g i l i i 1 n p i g i l i i 1 n p i 2 i 1 n p i where n is the number of epochs p 1 σ 2 is the weight σ denotes the formal error 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 gps vertical displacement time series in total 20 gps permanent stations fig 2 a data spanning the period from january 2011 to november 2019 in nc were publicly downloaded from the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc http www cgps ac cn in the data preprocessing the gamit and globk version 10 4 herring et al 2010 software were used to derive loosely constrained daily solutions for satellite orbits and positions and to estimate daily coordinates and covariance and to transform the daily free network solutions into international terrestrial reference frame 2008 corrections for solid earth tide and pole tide effects were implemented and ocean tide was corrected using the ocean tide model fes2004 hao et al 2016 non geophysical offsets caused by metadata changes and equipment malfunctions were corrected according to the station log files ming et al 2017 geophysical offsets owing to coseismic and post seismic displacements earthquake records are available at http www csi ac cn were updated with the differences of the seven day s means before and after offsets wang et al 2017 the ice6g d model was adopted to remove the glacial isostatic adjustment gia effects for all gps stations a et al 2013 peltier et al 2018 interquartile range iqr statistic was used to detect and remove the outliers and all deleted outliers were tagged as missing data the percentages of missing data are shown in fig 2 b for 20 stations with a mean of 6 2 as shown in fig 2 c significant long term trends and seasonal variations exist in the time series of station sxkl 2 2 2 grace gfo model the hydrological signal is an integrated measure of all forms of water stored on and below the earth s surface feng et al 2013 tang et al 2013 which is derived in this paper from the monthly rl06 solutions of grace spanning january 2011 to june 2017 and gfo spanning june 2018 to november 2019 provided by the center for space research at the university of texas http icgem gfz potsdam de home the rl06 solutions were expressed in the form of spherical harmonic coefficients truncated to degree and order d o 96 degree one coefficients were added back with those from grace technical note 13 landerer 2019 the c20 coefficients of grace gfo and c30 coefficients of gfo were replaced with those from satellite laser ranging solutions grace technical note 14 loomis et al 2020 the p4m6 de correlation filtering chen et al 2009 and the gaussian smoothing with an averaging radius of 300 km wahr and molenaar 1998 were combined used to remove north south stripes and suppress high frequency noise the gia effects were removed via the ice6g d model peltier et al 2018 to keep comparability with gps in addition for the subsequent time series of vertical displacement and terrestrial water change solved by grace gfo the data gap is filled by an improved ssa method proposed by shen et al 2015 2 2 3 surface mass models the monthly grid data of the noah model 0 25 0 25 and daily grid data of the catchment model 0 25 0 25 from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets keywords gldas page 1 were adopted to obtain the soil moisture since the catchment model also contains terrestrial water we thus compared the vertical displacement derived from the catchment model with that from grace gfo model therein the time series derived from grace gfo is directly calculated by using eq 1 with the post processed data the grid data of the catchment model were firstly transformed to the spherical harmonic coefficients truncated to degree and order 96 after being implemented the de correlation and gaussian filtering these spherical harmonic coefficients were input to eq 1 to calculate the vertical displacement in each station meanwhile the daily catchment model derived vertical displacements were resampled to monthly time series the average vertical displacement time series of all stations from the two models are shown in fig 3 with a correlation coefficient of 0 66 the discrepancy is mainly because the terrestrial water constituents estimated by the catchment model are incomplete such as the deep groundwater variation is not considered dill and dobslaw 2013 therefore hydl only refers to the loading from the grace gfo model in the remainder of this paper the time series of elastic vertical displacements due to the atml and ntol produced by deutsches geoforschungszentrum http rz vm115 gfz potsdam de 8080 repository were used the two datasets were calculated through the patched green s function approach with non tidal atmospheric surface pressure data 3 hour resolution and non tidal ocean bottom pressure data 3 hour resolution respectively dill and dobslaw 2013 moreover both datasets were resampled to daily temporal resolution same as the gps time series the time series of average vertical displacements of all stations derived from three kinds of mass loadings are shown in fig 4 from which we can see significant seasonal variations but small long term trends atml displacements have the largest seasonal fluctuation with an annual amplitude of 4 04 mm while the ntol displacements are negligibly small compared to the two others 3 results the flowchart for determining the results of this section is briefly presented in fig 5 including the seasonal and secular displacements and the correspondent driving sources overall fig 5 consists of two major columns according to the goals to be achieved in the first column gps vertical time series and mass loading displacement time series including atml and hydl are separated into the trend and the seasonal terms the seasonal term of gps is analyzed via ssa and ssa ica respectively and the significant components are determined and used to reconstruct gps displacement signals then the seasonal terms of mass loading displacement time series are processed via ssa ica to extract the displacement signals at the bottom of the first columns correlation analysis is employed to identify the driving sources of gps seasonal displacement and the phases of mass loading displacements are adjusted to improve the consistency between the displacement signals from gps and mass loadings in the second column the mass changes of terrestrial water and soil moisture are used to estimate the groundwater mass change then the long term trends of the three hydrological loading displacements are determined further the internal relations of the long term trends between land subsidence uplift and hydrological mass change in nc are explored 3 1 decomposition for gps seasonal displacement with ssa and ssa ica the long term trends of 20 gps vertical displacement time series in nc were determined by using least squares fitting with the following function yan et al 2019 14 y t y 0 b t f 1 2 c f sin 2 π f t d f cos 2 π f t ε t where y 0 denotes an offset bias b is the trend f 1 2 c f sin 2 π f t d f cos 2 π f t denote the seasonal terms including annual f 1 and semi annual f 2 variations the amplitude is calculated as c f 2 d f 2 ε is the residual after the trends were removed the time series in nc reflect significant seasonal variations fig 6 from which the amplitudes of least squares fitted the annual and semi annual terms are 1 67 4 46 and 0 18 1 27 mm respectively we successfully decomposed each detrended gps vertical time series by the ssa and ssa ica methods respectively we conducted several tests and found that the choice of window length l in a certain range has little effect on our final result considering the computational efficiency l was eventually set to 30 taking station bjyq as an example with the f test at a 95 significance level the first six pcs contain about 89 of the total variance which can sufficiently represent required seasonal signals thus the first six pcs were retained for further resolving six ics that are ranked in descending order according to the contribution ratios defined by liu et al 2017 and milliner et al 2018 since the difference between ssa and ssa ica can be fully reflected by comparing the pc and ic we thus plot the first six pcs and ics in figs 7 and 8 respectively from fig 7 pc1 represents the annual variation pc2 and pc3 contain some intra annual cycles and the rest pcs pc4 pc6 are almost random contrastively from fig 8 the annual cycles are scattered over the first three ics among which ic1 is a clear annual signal but the amplitude is smaller than pc1 both ic2 and ic3 are composed primarily of annual and intra annual signals the rest ics do not possess strong periodic features but have many higher frequency peaks we calculated the mutual information between any pair of column vectors in the pc and ic matrixes respectively and showed the mean value for each station in fig 9 where the mean mutual information of ics are all significantly smaller than those of pcs in all stations hence the ssa ica method derived more independent components than the ssa method particularly all mutual information values of ic are quite close to zero indicating that the components decomposed by ssa ica are mutually independent to a large extent 3 2 determination and adjustment for the driving sources of gps seasonal displacement we respectively grouped the pcs and ics to derive reconstructed components rcs for ssa and independent reconstructed components ircs for ssa ica therein ic1 or pc1 was classified into irc1 or rc1 the abundant intra annual variations for both ic2 and ic3 are inferred to be induced by different types of hydrological mass loading variations however when we compared them with the displacements derived from groundwater soil moisture and surface water loadings there had no compelling correspondence therefore we classified ic2 and ic3 or pc2 and pc3 into irc2 or rc2 to characterize the whole hydl displacement the rest ics and pcs are not considered because of the poorly seasonal characteristics then we compared atml displacement with irc1 and rc1 fig 10 hydl displacement with irc2 and rc2 fig 11 both irc2 and rc2 were resampled as the monthly resolution to allow a direct comparison with hydl displacement respectively the ntol displacement was excluded because of its low amplitude and complex temporal function in nc which was too difficult to find the corresponding component in the gps time series liu et al 2017 yan et al 2019 it should be noted that both atml and hydl displacements were also denoised by ssa ica aforehand chen et al 2013 as shown in fig 10 the time series of irc1 are basically consistent with those of atml displacements while the time series of rc1 show a little larger amplitudes which are because of the mixed annual signals in pc1 contrastively in fig 11 obvious differences can be found for three kinds of time series the main discrepancies between hydl displacements and irc2 are reflected in phases rc2 however largely loses the variation characteristics of hydl displacements the prs between the mass loading displacements and rcs ircs are shown in fig 12 from fig 12 a and c both rc1 and irc1 are in good agreement with atml displacement with the average prs of 0 57 and 0 60 respectively moreover the distribution characteristics of prs between rc1 based and irc1 based are quite similar and the former is slightly less than the latter at most stations indicating that atml plays a leading role in the gps seasonal displacement from fig 12 b and d the average pr between hydl displacement with irc2 is 0 53 while that with rc2 is as low as 0 17 the reason is that the predominantly annual variations of atml and hydl displacement are mixed in rc1 and thus interestingly the average pr between hydl displacement with rc1 0 43 is greatly larger than that with rc2 consequently our ssa ica succeeds in extracting the mass loading source signals from gps seasonal vertical displacements while ssa fails to achieve it therefore the source signal separation ability of ssa ica outperforms ssa it should be noted that the prs at stations hecd and hecx marked with the green dotted box are distinctly lower than others possibly due to the impacts of local effects ming et al 2017 which require further analysis through the correlation analysis we confirm that the primary driving sources of gps seasonal displacement in nc are atml and hydl however the correlations are not very significant especially for hydl to identify the causes we computed the annual amplitude a and phase φ by using the least squares estimation with a sin ω t t 0 φ where t 0 refers to 2011 0 and ω is the annual angular frequency noting that here we only consider the ircs of ssa ica since ssa fails to separate mass loading sources as shown in fig 13 a the annual amplitudes of atml displacements agree well with those of irc1 but the annual phases are slightly different with the shift of several days from fig 13 b hydl displacements are quite consistent with irc2 in amplitudes while phases of irc2 are shifted to about 2 3 months later than those of hydl displacements besides the different temporal resolutions for gps and grace gfo wang et al 2017 another salient reason may be the different detection strategies of surface displacement the growth peak of winter wheat in nc is in may yang et al 2010 due to the high demand for water and low precipitation groundwater is intensively pumped for irrigation resulting in a rapid decline of terrestrial water storage at that time grace gfo can detect the terrestrial water changes accurately within temporal resolution allowed so displacement derived from grace gfo models will undoubtedly reach the peak when terrestrial water storage change achieves the largest however the earth s response to the mass redistribution on its surface behaves as a viscoelastic adjustment process fu and freymueller 2012 guo et al 2015 also declared that deformation will continue even though the water level change stops therefore gps observed displacement will be delayed for a period in fact phase differences have been already found in previous studies wang et al 2017 liu et al 2018 yan et al 2019 li et al 2020 which will undoubtedly hinder the in depth analysis for gps time series but without drawing enough attention therefore this study attempted to adjust the phases of atml and hydl seasonal displacements respectively by shifting the phase difference values between irc1 and atml displacement irc2 and hydl displacement the wrms reduction is used to evaluate the consistency of seasonal displacement variation between gps and mass loadings before and after phase adjustment as presented in fig 14 before adjustment all stations show positive wrms reductions with a mean of 52 74 which is slightly better than those from the previous researches wang et al 2017 li et al 2020 probably due to the differences in mass loading models research periods and gps processing strategies after adjustment the mean wrms reduction reaches 64 88 which is 12 14 higher than that before adjustment indicating that the consistency between adjusted mass loading displacement and gps is significantly improved which has the potential for guiding the construction of the mass loading model in the future however stations bjyq and sxyc present marginally lower wrms reductions after adjustment possibly because the phase differences between mass loading displacements and ircs are too small to distinguish at these two stations so we performed some misadjustments 3 3 long term displacement trend due to hydrological mass change surface displacement of hydl certainly results from the storage changes of various types of water bodies therefore we evaluated the hydrological mass changes at first among which the terrestrial water storage tws change was estimated based on grace gfo models with the well known formula proposed by wahr and molenaar 1998 and expressed with 0 25 0 25 grid in the form of equivalent water height ewh soil moisture sm change was determined as the mean output from noah and catchment models rodell et al 2004 surface water storage sws in nc was reported to be extremely limited due to the massive building of dams as was snow water equivalent sws which can be ignored in terrestrial based water resource analysis huang et al 2015 feng et al 2022 thus groundwater storage gws change was estimated by deducting sm from tws change feng et al 2013 in addition monthly precipitation data from the china metrological administration cma available at http data cma cn was collected to characterize the links between hydrological variables and precipitation the area weighted average time series of tws sm gws and precipitation are shown in fig 15 and the spatial distributions of the trends of gws and sm are displayed in the form of color background in fig 16 from fig 15 changeable rates can be observed in different sub periods therein tws and gws increase slowly from the initiation of 2011 to the second half year of 2013 then decrease rapidly until the first half year of 2016 after a brief rebound during the second half year of 2016 both decrease again in the remaining time such changes are closely related to the temporal change pattern of precipitation tws and gws change in the wake of the fluctuation of precipitation and the changes slightly lag behind precipitation because precipitation must experience a slowly ground penetration process to recharge groundwater for the whole study period tws and gws decreased with the rate of 12 99 0 90 and 10 00 0 90 mm yr respectively sm change is basically consistent with tws before 2017 but it becomes relatively stable thereafter which may be benefited from the replenishment of the south to north water diversion project zhang et al 2021 the sm change rate during the whole period is 3 00 0 90 mm yr however the spatial distribution of the trends indicates that the rates of sm are not negative everywhere with slightly increasing trends in northern nc fig 16 subsequently we calculated the vertical displacements time series induced by tws gws and sm loadings their secular trends were fitted and illustrated in fig 16 from fig 16 a the trends of gws displacements during the period from january 2011 to november 2019 for all stations are negative with the range of 0 28 0 03 mm yr and the mean of 0 17 mm yr indicating that the porous response cause land subsidence guo et al 2015 due to the groundwater depletion is more significant than viscoelastic response cause land uplift wang et al 2017 which is because the huge groundwater aquifer in nc is filled with porous gravel sand and silt guo et al 2015 the stations with larger trends are mainly located in the east central plain 0 24 mm yr ecp defined by huang et al 2015 and marked in fig 16 a by the yellow dotted box where the groundwater depletion occurs in the deep confined aquifers huang et al 2015 conversely those stations in other zones mainly exploiting groundwater from the shallow unconfined aquifers huang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 present a relatively small ground subsidence rate 0 12 mm yr the reasons on the one hand compared with the shallow unconfined aquifer the water level in the deep confined aquifer will decrease much more when an equivalent amount of groundwater is consumed and it is more difficult to replenishment due to the multi layer aquifer systems liu et al 2018 as a result land subsidence is generally easier to achieve when abstracting groundwater from the deep confined aquifer on the other hand the fine clays and silts in deep confined aquifer possess high compressibility which can trigger more acute land subsidence guo et al 2015 therefore not only the quantity of groundwater consumption but the hydrogeological environment is also a key factor for the development of land subsidence from fig 16 b the displacement directions caused by sm loading are inconsistent over the region stations in northern nc show negative trends with a range of 0 17 0 02 mm yr while others in southern nc show positive trends with a range of 0 01 0 14 mm yr it is not hard to find that sm displacement directions depend on the changes in sm storage when sm storage is consumed southern nc the surface loading decreases and will result in land uplift conversely increased sm loading northern nc will compress deeper strata and then lead to land subsidence guo et al 2015 wang et al 2017 for the tws displacements obvious negative trends can be seen with a range of 0 32 0 02 mm yr and a mean of 0 18 mm yr although the trends of tws displacements are partly affected by those of sm displacements such as the stations sxlf and sxxx gws displacements from the perspective of the overall average level are undoubtedly the largest contributor accordingly we can conclude that extensive extraction of groundwater from the confined and unconfined aquifers has caused extraordinary serious groundwater loss and consequently induced severe land subsidence 4 discussion 4 1 knotty issues for ssa ica the components respectively reconstructed by ic2 and ic3 are not matched well with the displacements from groundwater soil moisture and surface water loadings but when ic2 and ic3 are jointly reconstructed the irc2 a good correlation has presented between irc2 and hydl displacement hence what extent of the mathematical independence can reflect the independence of physical loading sources in the real world is still unclear yan et al 2019 under the situation that more physical source signals are mixed it is very important but difficult to classify the ics into independent physical source groups for ssa ica currently we identify the group simply relying on the correlation analysis between ic and mass loading model derived displacement which will undoubtedly cause some deviations and require further investigation 4 2 comparison of the extracted source signals by ssa ica and ica ica has been widely applied to extract various geophysical source signals forootan and kusche 2012 guo et al 2014 liu et al 2017 2020 ming et al 2017 feng et al 2021 2022 jiang et al 2021 li et al 2021 therefore we employed the modified ica method developed by feng et al 2021 to extract the modified reconstructed components mrcs noting that we used the jade algorithm instead of fastica to estimate the unitary matrix the correlations between ircs from ssa ica and mrcs from modified ica are shown in fig 17 where the average prs are 0 71 and 0 70 for the first and second components respectively although the two kinds of reconstructed components are close however what should be emphasized is that the ica and ssa ica are intrinsically different the former requires the dimension of original data must be more than the number of potential source signals and it resolves a common temporal pattern for all stations then the source signal for each station is derived by assigning a different weight to the common temporal pattern thereby the source signal is inevitably affected by all stations the temporal pattern decomposed by ssa ica is only constrained by a single station without interference from other stations therefore we can conclude that the ssa ica can not only effectively extract physical source signals from gps time series but also remove the dimension restriction of ica which can be a supplement to ica associated theories 4 3 tectonic interpretation for gps vertical velocity the vertical velocity of the gps time series is constrained by both tectonic and non tectonic effects for those who are committed to giving an accurate interpretation of the secular crust motion it is crucially important to obtain a purer linear rate of tectonic movement van dam et al 2007 we thus removed the trend of non tectonic loading displacement from that of the gps time series to estimate the velocity of tectonic displacement roughly fu and freymueller 2012 non tectonic loading here includes hydl equal to tws loading and atml though the trends of the latter are very small with a mean of 0 01 mm yr for all stations the trends of gps tectonic and non tectonic displacements are illustrated in fig 18 from which we can see that the tectonic movement is active at a high rate mainly because nc has experienced large scale crustal extension and lithosphere thinning since the mesozoic stations located in shanxi province and along the taihang yanshan mountains reflect significant crustal uplift possibly caused by intense orogenic activity and compression of the tibetan plateau on the ordos block in western nc wang et al 2017 in addition it needs to pay close attention to two special stations which are built on soft sediment liu et al 2018 and show serious subsidence viz tjbd and hecx with the trends of 0 14 and 31 13 mm yr respectively the cause for such subsidence is attributed to the over exploitation of groundwater during the past several decades effective stresses within the strata have been increased as the continuous drop of groundwater levels thus aquifer system has experienced a long term depressurization as a result several huge groundwater depression cones have been formed in tianjin and cangzhou the locations and sizes of depression cones can be found in guo et al 2015 bawden et al 2001 also demonstrated that localized subsidence by groundwater abstraction can be large relative to tectonic deformation 5 conclusions land deformation has caused huge impacts on socio economic stability and sustainable development in nc in this study seasonal driving source and long term trend of vertical displacement in nc over the period from january 2011 to november 2019 are investigated by combining gps daily time series grace gfo models and atmospheric loading product the unitary matrix of ica is introduced to ssa to construct the ssa ica method comparing the pcs of ssa and ics of ssa ica annual cycles are concentrated in the pc1 while scattered over the first three ics the mutual information value of the pc matrix is much larger than that of the ic matrix in each station indicating that the ics are more independent than the pcs after grouping the pcs and ics respectively we compare the mass loading displacements with the rcs and ircs the average prs between atml displacement with rc1 and irc1 are 0 57 and 0 60 respectively and those between hydl displacement with rc2 and irc2 are 0 17 and 0 53 demonstrating that ssa ica successfully extracts the real mass loading displacements while ssa cannot identify them which highlight the powerful signal separation ability of ssa ica also the results indicate that atml and hydl are the primary contributors to gps seasonal displacement in nc furthermore due to the phase biases we adjust the phases of atml and hydl displacements by irc1 and irc2 the average wrms reduction reaches 64 88 after adjustment which is 12 14 higher than that before adjustment suggesting that the consistency between mass loading displacement and gps is significantly improved these outcomes are conducive to calibrating the products related to surface mass loading however the amplitudes of vertical displacements caused by the non tidal ocean loading and thermal expansion effect of bedrock and observation pillar are both extremely low and their temporal functions are complex in nc hence the corresponding components are not extracted by ssa ica which requires further analysis quantitative estimation of the hydrological change shows that gws decreasing rate from january 2011 to november 2019 in nc is 10 00 mm yr consequently the land subsidence due to gws depletion with an average trend of 0 17 mm yr during the same period plays a dominant role in the non tectonic displacement trend the stations with larger subsidence rates are mainly located in ecp especially in tianjin and cangzhou indicating that groundwater abstraction from deep confined aquifer results in extremely serious land subsidence the governments thus should pay enough attention to improving the utilization efficiency of deep groundwater in addition the tectonic movements behave actively in nc due to the orogenic activity and the compression of the ordos block which induce obvious land uplift credit authorship contribution statement tengfei feng methodology validation formal analysis writing original draft yunzhong shen

7978,study region athabasca river basin alberta canada 156 000 km2 study focus hydrology often relies upon hydrologic models in data sparse regions however it is unclear if such models are reliably accurate or if internal process simulations are reasonable representations of watershed function standard model evaluation and calibration approaches often prioritize accurate reproduction of recorded streamflow ignoring process simulation fidelity regardless of the intended model application this study evaluates whether combined use of streamflow and isotope tracer performance metrics can improve representation of simulated streamflow generating processes within a large river basin the athabasca watershed to inform calibration of a process based distributed hydrologic model new hydrological insights for the region flow based performance metrics were found to be sensitive to processes influencing streamflow volume and timing but insensitive to internal flow paths and storage volumes although somewhat less reliable than flow metrics isotope tracer performance metrics are found to be most sensitive to processes influencing mixing and water age and appreciably responsive to many other processes we demonstrate that process based hydrologic models for rivers such as the athabasca river cannot be optimally calibrated using streamflow metrics alone as such optimizations cannot tune parameters or process representations to which the objective function is insensitive importantly isotope tracers have demonstrable value for informing process based hydrologic model optimization by providing a window into the sub surface black box within complex regional scale simulations keywords hydrologic modeling parameter sensitivity process simulation performance metrics isotope tracers 1 introduction hydrologic models are broadly used to simulate flow generating processes in watersheds typically with the goal of producing runoff and streamflow assessments the flow timing and water volumes from these assessments affect predictions of ecosystem function and resilience water supply and hydroelectric generation and the extent of damage resulting from flooding and drought carlisle et al 2011 wan et al 2021 buttle et al 2016 an accurate prediction of streamflow in both the short term and long term for climate change projections is therefore of key importance for water resources operations and planning standard methods of evaluating models tend to judge simulation quality based on the accurate reproduction of historical streamflow while the fidelity of process simulation is often ignored regardless of the intended use of the simulation results clark et al 2011 increasing the physical basis of a model to improve process simulation and decrease model dependence on historical data is intuitively attractive but also necessitates higher resolution input data and increases the computational demand for running the model clark et al 2017 peters lidard et al 2017 accurately modeling streamflow is particularly challenging in remote regions as data availability is generally low streamflow and weather gauges are rare and have limited record lengths coulibaly et al 2013 data limitations increase the uncertainty but also the need for hydrologic modeling in mid to high latitude regions with limited accessibility to reliably simulate flows in ungauged basins or to predict flows under non stationary climatic conditions it is critical for hydrologic models to accurately represent the physical processes generating streamflow duethmann et al 2020 information on individual hydrologic processes is even more rare than weather or hydrometric data and limited accessibility in remote regions stalls the expansion of data networks additional observations such as stable isotope tracer data i e ratios of water molecules containing 18o or 2h to standard water have been used to add information on hydrologic processes stable isotope tracers are naturally occurring non reactive tracers of water source and processes resulting from their variable occurrence in precipitation and evaporating water bodies birkel and soulsby 2015 bowen et al 2019 a hydrologic model capable of simulating both flow and isotope tracer composition can therefore be more robustly evaluated against additional observed data a few models have already combined isotope and flow simulations such as the isowatflood model stadnyk et al 2013 the iwbmiso model belachew et al 2016 or the starr model van huijgevoort et al 2016 linked hydrologic tracer simulations can be compared to both flow and tracer observations further expanding the options for model evaluation simulation performance metric choice and the identification of more physically meaningful model parameter values during model calibration holmes et al 2020 stadnyk and holmes 2020 tunaley et al 2017 yamanaka and ma 2017 model performance metrics are used to evaluate model accuracy or as objective functions in automated model calibration algorithms they are broadly categorized as either residual error metrics based on aggregation of differences between simulated and observed data point pairs or data set comparison metrics based on differences between a population property of the observed and the simulated data sets bennett et al 2013 despite the wealth of literature on performance metrics there remains no general consensus on the best performance metric s to evaluate either flow or isotope tracer simulations and moreover these two types of data typically differ in temporal resolution and consistency of sampling which can significantly impact metric accuracy and therefore selection bennett et al 2013 mizukami et al 2019 the kling gupta kge and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse metrics are frequently used in the literature but flow signature metrics are also shown to improve the evaluation of specific flow simulation characteristics and identify hydrologically consistent parameter sets shafii and tolson 2015 knoben et al 2019 sahraei et al 2020 isotope simulations are most frequently evaluated using some variant of a residual error metric but other metrics such as the kling gupta efficiency have also been applied he et al 2019 tunaley et al 2017 these metrics all evaluate the model performance at local points either individually or as an averaged performance using integrated or cumulative data as both flow and flow tracers are the final summation of a multitude of hydrologic processes across a watershed a process based model can potentially be verified along individual flow paths as such processes are both simulated and intended to match real world fluxes it cannot be assumed that metrics designed to evaluate cumulative model performance will also be capable of evaluating or identifying the individual processes contributing to flow oreskes et al 1994 previous research on process based model calibration identifies that streamflow performance only informs a sub set of simulated processes acero triana et al 2019 newman et al 2017 and that process sensitivity to model performance varies seasonally bajracharya et al 2020 pfannerstill et al 2015 wagener et al 2003 the literature is however short in analyzing the processes tracer performance metric are sensitive to the actual capacities of metrics for both streamflow and tracer simulations to react to changes in the internal simulation of critical hydrologic processes on both inter and intra annual time scales would be of considerable utility in designing calibration strategies for process based models mizukami et al 2019 sensitivity analyses are well adapted to address this point and relative sensitivities of model parameters have previously been used to inform model calibration razavi and gupta 2015 song et al 2015 haghnegahdar et al 2017 sensitivity analyses are distinct from model calibration as they do not identify optimal or even necessarily good parameter values but rather they identify linkages between parameters and metrics this study will evaluate whether performance metrics respond to changes in simulated streamflow generating processes for the purposes of guiding hydrologic modeling choices to this end global sensitivity analyses are utilized to answer the following questions 1 which processes are flow simulation performance metrics sensitive to and is there any temporal or spatial variability in this sensitivity and 2 are there processes which isotope tracer metrics are sensitive to that streamflow metrics are insensitive to and vice versa these results will be used to assess the value of various metrics or datasets in adequately informing the calibration of a process based hydrologic model rather than comparing calibration outputs as has been done previously our aim is to provide guidance for the selection of performance metrics in tracer aided calibration and an awareness of inherent trade off between traditional flow based calibration and tracer aided calibration our study focuses on the canadian oil sands region in alberta canada where it is critical to assess the reliability of water supply forecasts given this region is undergoing significant future change resulting from anthropogenic development and climate change including glacial retreat permafrost thaw and increased forest fires gibson et al 2019a 2019b nenzén et al 2020 stahl et al 2008 understanding the hydrology and water supply of this region is a key goal of the alberta oil sands monitoring strategy government of canada 2021 2 methods 2 1 athabasca river basin the athabasca river runs north east from the rocky mountains to lake athabasca and the peace athabasca delta it is the most southerly part of the mackenzie river basin fig 1 the athabasca river watershed is located in the north of the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan on treaty 6 and 8 territory the total watershed area is 156 000 km2 elevations and land use vary widely from upstream to down the upper reaches of the athabasca are alpine or foothills regions with steep slopes and some glaciers most notably the athabasca glacier in the columbia icefield intsiful and ambinakudige 2021 the lower reaches which coincide with the athabasca oil sands region have subdued relief and abundant wetlands the soils in the basin are primarily loam with higher clay prevalence in the mid reach some sandy or coarse soil in the downstream region and some exposed rock or shallow soil in the upstream areas shangguan et al 2014 the rock underlying the athabasca basin is predominately sedimentary stone from the cretaceous and paleogene with some older rocks exposed in the rocky mountains and a small area with precambrian granite in the north alberta geological survey 2013 substantial agricultural activity occurs between the upper and lower reaches boreal coniferous forests are prevalent throughout the basin minimal quantities of water are diverted for agriculture while approximately 1 of annual flow is used for activities in the oil sands rosa et al 2017 there is some sporadic permafrost in the region which is actively degrading deeper bedrock formations contribute small amounts of flow to the athabasca river and its tributaries 3 5 of annual flow gibson et al 2016 vitt et al 2000 the landscape features of the athabasca river basin and its upstream middle and downstream regions are summarized in table 1 the climate of the athabasca watershed is highly seasonal mean monthly temperatures averaged across the entire basin range from 19 c to 17 c with a mean annual temperature of 0 c over the study period 2002 2015 the long term average annual precipitation is 450 mm in the downstream reaches approximately 60 of precipitation falls as rain but the upstream reaches are colder than the basin average and a larger fraction falls as snow environment and climate change canada 2020 the athabasca river basin is in many respects an ideal watershed case study for the utility of isotope tracers in large scale hydrologic modeling the basin contains a wide range of elevations and land cover from the glacial headwaters through mixed use grasslands and ending in wetland dominated boreal forest within a moderately sized basin the rivers in the athabasca watershed are not regulated by any major reservoirs or hydro electric developments the athabasca river basin is also relatively accessible compared to many mid to high latitude watersheds and oil sands developments have led to expanded research and longer term monitoring in the region 2 2 hydrologic model setup parameterization 2 2 1 model the athabasca river watershed was modeled using charm watflood and its associated dual isotope simulation model isowatflood charm is an open source distributed hydrologic model with a mixture of physically based and conceptual process representation kouwen 2018 the isotope tracer models for charm simulate the isotopic concentrations of oxygen 18 and deuterium in all of the storages and fluxes used in the original hydrologic model individual hydrologic storages are assumed to be completely mixed through depth and fluxes generally have the same concentration as the source storage except evaporative fluxes which are subject to isotopic fractionation stadnyk and holmes 2020 both the hydrologic and tracer simulations run on an hourly time step with daily simulated model output the athabasca river basin model divides the watershed area into 320 grid cells with a nominal cell size of 0 4 longitude by 0 2 latitude actual cell sizes are adjusted based on drainage area each cell is subdivided into 10 grouped response unit gru types based on land cover data from the esa european space agency 2017 the majority of these gru types are modeled with soil layers namely the grass 8 1 coniferous 54 1 and mixed forest 15 1 shrub 6 2 disconnected wetland 8 8 and barren 1 4 classes the glacier 0 2 and impervious 0 03 classes have no modeled soil storages all rain and snowmelt becomes direct runoff and glacier gru also generate glacier melt flows open water 3 8 and wetlands connected to the stream network 2 2 also have no soil storages but rain or snowmelt is added directly to the wetland channel or lake rather than running off 2 2 2 process representation the charm watflood model has two soil layers both of which can generate sub surface flows to the channel network rain or snowmelt can either infiltrate to the upper soil zone or runoff water in the upper soil zone may recharge the lower soil zone flow out to the channel network or connected wetlands or evapotranspire water in the lower soil zone may only flow out to the channel network or connected wetlands all types of gru have potential snowpack storages snow and glacier melt rates are calculated as a function of air temperature and melting snowpacks cover fractional areas of each gru the upper soil zone under a snowpack is considered frozen and all soil fluxes infiltration recharge and interflow have substantially reduced rates in frozen soils but permafrost is not included in the model connected wetlands where present collect outflows from all gru with soil layers and have bi directional flow with the channel network with direction determined by the relative water levels more detailed descriptions and full equations can be found in holmes 2016 all processes listed above have parameters controlling the simulated flux parameter values can be consistent across gru or separate gru can have different parameter values specific to that class as a mixed physically based and conceptual model there are a very large number of parameters which can be altered in setting up and calibrating a watershed model over 250 for the athabasca model however the vast majority have minimal impact on the simulation e g overland flow roughness factors or can be estimated from the literature surface depression storage caps this study will focus on potentially significant parameters identified by previous studies including holmes et al 2020 and model developer recommendations with a minimum of one parameter per simulated process as listed in table 2 2 3 meteorological data the hydrologic and isotope tracer models were run using four meteorological forcings hourly air temperature and humidity daily total precipitation and monthly average isotopic compositions of precipitation the precipitation temperature and humidity forcings were based on observations at environment and climate change canada eccc weather stations environment and climate change canada 2020 forcing data for each grid cell at each time step were estimated using inverse distance squared weighting with a temperature lapse rate of 5 c km and a precipitation lapse rate of 0 2 mm km 56 weather stations were included in the calculation provided there was observation data for that time interval minder et al 2010 kouwen 2018 the isotopic compositions of precipitation were estimated from the empirical model developed by delavau et al 2015 which uses a geospatial interpolation and a multiple linear regression of geographic and climatic indicators no field measurements of isotopes in precipitation within the athabasca basin boundaries were used in the development or validation of the geospatial isotope model but meteoric water samples from both immediately south and north of the watershed were included delavau et al 2011 the climate zone models covering the athabasca basin had modeled precipitation residual iqr of 3 6 and 4 7 for δ18o in validation and the model adequately captured the seasonality of isotopes in precipitation i e highly depleted precipitation in winter and annual variation of 15 for δ18o delavau et al 2015 2 3 1 flow and isotope data historical hydrometric data from the water survey of canada were used to calculate model performance metrics environment and climate change canada 2018 a total of 20 continuous or seasonal i e continuous only during the open water season hydrometric stations with daily data m3s 1 between 2002 and 2015 were used in the analysis listed in table 3 see fig 1 for spatial distribution and appendix a for average annual hydrographs and isotope sample data gauged areas ranged between 960 and 133 000 km2 the uncertainty in the streamflow data are approximately 10 on average with higher uncertainty during peak flow and ice on periods kiang et al 2018 westerberg et al 2020 a monthly water isotope sampling campaign on the athabasca river and several tributaries was conducted for the alberta environmental monitoring evaluation and reporting agency s long term river network monitoring program gibson et al 2016 sampling at hydrometric gauges in the athabasca basin began in 2002 and continued through 2014 with variable sampling frequency some years sampling occurred approximately monthly while some gauges have data gaps longer than one year all water samples were sealed in 30 ml high density polyethylene bottles and analyzed at either the university of waterloo environmental isotope laboratory or at alberta innovates technology futures victoria gibson et al 2016 high density polyethylene bottles have been shown to be effective at preventing isotopic fractionation and all samples were sealed and analyzed within 1 year of sample collection gibson et al 2019a 2019b spangenberg 2012 water samples were analyzed using a micromass isoprime dual inlet gas chromatograph pre 2009 and from 2009 on using a thermo scientific delta v advangage dual inlet hdevice system with an estimated analytical uncertainty of 0 1 for oxygen 18 and 1 for deuterium for both periods gibson et al 2016 isotope results are reported in δ notation in permil relative to v smow 2 4 performance metrics a variety of metrics were selected to quantify simulation performance based on the most commonly applied metrics from the literature as noted throughout this section metrics are sensitive to various characteristics of the distribution of the error residuals and therefore including multiple metrics in model evaluations is expected to expand the number of sensitive parameters only simulated data on days that have flow or isotope observations are considered for calculating these performance metrics firstly the normalized root mean square error was used for both the flow and isotope simulations calculated as 1 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n x s i x o i 2 x 0 where n is number of observations x o i is observation i x s i is the corresponding simulated value and x o is the observation mean the traditional nash sutcliffe efficiency nse another residual error metric and the log transform of nse were calculated exclusively for the flow simulation nash and sutcliffe 1970 while nrmse and nse are highly sensitive to large residuals that often happen due to mis timed simulations in high flow periods log nse is more sensitive to small residuals that happen during low flow periods 2 nse 1 i 1 n x s i x o i 2 i 1 n x o i x o 2 3 log nse 1 i 1 n log x s i log x o i 2 i 1 n log x o i log x o 2 the kling gupta efficiency kge metric and all three of its constituent components i e the correlation r the relative variability α and the bias β were used for both the isotope and flow simulations kge and nse share the same components r α and β but kge gives them the same weight as opposed to nse that relatively undermines variability gupta et al 2009 4 r i 1 n x o i x o x s i x s i 1 n x o i x o 2 i 1 n x s i x s 2 5 α σ s σ o 6 β x s x o 7 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where σ s and σ o are the standard deviations of the simulated and observed data three popular flow signature metrics were also applied to both the isotope and flow simulations eq 8 was used to calculate the slope of the flow duration curve sfdc for flows and the slope of the duration curve sdc for isotopes viglione et al 2013 8 sdc 100 x s 30 x s 70 40 x s x o 30 x o 70 40 x o where x 30 and x 70 are the data with exceedance probabilities of 30 and 70 the high and low flow signatures at the 5 and 95 exceedance probabilities were calculated using eqs 9 and 10 9 q 5 x o 5 x s 5 x o 5 10 q 95 x o 95 x s 95 x o 95 where x 5 and x 95 are the data with exceedance probabilities of 5 and 95 there are multiple other possible permutations of the sdc and high and low flow signatures which include slopes in log scale alternate exceedance probabilities and mean high and low flow comparisons but these are all fundamentally variants evaluating the same parts of the hydrograph bajracharya et al 2020 shafii and tolson 2015 yilmaz et al 2008 the relative variability and bias components of kge can also be flow signatures based on discharge statistics shafii and tolson 2015 finally three metrics quantifying the representativeness of the simulated slope of the isotope derived local mixing line lml which uses both isotope simulations in combination were included in the analysis the lml

sensitivity and visualization parameter sensitivity analyses quantify the variation in a response variable either a model performance metric or simply a model output variable to changes in parameter values either locally around a particular parameter value or globally across a wide range of possible parameter values a global sensitivity analysis gsa can illuminate the relative importance of different hydrologic processes within a particular watershed razavi and gupta 2015 song et al 2015 but the response is often aggregated across broad areas and longer time periods such that results represent an average or aggregate level of sensitivity this can be misleading for directing further research and in identifying the most significant unknowns bajracharya et al 2020 this study uses variogram based gsa an approach which aims to both improve the characterization of sensitivity and computational efficiency using the variogram measuring variance of differences in the response surface over the parameter space and quantifying global parameter sensitivity by integrating the variogram across multiple scales razavi and gupta 2016a this method has been implemented in the variogram analysis of response surfaces vars framework the basis of the vars tool software razavi et al 2019 this tool was selected for the gsa in this study due to the relative efficiency of the method which was required to apply gsa to a large scale process based hydrologic model the methodology for the application of vars to the isowatflood model is illustrated in fig 2 the vars tool was used to generate parameter sets using star sampling a sampling methodology for computationally efficient coverage of the full parameter space from 200 star centers a sampling resolution of 0 1 of the total parameter range used to generate cross sections of uniformly spaced parameter cross sections a total of 48 800 parameter sets were generated specifics of the sampling space are listed in table b 1 in the appendix razavi and gupta 2016b according to razavi and gupta 2016b this sample size was deemed sufficient for vars to calculate sensitivity reliably for our study in vars the variograms are integrated for multiple perturbation scales but the ivars50 integrated variogram across a range of scales from 0 to 50 of the scale range index is the most comprehensive index for global rather than local sensitivity and is therefore used exclusively in our results razavi and gupta 2016a the 90 confidence intervals on the sensitivity results were estimated via the internal vars bootstrap procedure using 1000 sampling iterations all sensitivity results in our study were normalized with values relative to the total sensitivity of a given metric i e the individual ivars50 values are normalized using the sum of the ivars50 for all parameters parameter sensitivities were calculated for all gauges and isotope sampling sites and the corresponding sensitivity indices were averaged either for the entire watershed or for all observation points within a defined region parameter sensitivities quantify the responsiveness of metrics to changes in parameter values and are not intended to identify goodness of fit or optimal parameter values sensitivity analyses were similarly performed on the data that was split seasonally december january february djf march april may mam june july august jja and september october november son to improve the temporal resolution of the analysis and assess seasonal changes in parameter and process sensitivity the individual sensitivities for parameters in a process based hydrologic model can inform our understanding of the model and basin function but they can also be grouped to illuminate the sensitivity of the model to specific simulated hydrologic processes changing a parameter value changes the simulated process that depends on that parameter value within the model and hence the contribution of that process to total streamflow if changing a parameter value and therefore the magnitude or timing of a process has no effect on the value of a performance metric then that metric is considered insensitive to both the parameter and the process multiple parameters can influence a process thus only if the metric is insensitive to all the parameters controlling a process is it truly insensitive to the process the number of analyzed parameters varied between processes ranging from one to seven individual parameters per process the parameters associated with each process are provided in table 2 the overall process sensitivity is summarized as the average sensitivity of all individual parameters controlling the process simulation assuming that if all parameters were equally sensitive all processes would have equal shares of sensitivity in the visualizations 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity the relative parameter sensitivities for all analyzed metrics are presented in fig 3 insensitive parameters are highlighted in blue and parameters which dominate the metric response are highlighted in orange shades darker shading is more sensitive insensitive the 90 confidence intervals for the relative sensitivity values are indicated by the red bars above the sensitivity values precise values for the confidence intervals are presented in table c 1 in the supplementary material the majority of flow simulation performance metrics left are sensitive to a consistent subset of parameters and are likewise insensitive to another subset of parameters in general flow metrics are highly sensitive to the snowmelt and soil retention parameters in the dominant land class coniferous forest flow metrics are also sensitive to snowmelt parameters in other prevalent land classes wetland evaporation and glacier parameters and baseflow parameters in the dominate river class all of these parameters have significant control over peak streamflow volume and timing there are a few outliers to these general tendencies lognse bias and q95 the lognse and q95 metrics are largely insensitive to snowmelt and soil retention parameters however lognse is extremely sensitive to the evaporation parameter pet f while the q95 metric is highly sensitive to wetland parameters kwet and θ the flow bias metric has a higher relative sensitivity to glacier and barren ground snowpack melt and is insensitive to baseflow and wetland parameters flow performance metrics are uniformly insensitive to all three soil conductivity parameters ksurf f khorz f kvert f channel roughness parameters snowmelt parameters for connected wetlands and open water and soil retention and baseflow parameters in non dominant classes combined these trends in relative sensitivity results mean that most flow metrics have correlated sensitivities correlation values for the sensitivities of all metrics are provided in table c 2 only the lognse and q95 metrics are not highly correlated with any other flow metrics confidence intervals on parameter sensitivities are narrow meaning that parameter sensitivity rankings for flow metrics are not highly dependent on the sampled parameter space i e are reliable such that a small subset of simulations with extreme results are not determining the overall sensitivity estimate these narrow confidence intervals are indicative of a smoother response surface where gradual changes in parameter values do not result in discontinuous changes in performance metric values in contrast to flow performance metrics isotope simulation performance metrics are at least somewhat sensitive to most parameters fewer blue cells in the right of fig 3 there was no parameter to which all isotope metrics were highly sensitive but all isotope metrics were at least moderately sensitive to the barren ground snowmelt parameter and the power parameter determining baseflow unlike the flow metrics the majority of isotope metric sensitivities have wide confidence intervals meaning that the relative sensitivities are often more uncertain for isotope metrics the isotope simulations correlations and the lml slope and r2 errors have the most reliable sensitivity estimates with confidence bounds comparable to those of the flow metrics as isotope performance metrics are all somewhat sensitive to nearly all parameters the relative sensitivities for isotope metrics are generally correlated with each other the lml slope and r2 errors are least correlated with other isotope metrics due to their high sensitivity to the pet adjustment factor flow and isotope performance metrics have distinct parameter sensitivities with only a few parameters having similar relative sensitivities for both metric types the surface conductivity snowmelt in connected wetlands and the alpine channel roughness parameters were uninfluential for all metrics no parameters were sensitive for all metrics isotope metric sensitivities were not generally correlated with flow metric sensitivities of the flow simulation metrics the bias sensitivities were most similar to isotope metric sensitivities due to the relative importance of the barren snowmelt parameter for both the flow bias and isotope metrics 3 2 process sensitivity the parameter sensitivities from fig 3 were grouped based on the process they affect in order to evaluate what metrics in this study are sensitive to specific simulated processes overall process sensitivities for all sampling sites or hydrometric gauges i e what would be used in a conventional model calibration are shown in fig 4 only six of the ten modeled processes dominate flow performance metric sensitivities with some variation in the relative shares for each metric the channel and upper zone soil fluxes have small or negligible shares of the overall flow metric sensitivity many of the evaluated metrics sensitivities are dominated by a single process particularly evaporation for lognse and wetlands for q95 and to a lesser degree glacier for bias and snowmelt for nrmse nse and correlation the kge metric has the most balanced shares of process sensitivity for the six processes dominating the streamflow response there is a substantial variation in the process sensitivities for isotope simulation performance metrics possibly due in part to the uncertainty in the parameter sensitivity values isotope metrics are consistently sensitive to soil retention snowmelt and baseflow and generally sensitive to interflow i e the horizontal upper soil zone flux no single isotope metric is sensitive to all processes but there at least one isotope metric is slightly sensitive for all ten processes the second isotope simulation 2h was not needed to cover all ten processes since the 18o simulation alone is sensitive to all processes given the uncertainty in many of the sensitivity estimates for isotope tracer metrics the differing sensitivities of the two tracers is likely insignificant in comparison to the flow metrics isotope metrics cover sub surface soil processes better and emphasize the channel roughness more however only the isotope correlations are highly sensitive to glacier melt meaning isotope simulations do not generally respond to changes in simulated glacier melt the isotope metrics have smaller shares of the overall sensitivity dedicated to wetlands evaporation and snowmelt than flow metrics although they are significant processes for both types of metric performance metrics can be calculated on a seasonal basis and observation locations can likewise be geographically separated for a more detailed analysis of process sensitivity across the athabasca region figs 5 and 6 for flow and isotope metrics respectively as would be expected from the overall annual results in fig 4 the kge nse and sfdc metrics are sensitive to six of the ten simulated hydrologic processes for either the average of all sites in the basin all or the basin wide annual a sensitivities with some variation in the ranking of these processes nse is generally more sensitive to snowmelt kge is more consistently sensitive to evaporation and glacier melt and wetlands are most influential over the annual sfdc it is important to note that cumulative error metrics have overall sensitivities that can be estimated from subsets with weighting e g overall snowmelt sensitivity for the nse will be between the maximum and minimum seasonal sensitivity this is not the case for population based error metrics the sfdc calculated from seasonally separated data may have different sensitive parameters than the sfdc calculated from unseparated data e g sfdc more sensitive to glaciers when considering whole years than seasonally separately data glacier melt is frequently the most influential process in the mountainous upstream headwater region of the athabasca basin in the summer and fall but is largely irrelevant to flow metrics in the mid or downstream basins among flow metrics snowmelt is an influential process across the entire basin but it is most sensitive in the period covering the freshet mam and to some extent jja similarly evaporation is most influential in summer and fall when the bulk of evaporation loss occurs in contrast to these seasonally varying processes flow metrics are sensitive to wetland fluxes year round more so in the lower slope mid and downstream regions of the basin where wetlands are more prevalent sub dividing data from fig 4 geographically and temporally does render some soil flux sensitivities noticeable all flow metrics in fig 5 are sensitive to interflow and lower zone recharge in the lowest flow data sub division winter flows in the upstream basin other low flow times and locations are likely to be sensitive to interflow and recharge these times and places are also likely to have baseflow as a relatively sensitive process soil retention is an influential process but has the highest relative sensitivity in spring mam coinciding with most snowmelt indicating that the primary cause of flow metrics sensitivity to retention is the soil s ability to absorb snowmelt no flow metric is sensitive to surface infiltration during any season or region therefore these metrics are completely insensitive to whether water on the soil surface infiltrates or runs off directly to wetlands flow metrics can be somewhat sensitive to channel parameters in very low flow or high peak flow periods parameters controlling flow velocity in the channel can influence flow simulation timing but wetlands have a much larger influence on the magnitude and timing of streamflow in this watershed isotope sampling locations are biased toward the downstream portion of the basin in the oil sands region of the athabasca river basin reference map fig 6 while the data sampling resolution in the upstream and mid basin regions are of the same quality as the best locations in the downstream region the smaller number of sites limits confidence in the generalizability of the sensitivities for the upstream and mid basin regions the large confidence intervals on isotope metric sensitivity fig 3 likewise adds to the uncertainty in regional and seasonal process sensitivity results some general observations from the isotope metric sensitivities may still however be drawn soil fluxes are the main theme of isotope sensitivity all isotope performance metrics are sensitive to some combination of infiltration interflow recharge soil retention and baseflow with these soil processes dominating the sensitivity in most seasons and regions baseflow is approximately the only sensitive process in the mid basin during fall son the isotope simulation at the upstream sampling site is clearly sensitive to surface infiltration and other downstream sites are not completely insensitive isotope performance metrics are more sensitive to recharge in winter djf and spring mam but there is no clear seasonal pattern to soil water retention sensitivity for isotope metrics unlike flow metrics overall there is considerable variation in the most sensitive processes for the various metrics locations and time periods and every modeled process is significant in at least one relative sensitivity sub division interestingly snowmelt and evaporation are not generally the most influential processes for isotope metrics even though both have distinctive signals in the isotope data these processes are also sensitive processes outside of their main seasons of occurrence isotope metrics are much less sensitive to glacier melt than flow metrics though it remains an influential process in the headwater basin during the summer and fall on the other hand compared to flow metrics isotope metrics are more sensitive to channel velocity the downstream transfer of process sensitivity for flow and isotope tracer metrics is illustrated in fig 7 with a pair wise comparison of sensitivities for nested watersheds along the athabasca river mainstem from upstream to downstream the flow metric sensitivity shows significant downstream transfer of process sensitivity along the mainstem of the athabasca river glacier melt is the dominant process in the athabasca headwaters and remains a significant process in the simulation at fort mcmurray over 1000 km downstream the flow gauges on the athabasca river itself are outliers from the regional sensitivities fig 5 due to influence of upstream areas glacier and snowmelt have much larger shares of the relative sensitivity isotope tracer sensitivities in contrast have limited downstream transfer of process sensitivity at the downstream end of the athabasca river isotope tracer sensitivities closely resemble those of local tributaries rather than upstream gauges isotope tracer sensitivities for the largest watershed areas also have limited seasonal variation unlike flow sensitivities for the same observation location 4 discussion 4 1 evaluating with blinders what flow based metrics see flow simulation performance metrics respond primarily to processes with substantial influence on either water volume i e evaporation and glacier melt or peak flow timing i e snowmelt wetland and soil retention the processes with the largest influence on flow metric values vary significantly within the athabasca river basin glacier melt is hugely significant to most flow simulation performance metrics in the mountain headwaters of the river but averaged flow metrics are less sensitive to the magnitude of glacial melt outside the alpine region conversely wetland retention and evaporation make only a modest contribution to flow metric responses in the headwaters where there is a limited area of wetlands and open water but these two processes are among the most important to flow metrics in the downstream oil sands region this finding is supported by gibson et al 2019a 2019b who found similar relationships between headwater and lowland regions using isotope derived estimates of water yield snowmelt and soil water retention are sensitive processes across the entire athabasca river basin but the scope of their influence on flow metric response is somewhat limited temporally the spring freshet mam is most sensitive to both melt rates and the upper soil zone water retention capacity from the timing of maximum sensitivity to soil water retention it is clear that flow metrics respond primarily to the capacity of the upper zone to absorb runoff and damp peak flows rather than its ability to retain water in the longer term and affect evapotranspiration based on the flow simulation alone it would appear that spatial variation in the most influential processes within the athabasca basin depends only on the prevalence of glaciers or wetlands although the model was not calibrated in this study sensitivity results indicate that tuning the simulation of just six of the ten modeled processes in the model would be sufficient to generate a good flow simulation assuming a good simulation is considered to be one where the simulated hydrographs closely resemble the observed hydrographs if this simple measure of accuracy is sufficient for the intended application of the hydrologic model a simulation that is well calibrated to optimize kge or some other combination of flow simulation performance metrics can be considered fit for its purpose e g short term peak flow forecasting in such situations however it would be unclear why a process based hydrologic model is being used in the first place the blind spots of flow metrics are of concern for potential model applications where soil fluxes are important or where the fidelity of process representation matters for example when total basin storage water age or flow paths are relevant outputs i e for water supply assessments or long term climate change studies calibrating the model to optimize only flow performance will likely prove to be inadequate kirchner 2006 in fact this study demonstrates that increasing structural complexity i e more parameters and processes is likely to result in a larger decision space of acceptable solutions derived from different hydrologic partitions or proportional flow path contributions figs 3 and 4 it should be noted that many applications of hydrologic models and scenarios in the canadian oil sands region require the accurate simulation of both water storage and flow paths for contaminant tracing or climate and land use impact assessment 4 2 the added value of isotope aided metrics isotope simulation performance metrics are sensitive to a wider variety of model processes than flow metrics fig 3 it is well known from previous research that some processes are only locally or periodically hydrologically significant and that parameter sensitivities therefore change depending on the time period or location within the watershed herman et al 2013 höllering et al 2018 we show here that there are in fact no processes that flow performance metrics are sensitive to that isotope performance metrics are not fig 4 in addition to those processes which flow metrics are sensitive to isotope metrics are additionally sensitive to soil water fluxes k f c and pwr and channel roughness n and are more sensitive to soil water storages soil in our modeling isotope metrics were sensitive to infiltration rates in association with exposed or barren ground lower and upper soil zone flows in association with grassland and mixed deciduous and coniferous forest and a mix of soil and wetland properties with channel velocities in association with wetlands and coniferous forest fig 6 snowmelt and evaporation were less influential than soil processes in spite of their importance to the water balance although this may be an artifact of the sampling resolution model sensitivity to sub surface processes is a reflection of the significance of mixing volumes in isotope tracer simulations the variability of the isotope tracer simulation in other models is also largely determined by the volume of simulated water in storage the water age birkel et al 2011 klaus et al 2015 rodriguez and klaus 2019 flow simulations are dependent on the amount and timing of flow while an isotope tracer simulation with a concentration output is dependent on the age of flow flow path length and fractionation processes surface versus subsurface flow paths flow metrics are therefore better at detecting flow volume or timing errors such as glacier melt rate errors fig 5 and isotope tracer metrics respond most to errors in flow paths such as soil water flux rates fig 6 there is little seasonal variation in process sensitivity for isotope tracers in the downstream region of the athabasca river basin the inherent mixing within large upstream areas sub surface storages or extensive regional wetlands limits the temporal variation in isotope data isotope data provided in appendix a isotope tracers are therefore better at providing information on processes in smaller basins than larger ones the damped isotope signals in larger watersheds provides useful information on long term process contributions but a high resolution isotope dataset from a smaller watershed can clarify individual process contributions for specific events or types of events as illustrated by fig 7 regions of low water yield have been reported within the middle and downstream portions of the athabasca river basin where it is believed there may be buried channels and a shift toward more vertical flow exchange as opposed to lateral surface runoff gibson et al 2019a 2019b in fact isotope tracer process sensitivities reflect this finding from surface water dominance in the headwater basin toward more soil storage dominated processes in the mid and downstream reaches this is however not reflected in flow based process sensitivities fig 7 to specifically diagnose lateral and vertical flow exchange processes other tracer types or enhanced sampling resolution may be necessary to fully delineate the geographical and temporal significance of these processes isotope tracer datasets can be better leveraged when sub basin scale or type are explicitly considered a single headwater sampling site or a site with different land cover or topography can add far more valuable information than adding more gauges along the mainstem of a river isotope tracer metrics in conjunction with flow metrics provide a more complete picture of the influential processes in the athabasca river basin than flow metrics alone when both data types are considered the alpine headwaters are affected not only glacial and snow melt but also infiltration and surface runoff fig 6 in the central portion of the athabasca watershed isotope tracer data can highlight the importance of soil storage and fluxes year round which flow performance metrics ignore both isotope tracer and streamflow simulations agree on the critical importance of wetlands and evaporation rates in the downstream regions of the athabasca river but isotope tracer metrics are also responsive to the path through the soil that water takes to reach those wetlands fig 6 which is intrinsically linked to residence time or water age there is also an interesting possibility that for processes both flow and isotope performance metrics are sensitive to the different simulation types may have contradictory optimization outcomes evaporation for example reduces simulated flow but increases both the magnitude and annual variability of isotope tracer concentrations i e seasonally enriched streamflow what may appear to be equifinality when streamflow alone is considered may not be equivalent when both tracers and streamflow are evaluated beven 2006 kirchner 2006 for example a model optimized with a flow performance metric could therefore have a much higher evaporative loss than the same model optimized with an isotope performance metric holmes et al 2020 this study utilized one hydrologic model with multiple simulated outputs to produce a suite of flow and isotope tracer based simulations the exact proportions we report for process sensitivity in relation to various metrics and proportion of simulated flow are specific to the hydrologic model used here isowatflood as they are a reflection of the model s internal structure and the algorithms that numerically define each process our findings however are model agnostic in terms of the cautionary tale they tell of over reliance on flow data for model evaluation or rather the missing information content when calibration is based on flow data alone the value of adding isotope tracer data is that water age and flow paths are directly incorporated into model evaluation which correlates to internal process function and model structure this outcome would occur generally for physically based models as it is a reflection of adding metrics and data capable of diagnosing such storage and flux interactions some findings relating to snowmelt sensitivity are only transferrable to watersheds under similar climates i e seasonal basins in mid to high latitude regions and outcomes would differ for lower latitude regions experiencing exclusively rainfall and much higher proportions of evaporative loss the actual value added by the isotope tracers in any particular application ultimately depends on the degree to which the isotopes fractionate throughout the regional hydrologic cycle and the isotope concentration distinctness of processes or end members in the watershed 4 3 on the selection of performance metrics for model calibration the various isotope and flow performance metrics have different relative advantages in the context of hydrologic model parameter calibration flow metrics consistently have reliable parameter sensitivities fig 3 due to a regular response surface for flow performance these reliable sensitivities are advantageous in model calibration as they identify consistently insensitive parameters and remove them from the calibration a smoother performance response surface also facilitates searching in optimization kge is the flow performance metric with the broadest range of process sensitivities and it is therefore the best choice for a stand alone flow metric in a process based optimization out of those evaluated in this study the nse is a possible alternative although unlike the kge it is skewed toward snowmelt i e the primary peak flow generating mechanism with high magnitude residual error in the athabasca basin using more specialized metrics such as lognse or flow signatures can highlight particular processes but these metrics did not respond strongly to processes also not covered by the kge metric fig 4 juggling different metrics or data subsets e g q95 or alpine flow gauges can highlight particular processes e g wetland fluxes or glacial melt far better than averaged general response metrics such as kge but does little to expose the internal soil processes the components of kge may be just as useful as specialized metrics for rebalancing process sensitivities when only streamflow is evaluated process based hydrologic models can behave as something like a black box for simulated flow pathways since streamflow simply tracks how much water comes out of the landscape blöschl et al 2019 streamflow performance is therefore unresponsive to changes in water flow paths alone flow metrics are indifferent to how much water is stored internally within a simulation or how long precipitation takes to reach the channel network as long as the correct volume of water reaches the river at the right time in contrast to flow metrics many isotope performance metrics have low reliability for parameter sensitivity fig 3 in that a small region of the parameter space can have an outsized influence over the relative sensitivity of a parameter as an example the isotope concentration simulation can perform extremely poorly if one combination of soil conductivity and soil water retention parameters results in the desiccation of a fractionating storage unit yet desiccation and poor simulation performance can be avoided by slight changes in any one of three parameters every isotope performance metric included in the analysis was sensitive to soil fluxes and storage indicating that responsiveness to internal flow paths is an inherent property of the isotope tracer simulation which the flow simulation alone does not have isotopic sensitivity to subsurface flow paths has been identified previously in the literature delavau et al 2017 stadnyk and holmes 2020 which is broadly why isotopes are considered excellent hydrologic tracers klaus and mcdonnell 2013 therefore unlike flow signatures isotope tracer performance metrics can cover processes missed by streamflow kge an isotope tracer simulation can produce a better informed hydrologic model but the utility of the added information is dependent on the application isotope performance metrics have a larger number of sensitive parameters than flow performance metrics fig 3 including isotope metrics in model optimization therefore increases the scope of the optimization more parameters need to be included in the optimization but more parameters will actually be optimized both the isotope tracer and seasonal flow metric sensitivity results oppose the common practice of removing parameters from calibration based on simple sensitivity analyses the considerable variation in sensitive processes for the various metrics locations and time periods meant every modeled process is significant to the model at some place or time the most reliable isotope parameter sensitivity metrics were the lml errors and the correlations between simulated and observed isotope data they are relatively unaffected by desiccation events in the simulation which can lead to substantially different model responses in highly localized parts of the decision space sahraei et al 2020 the more reliable isotope sensitivity estimates i e correlation and nrmse have similar process sensitivities for both tracers which is anticipated under similar atmospheric forcing however the advantage of simulating both isotopes is that it allows the calculation of a simulated lml and therefore lml errors of the isotope metrics lml error metrics were the most sensitive to evaporation no evidence was found to support using kge for isotope simulation evaluation in place of the traditional residual error metrics e g nrmse kge sensitivities were no more reliable and the same processes were influential for both nrmse and kge metrics furthermore the kge sensitivity was dominated by its variability component however trying to evaluate the variability error of a simulation based on sporadic observations is highly dubious just as using the variability in observations to normalize the squared error i e using the nse is not recommended for discontinuous data because the data sample may not be representative of the true population variability the variability error of the kge metric is not recommended for calibrating tracer simulations when only sparse observations are available the correlation or bias components of the kge are better supplements to a residual error metric in isotope simulation evaluation e g in a multi objective calibration problem formulation with discontinuous or sparse observed datasets simulating both isotope tracers does not increase the number of sensitive processes as all processes are sensitive to some degree to either of the two tracers the differing sensitivities of the two tracers for some metrics cannot be attributed to the properties of the tracers due to the uncertainties in the tracer sensitivity results it must also be noted that this analysis has not been extended to include either uncertainty in observed data values or from sampling analytic uncertainties for isotope data are relatively low however observations are sparse both spatially and temporally multi objective optimization methods are highly suitable for calibrating hydrologic models with both tracer and flow data as they allow a transparent choice in the trade off between simulation qualities the importance and uncertainty of an accurate tracer simulation can be balanced by the modeler 5 conclusions this study highlights the important regional hydrologic differences between the upper middle and lower basins of the athabasca river the oil sands monitoring program is concerned with cumulative effects assessment which requires knowledge of the impacts to more than just streamflow or total volume and accurate projections of future water supply depend on the accurate partitioning of processes controlling the overall water balance a black box model calibrated without specific consideration of these process can and likely will result in inaccurate partitioning of water in soils which directly influences projection of evapotranspiration air land and infiltration or baseflow land subsurface flow paths skewing future projections of streamflow the scope of this study was limited to sensitivity analyses in the athabasca river basin but there are some conclusions applicable to model calibration or evaluation more generally flow simulation performance metrics alone provide an incomplete picture of hydrologic process regional variation and significance kge is the best stand alone flow performance metric for process based optimization as it exhibited the broadest range of process sensitivity flow signature metrics can highlight specific processes already covered by the generalized kge but do not add new ones including an isotope tracer simulation expands the number of processes which can be evaluated residual error metrics or bias and correlation are all reasonable measures of simulation performance for isotope tracers in conclusion we suggest that a process based hydrologic model cannot be considered fully calibrated if the performance of the model is only evaluated with streamflow metrics because it is not possible for an optimization to tune parameters or processes to which the calibration objective is insensitive either the streamflow insensitive internal flux simulation should be ignored as unreliable or the model calibration should be expanded to include relevant datasets isotope tracers have demonstrable value for informing process based hydrologic model calibration although further research is needed on isotope enabled calibration

7978,study region athabasca river basin alberta canada 156 000 km2 study focus hydrology often relies upon hydrologic models in data sparse regions however it is unclear if such models are reliably accurate or if internal process simulations are reasonable representations of watershed function standard model evaluation and calibration approaches often prioritize accurate reproduction of recorded streamflow ignoring process simulation fidelity regardless of the intended model application this study evaluates whether combined use of streamflow and isotope tracer performance metrics can improve representation of simulated streamflow generating processes within a large river basin the athabasca watershed to inform calibration of a process based distributed hydrologic model new hydrological insights for the region flow based performance metrics were found to be sensitive to processes influencing streamflow volume and timing but insensitive to internal flow paths and storage volumes although somewhat less reliable than flow metrics isotope tracer performance metrics are found to be most sensitive to processes influencing mixing and water age and appreciably responsive to many other processes we demonstrate that process based hydrologic models for rivers such as the athabasca river cannot be optimally calibrated using streamflow metrics alone as such optimizations cannot tune parameters or process representations to which the objective function is insensitive importantly isotope tracers have demonstrable value for informing process based hydrologic model optimization

1 introduction hydrologic models are broadly used to simulate flow generating processes in watersheds typically with the goal of producing runoff and streamflow assessments the flow timing and water volumes from these assessments affect predictions of ecosystem function and resilience water supply and hydroelectric generation and the extent of damage resulting from flooding and drought carlisle et al 2011 wan et al 2021 buttle et al 2016 an accurate prediction of streamflow in both the short term and long term for climate change projections is therefore of key importance for water resources operations and planning standard methods of evaluating models tend to judge simulation quality based on the accurate reproduction of historical streamflow while the fidelity of process simulation is often ignored regardless of the intended use of the simulation results clark et al 2011 increasing the physical basis of a model to improve process simulation and decrease model dependence on historical data is intuitively attractive but also necessitates higher resolution input data and increases the computational demand for running the model clark et al 2017 peters lidard et al 2017 accurately modeling streamflow is particularly challenging in remote regions as data availability is generally low streamflow and weather gauges are rare and have limited record lengths coulibaly et al 2013 data limitations increase the uncertainty but also the need for hydrologic modeling in mid to high latitude regions with limited accessibility to reliably simulate flows in ungauged basins or to predict flows under non stationary climatic conditions it is critical for hydrologic models to accurately represent the physical processes generating streamflow duethmann et al 2020 information on individual hydrologic processes is even more rare than weather or hydrometric data and limited accessibility in remote regions stalls the expansion of data networks additional observations such as stable isotope tracer data i e ratios of water molecules containing 18o or 2h to standard water have been used to add information on hydrologic processes stable isotope tracers are naturally occurring non reactive tracers of water source and processes resulting from their variable occurrence in precipitation and evaporating water bodies birkel and soulsby 2015 bowen et al 2019 a hydrologic model capable of simulating both flow and isotope tracer composition can therefore be more robustly evaluated against additional observed data a few models have already combined isotope and flow simulations such as the isowatflood model stadnyk et al 2013 the iwbmiso model belachew et al 2016 or the starr model van huijgevoort et al 2016 linked hydrologic tracer simulations can be compared to both flow and tracer observations further expanding the options for model evaluation simulation performance metric choice and the identification of more physically meaningful model parameter values during model calibration holmes et al 2020 stadnyk and holmes 2020 tunaley et al 2017 yamanaka and ma 2017 model performance metrics are used to evaluate model accuracy or as objective functions in automated model calibration algorithms they are broadly categorized as either residual error metrics based on aggregation of differences between simulated and observed data point pairs or data set comparison metrics based on differences between a population property of the observed and the simulated data sets bennett et al 2013 despite the wealth of literature on performance metrics there remains no general consensus on the best performance metric s to evaluate either flow or isotope tracer simulations and moreover these two types of data typically differ in temporal resolution and consistency of sampling which can significantly impact metric accuracy and therefore selection bennett et al 2013 mizukami et al 2019 the kling gupta kge and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse metrics are frequently used in the literature but flow signature metrics are also shown to improve the evaluation of specific flow simulation characteristics and identify hydrologically consistent parameter sets shafii and tolson 2015 knoben et al 2019 sahraei et al 2020 isotope simulations are most frequently evaluated using some variant of a residual error metric but other metrics such as the kling gupta efficiency have also been applied he et al 2019 tunaley et al 2017 these metrics all evaluate the model performance at local points either individually or as an averaged performance using integrated or cumulative data as both flow and flow tracers are the final summation of a multitude of hydrologic processes across a watershed a process based model can potentially be verified along individual flow paths as such processes are both simulated and intended to match real world fluxes it cannot be assumed that metrics designed to evaluate cumulative model performance will also be capable of evaluating or identifying the individual processes contributing to flow oreskes et al 1994 previous research on process based model calibration identifies that streamflow performance only informs a sub set of simulated processes acero triana et al 2019 newman et al 2017 and that process sensitivity to model performance varies seasonally bajracharya et al 2020 pfannerstill et al 2015 wagener et al 2003 the literature is however short in analyzing the processes tracer performance metric are sensitive to the actual capacities of metrics for both streamflow and tracer simulations to react to changes in the internal simulation of critical hydrologic processes on both inter and intra annual time scales would be of considerable utility in designing calibration strategies for process based models mizukami et al 2019 sensitivity analyses are well adapted to address this point and relative sensitivities of model parameters have previously been used to inform model calibration razavi and gupta 2015 song et al 2015 haghnegahdar et al 2017 sensitivity analyses are distinct from model calibration as they do not identify optimal or even necessarily good parameter values but rather they identify linkages between parameters and metrics this study will evaluate whether performance metrics respond to changes in simulated streamflow generating processes for the purposes of guiding hydrologic modeling choices to this end global sensitivity analyses are utilized to answer the following questions 1 which processes are flow simulation performance metrics sensitive to and is there any temporal or spatial variability in this sensitivity and 2 are there processes which isotope tracer metrics are sensitive to that streamflow metrics are insensitive to and vice versa these results will be used to assess the value of various metrics or datasets in adequately informing the calibration of a process based hydrologic model rather than comparing calibration outputs as has been done previously our aim is to provide guidance for the selection of performance metrics in tracer aided calibration and an awareness of inherent trade off between traditional flow based calibration and tracer aided calibration our study focuses on the canadian oil sands region in alberta canada where it is critical to assess the reliability of water supply forecasts given this region is undergoing significant future change resulting from anthropogenic development and climate change including glacial retreat permafrost thaw and increased forest fires gibson et al 2019a 2019b nenzén et al 2020 stahl et al 2008 understanding the hydrology and water supply of this region is a key goal of the alberta oil sands monitoring strategy government of canada 2021 2 methods 2 1 athabasca river basin the athabasca river runs north east from the rocky mountains to lake athabasca and the peace athabasca delta it is the most southerly part of the mackenzie river basin fig 1 the athabasca river watershed is located in the north of the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan on treaty 6 and 8 territory the total watershed area is 156 000 km2 elevations and land use vary widely from upstream to down the upper reaches of the athabasca are alpine or foothills regions with steep slopes and some glaciers most notably the athabasca glacier in the columbia icefield intsiful and ambinakudige 2021 the lower reaches which coincide with the athabasca oil sands region have subdued relief and abundant wetlands the soils in the basin are primarily loam with higher clay prevalence in the mid reach some sandy or coarse soil in the downstream region and some exposed rock or shallow soil in the upstream areas shangguan et al 2014 the rock underlying the athabasca basin is predominately sedimentary stone from the cretaceous and paleogene with some older rocks exposed in the rocky mountains and a small area with precambrian granite in the north alberta geological survey 2013 substantial agricultural activity occurs between the upper and lower reaches boreal coniferous forests are prevalent throughout the basin minimal quantities of water are diverted for agriculture while approximately 1 of annual flow is used for activities in the oil sands rosa et al 2017 there is some sporadic permafrost in the region which is actively degrading deeper bedrock formations contribute small amounts of flow to the athabasca river and its tributaries 3 5 of annual flow gibson et al 2016 vitt et al 2000 the landscape features of the athabasca river basin and its upstream middle and downstream regions are summarized in table 1 the climate of the athabasca watershed is highly seasonal mean monthly temperatures averaged across the entire basin range from 19 c to 17 c with a mean annual temperature of 0 c over the study period 2002 2015 the long term average annual precipitation is 450 mm in the downstream reaches approximately 60 of precipitation falls as rain but the upstream reaches are colder than the basin average and a larger fraction falls as snow environment and climate change canada 2020 the athabasca river basin is in many respects an ideal watershed case study for the utility of isotope tracers in large scale hydrologic modeling the basin contains a wide range of elevations and land cover from the glacial headwaters through mixed use grasslands and ending in wetland dominated boreal forest within a moderately sized basin the rivers in the athabasca watershed are not regulated by any major reservoirs or hydro electric developments the athabasca river basin is also relatively accessible compared to many mid to high latitude watersheds and oil sands developments have led to expanded research and longer term monitoring in the region 2 2 hydrologic model setup parameterization 2 2 1 model the athabasca river watershed was modeled using charm watflood and its associated dual isotope simulation model isowatflood charm is an open source distributed hydrologic model with a mixture of physically based and conceptual process representation kouwen 2018 the isotope tracer models for charm simulate the isotopic concentrations of oxygen 18 and deuterium in all of the storages and fluxes used in the original hydrologic model individual hydrologic storages are assumed to be completely mixed through depth and fluxes generally have the same concentration as the source storage except evaporative fluxes which are subject to isotopic fractionation stadnyk and holmes 2020 both the hydrologic and tracer simulations run on an hourly time step with daily simulated model output the athabasca river basin model divides the watershed area into 320 grid cells with a nominal cell size of 0 4 longitude by 0 2 latitude actual cell sizes are adjusted based on drainage area each cell is subdivided into 10 grouped response unit gru types based on land cover data from the esa european space agency 2017 the majority of these gru types are modeled with soil layers namely the grass 8 1 coniferous 54 1 and mixed forest 15 1 shrub 6 2 disconnected wetland 8 8 and barren 1 4 classes the glacier 0 2 and impervious 0 03 classes have no modeled soil storages all rain and snowmelt becomes direct runoff and glacier gru also generate glacier melt flows open water 3 8 and wetlands connected to the stream network 2 2 also have no soil storages but rain or snowmelt is added directly to the wetland channel or lake rather than running off 2 2 2 process representation the charm watflood model has two soil layers both of which can generate sub surface flows to the channel network rain or snowmelt can either infiltrate to the upper soil zone or runoff water in the upper soil zone may recharge the lower soil zone flow out to the channel network or connected wetlands or evapotranspire water in the lower soil zone may only flow out to the channel network or connected wetlands all types of gru have potential snowpack storages snow and glacier melt rates are calculated as a function of air temperature and melting snowpacks cover fractional areas of each gru the upper soil zone under a snowpack is considered frozen and all soil fluxes infiltration recharge and interflow have substantially reduced rates in frozen soils but permafrost is not included in the model connected wetlands where present collect outflows from all gru with soil layers and have bi directional flow with the channel network with direction determined by the relative water levels more detailed descriptions and full equations can be found in holmes 2016 all processes listed above have parameters controlling the simulated flux parameter values can be consistent across gru or separate gru can have different parameter values specific to that class as a mixed physically based and conceptual model there are a very large number of parameters which can be altered in setting up and calibrating a watershed model over 250 for the athabasca model however the vast majority have minimal impact on the simulation e g overland flow roughness factors or can be estimated from the literature surface depression storage caps this study will focus on potentially significant parameters identified by previous studies including holmes et al 2020 and model developer recommendations with a minimum of one parameter per simulated process as listed in table 2 2 3 meteorological data the hydrologic and isotope tracer models were run using four meteorological forcings hourly air temperature and humidity daily total precipitation and monthly average isotopic compositions of precipitation the precipitation temperature and humidity forcings were based on observations at environment and climate change canada eccc weather stations environment and climate change canada 2020 forcing data for each grid cell at each time step were estimated using inverse distance squared weighting with a temperature lapse rate of 5 c km and a precipitation lapse rate of 0 2 mm km 56 weather stations were included in the calculation provided there was observation data for that time interval minder et al 2010 kouwen 2018 the isotopic compositions of precipitation were estimated from the empirical model developed by delavau et al 2015 which uses a geospatial interpolation and a multiple linear regression of geographic and climatic indicators no field measurements of isotopes in precipitation within the athabasca basin boundaries were used in the development or validation of the geospatial isotope model but meteoric water samples from both immediately south and north of the watershed were included delavau et al 2011 the climate zone models covering the athabasca basin had modeled precipitation residual iqr of 3 6 and 4 7 for δ18o in validation and the model adequately captured the seasonality of isotopes in precipitation i e highly depleted precipitation in winter and annual variation of 15 for δ18o delavau et al 2015 2 3 1 flow and isotope data historical hydrometric data from the water survey of canada were used to calculate model performance metrics environment and climate change canada 2018 a total of 20 continuous or seasonal i e continuous only during the open water season hydrometric stations with daily data m3s 1 between 2002 and 2015 were used in the analysis listed in table 3 see fig 1 for spatial distribution and appendix a for average annual hydrographs and isotope sample data gauged areas ranged between 960 and 133 000 km2 the uncertainty in the streamflow data are approximately 10 on average with higher uncertainty during peak flow and ice on periods kiang et al 2018 westerberg et al 2020 a monthly water isotope sampling campaign on the athabasca river and several tributaries was conducted for the alberta environmental monitoring evaluation and reporting agency s long term river network monitoring program gibson et al 2016 sampling at hydrometric gauges in the athabasca basin began in 2002 and continued through 2014 with variable sampling frequency some years sampling occurred approximately monthly while some gauges have data gaps longer than one year all water samples were sealed in 30 ml high density polyethylene bottles and analyzed at either the university of waterloo environmental isotope laboratory or at alberta innovates technology futures victoria gibson et al 2016 high density polyethylene bottles have been shown to be effective at preventing isotopic fractionation and all samples were sealed and analyzed within 1 year of sample collection gibson et al 2019a 2019b spangenberg 2012 water samples were analyzed using a micromass isoprime dual inlet gas chromatograph pre 2009 and from 2009 on using a thermo scientific delta v advangage dual inlet hdevice system with an estimated analytical uncertainty of 0 1 for oxygen 18 and 1 for deuterium for both periods gibson et al 2016 isotope results are reported in δ notation in permil relative to v smow 2 4 performance metrics a variety of metrics were selected to quantify simulation performance based on the most commonly applied metrics from the literature as noted throughout this section metrics are sensitive to various characteristics of the distribution of the error residuals and therefore including multiple metrics in model evaluations is expected to expand the number of sensitive parameters only simulated data on days that have flow or isotope observations are considered for calculating these performance metrics firstly the normalized root mean square error was used for both the flow and isotope simulations calculated as 1 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n x s i x o i 2 x 0 where n is number of observations x o i is observation i x s i is the corresponding simulated value and x o is the observation mean the traditional nash sutcliffe efficiency nse another residual error metric and the log transform of nse were calculated exclusively for the flow simulation nash and sutcliffe 1970 while nrmse and nse are highly sensitive to large residuals that often happen due to mis timed simulations in high flow periods log nse is more sensitive to small residuals that happen during low flow periods 2 nse 1 i 1 n x s i x o i 2 i 1 n x o i x o 2 3 log nse 1 i 1 n log x s i log x o i 2 i 1 n log x o i log x o 2 the kling gupta efficiency kge metric and all three of its constituent components i e the correlation r the relative variability α and the bias β were used for both the isotope and flow simulations kge and nse share the same components r α and β but kge gives them the same weight as opposed to nse that relatively undermines variability gupta et al 2009 4 r i 1 n x o i x o x s i x s i 1 n x o i x o 2 i 1 n x s i x s 2 5 α σ s σ o 6 β x s x o 7 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where σ s and σ o are the standard deviations of the simulated and observed data three popular flow signature metrics were also applied to both the isotope and flow simulations eq 8 was used to calculate the slope of the flow duration curve sfdc for flows and the slope of the duration curve sdc for isotopes viglione et al 2013 8 sdc 100 x s 30 x s 70 40 x s x o 30 x o 70 40 x o where x 30 and x 70 are the data with exceedance probabilities of 30 and 70 the high and low flow signatures at the 5 and 95 exceedance probabilities were calculated using eqs 9 and 10 9 q 5 x o 5 x s 5 x o 5 10 q 95 x o 95 x s 95 x o 95 where x 5 and x 95 are the data with exceedance probabilities of 5 and 95 there are multiple other possible permutations of the sdc and high and low flow signatures which include slopes in log scale alternate exceedance probabilities and mean high and low flow comparisons but these are all fundamentally variants evaluating the same parts of the hydrograph bajracharya et al 2020 shafii and tolson 2015 yilmaz et al 2008 the relative variability and bias components of kge can also be flow signatures based on discharge statistics shafii and tolson 2015 finally three metrics quantifying the representativeness of the simulated slope of the isotope derived local mixing line lml which uses both isotope simulations in combination were included in the analysis the lml slope error the lml intercept error and the lml fit error stadnyk and holmes 2020 the lml slope error is the difference between the best fit slope for the simulated river isotope compositions and the best fit slope for the observed river isotope compositions 11 lml me i 1 n o s i o s d s i d s i 1 n o s i o s 2 i 1 n o o i o o d o i d o i 1 n o o i o o 2 where o o i is oxygen 18 observation i and o s i is the simulated oxygen 18 value for the time observation i was taken and d o i and d s i are likewise the observation and simulated value for the deuterium data similarly the lml intercept error is the difference between the best fit line intercept for the simulated river isotope compositions and the best fit line intercept for the observed river isotope compositions 12 lml be d s o s i 1 n o s i o s d s i d s i 1 n o s i o s 2 d o o o i 1 n o o i o o d o i d o i 1 n o o i o o 2 the lml fit error is simply the difference between the r2 values for the best fit lines through the simulated and observed river isotope compositions 13 lml re r s 2 r o 2 the performance metrics used in this study are summarize in table 4 which includes a qualitative assessment of which error types each metric responds to as according to the literature previously referenced here the sensitivity of metrics to various error types differ error types considered are simulation timing simulation bias the simulation variability and errors in high quantiles e g peak flows enriched isotope concentrations and low quantiles e g low flow periods snowmelt freshet isotope signatures 2 5 parameter sensitivity and visualization parameter sensitivity analyses quantify the variation in a response variable either a model performance metric or simply a model output variable to changes in parameter values either locally around a particular parameter value or globally across a wide range of possible parameter values a global sensitivity analysis gsa can illuminate the relative importance of different hydrologic processes within a particular watershed razavi and gupta 2015 song et al 2015 but the response is often aggregated across broad areas and longer time periods such that results represent an average or aggregate level of sensitivity this can be misleading for directing further research and in identifying the most significant unknowns bajracharya et al 2020 this study uses variogram based gsa an approach which aims to both improve the characterization of sensitivity and computational efficiency using the variogram measuring variance of differences in the response surface over the parameter space and quantifying global parameter sensitivity by integrating the variogram across multiple scales razavi and gupta 2016a this method has been implemented in the variogram analysis of response surfaces vars framework the basis of the vars tool software razavi et al 2019 this tool was selected for the gsa in this study due to the relative efficiency of the method which was required to apply gsa to a large scale process based hydrologic model the methodology for the application of vars to the isowatflood model is illustrated in fig 2 the vars tool was used to generate parameter sets using star sampling a sampling methodology for computationally efficient coverage of the full parameter space from 200 star centers a sampling resolution of 0 1 of the total parameter range used to generate cross sections of uniformly spaced parameter cross sections a total of 48 800 parameter sets were generated specifics of the sampling space are listed in table b 1 in the appendix razavi and gupta 2016b according to razavi and gupta 2016b this sample size was deemed sufficient for vars to calculate sensitivity reliably for our study in vars the variograms are integrated for multiple perturbation scales but the ivars50 integrated variogram across a range of scales from 0 to 50 of the scale range index is the most comprehensive index for global rather than local sensitivity and is therefore used exclusively in our results razavi and gupta 2016a the 90 confidence intervals on the sensitivity results were estimated via the internal vars bootstrap procedure using 1000 sampling iterations all sensitivity results in our study were normalized with values relative to the total sensitivity of a given metric i e the individual ivars50 values are normalized using the sum of the ivars50 for all parameters parameter sensitivities were calculated for all gauges and isotope sampling sites and the corresponding sensitivity indices were averaged either for the entire watershed or for all observation points within a defined region parameter sensitivities quantify the responsiveness of metrics to changes in parameter values and are not intended to identify goodness of fit or optimal parameter values sensitivity analyses were similarly performed on the data that was split seasonally december january february djf march april may mam june july august jja and september october november son to improve the temporal resolution of the analysis and assess seasonal changes in parameter and process sensitivity the individual sensitivities for parameters in a process based hydrologic model can inform our understanding of the model and basin function but they can also be grouped to illuminate the sensitivity of the model to specific simulated hydrologic processes changing a parameter value changes the simulated process that depends on that parameter value within the model and hence the contribution of that process to total streamflow if changing a parameter value and therefore the magnitude or timing of a process has no effect on the value of a performance metric then that metric is considered insensitive to both the parameter and the process multiple parameters can influence a process thus only if the metric is insensitive to all the parameters controlling a process is it truly insensitive to the process the number of analyzed parameters varied between processes ranging from one to seven individual parameters per process the parameters associated with each process are provided in table 2 the overall process sensitivity is summarized as the average sensitivity of all individual parameters controlling the process simulation assuming that if all parameters were equally sensitive all processes would have equal shares of sensitivity in the visualizations 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity the relative parameter sensitivities for all analyzed metrics are presented in fig 3 insensitive parameters are highlighted in blue and parameters which dominate the metric response are highlighted in orange shades darker shading is more sensitive insensitive the 90 confidence intervals for the relative sensitivity values are indicated by the red bars above the sensitivity values precise values for the confidence intervals are presented in table c 1 in the supplementary material the majority of flow simulation performance metrics left are sensitive to a consistent subset of parameters and are likewise insensitive to another subset of parameters in general flow metrics are highly sensitive to the snowmelt and soil retention parameters in the dominant land class coniferous forest flow metrics are also sensitive to snowmelt parameters in other prevalent land classes wetland evaporation and glacier parameters and baseflow parameters in the dominate river class all of these parameters have significant control over peak streamflow volume and timing there are a few outliers to these general tendencies lognse bias and q95 the lognse and q95 metrics are largely insensitive to snowmelt and soil retention parameters however lognse is extremely sensitive to the evaporation parameter pet f while the q95 metric is highly sensitive to wetland parameters kwet and θ the flow bias metric has a higher relative sensitivity to glacier and barren ground snowpack melt and is insensitive to baseflow and wetland parameters flow performance metrics are uniformly insensitive to all three soil conductivity parameters ksurf f khorz f kvert f channel roughness parameters snowmelt parameters for connected wetlands and open water and soil retention and baseflow parameters in non dominant classes combined these trends in relative sensitivity results mean that most flow metrics have correlated sensitivities correlation values for the sensitivities of all metrics are provided in table c 2 only the lognse and q95 metrics are not highly correlated with any other flow metrics confidence intervals on parameter sensitivities are narrow meaning that parameter sensitivity rankings for flow metrics are not highly dependent on the sampled parameter space i e are reliable such that a small subset of simulations with extreme results are not determining the overall sensitivity estimate these narrow confidence intervals are indicative of a smoother response surface where gradual changes in parameter values do not result in discontinuous changes in performance metric values in contrast to flow performance metrics isotope simulation performance metrics are at least somewhat sensitive to most parameters fewer blue cells in the right of fig 3 there was no parameter to which all isotope metrics were highly sensitive but all isotope metrics were at least moderately sensitive to the barren ground snowmelt parameter and the power parameter determining baseflow unlike the flow metrics the majority of isotope metric sensitivities have wide confidence intervals meaning that the relative sensitivities are often more uncertain for isotope metrics the isotope simulations correlations and the lml slope and r2 errors have the most reliable sensitivity estimates with confidence bounds comparable to those of the flow metrics as isotope performance metrics are all somewhat sensitive to nearly all parameters the relative sensitivities for isotope metrics are generally correlated with each other the lml slope and r2 errors are least correlated with other isotope metrics due to their high sensitivity to the pet adjustment factor flow and isotope performance metrics have distinct parameter sensitivities with only a few parameters having similar relative sensitivities for both metric types the surface conductivity snowmelt in connected wetlands and the alpine channel roughness parameters were uninfluential for all metrics no parameters were sensitive for all metrics isotope metric sensitivities were not generally correlated with flow metric sensitivities of the flow simulation metrics the bias sensitivities were most similar to isotope metric sensitivities due to the relative importance of the barren snowmelt parameter for both the flow bias and isotope metrics 3 2 process sensitivity the parameter sensitivities from fig 3 were grouped based on the process they affect in order to evaluate what metrics in this study are sensitive to specific simulated processes overall process sensitivities for all sampling sites or hydrometric gauges i e what would be used in a conventional model calibration are shown in fig 4 only six of the ten modeled processes dominate flow performance metric sensitivities with some variation in the relative shares for each metric the channel and upper zone soil fluxes have small or negligible shares of the overall flow metric sensitivity many of the evaluated metrics sensitivities are dominated by a single process particularly evaporation for lognse and wetlands for q95 and to a lesser degree glacier for bias and snowmelt for nrmse nse and correlation the kge metric has the most balanced shares of process sensitivity for the six processes dominating the streamflow response there is a substantial variation in the process sensitivities for isotope simulation performance metrics possibly due in part to the uncertainty in the parameter sensitivity values isotope metrics are consistently sensitive to soil retention snowmelt and baseflow and generally sensitive to interflow i e the horizontal upper soil zone flux no single isotope metric is sensitive to all processes but there at least one isotope metric is slightly sensitive for all ten processes the second isotope simulation 2h was not needed to cover all ten processes since the 18o simulation alone is sensitive to all processes given the uncertainty in many of the sensitivity estimates for isotope tracer metrics the differing sensitivities of the two tracers is likely insignificant in comparison to the flow metrics isotope metrics cover sub surface soil processes better and emphasize the channel roughness more however only the isotope correlations are highly sensitive to glacier melt meaning isotope simulations do not generally respond to changes in simulated glacier melt the isotope metrics have smaller shares of the overall sensitivity dedicated to wetlands evaporation and snowmelt than flow metrics although they are significant processes for both types of metric performance metrics can be calculated on a seasonal basis and observation locations can likewise be geographically separated for a more detailed analysis of process sensitivity across the athabasca region figs 5 and 6 for flow and isotope metrics respectively as would be expected from the overall annual results in fig 4 the kge nse and sfdc metrics are sensitive to six of the ten simulated hydrologic processes for either the average of all sites in the basin all or the basin wide annual a sensitivities with some variation in the ranking of these processes nse is generally more sensitive to snowmelt kge is more consistently sensitive to evaporation and glacier melt and wetlands are most influential over the annual sfdc it is important to note that cumulative error metrics have overall sensitivities that can be estimated from subsets with weighting e g overall snowmelt sensitivity for the nse will be between the maximum and minimum seasonal sensitivity this is not the case for population based error metrics the sfdc calculated from seasonally separated data may have different sensitive parameters than the sfdc calculated from unseparated data e g sfdc more sensitive to glaciers when considering whole years than seasonally separately data glacier melt is frequently the most influential process in the mountainous upstream headwater region of the athabasca basin in the summer and fall but is largely irrelevant to flow metrics in the mid or downstream basins among flow metrics snowmelt is an influential process across the entire basin but it is most sensitive in the period covering the freshet mam and to some extent jja similarly evaporation is most influential in summer and fall when the bulk of evaporation loss occurs in contrast to these seasonally varying processes flow metrics are sensitive to wetland fluxes year round more so in the lower slope mid and downstream regions of the basin where wetlands are more prevalent sub dividing data from fig 4 geographically and temporally does render some soil flux sensitivities noticeable all flow metrics in fig 5 are sensitive to interflow and lower zone recharge in the lowest flow data sub division winter flows in the upstream basin other low flow times and locations are likely to be sensitive to interflow and recharge these times and places are also likely to have baseflow as a relatively sensitive process soil retention is an influential process but has the highest relative sensitivity in spring mam coinciding with most snowmelt indicating that the primary cause of flow metrics sensitivity to retention is the soil s ability to absorb snowmelt no flow metric is sensitive to surface infiltration during any season or region therefore these metrics are completely insensitive to whether water on the soil surface infiltrates or runs off directly to wetlands flow metrics can be somewhat sensitive to channel parameters in very low flow or high peak flow periods parameters controlling flow velocity in the channel can influence flow simulation timing but wetlands have a much larger influence on the magnitude and timing of streamflow in this watershed isotope sampling locations are biased toward the downstream portion of the basin in the oil sands region of the athabasca river basin reference map fig 6 while the data sampling resolution in the upstream and mid basin regions are of the same quality as the best locations in the downstream region the smaller number of sites limits confidence in the generalizability of the sensitivities for the upstream and mid basin regions the large confidence intervals on isotope metric sensitivity fig 3 likewise adds to the uncertainty in regional and seasonal process sensitivity results some general observations from the isotope metric sensitivities may still however be drawn soil fluxes are the main theme of isotope sensitivity all isotope performance metrics are sensitive to some combination of infiltration interflow recharge soil retention and baseflow with these soil processes dominating the sensitivity in most seasons and regions baseflow is approximately the only sensitive process in the mid basin during fall son the isotope simulation at the upstream sampling site is clearly sensitive to surface infiltration and other downstream sites are not completely insensitive isotope performance metrics are more sensitive to recharge in winter djf and spring mam but there is no clear seasonal pattern to soil water retention sensitivity for isotope metrics unlike flow metrics overall there is considerable variation in the most sensitive processes for the various metrics locations and time periods and every modeled process is significant in at least one relative sensitivity sub division interestingly snowmelt and evaporation are not generally the most influential processes for isotope metrics even though both have distinctive signals in the isotope data these processes are also sensitive processes outside of their main seasons of occurrence isotope metrics are much less sensitive to glacier melt than flow metrics though it remains an influential process in the headwater basin during the summer and fall on the other hand compared to flow metrics isotope metrics are more sensitive to channel velocity the downstream transfer of process sensitivity for flow and isotope tracer metrics is illustrated in fig 7 with a pair wise comparison of sensitivities for nested watersheds along the athabasca river mainstem from upstream to downstream the flow metric sensitivity shows significant downstream transfer of process sensitivity along the mainstem of the athabasca river glacier melt is the dominant process in the athabasca headwaters and remains a significant process in the simulation at fort mcmurray over 1000 km downstream the flow gauges on the athabasca river itself are outliers from the regional sensitivities fig 5 due to influence of upstream areas glacier and snowmelt have much larger shares of the relative sensitivity isotope tracer sensitivities in contrast have limited downstream transfer of process sensitivity at the downstream end of the athabasca river isotope tracer sensitivities closely resemble those of local tributaries rather than upstream gauges isotope tracer sensitivities for the largest watershed areas also have limited seasonal variation unlike flow sensitivities for the same observation location 4 discussion 4 1 evaluating with blinders what flow based metrics see flow simulation performance metrics respond primarily to processes with substantial influence on either water volume i e evaporation and glacier melt or peak flow timing i e snowmelt wetland and soil retention the processes with the largest influence on flow metric values vary significantly within the athabasca river basin glacier melt is hugely significant to most flow simulation performance metrics in the mountain headwaters of the river but averaged flow metrics are less sensitive to the magnitude of glacial melt outside the alpine region conversely wetland retention and evaporation make only a modest contribution to flow metric responses in the headwaters where there is a limited area of wetlands and open water but these two processes are among the most important to flow metrics in the downstream oil sands region this finding is supported by gibson et al 2019a 2019b who found similar relationships between headwater and lowland regions using isotope derived estimates of water yield snowmelt and soil water retention are sensitive processes across the entire athabasca river basin but the scope of their influence on flow metric response is somewhat limited temporally the spring freshet mam is most sensitive to both melt rates and the upper soil zone water retention capacity from the timing of maximum sensitivity to soil water retention it is clear that flow metrics respond primarily to the capacity of the upper zone to absorb runoff and damp peak flows rather than its ability to retain water in the longer term and affect evapotranspiration based on the flow simulation alone it would appear that spatial variation in the most influential processes within the athabasca basin depends only on the prevalence of glaciers or wetlands although the model was not calibrated in this study sensitivity results indicate that tuning the simulation of just six of the ten modeled processes in the model would be sufficient to generate a good flow simulation assuming a good simulation is considered to be one where the simulated hydrographs closely resemble the observed hydrographs if this simple measure of accuracy is sufficient for the intended application of the hydrologic model a simulation that is well calibrated to optimize kge or some other combination of flow simulation performance metrics can be considered fit for its purpose e g short term peak flow forecasting in such situations however it would be unclear why a process based hydrologic model is being used in the first place the blind spots of flow metrics are of concern for potential model applications where soil fluxes are important or where the fidelity of process representation matters for example when total basin storage water age or flow paths are relevant outputs i e for water supply assessments or long term climate change studies calibrating the model to optimize only flow performance will likely prove to be inadequate kirchner 2006 in fact this study demonstrates that increasing structural complexity i e more parameters and processes is likely to result in a larger decision space of acceptable solutions derived from different hydrologic partitions or proportional flow path contributions figs 3 and 4 it should be noted that many applications of hydrologic models and scenarios in the canadian oil sands region require the accurate simulation of both water storage and flow paths for contaminant tracing or climate and land use impact assessment 4 2 the added value of isotope aided metrics isotope simulation performance metrics are sensitive to a wider variety of model processes than flow metrics fig 3 it is well known from previous research that some processes are only locally or periodically hydrologically significant and that parameter sensitivities therefore change depending on the time period or location within the watershed herman et al 2013 höllering et al 2018 we show here that there are in fact no processes that flow performance metrics are sensitive to that isotope performance metrics are not fig 4 in addition to those processes which flow metrics are sensitive to isotope metrics are additionally sensitive to soil water fluxes k f c and pwr and channel roughness n and are more sensitive to soil water storages soil in our modeling isotope metrics were sensitive to infiltration rates in association with exposed or barren ground lower and upper soil zone flows in association with grassland and mixed deciduous and coniferous forest and a mix of soil and wetland properties with channel velocities in association with wetlands and coniferous forest fig 6 snowmelt and evaporation were less influential than soil processes in spite of their importance to the water balance although this may be an artifact of the sampling resolution model sensitivity to sub surface processes is a reflection of the significance of mixing volumes in isotope tracer simulations the variability of the isotope tracer simulation in other models is also largely determined by the volume of simulated water in storage the water age birkel et al 2011 klaus et al 2015 rodriguez and klaus 2019 flow simulations are dependent on the amount and timing of flow while an isotope tracer simulation with a concentration output is dependent on the age of flow flow path length and fractionation processes surface versus subsurface flow paths flow metrics are therefore better at detecting flow volume or timing errors such as glacier melt rate errors fig 5 and isotope tracer metrics respond most to errors in flow paths such as soil water flux rates fig 6 there is little seasonal variation in process sensitivity for isotope tracers in the downstream region of the athabasca river basin the inherent mixing within large upstream areas sub surface storages or extensive regional wetlands limits the temporal variation in isotope data isotope data provided in appendix a isotope tracers are therefore better at providing information on processes in smaller basins than larger ones the damped isotope signals in larger watersheds provides useful information on long term process contributions but a high resolution isotope dataset from a smaller watershed can clarify individual process contributions for specific events or types of events as illustrated by fig 7 regions of low water yield have been reported within the middle and downstream portions of the athabasca river basin where it is believed there may be buried channels and a shift toward more vertical flow exchange as opposed to lateral surface runoff gibson et al 2019a 2019b in fact isotope tracer process sensitivities reflect this finding from surface water dominance in the headwater basin toward more soil storage dominated processes in the mid and downstream reaches this is however not reflected in flow based process sensitivities fig 7 to specifically diagnose lateral and vertical flow exchange processes other tracer types or enhanced sampling resolution may be necessary to fully delineate the geographical and temporal significance of these processes isotope tracer datasets can be better leveraged when sub basin scale or type are explicitly considered a single headwater sampling site or a site with different land cover or topography can add far more valuable information than adding more gauges along the mainstem of a river isotope tracer metrics in conjunction with flow metrics provide a more complete picture of the influential processes in the athabasca river basin than flow metrics alone when both data types are considered the alpine headwaters are affected not only glacial and snow melt but also infiltration and surface runoff fig 6 in the central portion of the athabasca watershed isotope tracer data can highlight the importance of soil storage and fluxes year round which flow performance metrics ignore both isotope tracer and streamflow simulations agree on the critical importance of wetlands and evaporation rates in the downstream regions of the athabasca river but isotope tracer metrics are also responsive to the path through the soil that water takes to reach those wetlands fig 6 which is intrinsically linked to residence time or water age there is also an interesting possibility that for processes both flow and isotope performance metrics are sensitive to the different simulation types may have contradictory optimization outcomes evaporation for example reduces simulated flow but increases both the magnitude and annual variability of isotope tracer concentrations i e seasonally enriched streamflow what may appear to be equifinality when streamflow alone is considered may not be equivalent when both tracers and streamflow are evaluated beven 2006 kirchner 2006 for example a model optimized with a flow performance metric could therefore have a much higher evaporative loss than the same model optimized with an isotope performance metric holmes et al 2020 this study utilized one hydrologic model with multiple simulated outputs to produce a suite of flow and isotope tracer based simulations the exact proportions we report for process sensitivity in relation to various metrics and proportion of simulated flow are specific to the hydrologic model used here isowatflood as they are a reflection of the model s internal structure and the algorithms that numerically define each process our findings however are model agnostic in terms of the cautionary tale they tell of over reliance on flow data for model evaluation or rather the missing information content when calibration is based on flow data alone the value of adding isotope tracer data is that water age and flow paths are directly incorporated into model evaluation which correlates to internal process function and model structure this outcome would occur generally for physically based models as it is a reflection of adding metrics and data capable of diagnosing such storage and flux interactions some findings relating to snowmelt sensitivity are only transferrable to watersheds under similar climates i e seasonal basins in mid to high latitude regions and outcomes would differ for lower latitude regions experiencing exclusively rainfall and much higher proportions of evaporative loss the actual value added by the isotope tracers in any particular application ultimately depends on the degree to which the isotopes fractionate throughout the regional hydrologic cycle and the isotope concentration distinctness of processes or end members in the watershed 4 3 on the selection of performance metrics for model calibration the various isotope and flow performance metrics have different relative advantages in the context of hydrologic model parameter calibration flow metrics consistently have reliable parameter sensitivities fig 3 due to a regular response surface for flow performance these reliable sensitivities are advantageous in model calibration as they identify consistently insensitive parameters and remove them from the calibration a smoother performance response surface also facilitates searching in optimization kge is the flow performance metric with the broadest range of process sensitivities and it is therefore the best choice for a stand alone flow metric in a process based optimization out of those evaluated in this study the nse is a possible alternative although unlike the kge it is skewed toward snowmelt i e the primary peak flow generating mechanism with high magnitude residual error in the athabasca basin using more specialized metrics such as lognse or flow signatures can highlight particular processes but these metrics did not respond strongly to processes also not covered by the kge metric fig 4 juggling different metrics or data subsets e g q95 or alpine flow gauges can highlight particular processes e g wetland fluxes or glacial melt far better than averaged general response metrics such as kge but does little to expose the internal soil processes the components of kge may be just as useful as specialized metrics for rebalancing process sensitivities when only streamflow is evaluated process based hydrologic models can behave as something like a black box for simulated flow pathways since streamflow simply tracks how much water comes out of the landscape blöschl et al 2019 streamflow performance is therefore unresponsive to changes in water flow paths alone flow metrics are indifferent to how much water is stored internally within a simulation or how long precipitation takes to reach the channel network as long as the correct volume of water reaches the river at the right time in contrast to flow metrics many isotope performance metrics have low reliability for parameter sensitivity fig 3 in that a small region of the parameter space can have an outsized influence over the relative sensitivity of a parameter as an example the isotope concentration simulation can perform extremely poorly if one combination of soil conductivity and soil water retention parameters results in the desiccation of a fractionating storage unit yet desiccation and poor simulation performance can be avoided by slight changes in any one of three parameters every isotope performance metric included in the analysis was sensitive to soil fluxes and storage indicating that responsiveness to internal flow paths is an inherent property of the isotope tracer simulation which the flow simulation alone does not have isotopic sensitivity to subsurface flow paths has been identified previously in the literature delavau et al 2017 stadnyk and holmes 2020 which is broadly why isotopes are considered excellent hydrologic tracers klaus and mcdonnell 2013 therefore unlike flow signatures isotope tracer performance metrics can cover processes missed by streamflow kge an isotope tracer simulation can produce a better informed hydrologic model but the utility of the added information is dependent on the application isotope performance metrics have a larger number of sensitive parameters than flow performance metrics fig 3 including isotope metrics in model optimization therefore increases the scope of the optimization more parameters need to be included in the optimization but more parameters will actually be optimized both the isotope tracer and seasonal flow metric sensitivity results oppose the common practice of removing parameters from calibration based on simple sensitivity analyses the considerable variation in sensitive processes for the various metrics locations and time periods meant every modeled process is significant to the model at some place or time the most reliable isotope parameter sensitivity metrics were the lml errors and the correlations between simulated and observed isotope data they are relatively unaffected by desiccation events in the simulation which can lead to substantially different model responses in highly localized parts of the decision space sahraei et al 2020 the more reliable isotope sensitivity estimates i e correlation and nrmse have similar process sensitivities for both tracers which is anticipated under similar atmospheric forcing however the advantage of simulating both isotopes is that it allows the calculation of a simulated lml and therefore lml errors of the isotope metrics lml error metrics were the most sensitive to evaporation no evidence was found to support using kge for isotope simulation evaluation in place of the traditional residual error metrics e g nrmse kge sensitivities were no more reliable and the same processes were influential for both nrmse and kge metrics furthermore the kge sensitivity was dominated by its variability component however trying to evaluate the variability error of a simulation based on sporadic observations is highly dubious just as using the variability in observations to normalize the squared error i e using the nse is not recommended for discontinuous data because the data sample may not be representative of the true population variability the variability error of the kge metric is not recommended for calibrating tracer simulations when only sparse observations are available the correlation or bias components of the kge are better supplements to a residual error metric in isotope simulation evaluation e g in a multi objective calibration problem formulation with discontinuous or sparse observed datasets simulating both isotope tracers does not increase the number of sensitive processes as all processes are sensitive to some degree to either of the two tracers the differing sensitivities of the two tracers for some metrics cannot be attributed to the properties of the tracers due to the uncertainties in the tracer sensitivity results it must also be noted that this analysis has not been extended to include either uncertainty in observed data values or from sampling analytic uncertainties for isotope data are relatively low however observations are sparse both spatially and temporally multi objective optimization methods are highly suitable for calibrating hydrologic models with both tracer and flow data as they allow a transparent choice in the trade off between simulation qualities the importance and uncertainty of an accurate tracer simulation can be balanced by the modeler 5 conclusions this study highlights the important regional hydrologic differences between the upper middle and lower basins of the athabasca river the oil sands monitoring program is concerned with cumulative effects assessment which requires knowledge of the impacts to more than just streamflow or total volume and accurate projections of future water supply depend on the accurate partitioning of processes controlling the overall water balance a black box model calibrated without specific consideration of these process can and likely will result in inaccurate partitioning of water in soils which directly influences projection of evapotranspiration air land and infiltration or baseflow land subsurface flow paths skewing future projections of streamflow the scope of this study was limited to sensitivity analyses in the athabasca river basin but there are some conclusions applicable to model calibration or evaluation more generally flow simulation performance metrics alone provide an incomplete picture of hydrologic process regional variation and significance kge is the best stand alone flow performance metric for process based optimization as it exhibited the broadest range of process sensitivity flow signature metrics can highlight specific processes already covered by the generalized kge but do not add new ones including an isotope tracer simulation expands the number of processes which can be evaluated residual error metrics or bias and correlation are all reasonable measures of simulation performance for isotope tracers in conclusion we suggest that a process based hydrologic model cannot be considered fully calibrated if the performance of the model is only evaluated with streamflow metrics because it is not possible for an optimization to tune parameters or processes to which the calibration objective is insensitive either the streamflow insensitive internal flux simulation should be ignored as unreliable or the model calibration should be expanded to include relevant datasets isotope tracers have demonstrable value for informing process based hydrologic model calibration although further research is needed on isotope enabled calibration

groundwater exploitation has grown rapidly over the last six decades dillon et al 2019 in some areas this has led to substantial depletion and increased demand will exacerbate overexploitation scanlon

eliminates focused infiltration and recharge along with a host of other ecological functions and ecosystem services levick et al 2008 schoener and stone 2020a the present study aims to address an important disconnect in the published literature on the one hand much has been written about ar and mar strategies stefan and ansems 2018 niswonger et al 2017 including in urban environments page et al 2018 knapton et al 2019 these typically incorporate some form of structural modification to enhance recharge such as infiltration ponds wells or in channel modifications standen et al 2020 dillon et al 2019 on the other hand the importance of focused infiltration or transmission losses in ephemeral channels for natural groundwater recharge is well documented goodrich et al 2004 shanafield and cook 2014 scanlon et al 2006 summarized results from approximately 140 studies conducted in arid and semiarid regions across the globe and found that while recharge rates estimated over large areas are relatively low 0 2 35 mm y 1 recharge due to transmission losses in ephemeral streams can be many orders of magnitude higher up to 720 000 mm y 1 numerous studies demonstrate the importance of transmission losses for the water balance in dryland watersheds around the world schwartz 2016 showed that 21 86 of flood volumes infiltrated into the streambed alluvium during runoff events in a

wadis are an important contributor mcmahon et al 2008 studied a reach of the diamantina river in the lake eyre basin australia and found average transmission losses equal to 77 of total flood volume lange 2005 reported that transmission losses ranged from 29 to 94 of the upstream inflow volume for a reach of the kuiseb river in namibia in a study conducted in the southwestern u s during 2001 and 2002 coes and pool 2005 estimated that transmission losses in ephemeral channels accounted for 11 19 of annual recharge in urbanizing areas an important intersection exists between natural and managed aquifer recharge without the need for structural modifications ephemeral channels provide effective corridors for focused infiltration and recharge simultaneously stormwater runoff supplies additional water for potential recharge in the context of urbanization management decisions that aim to preserve transmission losses as a pathway for recharge should therefore be considered a mar strategy discussion of this important consideration is largely missing from the literature this is the research gap the present study aims to address the paper uses a large urbanizing watershed in semiarid central new mexico as a case study a hydrologic model for the basin was built and parameters estimated based on previous work conducted in the watershed schoener 2017 schoener and stone 2019 2020b the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the dynamics of runoff and transmission losses in the basin under real world rainfall conditions based on ten years of precipitation data 2 assess the potential impact of land use change and stormwater infrastructure on runoff and transmission losses this study contributes to the literature by quantifying the effects of stomwater management decisions on transmission losses an important source of groundwater recharge in dryland watersheds findings can be applied regionally to inform management decisions for ephemeral channels in other arid and semiarid watersheds 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the montoyas watershed a 142 km2 catchment in central new mexico u s fig 3 that drains to the rio grande just north of the city of albuquerque the watershed encompasses portions of the city of rio rancho approximately 20 of the basin is urbanized mostly in the lower and central part of the catchment soils are formed in eolian material and alluvium under natural conditions they support semi desert shrub and grassland vegetation annual precipitation is highly variable and ranges from 100 to 400 mm with an average of approximately 250 mm the study area is affected by the north american monsoon system adams and comrie 1997 heavy rainfall associated with summer thunderstorms frequently leads to localized flash flooding higgins et al 1997 runoff drains through a network of ephemeral streams called arroyos ephemeral channels only convey runoff for short periods often mere hours following intense rain events discharge at the outlet of the watershed was monitored continuously from 2008 to 2014 ten runoff events were recorded with a cumulative flow duration of 52 h over the entire 7 year period fig 3 shows an overview map of the study area with major ephemeral channels indicated in red channel elevations range from 1550 m to 1970 m above mean sea level a m s l in comparison the average groundwater level in the regional aquifer underlying the watershed is approximately 1510 m a m s l usgs 2021 the estimated thickness of the vadose zone beneath ephemeral channels therefore ranges from 460 m in the upper watershed to 40 m near the watershed outlet 2 2 precipitation and runoff data during the period with discharge measurements 2008 2014 10 runoff producing storms were observed in the study area table 1 summarizes precipitation and runoff characteristics for each storm event 5 min runoff data usgs 08329650 at the watershed outlet were obtained from the usgs new mexico water science center personal communication and from the southern sandoval county arroyo flood control authority precipitation data from 11 tipping bucket rain gages see fig s1 supplementary information were obtained from the southern sandoval county arroyo flood control authority precipitation gages onset computer bourne massachusetts measure rainfall in increments of 0 254 mm at a 5 min temporal

the method has been used successfully in the study area schoener and stone 2020b only data from locations that received more than 5 mm of rainfall for a given storm were used to calculate b including sites with very small cumulative rainfall amounts can lead to skewed values of b since small absolute differences between gi and ri can lead to large g r ratios gage and radar derived point precipitation data were then interpolated to rainfall grids spatial resolution 500 500 m temporal resolution 5 min using the inverse distance squared method in the gageinterp program maps showing the spatial distribution of cumulative precipitation for all 10 storms can be seen in fig 10 fig 4 compares intensity duration frequency curves grey for the study area with observed precipitation for the

emphasized that storm data presented in fig 4 does not represent basin average rainfall values but rather precipitation at the most intense location of any given storm event storms 1 10 table 1 were used for calibration validation of the hydrologic model 2 3 additional storms prism daily precipitation data prism 2021 for the study area were used to identify additional storms where at least 20 of the study area received 10 mm of rainfall or more this threshold was used to exclude very localized events as well as storms with low precipitation intensities unlikely to generate runoff 22 additional events were identified for the 10 year period 2008 2017 a summary table including storm dates is contained under supplementary information table s1 maps showing the spatial distribution of cumulative precipitation can be seen in fig s2 rain gage data and radar based precipitation estimates were obtained using the sources described for calibration storms 500 500 m 5 min precipitation grids for the study area were prepared using the same approach described above 2 4 hydrologic model numerous different hydrologic modeling programs capable of simulating channel transmission losses sometimes referred to as seepage exist including the soil water assessment tool swat the basin characterization model bcm the storm water management model swmm and the hydrologic modeling system hec hms for this study the latter was chosen for the following reasons 1 hec hms can simulate runoff from natural areas as well as urbanized subbasins including impervious surfaces and drainage infrastructure allowing analyses of future urbanization scenarios 2 the simplicity of the model makes it suitable for use in data sparse regions such as the study area 3 a previous study by the author demonstrated that hec hms performs well for simulating transmission losses in ephemeral channels of the study basin schoener 2017 4 the model is widely used throughout the study region e g nmdot 2018 adot 2014 pcrfcd 2021 findings from this study therefore have regional significance for hydrologic practice all hydrologic modeling was carried out using hec hms version 4 2 1 the watershed was divided into 143 subbasins watershed and subbasin boundaries were delineated using hec geo hms software based on a digital elevation model dem created from light detection and ranging data with a vertical resolution of 0 6 m boundaries were modified to accommodate desired analysis points and achieve subbasins with relatively uniform land use characteristics analysis points were selected for tributary confluences major existing culverts and road crossings and pond locations questionable boundaries were verified in the field especially at locations where graded roads influence flow paths as implemented in this study the hydrologic model has three major components 1 when precipitation reaches the land surface it is divided into infiltration and infiltration excess overland flow 2 overland flow is transformed into runoff hydrographs for each subbasin 3 runoff hydrographs are routed through ponds and ephemeral channels to the watershed outlet each model component is described in detail in sections 2 4 1 2 4 4 below although transmission losses are simulated as part of the reach routing procedure they are described in a separate subsection 2 4 4 because of their crucial role in this study 2 4 1 rainfall loss and excess in many dryland watersheds including the study area infiltration excess overland flow is the dominant mechanism for runoff generation cools et al 2012 huang et al 2016 huo et al 2020 to calculate excess precipitation directly connected impervious areas dcia were first quantified for each subbasin dcia were modeled as percent impervious in hec hms the model converts all precipitation falling on dcia to runoff major sources of dcia such as commercial areas and paved roads were digitized manually based on color digital aerial photographs acquired in the spring of 2010 during leaf off conditions residential roof areas were quantified based on spatial data of building footprint obtained from the city of rio rancho personal communication an average driveway size of 65 m2 was assumed for each residential lot 2010 land use conditions were used for the entire calibration and validation period 2008 2014 this simplifying assumption appears reasonable because urban growth in the watershed practically ceased following the housing crash of 2008 and no substantial increases occurred until after 2014 losses for pervious areas were modeled using the green and ampt infiltration model green and ampt 1912 2 f t k 1 θ sat θ i ψ f t where ft mm h 1 is the potential infiltration or loss rate at time t k mm h 1 is the saturated hydraulic

based on rainfall simulator experiments carried out in the study area by schoener and stone 2019 fig 5 black circle based on their results k values of 40 mm h 1 were used for undisturbed soils categorized as loamy sands fig 5 yellow for compacted or disturbed areas as well as sandy loams and sandy clay loams in the upper watershed see fig 5 orange and brown a lower rate of k 20 mm h 1 was applied for subbasins containing both soil types area weighted average values were calculated saturated volumetric water content was estimated based on in situ soil testing conducted at 18 test sites throughout the watershed fig 5 blue square to determine values of θsat a steel sleeve diameter 60 cm was inserted into the soil at each site to a depth of 5 cm the soil was saturated with 7 5 cm of water and a core sample ams inc american falls id of the top 7 5 cm was retrieved after all water had infiltrated moisture content was then determined by drying average θsat was 0 28 m3 m 3 with values at individual sites ranging from 0 19 to 0 35 m3 m 3 no systematic difference based on soil texture was evident the average value was therefore applied to the entire watershed initial water

measured rainfall runoff data see section 2 6 below 2 4 2 transforming excess precipitation to a runoff hydrograph excess precipitation was converted to runoff hydrographs using the modified clark model kull and feldman 1998 as a transform the model was selected because it is the only option available in hec hms that allows for the use of gridded rainfall data underlying the modclark transform is a gridded representation of the watershed each grid cell has a specified distance from the basin outlet which is scaled by the time of concentration assigned to the subbasin usace 2000 2013 a linear reservoir model accounts for storage effects within the subbasin model parameters time of concentration tc storage coefficient r were estimated based on spatial data and field surveys a 500 500 m grid for the basin was prepared using the hec geohms extension for arcgis esri redlands ca based on the digital elevation model of the study area 2 4 3 routing 48 ponds attenuate flow from urbanized areas and were included in the model pond parameters and dimensions were collected from corresponding engineering documents and verified in the field pond routing was simulated using rating curves elevation storage and storage discharge curves ponds were assumed to be dry at the start of each simulation the model contains a total of 133 routing reaches reaches were delineated in arcgis based on the 0 6 m dem slopes and channel bottom widths were estimated based on the dem and aerial photographs channel reaches were modeled using idealized cross sections that most closely resembled the natural geometry of the reach trapezoidal and rectangular roughness coefficients manning s n values were estimated based on aerial photographs and field investigation the muskingum cunge method was used for flood routing in hec hms 2 4 4 channel transmission losses in a detailed study conducted in the montoyas watershed schoener 2017 quantified transmission losses by calculating a reach water balance for major conveyances they concluded that transmission losses can be simulated successfully using a constant percolation channel loss rate of 38 mm h 1 the same approach was adopted in the present study losses in all routing reaches corresponding to natural channels were modeled using a constant loss rate of 38 mm h 1 corresponding reaches are indicated as red lines in fig 3 they have a combined length of 74 km an average channel bottom width of 29 m range 9 83 m and a total area of 159 ha major ephemeral channels or arroyos therefore make up approximately 1 of the watershed area a recent example demonstrating the important role of transmission losses in the study area can be seen in fig 6 on july 5 2018 a thunderstorm produced brief heavy rain over part of the watershed more than 45 mm of precipitation fell in the upper portion of the basin while the rest of the watershed received less than 10 mm of rainfall the duration of the storm was approximately one hour with peak intensities of more than 90 mm h 1 localized flash flooding in one ephemeral tributary was captured by a time lapse camera selected images in 20 min time increments are included in fig 6 runoff at the site commenced at 18 30 local time and ceased by 20 30 observations by the author confirmed that during this storm event only a small amount of flow reached the outlet of the watershed most of the runoff infiltrated into the permeable channel bed as the flash flood moved downstream this is evident in the hydrographs measured at two temporary gaging stations red squares flow 1 and 2 the red hydrograph fig 6 top represents flow at the confluence of upstream tributaries flow 1 comparatively little runoff reached the station near the watershed outlet flow 2 black hydrograph 2 5 model scenarios all 32 storm events 10 calibration storms and 22 additional storms see table 1 and table s1 respectively covering a 10 year period 2008 2017 were used to assess the impact of numerous land use and stormwater infrastructure scenarios on runoff and transmission losses in the watershed under real world conditions fig 7 shows four different urbanization scenarios for the study area whereby the urbanized area is indicated in blue pre urbanized conditions are shown on the left moving to the right conditions correspond to the years 2010 2030 and 2040 based on statistics from the u s census bureau 2020 approximately 32 100 people lived in the watershed in 2010 with an average household size of 2 72 the year 2020 was not included in the analysis because urban development slowed considerably in the decade following the 2008 housing crisis and results from a 2020 scenario would have been very similar to 2010 parameter estimation for the 2010 scenario is described in detail in section 2 4 above the pre urbanized scenario assumes no urbanization is present in the watershed loss model parameters were therefore estimated based on soil texture alone for future scenarios 2030 and 2040 the following assumptions were used 1 nearly the entire watershed is platted and zoned for residential development city of rio rancho personal communication based on average lot size it was assumed that any new urban development would be single family residential at a density of 10 dwelling units per hectare 2 following historic trends it was assumed that urbanization would progress from downstream to upstream 3 for the 2030 scenario the projected population numbers for the study area were estimated at 58 600 this was based on an annual growth rate of 4 equal to the average rate the city of rio rancho experienced during the period 1990 2010 4 using the same rational watershed population for the 2040 scenario was estimated at 87 900 5 assuming an average household size of 2 72 and a development density of 10 dwelling units per hectare the increase in urbanized area for the 2030 and 2040 scenarios was estimated at approximately 970 ha and 2050 ha respectively compared to 2010 conditions based on the assumptions above projected land use in the watershed was mapped in arcgis esri redlands ca for 2030 and 2040 conditions and loss model parameters for model subbasins were estimated following the approach described in section 2 4 above in addition to urbanization the impact of drainage infrastructure on runoff and transmission losses in the watershed was assessed three stormwater detention pond alternatives were considered 1 no ponds 2 2010 conditions i e stormwater detention ponds present in the watershed during the calibration validation period 3 future conditions assuming peak flows from future development will be restricted to 2010 conditions at the subbasin level for the 1 24 hour annual chance storm future conditions were simulated by adding hypothetical ponds to subbasins with an increase in urbanized area and adjusting storage volume and outlet dimensions until peak discharge was within 10 of the 2010 model run increasing urbanization often leads to encroachment on ephemeral channels particularly because infrequent flows are not perceived as a danger when arroyos do convey runoff substantial bank erosion can occur in a short period of time if not given sufficient room to meander erosion can quickly threaten houses roads and other urban infrastructure in urban areas arroyos are therefore often converted into concrete lined channels to assess the impact of channel lining on runoff and transmission losses in the study area four different scenarios were considered all arroyos are natural and lining of the lower 5 10 and 15 km of the arroyo fig 7 left indicates the 5 10 and 15 km marks long the main stem of the montoyas arroyo measured from the basin outlet no transmission losses occur in lined channel sections 2 6 model calibration and validation three model parameters were calibrated time of concentration tc storage coefficient r and wetting front suction ψ tc and r which affect hydrograph shape and timing were calibrated by modifying initial estimates of tc and r for all subbasins in increments of 5 and determining the optimal parameter combination based on maximum nash sutcliff efficiency nse for the largest observed runoff event see table 1 storm 6 that affected the entire watershed nse is calculated as 4 nse 1 i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 where yi obs is the i th observation yi sim is the i th simulated value n is the number of observations and ymean is the arithmetic average of observed values nse values range from to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect fit between observed and modeled hydrographs nash and sutcliffe 1970 model simulations with nse 0 5 are generally accepted as satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 wetting front suction ψ mm was then calibrated based on measured rainfall runoff data for ten observed storms see table 1 values of ψ for all subbasins were varied between 5 and 100 mm in increments of 5 mm 40 simulations for each storm the plausible range of ψ values was based on rainfall simulator experiments conducted by the author in the study area schoener and stone 2019 optimal values of ψ for each storm were determined based on maximum nse and minimum runoff volume error with equal weights assigned to each metric runoff volume error is calculated as the difference between measured and simulated runoff volume optimal ψ values were then correlated with antecedent soil moisture θi for each event the emerging relationship was used to scale ψ based on initial conditions the performance of this method was validated using observed data due to the limited number of runoff events the data could not be split into a training and testing set leave one out cross validation was therefore employed for model validation with this method the parameter of the prediction function in this case ψ is trained on all data except for one point a prediction is then made for that one point and tested by comparing simulated and observed flows this process was repeated n times where n is the number of observations in the data set in addition to nse two other metrics were used to assess model performance the mean absolute error mae 5 mae 1 n i 1 n y i obs y i sim and the root mean square error rmse 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation results optimized wetting front suction ψ values are plotted against antecedent soil moisture θi in fig 8 model calibration revealed that during two events storms 1 and 10 model performance was independent of wetting front suction both storms were largely limited to the lower urbanized portion of the watershed and runoff likely originated from impervious surfaces only storms 2 9 were therefore used for model calibration and cross validation fig 8 shows a strong linear correlation r2 0 85 between ψ and antecedent moisture whereby optimal wetting front suction decreases with increasing θi fig 9 shows results from the 8 fold cross validation using data from storms 2 9 the scatter plots compare measured and simulated runoff volumes left and flow durations right performance metrics are included below each chart the comparison illustrates that the model performed well with respect to runoff volume r2 0 85 with one exception see fig 9 black arrow predicted flow duration closely matched measured values seven out of eight simulations resulted in nse values exceeding 0 5 indicating good agreement between simulated and measured hydrographs detailed results for each storm are displayed in fig 10 maps show the spatial distribution of rainfall within the watershed whereby darker shading indicates higher precipitation adjacent to each rainfall map measured runoff is displayed with grey shading while simulated flows are shown as line graphs solid black lines represent simulations with optimal ψ values dotted red lines show cross validation results please note that storms 1 and 10 were not included in the cross validation simulated hydrographs generally agree well with measured flow with the exception of storm 9 this is also the outlier in fig 9 as well as the very small storm 10 little difference between optimal model runs and cross validation results is evident 3 2 runoff and transmission losses fig 11 compares simulated runoff top and transmission losses tl bottom based on four urbanization scenarios assuming natural channels and no stormwater detention ponds in the basin cumulative runoff and tl values for the entire 10 year period are listed on the right the comparison reveals large inter annual variability the wettest years 6 8 contributed 44 59 of cumulative runoff depending on land use scenario while dry years 2 4 5 9 contributed almost no runoff cumulatively estimated transmission losses in all ephemeral channels were between 64 and 81 of total runoff reaching the basin outlet depending on the urbanization scenario it is noteworthy that during some years estimated annual tl exceeded runoff see for example year 5 2040 scenario both runoff and tl increased with increasing urbanization comparing pre urbanized and projected 2040 conditions fig 11 cumulative runoff increased nearly 5 fold over the ten year study period while cumulative tl increased nearly 4 fold fig 12 compares estimated annual tl for 2010 urbanization and ponds based on four different channel treatment scenarios over the 10 year period of analysis simulated tl decreased drastically with increasing channel lining the overall decrease compared to all natural channels dark brown was 31 with the lower 5 km of the main channel lined brown 55 with the lower 10 km lined tan and 73 with the lower 15 km lined white fig 13 shows that detention ponds have a minimal effect on transmission losses based on the 2040 urbanization scenario with all natural channels overall tl only increased slightly 7 when comparing the scenario with no ponds dark green and the future pond scenario white it is noteworthy that for some years transmission losses for scenarios with ponds were slightly less than the no pond alternative see for example year 5 table 2 lists average tl i e the mean value based on ten years of data for various combinations of urbanization pond and channel treatment scenarios also included is the estimated domestic water use in the study area for the years 2010 2030 and 2040 assuming per capita usage of 238 l per day city of rio rancho personal communication depending on the scenario average annual tl can account for 2 8 10 2 of domestic use in 2010 1 5 7 2 in 2030 and 2 2 7 0 in 2040 the highest values correspond to model scenarios with natural channels the lowest tl values result from model runs where 15 km of the channel are lined 4 discussion this study demonstrates that management of ephemeral channels in urbanizing environments can have a profound impact on transmission loss and subsequent groundwater recharge the following sections of this paper first discuss transmission loss dynamics and impacts of urbanization and stormwater infrastructure at the new mexico study site subsequently larger implications that can help inform management decisions in similar dryland environments are identified finally limitations of this work are discussed along with areas of future research 4 1 new mexico study site results from the new mexico study site show that a substantial portion of runoff originating at the subbasin level infiltrates into permeable ephemeral channels before reaching the outlet of the watershed similar to findings from other dryland areas goodrich et al 2004 scanlon et al 2006 shanafield and cook 2014 transmission losses in the study area therefore have the potential to contribute to aquifer recharge in a meaningful way simulated runoff and transmission losses both increased substantially with increasing urbanization fig 11 increase in runoff can be attributed mainly to the increase in compacted and impervious surfaces associated with urbanization this causes an increase in the frequency of runoff events ladson et al 2006 as well as an increase in runoff from a given event compared to pre urbanized conditions shuster et al 2005 in the study area model scenarios indicate that only 38 of storm events would have resulted in runoff reaching the watershed outlet under pre urbanized conditions as opposed to 69 81 and 94 under 2010 2030 and 2040 conditions respectively increase in transmission losses with urbanization assuming unlined channels is related to the increased frequency and duration of flow present in ephemeral channels flow duration is positively correlated with transmission losses because longer contact of runoff with permeable channel beds increases the cumulative amount of water infiltrated findings by acworth et al 2021 from an arid watershed in australia show that the cumulative response of small runoff events can result in more recharge than a single event of large magnitude this suggests that flow duration is more important than event magnitude one might suspect that ponds increase transmission losses because they temporarily store runoff and release it at a reduced rate surprisingly model result indicate that this is not the case fig 13 shows that ponds have minimal impact on transmission losses cumulative tl are only slightly higher for scenarios with ponds compared to the model run without any stormwater detention facilities pond dimensions and outlet structures in the study area are configured to reduce peak outflow during the flood control design storm the 100 year or 1 annual chance storm with a 24 hour duration city of rio rancho personal communication the main purpose is to protect downstream areas from flash flooding per guidance from the new mexico office of the state engineer a water right is required if water is impounded by a flood control facility for more than 96 h all flood control ponds and dams in the study area are therefore designed to drain in 96 h or less as a result ponds reduce peak discharge but they typically do not substantially increase the duration of flow this is illustrated in fig s3 supplementary materials which shows inflow shaded grey and outflow hydrographs black for one selected pond during ten storm events the comparison shows that while the pond reduces peak flows total duration of the inflow and outflow hydrographs are similar in most cases this is true for nearly all stormwater detention ponds in the basin while ponds have minimal impact on transmission losses the effects of channel lining are substantial fig 12 the impact is largest in the downstream most portion of the arroyo and decreases moving upstream this is due to a combination of three factors 1 channel width generally decreases with distance from the watershed outlet that means less channel area per unit length is available for infiltration 2 flows are more frequent in the lower portion of the watershed due to a larger contributing area 3 urbanized area is limited to the lower portion of the watershed this also increases the frequency of runoff events in the lower portion of the basin fig 14 shows cumulative flow duration during the 10 year study period based on the 2010 urbanization and pond scenario cumulative flow duration ranged from 6 to 256 h the shortest durations red less than 50 h can be observed for tributaries in the upper watershed flow duration generally increases moving downstream with the longest durations blue more than 200 h occurring in the lower 15 km of the main stem interestingly flow duration decreases in the downstream direction for some channel segments this phenomenon can be attributed to infiltration of much or all runoff as it moves downstream during many of the smaller runoff events 4 2 larger implications lessons from the new mexico study site can be applied to inform management decisions for ephemeral channels in other urbanizing dryland areas this study confirms that transmission losses have the potential to contribute to aquifer recharge in a meaningful way corroborating findings from numerous studies in arid and semiarid systems goodrich et al 2004 coes and pool 2005 constantz et al 2002 mckenna and sala 2018 shanafield and cook 2014 to preserve this important function it is imperative to protect ephemeral channels from lining when arroyos are decoupled from the underlying aquifers their ability to infiltrate water is lost also lost are a host of other important ecological functions and ecosystem services levick et al 2008 preservation of ephemeral channels requires foresight and planning in urbanizing areas land is a finite and valuable resource if seen as mere conduits for runoff ephemeral streams will likely be transformed into concrete channels or pipes the hydraulically most efficient means for moving water downstream while occupying the smallest possible footprint a prime example from the city of albuquerque in central new mexico can be seen in fig 2 similar patterns can be observed in cities around the world scattered urbanization or urban sprawl can have comparable effects by slowly encroaching upon natural channels as a result hardened elements are often the only option for protecting public and private infrastructure from flooding and erosion strategies for preserving focused infiltration in ephemeral channels include designation of a buffer zone to allow space for lateral migration in cases where existing infrastructure is already encroaching strategic use of bank armoring and grade control structures to limit lateral and vertical movement is preferrable to channel lining schoener and stone 2020a water governance systems are critical for preservation but have in general paid less attention to ephemeral streams compared to their perennial counterparts fritz et al 2017 one example of local governance includes a resolution adopted by a new mexico flood control agency that requires approval by the agency s board of directors before ephemeral channel beds within their jurisdictional area can be lined see supplementary materials pg 5 6 this example is a direct result of the findings reported in this study and may be used as a model in other dryland areas in cases where urbanization pressures are high and not all ephemeral channels can be protected it might be necessary to prioritize certain reaches this study suggests that flow duration may be useful as a proxy for recharge in areas with limited flow data streamflow frequency and duration is easier to monitor than discharge in flashy erosive systems for example using simple temperature or electrical conductivity sensors constantz et al 2001 bhamjee et al 2016 based on findings from this study the author argues that preserving channels in as natural a state as possible constitutes a management approach that should be considered equivalent to a managed aquifer recharge strategy this approach is novel because traditionally mar strategies have been associated with built infrastructure such as infiltration basins and galleries dry wells or injections wells dillon et al 2019 niswonger et al 2017 instead of constructing infrastructure to enhance infiltration protection of ephemeral channels and particularly highly permeable channel beds preserves their natural function with increased urbanization and runoff focused infiltration and subsequent groundwater recharge also increases making preservation of ephemeral channels a viable mar strategy 4 3 limitations and future work this study uses transmission losses as a proxy for groundwater recharge the regional aquifer in the study area is comprised of basin and valley fill sediments deposited in the rio grande rift ranging in thickness from about 700 m to more than 4000 m in some areas thorn et al 1993 a 1996 study by hawley and whitworth 1996 identified likely sources of aquifer recharge they recognized channel infiltration in ephemeral arroyos as one such mechanism and identified the montoyas arroyo in the study area as a likely recharge reach based on channel sediments and their connectivity to underlying productive aquifer strata test borings drilled in the arroyo to a depth of 15 m show channel sediments dominated by sand schoener 2017 in 2008 the water authority in albuquerque just south of the study area conducted a pilot study using a 0 8 km stretch of the bear canyon arroyo for managed aquifer recharge they released reclaimed wastewater into the arroyo at a controlled rate and tracked water movement through the 150 m thick vadose zone moore et al 2008 miller et al 2021 based on extensive monitoring using a variety of sensors they concluded that 97 of the water released into the channel reached the aquifer in approximately 55 days with only 1 lost to evaporation at the new mexico study site using transmission losses as a proxy for groundwater recharge therefore appears to be a reasonable simplification however connectivity of ephemeral channels with their underlying aquifer should be evaluated on a case by case basis before applying this approach to other areas particularly if channels are underlain by strata of low permeability acworth et al 2021 villeneuve et al 2015 future work should establish long term monitoring of water movement through the vadose zone from the channel bed to the aquifer the hydrologic model built for this study was calibrated based on 2010 land use conditions which include urbanized and non urbanized areas in the watershed results for pre urbanized conditions as well as projected future land use 2030 2040 conditions are based on model scenarios that could not be validated using measured runoff data results for those scenarios are therefore associated with increased uncertainty finally this paper focuses solely on the quantity of runoff and transmission losses one important consideration not addressed as part of this work is related to water quality runoff from urban areas may contain various pollutants future research should address water quality dynamics between runoff and aquifer recharge at the new mexico study site specifically and any site using urban runoff to augment groundwater supply in general 5 conclusions this study evaluated the impacts of urbanization and stormwater infrastructure on ephemeral channel transmission losses tl in a 142 km2 watershed in central new mexico transmission losses are an important pathway for groundwater recharge in the study area and other arid and semiarid basins around the world a hydrologic model hec hms was built for the watershed and calibrated based on seven years of precipitation and discharge data validation results show good model performance with respect to runoff volume r2 0 85 and overall hydrograph shape nse 0 5 for seven out of eight simulations the model was then used to simulate the individual and combined impacts of land use change urbanization and stormwater infrastructure ponds channel lining on runoff and transmission losses over a ten year period based on observed storm events results show high inter annual runoff variability with the two wettest years contributing 44 59 of the 10 year total and dry years resulting in nearly no runoff both runoff and tl increased with urbanization assuming natural ephemeral channels tl comprised 64 81 of runoff reaching the basin outlet and 7 10 of domestic water use in the basin depending on urbanization scenario stormwater detention ponds had minimal impact on tl however lining the lower 5 10 and 15 km of ephemeral streams reduced tl by 31 55 and 73 over the ten year study period transmission losses have the potential to contribute to groundwater recharge in a meaningful way to preserve this important function in urbanizing areas it is imperative to protect ephemeral channels from lining this requires foresight and planning since land in urbanizing areas is a finite and valuable resource and channel lining often occurs in response to urban encroachment preservation of ephemeral channels should be considered a viable strategy for managed aquifer recharge in urbanizing areas future work should establish long term monitoring of water movement through the vadose zone to better understand dynamics between tl and aquifer recharge as more urban runoff is used for recharge potential impacts on groundwater quality must also be evaluated

management transmission loss urbanization 1 introduction approximately 30 of the earth s land surface is characterized as arid or semiarid whitford 2002 including much of the western united states these dryland areas feature low and highly variable annual rainfall and evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation water supply in arid and semiarid regions is particularly sensitive to variability and climate change mehran et al 2017 liu et al 2021 increasing temperatures are expected to alter the amount of precipitation falling as snow along with the timing of runoff qin et al 2020 in a warming world timing and quantity of surface water supplies depending on snowmelt runoff will therefore become increasingly unreliable richter et al 2013 estimate that 50 of all cities worldwide with

that the 19 year period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest in 500 years and the second driest in over 1200 years given increasing uncertainty of snowmelt driven surface water supply communities may have to rely increasingly on groundwater resources already groundwater is estimated to supply approximately 40 of agricultural and residential demand in the u s southwest maupin et al 2014 globally groundwater exploitation has grown rapidly over the last six decades dillon et al 2019 in some areas this has led to substantial depletion and increased demand will exacerbate overexploitation scanlon et al 2012 sources of groundwater recharge both natural and artificial will therefore become increasingly important artificial recharge ar or managed aquifer recharge mar encompasses strategies used to enhance aquifer storage and restore groundwater levels in water scarce areas dillon et al 2019 stefan and ansems 2018 niswonger et al 2017 mar refers to the intentional recharge of groundwater either for later recovery or for environmental benefits a variety of methods are used for mar including infiltration basins and galleries dry wells and injections wells a detailed description of methods and examples are given by dillon et al 2019 as well as in a recent report by the u s environmental protection agency usepa 2021 water sources used for mar range from natural streamflow and runoff dewatered groundwater from mining treated sewage effluent and excess supply from desalination dillon et al 2019 increasingly stormwater originating from urban areas is being considered as a source of recharge usepa 2021 natural recharge in many arid and semiarid areas only occurs where runoff is concentrated such as in ephemeral channels or depressions and playas constantz et al 2002 coes and pool 2005 mckenna and sala 2018 diffuse recharge in inter channel areas is limited hogan et al 2004 ephemeral channels are ubiquitous in dryland watersheds they only flow briefly following rainfall in their catchment and their channel bed always remains above the aquifer levick et al 2008 estimate that 59 of all streams in the conterminous u s are ephemeral or intermittent in the u s southwest they comprise 79 94 of all water courses goodrich et al 2018 despite their important role for groundwater recharge ephemeral channels in urbanizing areas have often been seen as mere conduits for runoff larger streams in growing cities are routinely straightened and lined with concrete to limit meandering and erosion goodrich et al 2018 thus making more land available for development based on a study in hamilton county ohio u s roy et al 2009 estimated that more than 90 of ephemeral headwater channels had been lost due to urbanization an example from new mexico u s can be seen in fig 2 shown on top is aerial imagery form the city of albuquerque from the year 1954 a dense network of ephemeral channels drain runoff from the sandia mountains westward towards the rio grande six decades later in 2014 nearly the entire area is urbanized most of the channel network has been converted to storm drain or lined with concrete lining piping or filling in ephemeral streams eliminates focused infiltration and recharge along with a host of other ecological functions and ecosystem services levick et al 2008 schoener and stone 2020a the present study aims to address an important disconnect in the published literature on the one hand much has been written about ar and mar strategies stefan and ansems 2018 niswonger et al 2017 including in urban environments page et al 2018 knapton et al 2019 these typically incorporate some form of structural modification to enhance recharge such as infiltration ponds wells or in channel modifications standen et al 2020 dillon et al 2019 on the other hand the importance of focused infiltration or transmission losses in ephemeral channels for natural groundwater recharge is well documented goodrich et al 2004 shanafield and cook 2014 scanlon et al 2006 summarized results from approximately 140 studies conducted in arid and semiarid regions across the globe and found that while recharge rates estimated over large areas are relatively low 0 2 35 mm y 1 recharge due to transmission losses in ephemeral streams can be many orders of magnitude higher up to 720 000 mm y 1 numerous studies demonstrate the importance of transmission losses for the water balance in dryland watersheds around the world schwartz 2016 showed that 21 86 of flood volumes infiltrated into the streambed alluvium during runoff events in a hyperarid watershed in southern israel gheith and sultan 2002 estimated that groundwater recharge through transmission losses constituted 21 31 or rainfall volume during a storm event in the eastern

alluvial aquifer tang et al 2001 used chemical and isotopic methods to analyze the spatial distribution of recharge in the united arab emirates and found that transmission losses in ephemeral channels wadis are an important contributor mcmahon et al 2008 studied a reach of the diamantina river in the lake eyre basin australia and found average transmission losses equal to 77 of total flood volume lange 2005 reported that transmission losses ranged from 29 to 94 of the upstream inflow volume for a reach of the kuiseb river in namibia in a study conducted in the southwestern u s during 2001 and 2002 coes and pool 2005 estimated that transmission losses in ephemeral channels accounted for 11 19 of annual recharge in urbanizing areas an important intersection exists between natural and managed aquifer recharge without the need for structural modifications ephemeral channels provide effective corridors for focused infiltration and recharge simultaneously stormwater runoff supplies additional water for potential recharge in the context of urbanization management decisions that aim to preserve transmission losses as a pathway for recharge should therefore be considered a mar strategy discussion of this important consideration is largely missing from the literature this is the research gap the present study aims to address the paper uses a large urbanizing watershed in semiarid central new mexico as a case study a hydrologic model for the basin was built and parameters estimated based on previous work conducted in the watershed schoener 2017 schoener and stone 2019 2020b the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the dynamics of runoff and transmission losses in the basin under real world rainfall conditions based on ten years of precipitation data 2 assess the

decisions on transmission losses an important source of groundwater recharge in dryland watersheds findings can be applied regionally to inform management decisions for ephemeral channels in other

north of the city of albuquerque the watershed encompasses portions of the city of rio rancho approximately 20 of the basin is urbanized mostly in the lower and central part of the catchment soils are formed in eolian material and alluvium under natural conditions they support semi desert shrub and grassland vegetation annual precipitation is highly variable and ranges from 100 to 400 mm with an average of approximately 250 mm the study area is affected by the north american monsoon system adams and comrie 1997 heavy rainfall associated with summer thunderstorms frequently leads to localized flash flooding higgins et al 1997 runoff drains through a network of ephemeral streams called arroyos ephemeral channels only convey runoff for short periods often mere hours following intense rain events discharge at the outlet of the watershed was monitored continuously from 2008 to 2014 ten runoff events were recorded with a cumulative flow duration of 52 h over the entire 7 year period fig 3 shows an overview map of the study area with major ephemeral channels indicated in red channel elevations range from 1550 m to 1970 m above mean sea level a m s l in comparison the average groundwater level in the regional aquifer underlying the watershed is approximately 1510 m a m s l usgs 2021 the estimated thickness of the vadose zone beneath ephemeral channels therefore ranges from 460 m in the upper watershed to 40 m near the watershed outlet 2 2 precipitation and runoff data during the period with discharge measurements 2008 2014 10 runoff producing storms were observed in the study area table 1 summarizes precipitation and runoff characteristics for each storm event 5 min runoff data usgs 08329650 at the watershed outlet were obtained from the usgs new mexico water science center personal communication and from the southern sandoval county arroyo flood control authority precipitation data from 11 tipping bucket rain gages see fig s1 supplementary information were obtained from the southern sandoval county arroyo flood control authority precipitation gages onset computer bourne massachusetts measure rainfall in increments of 0 254 mm at a 5 min temporal resolution to fill gaps in rain gage coverage radar derived quantitative precipitation estimates qpe were obtained from the national centers for environmental information https www ncdc noaa gov nexradinv qpe products provide an estimate of ground accumulated rainfall based on a relationship between reflectivity and rainfall rate noaa 2005 qpe products are not bias corrected using ground measurements nexrad level iii dta 172 data in raster format were used for this study at 37 locations see fig s1 supplementary materials point values were extracted from underlying nexrad rasters at a temporal resolution of 5 min using arcgis software esri redlands ca subsequently bias correction was performed by multiplying each time step with a bias adjustment factor b 1 b median g i r i i 1 2 n g i 5 mm where gi is the rain gage measured cumulative precipitation for a given storm event at location i ri is the radar derived cumulative precipitation at location i and n is the number of locations with rain gage and radar data the bias adjustment method is similar to the procedure described by bradley et al 2002 for hourly data and the single parameter rain gage adjustment noaa 2005 the method has been used successfully in the study area schoener and stone 2020b only data from locations that received more than 5 mm of rainfall for a given storm were used to calculate b including sites with very small cumulative rainfall amounts can lead to skewed values of b since small absolute differences between gi and ri can lead to large g r ratios gage and radar derived point precipitation data were then interpolated to rainfall grids spatial resolution 500 500 m temporal resolution 5 min using the inverse distance squared method in the gageinterp program maps showing the spatial distribution of cumulative precipitation for all 10 storms can be seen in fig 10 fig 4 compares intensity duration frequency curves grey for the study area with observed precipitation for the location with the highest cumulative rainfall for each of the storm events listed in table 1 elements of 2 storms exceeded the 100 year recurrence interval ri see fig 4 solid blue lines 4 storms fell between the 10 and 100 year ri dashed red lines 3 storms fell between the 1 and 10 year ri dotted black lines and one storm dash dotted purple line was smaller than the 1 year ri it should be emphasized that storm data presented in fig 4 does not represent basin average rainfall values but rather precipitation at the most intense location of any given storm event storms 1 10 table 1 were used for calibration validation of the hydrologic model 2 3 additional storms prism daily precipitation data prism 2021 for the study area were used to identify additional storms where at least 20 of the study area received 10 mm of rainfall or more this threshold was used to exclude very localized events as well as storms with low precipitation intensities unlikely to generate runoff 22 additional events were identified for the 10 year period 2008 2017 a summary table including storm dates is contained under supplementary information table s1 maps showing the spatial distribution of cumulative precipitation can be seen in fig s2 rain gage data and radar based precipitation estimates were obtained using the sources described for calibration storms 500 500 m 5 min precipitation grids for the study area were prepared using the same approach described above 2 4 hydrologic model numerous different hydrologic modeling programs capable of simulating channel transmission losses sometimes referred to as seepage exist including the soil water assessment tool swat the basin characterization model bcm the storm water management model swmm and the hydrologic modeling system hec hms for this study the latter was chosen for the following reasons 1 hec hms can simulate runoff from natural areas as well as urbanized subbasins including impervious surfaces and drainage infrastructure allowing analyses of future urbanization scenarios 2 the simplicity of the model makes it suitable for use in data sparse regions such as the study area 3 a previous study by the author demonstrated that hec hms performs well for simulating transmission losses in ephemeral channels of the study basin schoener 2017 4 the model is widely used throughout the study region e g nmdot 2018 adot 2014 pcrfcd 2021 findings from this study therefore have regional significance for hydrologic practice all hydrologic modeling was carried out using hec hms version 4 2 1 the watershed was divided into 143 subbasins watershed and subbasin boundaries were delineated using hec geo hms software based on a digital elevation model dem created from light detection and ranging data with a vertical resolution of 0 6 m boundaries were modified to accommodate desired analysis points and achieve subbasins with relatively uniform land use characteristics analysis points were selected for tributary confluences major existing culverts and road crossings and pond locations questionable boundaries were verified in the field especially at locations where graded roads influence flow paths as implemented in this study the hydrologic model has three major components 1 when precipitation reaches the land surface it is divided into infiltration and infiltration excess overland flow 2 overland flow is transformed into runoff hydrographs for each subbasin 3 runoff hydrographs are routed through ponds and ephemeral channels to the watershed outlet each model component is described in detail in sections 2 4 1 2 4 4 below although transmission losses are simulated as part of the reach routing procedure they are described in a separate subsection 2 4 4 because of their crucial role in this study 2 4 1 rainfall loss and excess in many dryland watersheds including the study area infiltration excess overland flow is the dominant mechanism for runoff generation cools et al 2012 huang et al 2016 huo et al 2020 to calculate excess precipitation directly connected impervious areas dcia were first quantified for each subbasin dcia were modeled as percent impervious in hec hms the model converts all precipitation falling on dcia to runoff major sources of dcia such as commercial areas and paved roads were digitized manually based on color digital aerial photographs acquired in the spring of 2010 during leaf off conditions residential roof areas were quantified based on spatial data of building footprint obtained from the city of rio rancho personal communication an average driveway size of 65 m2 was assumed for each residential lot 2010 land use conditions were used for the entire calibration and validation period 2008 2014 this simplifying assumption appears reasonable because urban growth in the watershed practically ceased following the housing crash of 2008 and no substantial increases occurred until after 2014 losses for pervious areas were modeled using the green and ampt infiltration model green and ampt 1912 2 f t k 1 θ sat θ i ψ f t where ft mm h 1 is the potential infiltration or loss rate at time t k mm h 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity θi and θsat m3 m 3 are the initial and saturated volumetric water contents respectively ψ mm is the wetting front suction and ft mm is the cumulative infiltration at time t fig 5 shows soil textures in the study area obtained from the natural resources conservation service nrcs web soil survey https websoilsurvey sc egov usda gov saturated hydraulic conductivity k was estimated based on rainfall simulator experiments carried out in the study area by schoener and stone 2019 fig 5 black circle based on their results k values of 40 mm h 1 were used for undisturbed soils categorized as loamy sands fig 5 yellow for compacted or disturbed areas as well as sandy loams and sandy clay loams in the upper watershed see fig 5 orange and brown a lower rate of k 20 mm h 1 was applied for subbasins containing both soil types area weighted average values were calculated saturated volumetric water content was estimated based on in situ soil testing conducted at 18 test sites throughout the watershed fig 5 blue square to determine values of θsat a steel sleeve diameter 60 cm was inserted into the soil at each site to a depth of 5 cm the soil was saturated with 7 5 cm of water and a core sample ams inc american falls id of the top 7 5 cm was retrieved after all water had infiltrated moisture content was then determined by drying average θsat was 0 28 m3 m 3 with values at individual sites ranging from 0 19 to 0 35 m3 m 3 no systematic difference based on soil texture was evident the average value was therefore applied to the entire watershed initial water content at the onset of a storm event was estimated using the method introduced by schoener and stone 2020b for the study area antecedent soil moisture θi m3 m 3 was inferred from precipitation during the 13 day period preceding the day of interest 3 θ i 0 0075 t 1 13 p t 0 66 t 0 0216 θ i 0 12 where pt is the cumulative rainfall mm during day t pt during the 13 day period required for equation 3 was based on radar derived precipitation estimates obtained from the national centers for environmental information https www ncdc noaa gov nexradinv wetting front suction ψ mm was calibrated based on measured rainfall runoff data see section 2 6 below 2 4 2 transforming excess precipitation to a runoff hydrograph excess precipitation was converted to runoff hydrographs using the modified clark model kull and feldman 1998 as a transform the model was selected because it is the only option available in hec hms that allows for the use of gridded rainfall data underlying the modclark transform is a gridded representation of the watershed each grid cell has a specified distance from the basin outlet which is scaled by the time of concentration assigned to the subbasin usace 2000 2013 a linear reservoir model accounts for storage effects within the subbasin model parameters time of concentration tc storage coefficient r were estimated based on spatial data and field surveys a 500 500 m grid for the basin was prepared using the hec geohms extension for arcgis esri redlands ca based on the digital elevation model of the study area 2 4 3 routing 48 ponds attenuate flow from urbanized areas and were included in the model pond parameters and dimensions were collected from corresponding engineering documents and verified in the field pond routing was simulated using rating curves elevation storage and storage discharge curves ponds were assumed to be dry at the start of each simulation the model contains a total of 133 routing reaches reaches were delineated in arcgis based on the 0 6 m dem slopes and channel bottom widths were estimated based on the dem and aerial photographs channel reaches were modeled using idealized cross sections that most closely resembled the natural geometry of the reach trapezoidal and rectangular roughness coefficients manning s n values were estimated based on aerial photographs and field investigation the muskingum cunge method was used for flood routing in hec hms 2 4 4 channel transmission losses in a detailed study conducted in the montoyas watershed schoener 2017 quantified transmission losses by calculating a reach water balance for major conveyances they concluded that transmission losses can be simulated successfully using a constant percolation channel loss rate of 38 mm h 1 the same approach was adopted in the present study losses in all routing reaches corresponding to natural channels were modeled using a constant loss rate of 38 mm h 1 corresponding reaches are indicated as red lines in fig 3 they have a combined length of 74 km an average channel bottom width of 29 m range 9 83 m and a total area of 159 ha major ephemeral channels or arroyos therefore make up approximately 1 of the watershed area a recent example demonstrating the important role of transmission losses in the study area can be seen in fig 6 on july 5 2018 a thunderstorm produced brief heavy rain over part of the watershed more than 45 mm of precipitation fell in the upper portion of the basin while the rest of the watershed received less than 10 mm of rainfall the duration of the storm was approximately one hour with peak intensities of more than 90 mm h 1 localized flash flooding in one ephemeral tributary was captured by a time lapse camera selected images in 20 min time increments are included in fig 6 runoff at the site commenced at 18 30 local time and ceased by 20 30 observations by the author confirmed that during this storm event only a small amount of flow reached the outlet of the watershed most of the runoff infiltrated into the permeable channel bed as the flash flood moved downstream this is evident in the hydrographs measured at two temporary gaging stations red squares flow 1 and 2 the red hydrograph fig 6 top represents flow at the confluence of upstream tributaries flow 1 comparatively little runoff reached the station near the watershed outlet flow 2 black hydrograph 2 5 model scenarios all 32 storm events 10 calibration storms and 22 additional storms see table 1 and table s1 respectively covering a 10 year period 2008 2017 were used to assess the impact of numerous land use and stormwater infrastructure scenarios on runoff and transmission losses in the watershed under real world conditions fig 7 shows four different urbanization scenarios for the study area whereby the urbanized area is indicated in blue pre urbanized conditions are shown on the left moving to the right conditions correspond to the years 2010 2030 and 2040 based on statistics from the u s census bureau 2020 approximately 32 100 people lived in the watershed in 2010 with an average household size of 2 72 the year 2020 was not included in the analysis because urban development slowed considerably in the decade following the 2008 housing crisis and results from a 2020 scenario would have been very similar to 2010 parameter estimation for the 2010 scenario is described in detail in section 2 4 above the pre urbanized scenario assumes no urbanization is present in the watershed loss model parameters were therefore estimated based on soil texture alone for future scenarios 2030 and 2040 the following assumptions were used 1 nearly the entire watershed is platted and zoned for residential development city of rio rancho personal communication based on average lot size it was assumed that any new urban development would be single family residential at a density of 10 dwelling units per hectare 2 following historic trends it was assumed that urbanization would progress from downstream to upstream 3 for the 2030 scenario the projected population numbers for the study area were estimated at 58 600 this was based on an annual growth rate of 4 equal to the average rate the city of rio rancho experienced during the period 1990 2010 4 using the same rational watershed population for the 2040 scenario was estimated at 87 900 5 assuming an average household size of 2 72 and a development density of 10 dwelling units per hectare the increase in urbanized area for the 2030 and 2040 scenarios was estimated at approximately 970 ha and 2050 ha respectively compared to 2010 conditions based on the assumptions above projected land use in the watershed was mapped in arcgis esri redlands ca for 2030 and 2040 conditions and loss model parameters for model subbasins were estimated following the approach described in section 2 4 above in addition to urbanization the impact of drainage infrastructure on runoff and transmission losses in the watershed was assessed three stormwater detention pond alternatives were considered 1 no ponds 2 2010 conditions i e stormwater detention ponds present in the watershed during the calibration validation period 3 future conditions assuming peak flows from future development will be restricted to 2010 conditions at the subbasin level for the 1 24 hour annual chance storm future conditions were simulated by adding hypothetical ponds to subbasins with an increase in urbanized area and adjusting storage volume and outlet dimensions until peak discharge was within 10 of the 2010 model run increasing urbanization often leads to encroachment on ephemeral channels particularly because infrequent flows are not perceived as a danger when arroyos do convey runoff substantial bank erosion can occur in a short period of time if not given sufficient room to meander erosion can quickly threaten houses roads and other urban infrastructure in urban areas arroyos are therefore often converted into concrete lined channels to assess the impact of channel lining on runoff and transmission losses in the study area four different scenarios were considered all arroyos are natural and lining of the lower 5 10 and 15 km of the arroyo fig 7 left indicates the 5 10 and 15 km marks long the main stem of the montoyas arroyo measured from the basin outlet no transmission losses occur in lined channel sections 2 6 model calibration and validation three model parameters were calibrated time of concentration tc storage coefficient r and wetting front suction ψ tc and r which affect hydrograph shape and timing were calibrated by modifying initial estimates of tc and r for all subbasins in increments of 5 and determining the optimal parameter combination based on maximum nash sutcliff efficiency nse for the largest observed runoff event see table 1 storm 6 that affected the entire watershed nse is calculated as 4 nse 1 i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 where yi obs is the i th observation yi sim is the i th simulated value n is the number of observations and ymean is the arithmetic average of observed values nse values range from to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect fit between observed and modeled hydrographs nash and sutcliffe 1970 model simulations with nse 0 5 are generally accepted as satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 wetting front suction ψ mm was then calibrated based on measured rainfall runoff data for ten observed storms see table 1 values of ψ for all subbasins were varied between 5 and 100 mm in increments of 5 mm 40 simulations for each storm the plausible range of ψ values was based on rainfall simulator experiments conducted by the author in the study area schoener and stone 2019 optimal values of ψ for each storm were determined based on maximum nse and minimum runoff volume error with equal weights assigned to each metric runoff volume error is calculated as the difference between measured and simulated runoff volume optimal ψ values were then correlated with antecedent soil moisture θi for each event the emerging relationship was used to scale ψ based on initial conditions the performance of this method was validated using observed data due to the limited number of runoff events the data could not be split into a training and testing set leave one out cross validation was therefore employed for model validation with this method the parameter of the prediction function in this case ψ is trained on all data except for one point a prediction is then made for that one point and tested by comparing simulated and observed flows this process was repeated n times where n is the number of observations in the data set in addition to nse two other metrics were used to assess model performance the mean absolute error mae 5 mae 1 n i 1 n y i obs y i sim and the root mean square error rmse 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation results optimized wetting front suction ψ values are plotted against antecedent soil moisture θi in fig 8 model calibration revealed that during two events storms 1 and 10 model performance was independent of wetting front suction both storms were largely limited to the lower urbanized portion of the watershed and runoff likely originated from impervious surfaces only storms 2 9 were therefore used for model calibration and cross validation fig 8 shows a strong linear correlation r2 0 85 between ψ and antecedent moisture whereby optimal wetting front suction decreases with increasing θi fig 9 shows results from the 8 fold cross validation using data from storms 2 9 the scatter plots compare measured and simulated runoff volumes left and flow durations right performance metrics are included below each chart the comparison illustrates that the model performed well with respect to runoff volume r2 0 85 with one exception see fig 9 black arrow predicted flow duration closely matched measured values seven out of eight simulations resulted in nse values exceeding 0 5 indicating good agreement between simulated and measured hydrographs detailed results for each storm are displayed in fig 10 maps show the spatial distribution of rainfall within the watershed whereby darker shading indicates higher precipitation adjacent to each rainfall map measured runoff is displayed with grey shading while simulated flows are shown as line graphs solid black lines represent simulations with optimal ψ values dotted red lines show cross validation results please note that storms 1 and 10 were not included in the cross validation simulated hydrographs generally agree well with measured flow with the exception of storm 9 this is also the outlier in fig 9 as well as the very small storm 10 little difference between optimal model runs and cross validation results is evident 3 2 runoff and transmission losses fig 11 compares simulated runoff top and transmission losses tl bottom based on four urbanization scenarios assuming natural channels and no stormwater detention ponds in the basin cumulative runoff and tl values for the entire 10 year period are listed on the right the comparison reveals large inter annual variability the wettest years 6 8 contributed 44 59 of cumulative runoff depending on land use scenario while dry years 2 4 5 9 contributed almost no runoff cumulatively estimated transmission losses in all ephemeral channels were between 64 and 81 of total runoff reaching the basin outlet depending on the urbanization scenario it is noteworthy that during some years estimated annual tl exceeded runoff see for example year 5 2040 scenario both runoff and tl increased with increasing urbanization comparing pre urbanized and projected 2040 conditions fig 11 cumulative runoff increased nearly 5 fold over the ten year study period while cumulative tl increased nearly 4 fold fig 12 compares estimated annual tl for 2010 urbanization and ponds based on four different channel treatment scenarios over the 10 year period of analysis simulated tl decreased drastically with increasing channel lining the overall decrease compared to all natural channels dark brown was 31 with the lower 5 km of the main channel lined brown 55 with the lower 10 km lined tan and 73 with the lower 15 km lined white fig 13 shows that detention ponds have a minimal effect on transmission losses based on the 2040 urbanization scenario with all natural channels overall tl only increased slightly 7 when comparing the scenario with no ponds dark green and the future pond scenario white it is noteworthy that for some years transmission losses for scenarios with ponds were slightly less than the no pond alternative see for example year 5 table 2 lists average tl i e the mean value based on ten years of data for various combinations of urbanization pond and channel treatment scenarios also included is the estimated domestic water use in the study area for the years 2010 2030 and 2040 assuming per capita usage of 238 l per day city of rio rancho personal communication depending on the scenario average annual tl can account for 2 8 10 2 of domestic use in 2010 1 5 7 2 in 2030 and 2 2 7 0 in 2040 the highest values correspond to model scenarios with natural channels the lowest tl values result from model runs where 15 km of the channel are lined 4 discussion this study demonstrates that management of ephemeral channels in urbanizing environments can have a profound impact on transmission loss and subsequent groundwater recharge the following sections of this paper first discuss transmission loss dynamics and impacts of urbanization and stormwater infrastructure at the new mexico study site subsequently larger implications that can help inform management decisions in similar dryland environments are identified finally limitations of this work are discussed along with areas of future research 4 1 new mexico study site results from the new mexico study site show that a substantial portion of runoff originating at the subbasin level infiltrates into permeable ephemeral channels before reaching the outlet of the watershed similar to findings from other dryland areas goodrich et al 2004 scanlon et al 2006 shanafield and cook 2014 transmission losses in the study area therefore have the potential to contribute to aquifer recharge in a meaningful way simulated runoff and transmission losses both increased substantially with increasing urbanization fig 11 increase in runoff can be attributed mainly to the increase in compacted and impervious surfaces associated with urbanization this causes an increase in the frequency of runoff events ladson et al 2006 as well as an increase in runoff from a given event compared to pre urbanized conditions shuster et al 2005 in the study area model scenarios indicate that only 38 of storm events would have resulted in runoff reaching the watershed outlet under pre urbanized conditions as opposed to 69 81 and 94 under 2010 2030 and 2040 conditions respectively increase in transmission losses with urbanization assuming unlined channels is related to the increased frequency and duration of flow present in ephemeral channels flow duration is positively correlated with transmission losses because longer contact of runoff with permeable channel beds increases the cumulative amount of water infiltrated findings by acworth et al 2021 from an arid watershed in australia show that the cumulative response of small runoff events can result in more recharge than a single event of large magnitude this suggests that flow duration is more important than event magnitude one might suspect that ponds increase transmission losses because they temporarily store runoff and release it at a reduced rate surprisingly model result indicate that this is not the case fig 13 shows that ponds have minimal impact on transmission losses cumulative tl are only slightly higher for scenarios with ponds compared to the model run without any stormwater detention facilities pond dimensions and outlet structures in the study area are configured to reduce peak outflow during the flood control design storm the 100 year or 1 annual chance storm with a 24 hour duration city of rio rancho personal communication the main purpose is to protect downstream areas from flash flooding per guidance from the new mexico office of the state engineer a water right is required if water is impounded by a flood control facility for more than 96 h all flood control ponds and dams in the study area are therefore designed to drain in 96 h or less as a result ponds reduce peak discharge but they typically do not substantially increase the duration of flow this is illustrated in fig s3 supplementary materials which shows inflow shaded grey and outflow hydrographs black for one selected pond during ten storm events the comparison shows that while the pond reduces peak flows total duration of the inflow and outflow hydrographs are similar in most cases this is true for nearly all stormwater detention ponds in the basin while ponds have minimal impact on transmission losses the effects of channel lining are substantial fig 12 the impact is largest in the downstream most portion of the arroyo and decreases moving upstream this is due to a combination of three factors 1 channel width generally decreases with distance from the watershed outlet that means less channel area per unit length is available for infiltration 2 flows are more frequent in the lower portion of the watershed due to a larger contributing area 3 urbanized area is limited to the lower portion of the watershed this also increases the frequency of runoff events in the lower portion of the basin fig 14 shows cumulative flow duration during the 10 year study period based on the 2010 urbanization and pond scenario cumulative flow duration ranged from 6 to 256 h the shortest durations red less than 50 h can be observed for tributaries in the upper watershed flow duration generally increases moving downstream with the longest durations blue more than 200 h occurring in the lower 15 km of the main stem interestingly flow duration decreases in the downstream direction for some channel segments this phenomenon can be attributed to infiltration of much or all runoff as it moves downstream during many of the smaller runoff events 4 2 larger implications lessons from the new mexico study site can be applied to inform management decisions for ephemeral channels in other urbanizing dryland areas this study confirms that transmission losses have the potential to contribute to aquifer recharge in a meaningful way corroborating findings from numerous studies in arid and semiarid systems goodrich et al 2004 coes and pool 2005 constantz et al 2002 mckenna and sala 2018 shanafield and cook 2014 to preserve this important function it is imperative to protect ephemeral channels from lining when arroyos are decoupled from the underlying aquifers their ability to infiltrate water is lost also lost are a host of other important ecological functions and ecosystem services levick et al 2008 preservation of ephemeral channels requires foresight and planning in urbanizing areas land is a finite and valuable resource if seen as mere conduits for runoff ephemeral streams will likely be transformed into concrete channels or pipes the hydraulically most efficient means for moving water downstream while occupying the smallest possible footprint a prime example from the city of albuquerque in central new mexico can be seen in fig 2 similar patterns can be observed in cities around the world scattered urbanization or urban sprawl can have comparable effects by slowly encroaching upon natural channels as a result hardened elements are often the only option for protecting public and private infrastructure from flooding and erosion strategies for preserving focused infiltration in ephemeral channels include designation of a buffer zone to allow space for lateral migration in cases where existing infrastructure is already encroaching strategic use of bank armoring and grade control structures to limit lateral and vertical movement is preferrable to channel lining schoener and stone 2020a water governance systems are critical for preservation but have in general paid less attention to ephemeral streams compared to their perennial counterparts fritz et al 2017 one example of local governance includes a resolution adopted by a new mexico flood control agency that requires approval by the agency s board of directors before ephemeral channel beds within their jurisdictional area can be lined see supplementary materials pg 5 6 this example is a direct result of the findings reported in this study and may be used as a model in other dryland areas in cases where urbanization pressures are high and not all ephemeral channels can be protected it might be necessary to prioritize certain reaches this study suggests that flow duration may be useful as a proxy for recharge in areas with limited flow data streamflow frequency and duration is easier to monitor than discharge in flashy erosive systems for example using simple temperature or electrical conductivity sensors constantz et al 2001 bhamjee et al 2016 based on findings from this study the author argues that preserving channels in as natural a state as possible constitutes a management approach that should be considered equivalent to a managed aquifer recharge strategy this approach is novel because traditionally mar strategies have been associated with built infrastructure such as infiltration basins and galleries dry wells or injections wells dillon et al 2019 niswonger et al 2017 instead of constructing infrastructure to enhance infiltration protection of ephemeral channels and particularly highly permeable channel beds preserves their natural function with increased urbanization and runoff focused infiltration and subsequent groundwater recharge also increases making preservation of ephemeral channels a viable mar strategy 4 3 limitations and future work this study uses transmission losses as a proxy for groundwater recharge the regional aquifer in the study area is comprised of basin and valley fill sediments deposited in the rio grande rift ranging in thickness from about 700 m to more than 4000 m in some areas thorn et al 1993 a 1996 study by hawley and whitworth 1996 identified likely sources of aquifer recharge they recognized channel infiltration in ephemeral arroyos as one such mechanism and identified the montoyas arroyo in the study area as a likely recharge reach based on channel sediments and their connectivity to underlying productive aquifer strata test borings drilled in the arroyo to a depth of 15 m show channel sediments dominated by sand schoener 2017 in 2008 the water authority in albuquerque just south of the study area conducted a pilot study using a 0 8 km stretch of the bear canyon arroyo for managed aquifer recharge they released reclaimed wastewater into the arroyo at a controlled rate and tracked water movement through the 150 m thick vadose zone moore et al 2008 miller et al 2021 based on extensive monitoring using a variety of sensors they concluded that 97 of the water released into the channel reached the aquifer in approximately 55 days with only 1 lost to evaporation at the new mexico study site using transmission losses as a proxy for groundwater recharge therefore appears to be a reasonable simplification however connectivity of ephemeral channels with their underlying aquifer should be evaluated on a case by case basis before applying this approach to other areas particularly if channels are underlain by strata of low permeability acworth et al 2021 villeneuve et al 2015 future work should establish long term monitoring of water movement through the vadose zone from the channel bed to the aquifer the hydrologic model built for this study was calibrated based on 2010 land use conditions which include urbanized and non urbanized areas in the watershed results for pre urbanized conditions as well as projected future land use 2030 2040 conditions are based on model scenarios that could not be validated using measured runoff data results for those scenarios are therefore associated with increased uncertainty finally this paper focuses solely on the quantity of runoff and transmission losses one important consideration not addressed as part of this work is related to water quality runoff from urban areas may contain various pollutants future research should address water quality dynamics between runoff and aquifer recharge at the new mexico study site specifically and any site using urban runoff to augment groundwater supply in general 5 conclusions this study evaluated the impacts of urbanization and stormwater infrastructure on ephemeral channel transmission losses tl in a 142 km2 watershed in central new mexico transmission losses are an important pathway for groundwater recharge in the study area and other arid and semiarid basins around the world a hydrologic model hec hms was built for the watershed and calibrated based on seven years of precipitation and discharge data validation results show good model performance with respect to runoff volume r2 0 85 and overall hydrograph shape nse 0 5 for seven out of eight simulations the model was then used to simulate the individual and combined impacts of land use change urbanization and stormwater infrastructure ponds channel lining on runoff and transmission losses over a ten year period based on observed storm events results show high inter annual runoff variability with the two wettest years contributing 44 59 of the 10 year total and dry years resulting in nearly no runoff both runoff and tl increased with urbanization assuming natural ephemeral channels tl comprised 64 81 of runoff reaching the basin outlet and 7 10 of domestic water use in the basin depending on urbanization scenario stormwater detention ponds had minimal impact on tl however lining the lower 5 10 and 15 km of ephemeral streams reduced tl by 31 55 and 73 over the ten year study period transmission losses have the potential to contribute to groundwater recharge in a meaningful way to preserve this important function in urbanizing areas it is imperative to protect ephemeral channels from lining this requires foresight and planning since land in urbanizing areas is a finite and valuable resource and channel lining often occurs in response to urban encroachment preservation of ephemeral channels should be considered a viable strategy for managed aquifer recharge in urbanizing areas future work should establish long term monitoring of water movement through the vadose zone to better understand dynamics between tl and aquifer recharge as more urban runoff is used for recharge potential impacts on groundwater quality must also be evaluated
