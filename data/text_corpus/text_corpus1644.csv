hydrology study focus the study assesses the response of hundreds of shallow groundwater fed lakes to drought total lake area tla determined by classifying landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2018

preceding climatic effect groundwater time lag and evaluated against tla using bayesian regression analysis new hydrologic insight for the region tla in the nsh respond to the seasonal as well as long term climatic effects moderated by topography surface and subsurface hydrology a higher determination coefficient r2 and lower mean square error of tla at annual pdsi and decumpdsi illustrate the effect of long term climatic fluctuations and groundwater influence the evaporative losses from lakes are modulated by the lake groundwater exchange but the groundwater recharge has a longer response

decrease in rainfall duration amount and frequency causes drought to stress all components of a hydrologic system peters et al 2006 the effects of drought are hard to characterize as drought propagates and produces responses at multiple spatial and temporal scales for example a hydrologic system with hydraulic connectivity to groundwater produces a different response than a system without the connection peters et al 2006 however the effects of drought on the hydrological system can be characterized through the response of water bodies e g lakes lake properties such as surface area water level volume and salinity provide valuable information to assess the effect of drought on surface and groundwater hydrology tweed et al 2009 the change in lake surface area measured through remote sensing helps to monitor and assess the response of the hydrologic system to drought however studies that quantify the response of thousands of shallow closed groundwater fed lakes are limited lakes are sensitive indicators of drought as they respond rapidly and integrate information about changes in environmental landscape and atmospheric conditions adrian et al 2009 harris 1994 mason et al 1994 pham et al 2008 williamson et al 2008 the change in a lake s physical du et al 2012 li et al 2018 mason et al 1994 tang et al 2018 wang et al 2018b yan and zheng 2015 biological biota williamson et al 2008 or chemical salinity pham et al 2008 characteristics help to explain the hydrologic response to drought for example mason et al 1994 found that the lake water level and size surface area are sensitive to low frequency climate signals e g drought but are less sensitive to high frequency climate signals e g seasonal variations zhang et al 2009 found that the lake responses are defined by the size large lakes respond to long term climate effects but moderate the seasonal effects while smaller lakes are sensitive and responsive to seasonal effects in addition to climate the response of lakes is regulated by contribution of the lake groundwater exchange fig 1 geographic regions adrian et al 2009 liao et al 2013 tang et al 2018 yan and zheng 2015 lake position relative to regional groundwater flow smith and townley 2002 drought severity and hydraulic connectivity peters et al 2006 pham et al 2008 tweed et al 2009 lakes with hydraulic connection to groundwater also provide the opportunity to evaluate or monitor the groundwater level variations however most of the studies have been focused previously on areas where lake hydrology is defined by a combination of precipitation evaporation and overland flow fig 1a lakes water budget that include substantial surface water groundwater exchange fig 1b respond differently asthe influence of surface water evaporation on lake water levels is compensated partially by the groundwater inflow fluxes and are less studied however these fluxes commonly lag behind the evaporative losses because they originate from groundwater recharge over large surrounding areas with long travel times through the hosting aquifer time lag the time a precipitation event takes to travel through the subsurface and effect the lake area is often used for example the present volume number and stage of lakes were determined by backward time averaging of climate events gong et al 2015 langbein 1961 liu and schwartz 2012 mason et al 1994 previous studies have primarily focused on lake water level and salinity to characterize the response from drought gosselin et al 2000 tweed et al 2009 fewer studies use lakes area to characterize the response of drought on water bodies lakes area however is easily quantified using remote sensing that provides opportunity to monitor lakes in remote areas with sparse or no observations remote sensing is an easily implemented method to delineate water surface area using single band thresholding classification multi band and subpixel methods bijeesh and narasimhamurthy 2020 du et al 2012 thresholding the simplest method involves selecting a threshold value to delineate water from single bands however the method suffers from errors such as mixing of water pixels with shadows due to overlapping of spectral signatures frazier and page 2000 along with a subjective selection of threshold values xu 2006 the classification based method uses all or some of the available bands to label classes with algorithms such as nearest neighborhood maximum likelihood iso data k means support vector machine random forest and artificial neural network to identify water area paul et al 2018 the classification based method usually serves as a better method than thresholding but suffers from a mixed pixel effect frazier and page 2000 hybrid methods combine multiple methods to delineate and differentiate water areas for example multi band images when combined with image color space jiang et al 2012 principal component analysis bal√°zs et al 2018 or tasseled cap transformation hoan et al 2012 zhuang and chen 2018 provides better characterization of the water surface area the objective of this study was to characterize the spatial and temporal response of hundreds of shallow groundwater fed lakes in the nebraska sand hills nsh to drought the lakes area derived from landsat images are juxtaposed with drought indices and the responses of lakes area are assessed using bayesian ridge regression analysis 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the nsh is a drought sensitive grass stabilized eolian landscape located in a semi arid climate of western nebraska fig 2 drought in the nsh like in the entire united states u s are controlled by the low frequency sea surface temperature anomalies in the pacific and atlantic oceans mo and lettenmaier 2018 schubert et al 2004 the direct and indirect influence of the surface sea temperature anomalies in precipitation leads to a series of recurring and long lasting drought in the nsh the nsh is also vulnerable to drought due to semi arid climate eolian landscape human encroachment and climate change adane et al 2019 burbach and joeckel 2006 the nsh has temperatures ranging from 40 to 43 3 c with an average annual temperature of 8 9 c the annual average precipitation ranges from 450 mm in the west to 690 mm in the eastern part of nsh national climatic data center 2020 the annual average precipitation ranges from 450 mm in the west to 690 mm in the east national climatic data center 2020 because of its semi arid nature a large proportion of precipitation is lost as evapotranspiration 700 mm winter 1986 and the groundwater influx makes up the difference the sandy soils promote high infiltration with annual recharge rates of approximately 73 73 mm yr 1 varying between 40 85 mm yr 1 in the western and 200 85 mm yr 1 in the south eastern parts szilagyi et al 2011 the combination of climate topography soil and groundwater surface water interactions resulted in a total of 4700 and 2000 km2 of lakes and wetlands respectively dappen et al 2007 most of the lakes are shallow with a depth less than 1 m while the lake areas range from 0 004 13 km2 gosselin et al 2000 the majority of the lakes are smaller than 0 2 km2 table 1 lake water level is lower than the regional groundwater level ong 2010 winter 1986 and evapotranspiration that exceeds precipitation suggests that the lakes represent areas of focused groundwater discharge typical for groundwater fed lakes zlotnik et al 2009 given the difference in climate topography and lake density in the nsh three study areas were selected for this research the western lake region wlr has the highest lake density of 0 035 per km2 followed by the north eastern region ner of 0 020 per km2 and the central lake region clr 0 017 per km2 fig 2 geology is an integral part of the surface water and groundwater hydrology in the nsh the dunes in nsh are composed of well sorted fine to medium grained sand and lie atop the quaternary deposits of alluvial sand and silt the dunes and layer of alluvial sand and silt overlie the ogallala group are composed of moderate to low permeable sand sandstone and siltstones fig 2b the dunes and quaternary deposits have the highest permeability and form an important part of the aquifer through efficient transmission of recharge and minimizing evapotranspiration loss gutentag et al 1984 peterson et al 2020 the ogallala formation although less permeable contains most of the groundwater due to considerable thickness and extent the aquifer gently dips eastward at 0 9 1 3 m per km gutentag et al 1984 and is part of the high plains aquifer system where saturated the arikaree formation and the white river group lie beneath the ogallala group and are also part of the high plains aquifer though they are finer grained and only contain usable quantities of water locally in fractured or coarse grained areas 2 2 data landsat satellite images from three different sensors were used to extract the total lake area tla table 2 throughout the manuscript tla will refer to the area of all the lakes within the study area the surface reflectance data from the landsat thematic mapper tm enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and operational land imager oli with a similar spectral and spatial resolution in the multispectral region table 2 were used the surface reflectance data hosted in google earth engine gee were corrected for atmospheric and geometric effects using the lasrc approach vermote et al 2016 in this study we used 450 images for the three study areas the monthly and annual distribution of images fig 3 shows an uneven distribution the highest number of images was available for september october and july annually 2012 had the largest number of images for ner and 2016 for clr and wlr palmer drought severity index pdsi is calculated on the concept of water supply and demand it uses precipitation soil moisture content potential evapotranspiration water storage runoff and antecedent conditions to estimate soil moisture balance alley 1984 the magnitude of drought is specified based on values ranging from 10 dry to 10 wet with values less than 3 indicating moderate to severe drought condition pdsi is one of the widely used drought indices and provides a robust approximation of soil moisture variability as compared with other metrics such as the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei cook et al 2014 the use of precipitation and temperature from antecedent conditions provides better estimates of the soil water balance and the effect of water stress in the hydrological system eg soil moisture streamflow dai et al 2004 than the indices that only consider precipitation or temperature keyantash et al 2002 similarly the effects of warming due to climate change is better approximated by pdsi as compared with standardized precipitation index spi dubrovsky et al 2009 with a large proportion of precipitation lost to evapotranspiration and a high contribution from groundwater soil moisture balance is an important component and pdsi therefore provides proper representation of the drought conditions in the nsh the pdsi used in our study is calculated per pixel 4 km with gridded meteorological data from the parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism the penman montieth equation is used to calculate potential evapotranspiration while available soil water holding capacity in the top 2 5 m of the soil was derived from the statsgo soils database the pdsi data are available three times a month and were resampled for a monthly and annual series details on the method and data are provided in abatzoglou et al 2014 2 3 lake area extraction the landsat images 1984 2018 hosted in gee were filtered for cloud cover less than 10 and winter months december february to reduce the effect of cloud and snow covered lakes although nsh has a higher contrast ratio between water bodies and the surrounding land high suspended sediment submerged or floating vegetation and background reflectance from shallow water areas causes a mixed spectral response the collection of images was therefore transformed using the tasseled cap transformation and combined with original bands to capture spectral variability present in the nsh tasseled cap transformation uses empirical coefficients baig et al 2014 crist and cicone 1984 huang et al 2002 to derive components where the first three components brightness greenness and wetness account for the most variation crist and kauth 1986 the wetness feature is sensitive to soil and plant moisture and reduces the influence of shadows and enhances water body detection and delineation hoan et al 2012 jain et al 2005 zhuang and chen 2018 the greenness wetness and brightness components of tasseled cap transformation were stacked with original bands and a random forest classifier in gee was used to classify the images into water and non water areas training samples were collected from the water bodies 150 and non water 200 areas using visual analysis random forest classifier an ensemble of decision trees that provides higher accuracy and is widely used in processing remotely sensed imagery including water and wetland classification tian et al 2016 wang et al 2018a 2020 was used to classify the time series images water areas consisting of a limited number of pixels are mainly associated with image misclassification due to mixed pixel effects therefore areas with less than 10 pixels were removed using a majority filter with eight neighborhoods i e a kernel of 3 3 pixels as a result of filtering any object smaller than 0 81 ha 0 0081 km2 was automatically removed from the data the gaps present in the lakes from landsat etm sensor was filled using the nibble tool in arcgis pro 2 4 the scan line corrector slc error present in etm images were extracted and reclassified as nodata to define a mask raster the nibble operation then grows the lake area input cells into the nearest nodata cells of the mask raster the shape and area of the lakes are preserved as it only fills the missing pixels within the neighborhood defined in the mask raster as the pdsi has spatial resolution of 4 km the response of individual lakes was not properly differentiable therefore we summed the lakes area tla within each study area for further analysis this also averages the uncertainty associated with smaller lakes undetected and removed during the classification process 2 4 pdsi and total lake area time series lakes in the nsh are primarily groundwater fed and lake dynamics are a function of the current and preceding climatic conditions to account for the dependence of tla on hydrologic conditions in preceding years a cumulative pdsi cumpdsi was derived eq 1 1 c u m p d s i k n 1 k p d s i k where cumpdsik is the cumulative pdsi values by k th time and pdsik is pdsi value at the k th time and is calculated monthly and annually pdsi a water balance index when summed cumpdsi should have a trend with a slope of zero over the long term however the cumpdsi exhibited a trend which was removed fig 4 to calculate detrended pdsi depdsi and detrended cumulative pdsi decumpdsi huang et al 2011 using eqs 2 and 3 respectively the trends were calculated using a simple linear regression that uses least squares to minimize the difference between the observed and fitted values the slope of the regression was then used to remove the trend present in pdsi a negative trend in wlr clr and ner was removed by adding a value of 0 1330 0 2078 and 0 2340 respectively the values inside square brackets eq 2 indicate respective trend values in clr and ner region 2 d e p d s i k p d s i k 0 133 0 2078 0 234 where k ranges from 1 to n in analogy with cumpdsik a detrended cumulative index decumpdsik was calculated using eq 3 the pdsi and decumpdsi were aggregated for monthly and annual timescale 3 d e c u m p d s i k n 1 k d e p d s i k 2 5 total lake area and pdsi regression analysis the bayesian ridge regression was used to predict the response of tla in the nsh the pdsi and decumpdsi were time lagged by t to incorporate effects of groundwater influence from drought the bayesian ridge regression uses the probability distribution of the independent variable and its coefficients to estimate the distribution of the dependent variable murphy 2012 assuming a gaussian distribution the response is estimated as 4 y n Œº Œ± 1 where y y 1 y 2 y n is the dependent variable tla parametrized by mean Œº xÍû∑ and variance Œ± 1 x is n m matrix of time lagged pdsi or decumpdsi and Íû∑ is the weight the bayesian approach computes posterior distribution p œâ y x Œ± p y œâ x p œâ x as a product of likelihood and prior distribution the prior distribution is given by spherical gaussian centered about zero œâ n 0 Œª 1 i the priors for Œ± 1 and Œª 1 are gamma distributions i e Œ± g Œ± 1 Œ± 1 Œª g Œª 1 Œª 2 and Œ± 0 Œª 0 Œ± Œª and Íû∑ are estimated from the data during training process bishop 2006 the Œª also serves as a regularization parameter which is estimated from the data during the training phase eliminates subjectivity and makes the algorithm more stable the ridge regression reduces the effect of collinearity and thereby avoids high prediction error associated with correlated data murphy 2012 because the posterior distribution is gaussian its mode coincides with mean and therefore maximum posterior is calculated to minimize the prediction loss maximization of the posterior distribution with respect to weights Íû∑ minimizes the sum of squares with the addition of the quadratic minimization parameter Œª eq 5 5 Íû∑ ÀÜ m a p x t x Œª i 1 x t y where x is the matrix of inputs and i is the identity matrix the dependent variables are then solved using eq 6 to get the estimate of the lakes sizes 6 y ÀÜ x x t x Œª i 1 x t y to determine the number of preceding climatic events that define the tla a correlation and a regression analysis between the tla and time lagged pdsi and decumpdsi were performed the pdsi and decumpdsi were time lagged to thirty six past observations corresponding to the three and thirty six years for monthly and annual data pdsi and decumpdsi from the past were combined sequentially and a regression analysis was evaluated using r2 the performance r2 was plotted against the features fig 5 a combination that produced the highest r2 and lowest mse was selected as the final model the Œ± and Œª parameters of the bayesian regression are random numbers that follow the gamma distribution and are estimated during the training process a grid search cross validation method was used to estimate the optimal Œ± and Œª values the values 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 10 10 10 12 10 15 were used to find the optimal parameters the results fig 6 shows that the negative mean squared errors do not change significantly with lower hyper parameters values 10 6 therefore the default values of Œ±1 Œ±2 Œª1 Œª2 10 6 as suggested by mackay 1992 were used as the bayesian ridge regression is insensitive to hyper parameter settings we used 70 of the data to train and 30 to test the model using the scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 package implemented in python 3 7 effect of irrigation on groundwater level and its subsequent effect on the tla were analyzed using hotspot analysis of active irrigation well data hosted by the conservation and survey division school of natural resources university of nebraska lincoln and the nebraska department of natural resources conservation and survey division 2021a hotspot analysis performed using arcgis pro 2 6 shows if the underlying spatial pattern is significant or the result is from random processes getis and ord 1992 scott and janikas 2010 it creates statistically significant spatial clusters of high or low values with z score p value and confidence level a high z score with small p value indicate spatial clustering of high values while a low negative z score and small p value indicate a spatial clustering of low values scott and janikas 2010 in our study we used the location of irrigation wells to calculate the zones with higher and lower pumping rates a convergence index conrad et al 2015 was calculated from the digital elevation model with a resolution of 30 m to highlight the effect of topography on tla response the calculation uses aspect and finds the degree to which the surrounding cells point to the center cell the convergence index with values of zero indicate a planar valley a negative value shows a convergent channels and a positive value indicate divergent ridges surface conrad et al 2015 2 6 accuracy assessment accuracy of the extracted lakes was assessed using high spatial resolution aerial images from the national agriculture imagery program naip as reference data images were selected to represent the normal dry and wet seasons based on the availability of naip and cloud free landsat images we used three different years to represent tla variation during normal 2004 dry 2012 and wet 2018 years for each year 100 random points were generated using a random point algorithm and labeled using visual interpretation in gee the overall accuracy error of commission omission and kappa statistics were calculated the error of commission represents the percentage of pixels classified as lakes that do not belong to the lakes as per the reference naip data while the error of omission is the percentage of the pixels that are present as lakes in the reference data but absent in classified data kappa statistics show whether the results of the error matrix is significantly better than agreement due to chance stehman 1997 3 results 3 1 accuracy of lake area the lake area extracted from landsat images when compared with naip illustrates an overall accuracy greater than 95 for the normal dry and wet years table 3 the error of commission and omission were less than 5 and 8 respectively for each year the kappa statistics greater than 93 highlights that the lake area are significantly better than chance 3 2 relationship between pdsi and total lake area a correlation analysis shows a strong cyclic pattern in tla with annual pdsi and decumpdsi a linear decrease in correlation is seen in monthly pdsi while the decumpdsi displays a weaker cyclic pattern fig 7 a linear and weaker cyclic pattern in correlation in monthly data indicates that the climate from the previous year contributes to the current tla 3 2 1 spatial variation of total lake area a long term average of classified lakes from 1984 to 2018 shows a spatial pattern in tla variation since the classified image had a value of 1 for presence and 0 for the absence of water an area with a consistent presence of water has a mean value closer to 1 while an area with a value closer to 0 indicates the intermittent presence of water table 4 shows the percentage of tla fluctuation between 1984 and 2018 ner has the highest percentage of lakes that fluctuates equal to or less than 20 of the time while wlr shows the highest proportion of permanent lakes fig 8 shows individual lakes differing responses to drought lake boundaries in the northern wlr fig 8a fluctuate more often than the lakes in the southern wlr fig 8c some of the larger lakes in the ner are less variable as the area is modified through human interference such as dams and irrigation the spatial pattern in tla fluctuation is due to the variability in hydraulic conductivity flow direction and the gradient of the regional groundwater apart from the influence of the underlying groundwater condition the existence of lakes in the nsh is strongly controlled by topography the fluctuation is pronounced when the lakes are present in the convergent and divergent topography fig 9 the lakes in planar areas are permanent fig 9 indicating strong influence of topography the number of irrigation wells has increased dramatically in the last 80 years in the nsh for example irrigation wells increased from only a few hundred in 1940 7775 within a 10 km outside buffer of the nsh boundary in 2019 conservation and survey division 2021b the presence of hotspots near ner and modified lakes provides some explanation for the varied relation a hotspot map fig 10 shows that the lakes in ner have a higher chance of being influenced by irrigation smaller hotspot zones also lie closer to wlr while the majority of the nsh lies on the cold spot or not significant zone indicating little or no interference of irrigation on groundwater and tla fig 10 3 2 2 temporal variation in total lake area the temporal response of lakes in the nsh reveals seasonal abrupt and long term effects of drought the scattering of tla represented in fig 11 shows the effect of seasonal climatic variation the smoothened savitzky golay filter tla variation represented as a solid line in fig 11 illustrates the response of lakes to multiyear droughts the multiyear drought of 2000 2005 for example caused a considerable reduction in tla similarly an abrupt drought from may august of 2012 drastically reduced the tla fig 11 also shows that the tla fluctuation follows the pacific decadal oscillation pdo it also highlights that the effect of pdo is not immediate the tla decreases after reductions in pdo for a few years and indicates the presence of lag in the response of lakes this highlights that the tla in the nsh depends on the groundwater flux and varying responses to drought for example lakes in wlr and clr show a longer time lag while ner indicates a shorter time lag the sensitivity of wlr can be due to the presence of a thicker vadose zone that promotes longer travel times for precipitation ner less sensitive to immediate climate effects can be due to the gentle topography consistent groundwater flux or human interference such as irrigation fig 10 3 2 3 lake response to drought a bayesian ridge regression model shows that the variations in tla are best explained on an annual timescale figs 12b d f the relationship between the tla and independent variables pdsi and decumpdsi is best demonstrated by decumpdsi in the wlr and clr the decumpdsi increased the r2 and reduced the mean squared error mse on the training and testing data at monthly and annual time series the ner however showed a slightly better estimate with pdsi on monthly and annual data table 5 lower r2 and higher mse values at a monthly timescale fig 12a c f suggest that the tla variation has higher uncertainty and less correlation than at a longer time scale a lesser fitting could be related to the fact that smaller lakes 0 8 ha that respond rapidly to climatic fluctuations removed to reduce the uncertainty were not considered in the analysis similarly seasonality in tla may not be well represented due to the limited number of cloud and snow free images on an annual timescale a high r2 and low mse is obtained using 5 10 years of time lagged pdsi and decumpdsi values at all three study areas fig 5a b c maximum mse within four landsat pixels shows that the annual decumpdsi could be used to determine the lake response in the nsh in general the r2 values increases and mse decreases for the pdsi and decumpdsi when the timescale is increased from monthly to annual this suggests that the tla variation in the nsh is controlled by the longer term effect of drought and that the response time of lakes as modulated by groundwater flow is in terms of many years 5 10 instead of months and days 4 discussion the tla classified using the random forest classifier showed the highest accuracy the higher accuracy 95 is the result of a combination of tasseled cap components original bands and higher contrast between the water and homogenous surrounding landscape with a spatial resolution of 30 m at least 9 pixels are necessary to consistently represent an object using landsat images ozesmi and bauer 2002 to avoid mixed pixel effect due to high suspended sediment submerged or floating vegetation and background reflectance at lake boundaries pixels within 3 3 filters were removed this leads to underrepresentation of the smaller lakes similarly a unevenly distributed and limited number of cloud free images resulted in the inability to capture the seasonal variation present in the tla the study therefore has partial or limited response of spatial and temporal variation of smaller lakes the results however show that higher resolution satellites e g sentinel 2 could be used to characterize the smaller lakes and its response to seasonal variation however many higher resolution satellites have limited temporal re visit frequency and shorter periods of records the lake hydrology in the nsh is dependent on the precipitation and groundwater fluxes as input evapotranspiration as output and little or no contribution from overland flow the effect of precipitation is clearly seen as the tla fluctuates in response to the seasonal and long term climate changes although seasonal variations are not apparent the long term effects of climate fluctuations is seen in the time series tla and high r2 values in bayesian regression with annual data the results correspond with several studies indicating that the climate in the central u s is the result of inter annual and multiyear variation of the precipitation from air masses originating from the pacific ocean the arctic and the gulf of mexico bryson and hare 1974 kushnir et al 2010 schubert et al 2009 the sea surface temperature fluctuations cause shorter and longer oscillations of climate signals such as quasi biennial oscillation qbo el ni√±o southern oscillation enso the quasi decadal oscillation qdo atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and pdo white et al 2008 the pdo and amo cause interdecadal oscillation and result in the long term trend and decadal variability of drought in the central u s mo and lettenmaier 2018 nigam et al 2011 white et al 2008 fig 11 illustrates that pdo affects the tla in the nsh groundwater plays an important role in the existence of lakes in the nsh with evapotranspiration exceeding precipitation the deficit in water budget of lakes is fulfilled by the groundwater contribution the high coefficient of determination and low mse with time lagged annual data indicates the effect of groundwater in the lake response the difference in the water table depth vadose zone thickness and hydraulic connectivity shows spatial and temporal patterns in tla the predominance of fine to coarse grained sand permits high infiltration thus leading to a shorter lag time and therefore the response time of the tla our results from the wlr show a longer time lag than the ner and lies between 5 10 years besides precipitation and groundwater contribution studies have shown the tla also depends on the gradient of groundwater flow peters et al 2006 pham et al 2008 position of lakes with respect to the local or regional groundwater flow tague et al 2008 storage and lake bathymetry tweed et al 2009 and topography as evident in this study local variation in hydraulic connectivity fig 8a d vs fig 8c topography fig 9 and bathymetry results in immediate drying up of smaller shallow lakes and area reduction of larger or groundwater fed lakes during drought the results indicate that the tla fluctuation can measure and monitor the groundwater level variation in the nsh some of the differences in lower correlation and low r2 between tla and short term climatic effects can also be attributed to the inherent drawbacks of pdsi these include i the assumption of no runoff until the water capacity of the topsoil layer is full while in the nsh due to the high hydraulic conductivity of the sandy soil the majority of the precipitation infiltrates and there may be little or no runoff and ii exclusion of snow cover snowfall and frozen ground in pdsi calculation dracup 1991 which is prevalent in winter months in the nsh and therefore might lead to some limitations in relation to the tla tla however does not show significant variation in winter months due to low evaporation and iii inability of pdsi to capture the climatic variability of a shorter temporal scale less than 9 months heim 2002 therefore although pdsi best represents the soil moisture condition in nsh other drought indices such as spi spei should be explored in future research the variations in lake responses in the nsh because of local hydraulic conductivity regional lake position and topographic influences can be refined in future studies with few monitoring wells in the nsh future work should also evaluate the potential in using the lakes as monitoring wells to better quantify the groundwater levels in the nsh 5 conclusions this study presents the spatial and temporal tla variation in response to climatic changes in the nsh the spatial and temporal variations are apparent in tla in response to the seasonal and longer term climatic effects the response of the lakes is controlled by the geographic location the local variation of topography climate and groundwater influence the longer response time as determined by the higher degree of fit and lower mse at the annual time scale using bayesian analysis shows that the groundwater is crucial in determining the response of lakes in the nsh similarly a higher degree of fit with detrended cumulative pdsi highlights the importance of water balance and preceding climate effect on the lakes of the nsh the study therefore provides a simple and effective method to monitor and predict the lake response with readily available a priori climate data the tla calculated with a limited number of cloud free satellite images however may not represent the seasonal fluctuations in the nsh similarly the response of smaller lakes that are sensitive to short term climatic forcing may be biased due to the limited spatial resolution of the landsat sensor author statement nawaraj shrestha data curation methodology formal analysis writing original draft

severity index drought remote sensing nebraska sand hills 1 introduction drought is a natural phenomenon that has severe socioeconomic and environmental effects ding et al 2011 mo et al 2009 a decrease in rainfall duration amount and frequency causes drought to stress all components of a hydrologic system peters et al 2006 the effects of drought are hard to characterize as drought propagates and produces responses at multiple spatial and temporal scales for example a hydrologic system with hydraulic connectivity to groundwater produces a different response than a system without the connection peters et al 2006 however the effects of drought on the hydrological system can be characterized through the response of water bodies e g lakes lake properties such as surface area water level volume and salinity provide valuable information to assess the effect of drought on surface and groundwater hydrology tweed et al 2009 the change in lake surface area measured through remote sensing helps to monitor and assess the response of the hydrologic system to drought however studies that quantify the response of thousands of shallow closed groundwater fed lakes are limited lakes are sensitive indicators of drought as they respond rapidly and integrate information about changes in environmental landscape and atmospheric conditions adrian et al 2009 harris 1994 mason et al 1994 pham et al 2008 williamson et al 2008 the change in a lake s physical du et al 2012 li et al 2018 mason et al 1994 tang et al 2018 wang et al 2018b yan and zheng 2015 biological biota williamson et al 2008 or chemical salinity pham et al 2008 characteristics help to explain the hydrologic response to drought for example mason et al 1994 found that the lake water level and size surface area are sensitive to low frequency climate signals e g drought but are less sensitive to high frequency climate signals e g seasonal variations zhang et al 2009 found that the lake responses are defined by the size large lakes respond to long term climate effects but moderate the seasonal effects while smaller lakes are sensitive and responsive to seasonal effects in addition to climate the response of lakes is regulated by contribution of the lake groundwater exchange fig 1 geographic regions adrian et al 2009 liao et al 2013 tang et al 2018 yan and zheng 2015 lake position relative to regional groundwater flow smith and townley 2002 drought severity and hydraulic connectivity peters et al 2006 pham et al 2008 tweed et al 2009 lakes with hydraulic connection to groundwater also provide the opportunity to evaluate or monitor the groundwater level variations however most of the studies have been focused previously on areas where lake hydrology is defined by a combination of precipitation evaporation and overland flow fig 1a lakes water budget that include substantial surface water groundwater exchange fig 1b respond differently asthe influence of surface water evaporation on lake water levels is compensated partially by the groundwater inflow fluxes and are less studied however these fluxes commonly lag behind the evaporative losses because they originate from groundwater recharge over large surrounding areas with long travel times through the hosting aquifer time lag the time a precipitation event takes to travel through the subsurface and effect the lake area is often used for example the present volume number and stage of lakes were determined by backward time averaging of climate events gong et al 2015 langbein 1961 liu and schwartz 2012 mason et al 1994 previous studies have primarily focused on lake water level and salinity to characterize the response from drought gosselin et al 2000 tweed et al 2009 fewer studies use lakes area to characterize the response of drought on water bodies lakes area however is easily quantified using remote sensing that provides opportunity to monitor lakes in remote areas with sparse or no observations remote sensing is an easily implemented method to delineate water surface area using single band thresholding classification multi band and subpixel methods bijeesh and narasimhamurthy 2020 du et al 2012 thresholding the simplest method involves selecting a threshold value to delineate water from single bands however the method suffers from errors such as mixing of water pixels with shadows due to overlapping of spectral signatures frazier and page 2000 along with a subjective selection of threshold values xu 2006 the classification based method uses all or some of the available bands to label classes with algorithms such as nearest neighborhood maximum likelihood iso data k means support vector machine random forest and artificial neural network to identify water area paul et al 2018 the classification based method usually serves as a better method than thresholding but suffers from a mixed pixel effect frazier and page 2000 hybrid methods combine multiple methods to delineate and differentiate water areas for example multi band images when combined with image color space jiang et al 2012 principal component analysis bal√°zs et al 2018 or tasseled cap transformation hoan et al 2012 zhuang and chen 2018 provides better characterization of the water surface area the objective of this study was to characterize the spatial and temporal response of hundreds of shallow groundwater fed lakes in the nebraska sand hills nsh to drought the lakes area derived from landsat images are juxtaposed with drought indices and the responses of lakes area are assessed using bayesian ridge regression analysis 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the nsh is a drought sensitive grass stabilized eolian landscape located in a semi arid climate of western nebraska fig 2 drought in the nsh like in the entire united states u s are controlled by the low frequency sea surface temperature anomalies in the pacific and atlantic oceans mo and lettenmaier 2018 schubert et al 2004 the direct and indirect influence of the surface sea temperature anomalies in precipitation leads to a series of recurring and long lasting drought in the nsh the nsh is also vulnerable to drought due to semi arid climate eolian landscape human encroachment and climate change adane et al 2019 burbach and joeckel 2006 the nsh has temperatures ranging from 40 to 43 3 c with an average annual temperature of 8 9 c the annual average precipitation ranges from 450 mm in the west to 690 mm in the eastern part of nsh national climatic data center 2020 the annual average precipitation ranges from 450 mm in the west to 690 mm in the east national climatic data center 2020 because of its semi arid nature a large proportion of precipitation is lost as evapotranspiration 700 mm winter 1986 and the groundwater influx makes up the difference the sandy soils promote high infiltration with annual recharge rates of approximately 73 73 mm yr 1 varying between 40 85 mm yr 1 in the western and 200 85 mm yr 1 in the south eastern parts szilagyi et al 2011 the combination of climate topography soil and groundwater surface water interactions resulted in a total of 4700 and 2000 km2 of lakes and wetlands respectively dappen et al 2007 most of the lakes are shallow with a depth less than 1 m while the lake areas range from 0 004 13 km2 gosselin et al 2000 the majority of the lakes are smaller than 0 2 km2 table 1 lake water level is lower than the regional groundwater level ong 2010 winter 1986 and evapotranspiration that exceeds precipitation suggests that the lakes represent areas of focused groundwater discharge typical for groundwater fed lakes zlotnik et al 2009 given the difference in climate topography and lake density in the nsh three study areas were selected for this research the western lake region wlr has the highest lake density of 0 035 per km2 followed by the north eastern region ner of 0 020 per km2 and the central lake region clr 0 017 per km2 fig 2 geology is an integral part of the surface water and groundwater hydrology in the nsh the dunes in nsh are composed of well sorted fine to medium grained sand and lie atop the quaternary deposits of alluvial sand and silt the dunes and layer of alluvial sand and silt overlie the ogallala group are composed of moderate to low permeable sand sandstone and siltstones fig 2b the dunes and quaternary deposits have the highest permeability and form an important part of the aquifer through efficient transmission of recharge and minimizing evapotranspiration loss gutentag et al 1984 peterson et al 2020 the ogallala formation although less permeable contains most of the groundwater due to considerable thickness and extent the aquifer gently dips eastward at 0 9 1 3 m per km gutentag et al 1984 and is part of the high plains aquifer system where saturated the arikaree formation and the white river group lie beneath the ogallala group and are also part of the high plains aquifer though they are finer grained and only contain usable quantities of water locally in fractured or coarse grained areas 2 2 data landsat satellite images from three different sensors were used to extract the total lake area tla table 2 throughout the manuscript tla will refer to the area of all the lakes within the study area the surface reflectance data from the landsat thematic mapper tm enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and operational land imager oli with a similar spectral and spatial resolution in the multispectral region table 2 were used the surface reflectance data hosted in google earth engine gee were corrected for atmospheric and geometric effects using the lasrc approach vermote et al 2016 in this study we used 450 images for the three study areas the monthly and annual distribution of images fig 3 shows an uneven distribution the highest number of images was available for september october and july annually 2012 had the largest number of images for ner and 2016 for clr and wlr palmer drought severity index pdsi is calculated on the concept of water supply and demand it uses precipitation soil moisture content potential evapotranspiration water storage runoff and antecedent conditions to estimate soil moisture balance alley 1984 the magnitude of drought is specified based on values ranging from 10 dry to 10 wet with values less than 3 indicating moderate to severe drought condition pdsi is one of the widely used drought indices and provides a robust approximation of soil moisture variability as compared with other metrics such as the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei cook et al 2014 the use of precipitation and temperature from antecedent conditions provides better estimates of the soil water balance and the effect of water stress in the hydrological system eg soil moisture streamflow dai et al 2004 than the indices that only consider precipitation or temperature keyantash et al 2002 similarly the effects of warming due to climate change is better approximated by pdsi as compared with standardized precipitation index spi dubrovsky et al 2009 with a large proportion of precipitation lost to evapotranspiration and a high contribution from groundwater soil moisture balance is an important component and pdsi therefore provides proper representation of the drought conditions in the nsh the pdsi used in our study is calculated per pixel 4 km with gridded meteorological data from the parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism the penman montieth equation is used to calculate potential evapotranspiration while available soil water holding capacity in the top 2 5 m of the soil was derived from the statsgo soils database the pdsi data are available three times a month and were resampled for a monthly and annual series details on the method and data are provided in abatzoglou et al 2014 2 3 lake area extraction the landsat images 1984 2018 hosted in gee were filtered for cloud cover less than 10 and winter months december february to reduce the effect of cloud and snow covered lakes although nsh has a higher contrast ratio between water bodies and the surrounding land high suspended sediment submerged or floating vegetation and background reflectance from shallow water areas causes a mixed spectral response the collection of images was therefore transformed using the tasseled cap transformation and combined with original bands to capture spectral variability present in the nsh tasseled cap transformation uses empirical coefficients baig et al 2014 crist and cicone 1984 huang et al 2002 to derive components where the first three components brightness greenness and wetness account for the most variation crist and kauth 1986 the wetness feature is sensitive to soil and plant moisture and reduces the influence of shadows and enhances water body detection and delineation hoan et al 2012 jain et al 2005 zhuang and chen 2018 the greenness wetness and brightness components of tasseled cap transformation were stacked with original bands and a random forest classifier in gee was used to classify the images into water and non water areas training samples were collected from the water bodies 150 and non water 200 areas using visual analysis random forest classifier an ensemble of decision trees that provides higher accuracy and is widely used in processing remotely sensed imagery including water and wetland classification tian et al 2016 wang et al 2018a 2020 was used to classify the time series images water areas consisting of a limited number of pixels are mainly associated with image misclassification due to mixed pixel effects therefore areas with less than 10 pixels were removed using a majority filter with eight neighborhoods i e a kernel of 3 3 pixels as a result of filtering any object smaller than 0 81 ha 0 0081 km2 was automatically removed from the data the gaps present in the lakes from landsat etm sensor was filled using the nibble tool in arcgis pro 2 4 the scan line corrector slc error present in etm images were extracted and reclassified as nodata to define a mask raster the nibble operation then grows the lake area input cells into the nearest nodata cells of the mask raster the shape and area of the lakes are preserved as it only fills the missing pixels within the neighborhood defined in the mask raster as the pdsi has spatial resolution of 4 km the response of individual lakes was not properly differentiable therefore we summed the lakes area tla within each study area for further analysis this also averages the uncertainty associated with smaller lakes undetected and removed during the classification process 2 4 pdsi and total lake area time series lakes in the nsh are primarily groundwater fed and lake dynamics are a function of the current and preceding climatic conditions to account for the dependence of tla on hydrologic conditions in preceding years a cumulative pdsi cumpdsi was derived eq 1 1 c u m p d s i k n 1 k p d s i k where cumpdsik is the cumulative pdsi values by k th time and pdsik is pdsi value at the k th time and is calculated monthly and annually pdsi a water balance index when summed cumpdsi should have a trend with a slope of zero over the long term however the cumpdsi exhibited a trend which was removed fig 4 to calculate detrended pdsi depdsi and detrended cumulative pdsi decumpdsi huang et al 2011 using eqs 2 and 3 respectively the trends were calculated using a simple linear regression that uses least squares to minimize the difference between the observed and fitted values the slope of the regression was then used to remove the trend present in pdsi a negative trend in wlr clr and ner was removed by adding a value of 0 1330 0 2078 and 0 2340 respectively the values inside square brackets eq 2 indicate respective trend values in clr and ner region 2 d e p d s i k p d s i k 0 133 0 2078 0 234 where k ranges from 1 to n in analogy with cumpdsik a detrended cumulative index decumpdsik was calculated using eq 3 the pdsi and decumpdsi were aggregated for monthly and annual timescale 3 d e c u m p d s i k n 1 k d e p d s i k 2 5 total lake area and pdsi regression analysis the bayesian ridge regression was used to predict the response of tla in the nsh the pdsi and decumpdsi were time lagged by t to incorporate effects of groundwater influence from drought the bayesian ridge regression uses the probability distribution of the independent variable and its coefficients to estimate the distribution of the dependent variable murphy 2012 assuming a gaussian distribution the response is estimated as 4 y n Œº Œ± 1 where y y 1 y 2 y n is the dependent variable tla parametrized by mean Œº xÍû∑ and variance Œ± 1 x is n m matrix of time lagged pdsi or decumpdsi and Íû∑ is the weight the bayesian approach computes posterior distribution p œâ y x Œ± p y œâ x p œâ x as a product of likelihood and prior distribution the prior distribution is given by spherical gaussian centered about zero œâ n 0 Œª 1 i the priors for Œ± 1 and Œª 1 are gamma distributions i e Œ± g Œ± 1 Œ± 1 Œª g Œª 1 Œª 2 and Œ± 0 Œª 0 Œ± Œª and Íû∑ are estimated from the data during training process bishop 2006 the Œª also serves as a regularization parameter which is estimated from the data during the training phase eliminates subjectivity and makes the algorithm more stable the ridge regression reduces the effect of collinearity and thereby avoids high prediction error associated with correlated data murphy 2012 because the posterior distribution is gaussian its mode coincides with mean and therefore maximum posterior is calculated to minimize the prediction loss maximization of the posterior distribution with respect to weights Íû∑ minimizes the sum of squares with the addition of the quadratic minimization parameter Œª eq 5 5 Íû∑ ÀÜ m a p x t x Œª i 1 x t y where x is the matrix of inputs and i is the identity matrix the dependent variables are then solved using eq 6 to get the estimate of the lakes sizes 6 y ÀÜ x x t x Œª i 1 x t y to determine the number of preceding climatic events that define the tla a correlation and a regression analysis between the tla and time lagged pdsi and decumpdsi were performed the pdsi and decumpdsi were time lagged to thirty six past observations corresponding to the three and thirty six years for monthly and annual data pdsi and decumpdsi from the past were combined sequentially and a regression analysis was evaluated using r2 the performance r2 was plotted against the features fig 5 a combination that produced the highest r2 and lowest mse was selected as the final model the Œ± and Œª parameters of the bayesian regression are random numbers that follow the gamma distribution and are estimated during the training process a grid search cross validation method was used to estimate the optimal Œ± and Œª values the values 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 10 10 10 12 10 15 were used to find the optimal parameters the results fig 6 shows that the negative mean squared errors do not change significantly with lower hyper parameters values 10 6 therefore the default values of Œ±1 Œ±2 Œª1 Œª2 10 6 as suggested by mackay 1992 were used as the bayesian ridge regression is insensitive to hyper parameter settings we used 70 of the data to train and 30 to test the model using the scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 package implemented in python 3 7 effect of irrigation on groundwater level and its subsequent effect on the tla were analyzed using hotspot analysis of active irrigation well data hosted by the conservation and survey division school of natural resources university of nebraska lincoln and the nebraska department of natural resources conservation and survey division 2021a hotspot analysis performed using arcgis pro 2 6 shows if the underlying spatial pattern is significant or the result is from random processes getis and ord 1992 scott and janikas 2010 it creates statistically significant spatial clusters of high or low values with z score p value and confidence level a high z score with small p value indicate spatial clustering of high values while a low negative z score and small p value indicate a spatial clustering of low values scott and janikas 2010 in our study we used the location of irrigation wells to calculate the zones with higher and lower pumping rates a convergence index conrad et al 2015 was calculated from the digital elevation model with a resolution of 30 m to highlight the effect of topography on tla response the calculation uses aspect and finds the degree to which the surrounding cells point to the center cell the convergence index with values of zero indicate a planar valley a negative value shows a convergent channels and a positive value indicate divergent ridges surface conrad et al 2015 2 6 accuracy assessment accuracy of the extracted lakes was assessed using high spatial resolution aerial images from the national agriculture imagery program naip as reference data images were selected to represent the normal dry and wet seasons based on the availability of naip and cloud free landsat images we used three different years to represent tla variation during normal 2004 dry 2012 and wet 2018 years for each year 100 random points were generated using a random point algorithm and labeled using visual interpretation in gee the overall accuracy error of commission omission and kappa statistics were calculated the error of commission represents the percentage of pixels classified as lakes that do not belong to the lakes as per the reference naip data while the error of omission is the percentage of the pixels that are present as lakes in the reference data but absent in classified data kappa statistics show whether the results of the error matrix is significantly better than agreement due to chance stehman 1997 3 results 3 1 accuracy of lake area the lake area extracted from landsat images when compared with naip illustrates an overall accuracy greater than 95 for the normal dry and wet years table 3 the error of commission and omission were less than 5 and 8 respectively for each year the kappa statistics greater than 93 highlights that the lake area are significantly better than chance 3 2 relationship between pdsi and total lake area a correlation analysis shows a strong cyclic pattern in tla with annual pdsi and decumpdsi a linear decrease in correlation is seen in monthly pdsi while the decumpdsi displays a weaker cyclic pattern fig 7 a linear and weaker cyclic pattern in correlation in monthly data indicates that the climate from the previous year contributes to the current tla 3 2 1 spatial variation of total lake area a long term average of classified lakes from 1984 to 2018 shows a spatial pattern in tla variation since the classified image had a value of 1 for presence and 0 for the absence of water an area with a consistent presence of water has a mean value closer to 1 while an area with a value closer to 0 indicates the intermittent presence of water table 4 shows the percentage of tla fluctuation between 1984 and 2018 ner has the highest percentage of lakes that fluctuates equal to or less than 20 of the time while wlr shows the highest proportion of permanent lakes fig 8 shows individual lakes differing responses to drought lake boundaries in the northern wlr fig 8a fluctuate more often than the lakes in the southern wlr fig 8c some of the larger lakes in the ner are less variable as the area is modified through human interference such as dams and irrigation the spatial pattern in tla fluctuation is due to the variability in hydraulic conductivity flow direction and the gradient of the regional groundwater apart from the influence of the underlying groundwater condition the existence of lakes in the nsh is strongly controlled by topography the fluctuation is pronounced when the lakes are present in the convergent and divergent topography fig 9 the lakes in planar areas are permanent fig 9 indicating strong influence of topography the number of irrigation wells has increased dramatically in the last 80 years in the nsh for example irrigation wells increased from only a few hundred in 1940 7775 within a 10 km outside buffer of the nsh boundary in 2019 conservation and survey division 2021b the presence of hotspots near ner and modified lakes provides some explanation for the varied relation a hotspot map fig 10 shows that the lakes in ner have a higher chance of being influenced by irrigation smaller hotspot zones also lie closer to wlr while the majority of the nsh lies on the cold spot or not significant zone indicating little or no interference of irrigation on groundwater and tla fig 10 3 2 2 temporal variation in total lake area the temporal response of lakes in the nsh reveals seasonal abrupt and long term effects of drought the scattering of tla represented in fig 11 shows the effect of seasonal climatic variation the smoothened savitzky golay filter tla variation represented as a solid line in fig 11 illustrates the response of lakes to multiyear droughts the multiyear drought of 2000 2005 for example caused a considerable reduction in tla similarly an abrupt drought from may august of 2012 drastically reduced the tla fig 11 also shows that the tla fluctuation follows the pacific decadal oscillation pdo it also highlights that the effect of pdo is not immediate the tla decreases after reductions in pdo for a few years and indicates the presence of lag in the response of lakes this highlights that the tla in the nsh depends on the groundwater flux and varying responses to drought for example lakes in wlr and clr show a longer time lag while ner indicates a shorter time lag the sensitivity of wlr can be due to the presence of a thicker vadose zone that promotes longer travel times for precipitation ner less sensitive to immediate climate effects can be due to the gentle topography consistent groundwater flux or human interference such as irrigation fig 10 3 2 3 lake response to drought a bayesian ridge regression model shows that the variations in tla are best explained on an annual timescale figs 12b d f the relationship between the tla and independent variables pdsi and decumpdsi is best demonstrated by decumpdsi in the wlr and clr the decumpdsi increased the r2 and reduced the mean squared error mse on the training and testing data at monthly and annual time series the ner however showed a slightly better estimate with pdsi on monthly and annual data table 5 lower r2 and higher mse values at a monthly timescale fig 12a c f suggest that the tla variation has higher uncertainty and less correlation than at a longer time scale a lesser fitting could be related to the fact that smaller lakes 0 8 ha that respond rapidly to climatic fluctuations removed to reduce the uncertainty were not considered in the analysis similarly seasonality in tla may not be well represented due to the limited number of cloud and snow free images on an annual timescale a high r2 and low mse is obtained using 5 10 years of time lagged pdsi and decumpdsi values at all three study areas fig 5a b c maximum mse within four landsat pixels shows that the annual decumpdsi could be used to determine the lake response in the nsh in general the r2 values increases and mse decreases for the pdsi and decumpdsi when the timescale is increased from monthly to annual this suggests that the tla variation in the nsh is controlled by the longer term effect of drought and that the response time of lakes as modulated by groundwater flow is in terms of many years 5 10 instead of months and days 4 discussion the tla classified using the random forest classifier showed the highest accuracy the higher accuracy 95 is the result of a combination of tasseled cap components original bands and higher contrast between the water and homogenous surrounding landscape with a spatial resolution of 30 m at least 9 pixels are necessary to consistently represent an object using landsat images ozesmi and bauer 2002 to avoid mixed pixel effect due to high suspended sediment submerged or floating vegetation and background reflectance at lake boundaries pixels within 3 3 filters were removed this leads to underrepresentation of the smaller lakes similarly a unevenly distributed and limited number of cloud free images resulted in the inability to capture the seasonal variation present in the tla the study therefore has partial or limited response of spatial and temporal variation of smaller lakes the results however show that higher resolution satellites e g sentinel 2 could be used to characterize the smaller lakes and its response to seasonal variation however many higher resolution satellites have limited temporal re visit frequency and shorter periods of records the lake hydrology in the nsh is dependent on the precipitation and groundwater fluxes as input evapotranspiration as output and little or no contribution from overland flow the effect of precipitation is clearly seen as the tla fluctuates in response to the seasonal and long term climate changes although seasonal variations are not apparent the long term effects of climate fluctuations is seen in the time series tla and high r2 values in bayesian regression with annual data the results correspond with several studies indicating that the climate in the central u s is the result of inter annual and multiyear variation of the precipitation from air masses originating from the pacific ocean the arctic and the gulf of mexico bryson and hare 1974 kushnir et al 2010 schubert et al 2009 the sea surface temperature fluctuations cause shorter and longer oscillations of climate signals such as quasi biennial oscillation qbo el ni√±o southern oscillation enso the quasi decadal oscillation qdo atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and pdo white et al 2008 the pdo and amo cause interdecadal oscillation and result in the long term trend and decadal variability of drought in the central u s mo and lettenmaier 2018 nigam et al 2011 white et al 2008 fig 11 illustrates that pdo affects the tla in the nsh groundwater plays an important role in the existence of lakes in the nsh with evapotranspiration exceeding precipitation the deficit in water budget of lakes is fulfilled by the groundwater contribution the high coefficient of determination and low mse with time lagged annual data indicates the effect of groundwater in the lake response the difference in the water table depth vadose zone thickness and hydraulic connectivity shows spatial and temporal patterns in tla the predominance of fine to coarse grained sand permits high infiltration thus leading to a shorter lag time and therefore the response time of the tla our results from the wlr show a longer time lag than the ner and lies between 5 10 years besides precipitation and groundwater contribution studies have shown the tla also depends on the gradient of groundwater flow peters et al 2006 pham et al 2008 position of lakes with respect to the local or regional groundwater flow tague et al 2008 storage and lake bathymetry tweed et al 2009 and topography as evident in this study local variation in hydraulic connectivity fig 8a d vs fig 8c topography fig 9 and bathymetry results in immediate drying up of smaller shallow lakes and area reduction of larger or groundwater fed lakes during drought the results indicate that the tla fluctuation can measure and monitor the groundwater level variation in the nsh some of the differences in lower correlation and low r2 between tla and short term climatic effects can also be attributed to the inherent drawbacks of pdsi these include i the assumption of no runoff until the water capacity of the topsoil layer is full while in the nsh due to the high hydraulic conductivity of the sandy soil the majority of the precipitation infiltrates and there may be little or no runoff and ii exclusion of snow cover snowfall and frozen ground in pdsi calculation dracup 1991 which is prevalent in winter months in the nsh and therefore might lead to some limitations in relation to the tla tla however does not show significant variation in winter months due to low evaporation and iii inability of pdsi to capture the climatic variability of a shorter temporal scale less than 9 months heim 2002 therefore although pdsi best represents the soil moisture condition in nsh other drought indices such as spi spei should be explored in future research the variations in lake responses in the nsh because of local hydraulic conductivity regional lake position and topographic influences can be refined in future studies with few monitoring wells in the nsh future work should also evaluate the potential in using the lakes as monitoring wells to better quantify the groundwater levels in the nsh 5 conclusions this study presents the spatial and temporal tla variation in response to climatic changes in the nsh the spatial and temporal variations are apparent in tla in response to the seasonal and longer term climatic effects the response of the lakes is controlled by the geographic location the local variation of topography climate and groundwater influence the longer response time as determined by the higher degree of fit and lower mse at the annual time scale using bayesian analysis shows that the groundwater is crucial in determining the response of lakes in the nsh similarly a higher degree of fit with detrended cumulative pdsi highlights the importance of water balance and preceding climate effect on the lakes of the nsh the study therefore provides a simple and effective method to monitor and predict the lake response with readily available a priori climate data the tla calculated with a limited number of cloud free satellite images however may not represent the seasonal fluctuations in the nsh similarly the response of smaller lakes that are sensitive to short term climatic forcing may be biased due to the limited spatial resolution of the landsat sensor author statement nawaraj shrestha data curation methodology formal analysis writing original draft

barnett 1998 dai and wigley 2000 goodrich 2007 similar to enso the pacific decadal oscillation pdo atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and north atlantic oscillation nao are also large scale oceanic atmospheric phenomena responsible for warming or cooling of the pacific and atlantic ocean respectively however they oscillate at different periodicities decadal to multi decadal in the recent past studies have generated greater interest related enso and other decadal multidecadal climate cycles such as pdo nao and amo and their effect on meteorological and hydrological parameters tootle et al 2005 araghinejad et al 2006 johnson et al 2013 mitra et al 2014 singh et al 2015 2016 tamaddun et al 2019a 2019b several studies have investigated the tele connections between sea conditions in the atlantic and pacific oceans sea surface temperatures with regional precipitation and streamflow chiew et al 1998 schmidt et al 2001 sen et al 2004 tootle and piechota 2004 murgulet et al 2017 streamflows in the united states have shown significant tele connections to enso chiew and mcmahon 2002 dracup and kahya 1994 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 johnson et al 2013 tamaddun et al 2017a pdo hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 singh et al 2015 tamaddun et al 2017a amo and nao tootle and piechota 2006 singh et al 2015 recent research has focused on coupling of the interannual enso with other decadal multidecadal climatic oscillations such as pdo amo and nao studies have shown that pdo modulates the strength of enso teleconnections to precipitation and droughts cayan et al 1998 gershunov and barnett 1998 mccabe et al 2004 similarly enfield et al 2001 evaluated the impact of amo on precipitation and found that most of the us experiences below normal precipitation during amo positive phase rajagopalan et al 2000 studied the coupled interactions of enso with pdo and nao on meteorological droughts using the palmer drought severity index coupled studies have also been conducted with respect to streamflows at a regional scale in the united states hidalgo and dracup 2001 rogers and coleman 2003 johnson et al 2013 singh et al 2015 murgulet et al 2017 tamaddun et al 2017a as these studies are regional in nature they fail to provide information at a larger conus scale it is important to consider the conus as a whole for the evaluation and not limit to regional scale in order to understand the effect of large scale oscillations on contiguous hydrology therefore a study by tootle et al 2005 showed significant modulation of enso behavior dependent on the phases of amo and pdo throughout the conus they indicated that enso phase streamflows in the conus are influenced by other decadal and multidecadal oscillations however the study used the non parametric statistical wilcoxon rank sum test wrs to infer the interaction between enso and other decadal multidecadal climate cycles without directly modelling the interaction effect interaction test also singh et al 2018 showed that the wrs test fails to account for monthly and seasonal cluster correlations within the data which might indicate erroneous results further the study also failed to quantify the magnitude of the modulation across different regions and or climate zones in the conus apart from that the strength of teleconnections and scaling rate change in streamflow with one standard deviation change in climate index of enso pdo amo and nao towards streamflow variability across the regions in the contiguous united states have not been quantified the quantification of the modulation magnitude scaling rate teleconnection strength and interaction test would indicate provide predictive ability that can be helpful in forecasting of streamflows and water resources availability in the conus singh et al 2018 therefore in this study we revisit the topic of large scale ocean atmospheric cycle modulations on us streamflows and performed a comprehensive investigation on the interactive effect of climatic oscillations i e enso nao pdo and amo on streamflows in the entire conus using robust and efficient statistical procedures we tested and evaluated the interactions interaction test between enso and other large scale oscillations by directly modelling the interaction using a non parametric linear mixed effects lme model we used a powerful statistical procedure called joint rank fit jrfit kloke et al 2009 singh et al 2018 to fit the mixed effects model and estimate the individual and coupled effects of climatic oscillations on streamflow levels for different regions across the conus the jrfit model is able to efficiently model the interaction of two climate phenomena and works well for cluster correlated datasets singh et al 2018 moreover the strength of tele connection and scaling rate between the ocean atmospheric cycles and streamflow levels were also quantified using a non parametric rank based partial least square pls regression analysis we also perform false discovery rate fdr analysis to test for false discovery rates in multiple hypothesis testing benjamini and hochberg 1995 overall with the help of these statistical analysis we identify and highlight new modulations interactions by classifying the interactions into three major types of interactions in the conus region that were missed in the earlier studies further this study is conducted over an extended period of historic data compared to tootle et al 2005 that is required to more accurately and comprehensively evaluate the effect of inter decadal phenomena on hydrologic variables with a greater number of stations higher record of data and a powerful statistical technique this comprehensive study provides a holistic picture of the effect of ocean atmospheric cycles on streamflow levels across different climate zones in conus karl and koss 1984 which greatly adds to the current knowledge the outcomes of this study will be helpful in developing streamflow forecasting frameworks across the conus region which incorporate climate oscillation information incorporating the information from ocean atmospheric phenomena such as enso nao pdo and amo into the forecaster s toolbox can greatly improve the lead time in streamflow forecasting tootle et al 2005 araghinejad et al 2006 2 methodology a robust and powerful nonparametric model fitting procedure known as jrfit procedure kloke et al 2009 is applied to test and quantify the individual impacts of the phases of enso nao pdo and amo on streamflows moreover a rank based pls approach is introduced to estimate the strength and direction of teleconnection effect of enso amo pdo and nao on streamflow fluctuations interaction tests between enso and the other climatic oscillations are performed to evaluate the modulation by nao amo and pdo of enso effects on streamflow 2 1 data 2 1 1 streamflow data the streamflow data were obtained from the model parameter estimation experiment mopex duan et al 2006 schaake et al 2006 since the spatial and temporal extent of the mopex data is large and do not have missing values it is better suited for analysis related to decadal and multi decadal climatic oscillations wang and hejazi 2011 berghuijs et al 2016 we extracted approximately 80 years 1920 2002 of daily streamflow data across the contiguous united states fig 1 from mopex schaake et al 2006 datasets which are classified to be free of or minimally impacted by water management schaake et al 2006 monthly data were aggregated from daily data to evaluate the effects of climatic oscillations on streamflows 2 1 2 oceanic atmospheric phenomena indicators to identify teleconnections of climatic oscillations on streamflows we used monthly pdo enso amo and nao indices from the joint institute for the study of the atmosphere and ocean university of washington joint institute for the study of atmosphere and ocean jisao 2012 climate prediction center cpc national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa physical sciences division of the earth systems research laboratory noaa earth systems research laboratory esrl 2012 and national center for atmospheric research ncar respectively in this study we used the ni√±o 3 4 sst index ersst v3b as the enso index enso has three phases neutral phase is defined when ni√±o 3 4 index value is between 0 5 c and 0 5 c el ni√±o warm and la ni√±a cold phases correspond to the values above 0 5 c and below 0 5 c respectively the phases of amo and pdo i e positive warm and negative cold are defined based on positive and negative numerical values of sst anomalies table 1 the positive and negative phases of nao are defined based on positive and negative numerical values of mean slp anomalies table 1 2 2 statistical method 2 2 1 joint rank fit jrfit the nonparametric jrfit procedure extends the wilcoxon rank sum procedure to the estimation of mixed linear model parameters and their standard errors therefore it can be used for the analysis of models where the response variables exhibit cluster correlation kloke et al 2009 hettmansperger and mckean 2011 in this study the jrfit procedure was used to perform individual and coupled analyses the wilcoxon rank sum procedure has long been used in hydrological studies tootle et al 2005 johnson et al 2013 this was extended by jaeckel 1972 to the estimation of general linear models with independent responses and this procedure was extended to models with responses that are cluster correlated by kloke et al 2009 the new procedure named jrfit was shown to provide parameter estimators that are robust and efficient with an asymptotic normal distribution hence significance tests can be performed using wald type tests kloke et al 2009 effects of individual ocean atmospheric phenomena pdo enso nao and amo on streamflow were estimated using the simple linear model with binary regressor 1 s Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x Œµ where s represents the vector of streamflow values Œµ represents a vector of unobserved random errors and x represents a vector with x 0 and x 1 representing the positive warm and negative cold phases of the respective ocean atmospheric oscillation the magnitude of the slope coefficient Œ≤ 1 is the amount by which streamflow changes when ocean atmospheric oscillation changes phases cluster correlation in streamflow data on a monthly basis means that the variance covariance matrix of Œµ is block diagonal where each block represents a month jrfit provides an estimate of this matrix along with the regression coefficients note that in the case of independent responses then 1 becomes a simple linear model and the test of the hypothesis h Œ≤ 1 0 via jrfit becomes the wilcoxon rank sum test hettmansperger and mckean 2011 considering the wilcoxon rank sum test as a test of linear model parameters opens doors to studying more complicated effects of ocean atmospheric oscillations for instance we can study the interactive effects of ocean atmospheric oscillations on streamflow levels the statistical model for the interaction coupled effects of enso with other climate oscillations on streamflows was 2 s Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 Œ≤ 2 x 2 Œ≤ 3 x 1 x 2 Œµ where x 1 entries are 0 for la ni√±a phase and 1 for el ni√±o phase x 2 entries are 0 or negative phase of pdo nao amo and 1 for positive phase of pdo nao amo and x 1 x 2 is the component wise product of x 1 and x 2 thus Œ≤ 3 estimates the interactive effect of enso with other ocean atmospheric phenomena the significance of the interaction coefficient Œ≤ 3 represents the mitigation or enhancement of the effect of el ni√±o la ni√±a on streamflow due to change of phases of the other climatic oscillations under consideration 2 2 2 robust partial least squares generally partial least squares regression is the combination of principal component analysis and multiple regression it proceeds by extracting orthogonal latent variables from the predictor variables possessing optimal fit to the response computation of pls was facilitated by the statistically inspired modification of pls simpls algorithm de jong 1993 and pls can be constructed by their respective weight vectors or loadings wk and orthogonal components or scores t k xwk boulesteix and strimmer 2007 such that wk maximizes c o v t k y pls s x components explain variance in y with sequentially decreasing covariation pls is sensitive to outliers hence estimation of robust pls scores was important in this study in this research we used a rank based pls score estimation introduced in schneid 2015 this approach proceeds by replacing the covariance matrix in simpls computation by a robust covariance matrix based on ranks note that c o v t k y v a r t k v a r y œÅ t y where œÅ t y is the pearson product moment correlation between the scores t k and response y the approach proposed by schneid 2015 replaces œÅ t y by spearman s rank correlation coefficient œÅ t y s defined as 3 œÅ t y s c o r r r a n k t k r a n k y other proposed robust estimators of pls scores also use simpls and a robust covariance matrix estimated by a low dimensional projection of the data x y via a robust algorithm of principal component analysis hubert and branden 2003 however most of these procedures require complex computational algorithms m√∏ller et al 2005 kruger et al 2008 gonz√°lez et al 2009 the rank based approach using bivariate spearman s correlation estimates as a simple alternative for the robust covariance estimators is a simple approach that results in outlier resistant pls gil and romera 1998 m√∏ller et al 2005 serneels et al 2005 rousseeuw et al 2006 daszykowski et al 2007 2 2 3 false discovery rate correction since we make station by station tests of hypotheses we applied a false discovery rate correction using the step up fdr procedure of benjamini and hochberg 1995 to control the proportion of hypotheses that are falsely declared significant this is a common approach utilized when a large number of statistical tests are performed simultaneously and less stringent than family wise error rate controlling methods such as the bonferroni significance cutoff for fdr corrected p values is often chosen higher than 0 05 mcdonald 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 individual analysis the results from the non parametric jrfit procedure eq 1 for enso pdo amo and nao cycle are presented in figs 2 and 3 following an fdr correction for multiple comparisons the significant stations p 0 10 with the percentage change in estimated median streamflow for the phases of enso amo pdo and nao compared to the respective station long term medians are presented in fig 2 the comparison box and whisker plots showing the percentage change in median streamflows during the phases of enso amo pdo and nao for the nine climatic regions in the us is provided in fig 3 moreover the results from the non parametric pls analyses for all the climatic oscillations are presented in figs 4 and 5 pls coefficients indicating the strength and direction of the tele connections of enso pdo nao and amo cycles towards streamflow variability are provided in fig 4 fig 5 depicts similar information as fig 4 however it presents the range of pls coefficients for different regions we also report the scaling rates for different cycle i e the estimated effect in m3 s on regional median streamflow at one standard deviation change in the enso pdo amo and nao indices table 2 3 1 1 enso the jrfit results for enso indicate that all phases show significant teleconnection at all climatic regions except west and nr fig 2 the results are consistent with well established relationships of enso effects on streamflow levels in the southeast schmidt et al 2001 tootle et al 2005 johnson et al 2013 singh et al 2015 and northwest us harshburger et al 2002 beebee and manga 2004 in the southeast el ni√±o la ni√±a phases resulted in above below normal streamflows while in the northwest el ni√±o la ni√±a phases led to below above normal streamflows apart from these well established findings we also identified significant enso tele connections with streamflows in ne um south and the lower regions of ov fig 2 the stations in nw ne and lower ov showed decreased increased streamflows during el ni√±o la ni√±a phases while in the south and midwest regions el ni√±o la ni√±a phases resulted in higher lower than normal streamflows fig 3 streamflow levels in ne nw and ov were higher by approximately 10 15 and 8 compared to long term median fig 3 during la ni√±a conditions while for south se and um the streamflow levels were lower by 20 10 and 25 compared to long term median respectively fig 3 the results from pls regression analysis shows that the pls coefficient for enso index is highly positive indicating a strong positive teleconnection on streamflow levels i e streamflows increase with increase in enso sst for all regions in conus except ne nw and in some parts of ov fig 4 a and5 where major negative tele connections were found fig 4 a and 5 from fig 5 it is also evident that some stations in upper regions of se also showed positive correlations with enso fig 4 a and5 moreover the pls analysis also quantified the overall scaling rate of enso on streamflow levels across different regions in conus table 2 results show that one standard deviation increase in the enso index 0 8 resulted in an estimated regional median streamflow changes from long term median ranging from a drop of 7 47 m3 s in nw to an increase of 5 23 m3 s in the south table 2 3 1 2 pdo the pdo analysis identified climatic regions nw um ov se and s where pdo showed prominent teleconnections figs 2 and 3 nigam et al 1999 and tootle et al 2005 linked pdo tele connections to the um while beebee and manga 2004 and tootle et al 2005 indicated a pdo signal on pacific northwest streamflows however in this study we also identified stations in other climatic regions viz south lower regions in ov and se which indicated statistically significant tele connections with pdo this difference in results could be attributed to longer period of record and use of powerful non parametric approach in this study in nw and se positive negative phases of pdo resulted in decrease increase in streamflows while the opposite was true for sw um s and ov figs 2 and 3 for the nw and se climatic regions streamflow levels were 8 lower compared to long term medians during the pdo positive phase while being 10 and 8 higher compared to long term medians respectively during the pdo negative phase the results from pls regression analysis shows that the pls coefficient for pdo index is highly positive indicating a strong positive teleconnection on streamflow levels i e streamflows increase with increase in pdo sst for all regions in conus except nw ne northern regions of se and in lower parts of ov figs 4 b and5 where strong negative tele connections were found fig 4 b and5 results on scaling rate show that one standard deviation increase in the pdo index 1 11 resulted in an estimated regional median streamflow changes ranging from a drop of 7 52 m3 s for nw region and to an increase of 9 05 m3 s for the south table 2 3 1 3 amo the amo analysis identified significant tele connections across conus with particularly stronger tele connections along the east coast of the us fig 4 the study conducted by tootle et al 2005 identified negative streamflow correlations with amo phases in the upper to middle mississippi river basin lower appalachians gulf of mexico and southwest while identifying positive streamflow correlation in the northwest however the results of this study indicate a wider range of tele connections across the conus the streamflow levels were below above normal during the positive negative phase of amo in se ne s ov and um climatic regions while it was above normal in the nr sw nw and west irrespective of phases of amo figs 2 3 and 4 a study conducted by enfield et al 2001 also correlated the amo phases with precipitation across the us and identified that precipitation exhibited significant negative correlations with amo phases throughout the us except for in the pacific northwest negative amo phase streamflows were approximately 20 higher compared to the long term medians across all the climate regions while streamflow levels decreased by approximately 10 compared to long term medians during the positive phase for ne ov south se and um regions fig 3 the pls analysis results also showed that pls coefficient for pdo index is highly negative for most of the regions in conus fig 4 b results on scaling rates show that one standard deviation 0 14 increase in amo index leads to estimated regional median streamflow changes ranging from a drop of 16 77 m3 s in ov to an increase of 0 95 m3 s in the west table 2 it is important to note that the pls coefficients and scaling rates for amo are negative for all the regions with higher magnitudes compared to enso pdo and nao highlighting the strong negative teleconnection of amo with streamflows across the conus fig 4 and table 2 3 1 4 nao streamflow generally increased during nao positive phases showing an average increase of approximately 20 compared to long term medians across all the climate regions except the west fig 2 and 3 significant differences in streamflows were found in four distinct regions i e the ne ov south and um where most of the stations showed below normal streamflows approximately 10 25 during the nao negative phase fig 3 tootle et al 2005 found significant differences between the phases of nao and observed an increase streamflows during the positive phase than negative phase of nao in the upper to middle mississippi river basin um and ov only visbeck et al 2001 also identified significant correlations in ne the results from this study validate some of the results from the previous studies however the results from the current research also identified strong teleconnections in other climatic regions viz se s nr and nw the streamflow levels of these regions increased by approximately 8 25 compared to long term medians during the nao positive phase and decreased by 5 12 during the negative phase moreover the results from pls regression analysis also asserts that nao has positive teleconnections with streamflows across all the climatic regions except west fig 4 and 5 it was also found that the overall strength of teleconnection of nao on streamflows in conus was the least among the other climatic oscillations fig 4 an increase of one standard deviation 1 04 in the nao index leads to estimated regional median streamflow changes ranging from a drop of 1 52 m3 s in the west to an increase of 2 02 m3 s in ov region table 2 3 2 coupled analyses the jrfit estimate of interaction term in the linear mixed effect model eq 2 was used to measure the coupled effects of enso with pdo nao and amo on streamflow subsequently the fdr correction was applied to the interaction test significant p 0 10 interaction between enso and any other climate cycles for example pdo is an indicator of unequal modulation of the phases of enso by negative and positive phases of that cycle for example pdo following a significant interaction test simple main effect comparisons were performed by comparing the phases of pdo amo and nao with each phase of enso using jrfit stations that showed significant interactions following an fdr correction p 0 10 were identified and the percent differences of el ni√±o and la ni√±a streamflow medians from the station median when coupled with the phases of pdo amo and nao are presented in fig 6 fig 7 gives the percent differences of streamflow medians from long term station medians for el ni√±o and la ni√±a phases coupled with the positive and negative phases of pdo amo and nao including non significant stations broadly all climate regions exhibited significant coupled effects of enso and pdo as well as enso and amo on streamflow moreover the interaction effect of enso and nao was significant across all the climate regions except in the southeast where only a few stations were found to be significant due to the different types of interactions observed between decadal multidecadal cycles either amo pdo nao and enso we categorize the results in three major interaction types interaction type 1 positive and negative phases of decadal multidecadal cycles amo pdo nao are responsible for modulation of either phases of enso type 1 interaction are further subdivided into two types type 1a interaction when positive and negative phases of decadal multidecadal cycles amo pdo nao modulates el ni√±o phases only type 1b interaction when positive and negative phases of decadal multidecadal cycles amo pdo nao modulates la ni√±a phases only type 2 interaction a phase of decadal multidecadal cycle amo pdo nao modulates either both the phases of enso such that the sign of percentage streamflow change values for either both the phases of enso flip compared to the enso individual analysis type 3 interaction a phase of decadal multidecadal cycle amo pdo nao modulates either both the phases of enso such that the magnitude of streamflow change values for either both the phase of enso shifts considerably without flipping the sign compared to the enso individual analysis however the sign does not change it is important to note that the interaction type 1 and type 2 3 are not mutually exclusive i e type 1 can occur simultaneously with type 2 or type 3 while type 2 and type 3 interactions are by definition mutually exclusive 3 2 1 enso and pdo for the enso pdo analysis type 1 interactions are seen across almost all regions in conus strong influence of pdo negative and positive phases were observed on la ni√±a and el ni√±o streamflows respectively across the conus the most significant combinations are that of la ni√±a associated pdo negative phase and el ni√±o associated pdo positive phase which exhibited above normal streamflow in the nw and se respectively this is consistent with the findings of gershunov and barnett 1998 that pdo has strong influence on enso for sea level pressures and heavy daily precipitation in the contiguous united states and el ni√±o la ni√±a signals were found to be strong and stable during the positive negative pdo phase tootle et al 2005 identified that pdo influence el ni√±o streamflows in the upper to middle mississippi river basin only at higher significance level where the phases of pdo influence el ni√±o streamflow however but they failed to identify pdo enso interaction for the rest of the us in this study due to the introduction of jrfit interactive test the enso pdo interaction on streamflow levels was found to be significant across other climatic regions as well strong significant differences were observed in el ni√±o streamflows when associated with pdo positive and negative phases for the entire conus except for the sw west and nr fig 6 type 1a similarly significant differences were observed in la ni√±a streamflows when coupled with pdo negative and positive phases except for the south and nr regions fig 6 type 1b la ni√±a coupled with positive phases of pdo resulted in 25 decrease in streamflow in the se linked with extreme droughts in this region during these periods fig 7 however la ni√±a associated with the positive phase of pdo resulted in approximately 25 and 100 increase in streamflow in the sw and west respectively compared to overall la ni√±a phases fig 7 type 2 interactions are also seen in the enso pdo interaction analysis contrary to enso individual analysis it was found that for positive phase pdo streamflow levels were higher during the el ni√±o phase and lower during the la ni√±a phase for the ne and ov fig 6 and 7 similar type 2 interactions also suggest that el ni√±o is modulated by the negative phase of pdo in the nw um south and se the percent changes in median streamflow levels were above normal during el ni√±o phase associated with pdo negative phase for nw contrary to enso individual analysis also el ni√±o phase streamflows were below normal approximately 25 during pdo negative phase for the um south and se also contrary to the results of the enso individual analyses figs 6 and 7 these results derived from interaction tests clearly provides new insights on how the enso phases are modulated by the phases of pdo across conus that are contrary to the findings of individual analysis and have not reported in earlier literature studies tootle et al 2005 johnson et al 2013 bhandari et al 2018 tamaddun et al 2017a 2019 these findings also indicate that individual analysis results can sometimes be disinforming if not considered in conjunction of the interaction effects of other decadal multidecadal cycles 3 2 2 enso and amo interaction of enso streamflows due to amo cycles were observed at almost all regions in the conus several researchers have identified this modulation effect for se tootle et al 2005 and singh et al 2015 however in this study we found that the modulation effect exists for other regions in conus as well type 1 interactions were observed in nw um ov nr and west regions type 1a interactions were observed in the nw um and ov where highly significant differences in el ni√±o streamflows when associated with amo positive and negative phases fig 6 similarly type 1b interactions were observed in entire conus region with the exception of nr um and west where significant differences were observed in la ni√±a streamflows when associated with amo positive and negative phases type 2 interaction were observed in some parts of conus as well contrary to the results in enso individual analysis la ni√±a events occurring in an amo positive phase result in decreased streamflow in the ne ov and sw this indicates that la ni√±a does not always cause wetter conditions in these regions rather when associated with amo positive phase can lead to drier conditions in these regions similarly type 2 interactions were also observed in south and se regions significant differences in la ni√±a streamflow levels were observed in these regions when associated with the positive and negative phases of amo as per individual enso analysis la ni√±a events lead to decreased streamflow levels in the south and se figs 6 however la ni√±a events coinciding with the amo negative phase result in above normal streamflow levels countering la ni√±a s negative effect on streamflows in this region type 3 interaction was also observed in the amo enso analysis la ni√±a coupled with amo positive resulted in significantly greater reduction approximately 35 in streamflow than individual la ni√±a phase fig 7 leading to severe droughts in the se and south regions moreover the percentage changes in median streamflows were above normal approximately 15 and below normal approximately 25 during el ni√±o amo positive phase in nw and um respectively compared to individual el ni√±o phase fig 7 3 2 3 enso and nao for enso nao a significant association was seen for el ni√±o with nao phases in um nw and nr regions however la ni√±a association with nao phases were not significant in the conus region from the individual analysis it was found that an el ni√±o phase usually led to an increased streamflow in the um however when coinciding with nao negative phase figs 6 and 7 resulted in below normal streamflow type 2 interaction this result asserts the findings from tootle et al 2005 however in this study different interactions with respect to enso nao were also observed el ni√±o associated with the positive phase of nao resulted in greater increase in streamflow approximately 100 in the um suggesting a modulation effect of both phases of nao on el ni√±o streamflow levels type 1a interaction in nr region el ni√±o during nao negative phase resulted in greater increase in streamflow compared to individual enso approximately 80 type 3 interaction fig 7 higher than normal streamflows were identified in nw during the el ni√±o phase occurring in an nao negative phase which differs from the enso individual analysis where streamflow levels were below normal during el ni√±o phases type 2 interaction moreover el ni√±o phase occurring in an nao positive phase resulted in a greater decrease in streamflow levels approximately 20 as compared to individual el ni√±o results approximately 5 type 3 interaction 4 conclusions this study systematically investigates the relationships between interdecadal and interannual ocean atmospheric phenomena on streamflow levels across nine climate regions of the conus this research made a number of novel contributions towards the understanding of the interplay between large scale interannual and multidecadal ocean atmospheric oscillations and its connection to conus streamflow levels using powerful and robust statistical procedures previous studies used common statistical procedures viz wavelet analysis and wrs to detect teleconnections and infer the interaction between enso and other decadal and multi decadal climate cycles without performing interaction test tootle et al 2005 johnson et al 2013 mitra et al 2014 bhandari et al 2018 tamaddun et al 2019a however in this study we model the interactions using the interaction test to identify newer interactions that were not reported in earlier literature we tested and evaluated the interactions interaction test between enso and other large scale oscillations by directly modelling the interaction using a non parametric lme model we also used a powerful statistical procedure jrfit to fit the mixed effects model and estimate the individual and coupled effects of climatic oscillations on streamflow levels further we quantify the magnitude of the modulation scaling rates teleconnection strength across climate zones in the conus the entire study was divided into individual and coupled analysis the major and new findings in the individual analysis are summarized below 1 in the individual enso analysis almost all the regions showed significant tele connections in this study several new tele connections were also identified viz in ne um west south and the lower regions of ov 2 in pdo individual analysis several regions were identified having tele connections with pdo however in this study south lower regions in ov and se also indicated statistically significant teleconnections with pdo that were not reported in earlier literature 3 the negative correlation of amo with streamflow was apparent across climate regions however some new areas exhibiting significant positive correlation where streamflow increased during positive amo phase were identified in the west and some parts of northwest nr and sw 4 the effect of nao on streamflow levels was found to be positive across all the climatic regions except west sw and nw regions where streamflow decreased during nao negative phase newer tele connections were observed in se s nr and nw 5 the pls coefficients and scaling rates for amo highlight the strong negative tele connection of amo with streamflows across the conus compared to enso pdo and nao coupled analysis reveal the interplay between large scale interannual and decadal variations in climate e g the relationship between the enso with pdo amo and nao which may modulate the teleconnections with streamflow in conus region the study presented here contributes to an improved understanding of how interdecadal phenomena modulate the effect of enso and its impact on streamflow levels in the nine climate regions across the us through interaction test between enso with amo pdo and nao three types of interaction results were identified some of the major and newer findings in the coupled analysis are summarized below 1 significant type 1 enso pdo interactions are seen across all regions in conus such interactions were also observed for enso amo at majority of the regions in conus nw um ov nr um and west 2 type 2 interactions discovered in this study were interesting as they generally go against the results of enso individual analysis for example contrary to the results in enso individual analysis la ni√±a events occurring in an amo positive phase result in decreased streamflow in the ne ov and sw this indicates that la ni√±a does not always cause wetter conditions in these regions rather when associated with amo positive phase can lead to drier conditions in these regions similar type 2 interactions were found for all enso pdo enso amo and enso nao coupled analysis 3 type 3 interactions involve where the results of the enso individual analysis are enhanced due to the interaction of the phases of enso with other cycles for example la ni√±a coupled with amo positive resulted in significantly greater reduction approximately 35 in streamflow than individual la ni√±a phase prominent type 3 interactions were observed with enso amo analysis in the se and south regions moreover in enso nao analysis type 3 interactions were observed in nw and nr regions the results from this study will be helpful in development of better forecasting tools studies have shown that incorporating large scale climate information could lead us to more accurate specificity hydrological forecasts with increase in the lead times signals grantz et al 2005 abrishamchi et al 2006 singh 2016 this current research will help provide important information to water managers responsible for predicting streamflow variability in response to ocean atmospheric oscillations in conus it would also help regional water managers in forecasting regional water availability hydropower generation and help them develop drought adaptation and mitigation strategies by incorporating information based on the large scale ocean atmospheric cycles it is however important to note that the entire analysis is based on non parametric statistics that is primarily data driven and does not consider the physical processes involved in modelling the modulation interaction effect therefore model based studies are needed to validate the findings of this study moreover the record length of 80 years of streamflow data is still limited when considering the analysis with respect to multidecadal cycles as very only few phases of each cycle can be considered especially for modelling interactions limiting the robustness of the results code availability the r codes used in this study can be made available by writing to the

8221,study region the contiguous united states conus study focus this study assesses the effects of the large scale oceanic atmospheric oscillations such as el ni√±o southern oscillation enso atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo north atlantic oscillation nao and pacific decadal oscillation pdo on streamflow levels two robust and powerful non parametric procedures namely the joint rank fit jrfit and the rank based partial least squares regression are used to identify and quantify the strength and direction of teleconnections individual analysis further jrfit is used to model the interactive effects coupled analysis of enso with amo pdo nao cycles on streamflows new hydrological insights for the region individual analysis results identified new significant enso pdo amo and nao tele connections with streamflows across conus pls analysis showed a stronger amo teleconnection with streamflows compared to other oscillations the coupled analyses results were categorized into three groups based on the types of interactions of the enso phases type 1 interactions where a phase of enso is modulated by phases of decadal multidecadal cycles are seen across all majority of regions in conus interesting results were obtained for type 2 type 3 interactions as the effects of enso phases were opposite similar but enhanced compared to individual analysis of enso when associated with the phases of pdo amo nao the results provide several new findings and useful information for forecasting of water resources in the conus region keywords streamflow pls jrfit enso pdo amo 1 introduction el ni√±o southern oscillation enso centered in the equatorial pacific is one of the most studied ocean atmospheric phenomena of tropical air sea interactions its tele connections to climate variations in the contiguous us on inter annual timescales for a periodicity of 2 7 years are well documented walker 1923 kousky et al 1984 ropelewski and halpert 1989 diaz and markgraf 1992 2000 gershunov and barnett 1998 dai and wigley 2000 goodrich 2007 similar to enso the pacific decadal oscillation pdo atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and north atlantic oscillation nao are also large scale oceanic atmospheric phenomena responsible for warming or cooling of the pacific and atlantic ocean respectively however they oscillate at different periodicities decadal to multi decadal in the recent past studies have generated greater interest related enso and other decadal multidecadal climate cycles such as pdo nao and amo and their effect on meteorological and hydrological parameters tootle et al 2005 araghinejad et al 2006 johnson et al 2013 mitra et al 2014 singh et al 2015 2016 tamaddun et al 2019a 2019b several studies have investigated the tele connections between sea conditions in the atlantic and pacific oceans sea surface temperatures with regional precipitation and streamflow chiew et al 1998 schmidt et al 2001 sen et al 2004 tootle and piechota 2004 murgulet et al 2017 streamflows in the united states have shown significant tele connections to enso chiew and mcmahon 2002 dracup and kahya 1994 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 johnson et al 2013 tamaddun et al 2017a pdo hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 singh et al 2015 tamaddun et al 2017a amo and nao tootle and piechota 2006 singh et al 2015 recent research has focused on coupling of the interannual enso with other decadal multidecadal climatic oscillations such as pdo amo and nao studies have shown that pdo modulates the strength of enso teleconnections to precipitation and droughts cayan et al 1998 gershunov and barnett 1998 mccabe et al 2004 similarly enfield et al 2001 evaluated the impact of amo on precipitation and found that most of the us experiences below normal precipitation during amo positive phase rajagopalan et al 2000 studied the coupled interactions of enso with pdo and nao on meteorological droughts using the palmer drought severity index coupled studies have also been conducted with respect to streamflows at a regional scale in the united states hidalgo and dracup 2001 rogers and coleman 2003 johnson et al 2013 singh et al 2015 murgulet et al 2017 tamaddun et al 2017a as these studies are regional in nature they fail to provide information at a larger conus scale it is important to consider the conus as a whole for the evaluation and not limit to regional scale in order to understand the effect of large scale oscillations on contiguous hydrology therefore a study by tootle et al 2005 showed significant modulation of enso behavior dependent on the phases of amo and pdo throughout the conus they indicated that enso phase streamflows in the conus are influenced by other decadal and multidecadal oscillations however the study used the non parametric statistical wilcoxon rank sum test wrs to infer the interaction between enso and other decadal multidecadal climate cycles without directly modelling the interaction effect interaction test also singh et al 2018 showed that the wrs test fails to account for monthly and seasonal cluster correlations within the data which might indicate erroneous results further the study also failed to quantify the magnitude of the modulation across different regions and or climate zones in the conus apart from that the strength of teleconnections and scaling rate change in streamflow with one standard deviation change in climate index of enso pdo amo and nao towards streamflow variability across the regions in the contiguous united states have not been quantified the quantification of the modulation magnitude scaling rate teleconnection strength and interaction test would indicate provide predictive ability that can be helpful in forecasting of streamflows and water resources availability in the conus singh et al 2018 therefore in this study we revisit the topic of large scale ocean atmospheric cycle modulations on us streamflows and performed a comprehensive investigation on the interactive effect of climatic oscillations i e enso nao pdo and amo on streamflows in the entire conus using robust and efficient statistical procedures we tested and evaluated the interactions interaction test between enso and other large scale oscillations by directly modelling the interaction using a non parametric linear mixed effects lme model we used a powerful statistical procedure called joint rank fit jrfit kloke et al 2009 singh et al 2018 to fit the mixed effects model and estimate the individual and coupled effects of climatic oscillations on streamflow levels for different regions across the conus the jrfit model is able to efficiently model the interaction of two climate phenomena and works well for cluster correlated datasets singh et al 2018 moreover the strength of tele connection and scaling rate between the ocean atmospheric cycles and streamflow levels were also quantified using a non parametric rank based partial least square pls regression analysis we also perform false discovery rate fdr analysis to test for false discovery rates in multiple hypothesis testing benjamini and hochberg 1995 overall with the help of these statistical analysis we identify and highlight new modulations interactions by classifying the interactions into three major types of interactions in the conus region that were missed in the earlier studies further this study is conducted over an extended period of historic data compared to tootle et al 2005 that is required to more accurately and comprehensively evaluate the effect of inter decadal phenomena on hydrologic variables with a greater number of stations higher record of data and a powerful statistical technique this comprehensive study provides a holistic picture of the effect of ocean atmospheric cycles on streamflow levels across different climate zones in conus karl and koss 1984 which greatly adds to the current knowledge the outcomes of this study will be helpful in developing streamflow forecasting frameworks across the conus region which incorporate climate oscillation information incorporating the information from ocean atmospheric phenomena such as enso nao pdo and amo into the forecaster s toolbox can greatly improve the lead time in streamflow forecasting tootle et al 2005 araghinejad et al 2006 2 methodology a robust and powerful nonparametric model fitting procedure known as jrfit procedure kloke et al 2009 is applied to test and quantify the individual impacts of the phases of enso nao pdo and amo on streamflows moreover a rank based pls approach is introduced to estimate the strength and direction of teleconnection effect of enso amo pdo and nao on streamflow fluctuations interaction tests between enso and the other climatic oscillations are performed to evaluate the modulation by nao amo and pdo of enso effects on streamflow 2 1 data 2 1 1 streamflow data the streamflow data were obtained from the model parameter estimation experiment mopex duan et al 2006 schaake et al 2006 since the spatial and temporal extent of the mopex data is large and do not have missing values it is better suited for analysis related to decadal and multi decadal climatic oscillations wang and hejazi 2011 berghuijs et al 2016 we extracted approximately 80 years 1920 2002 of daily streamflow data across the contiguous united states fig 1 from mopex schaake et al 2006 datasets which are classified to be free of or minimally impacted by water management schaake et al 2006 monthly data were aggregated from daily data to evaluate the effects of climatic oscillations on streamflows 2 1 2 oceanic atmospheric phenomena indicators to identify teleconnections of climatic oscillations on streamflows we used monthly pdo enso amo and nao indices from the joint institute for the study of the atmosphere and ocean university of washington joint institute for the study of atmosphere and ocean jisao 2012 climate prediction center cpc national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa physical sciences division of the earth systems research laboratory noaa earth systems research laboratory esrl 2012 and national center for atmospheric research ncar respectively in this study we used the ni√±o 3 4 sst index ersst v3b as the enso index enso has three phases neutral phase is defined when ni√±o 3 4 index value is between 0 5 c and 0 5 c el ni√±o warm and la ni√±a cold phases correspond to the values above 0 5 c and below 0 5 c respectively the phases of amo and pdo i e positive warm and negative cold are defined based on positive and negative numerical values of sst anomalies table 1 the positive and negative phases of nao are defined based on positive and negative numerical values of mean slp anomalies table 1 2 2 statistical method 2 2 1 joint rank fit jrfit the nonparametric jrfit procedure extends the wilcoxon rank sum procedure to the estimation of mixed linear model parameters and their standard errors therefore it can be used for the analysis of models where the response variables exhibit cluster correlation kloke et al 2009 hettmansperger and mckean 2011 in this study the jrfit procedure was used to perform individual and coupled analyses the wilcoxon rank sum procedure has long been used in hydrological studies tootle et al 2005 johnson et al 2013 this was extended by jaeckel 1972 to the estimation of general linear models with independent responses and this procedure was extended to models with responses that are cluster correlated by kloke et al 2009 the new procedure named jrfit was shown to provide parameter estimators that are robust and efficient with an asymptotic normal distribution hence significance tests can be performed using wald type tests kloke et al 2009 effects of individual ocean atmospheric phenomena pdo enso nao and amo on streamflow were estimated using the simple linear model with binary regressor 1 s Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x Œµ where s represents the vector of streamflow values Œµ represents a vector of unobserved random errors and x represents a vector with x 0 and x 1 representing the positive warm and negative cold phases of the respective ocean atmospheric oscillation the magnitude of the slope coefficient Œ≤ 1 is the amount by which streamflow changes when ocean atmospheric oscillation changes phases cluster correlation in streamflow data on a monthly basis means that the variance covariance matrix of Œµ is block diagonal where each block represents a month jrfit provides an estimate of this matrix along with the regression coefficients note that in the case of independent responses then 1 becomes a simple linear model and the test of the hypothesis h Œ≤ 1 0 via jrfit becomes the wilcoxon rank sum test hettmansperger and mckean 2011 considering the wilcoxon rank sum test as a test of linear model parameters opens doors to studying more complicated effects of ocean atmospheric oscillations for instance we can study the interactive effects of ocean atmospheric oscillations on streamflow levels the statistical model for the interaction coupled effects of enso with other climate oscillations on streamflows was 2 s Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 Œ≤ 2 x 2 Œ≤ 3 x 1 x 2 Œµ where x 1 entries are 0 for la ni√±a phase and 1 for el ni√±o phase x 2 entries are 0 or negative phase of pdo nao amo and 1 for positive phase of pdo nao amo and x 1 x 2 is the component wise product of x 1 and x 2 thus Œ≤ 3 estimates the interactive effect of enso with other ocean atmospheric phenomena the significance of the interaction coefficient Œ≤ 3 represents the mitigation or enhancement of the effect of el ni√±o la ni√±a on streamflow due to change of phases of the other climatic oscillations under consideration 2 2 2 robust partial least squares generally partial least squares regression is the combination of principal component analysis and multiple regression it proceeds by extracting orthogonal latent variables from the predictor variables possessing optimal fit to the response computation of pls was facilitated by the statistically inspired modification of pls simpls algorithm de jong 1993 and pls can be constructed by their respective weight vectors or loadings wk and orthogonal components or scores t k xwk boulesteix and strimmer 2007 such that wk maximizes c o v t k y pls s x components explain variance in y with sequentially decreasing covariation pls is sensitive to outliers hence estimation of robust pls scores was important in this study in this research we used a rank based pls score estimation introduced in schneid 2015 this approach proceeds by replacing the covariance matrix in simpls computation by a robust covariance matrix based on ranks note that c o v t k y v a r t k v a r y œÅ t y where œÅ t y is the pearson product moment correlation between the scores t k and response y the approach proposed by schneid 2015 replaces œÅ t y by spearman s rank correlation coefficient œÅ t y s defined as 3 œÅ t y s c o r r r a n k t k r a n k y other proposed robust estimators of pls scores also use simpls and a robust covariance matrix estimated by a low dimensional projection of the data x y via a robust algorithm of principal component analysis hubert and branden 2003 however most of these procedures require complex computational algorithms m√∏ller et al 2005 kruger et al 2008 gonz√°lez et al 2009 the rank based approach using bivariate spearman s correlation estimates as a simple alternative for the robust covariance estimators is a simple approach that results in outlier resistant pls gil and romera 1998 m√∏ller et al 2005 serneels et al 2005 rousseeuw et al 2006 daszykowski et al 2007 2 2 3 false discovery rate correction since we make station by station tests of hypotheses we applied a false discovery rate correction using the step up fdr procedure of benjamini and hochberg 1995 to control the proportion of hypotheses that are falsely declared significant this is a common approach utilized when a large number of statistical tests are performed simultaneously and less stringent than family wise error rate controlling methods such as the bonferroni significance cutoff for fdr corrected p values is often chosen higher than 0 05 mcdonald 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 individual analysis the results from the non parametric jrfit procedure eq 1 for enso pdo amo and nao cycle are presented in figs 2 and 3 following an fdr correction for multiple comparisons the significant stations p 0 10 with the percentage change in estimated median streamflow for the phases of enso amo pdo and nao compared to the respective station long term medians are presented in fig 2 the comparison box and whisker plots showing the percentage change in median streamflows during the phases of enso amo pdo and nao for the nine climatic regions in the us is provided in fig 3 moreover the results from the non parametric pls analyses for all the climatic oscillations are presented in figs 4 and 5 pls coefficients indicating the strength and direction of the tele connections of enso pdo nao and amo cycles towards streamflow variability are provided in fig 4 fig 5 depicts similar information as fig 4 however it presents the range of pls coefficients for different regions we also report the scaling rates for different cycle i e the estimated effect in m3 s on regional median streamflow at one standard deviation change in the enso pdo amo and nao indices table 2 3 1 1 enso the jrfit results for enso indicate that all phases show significant teleconnection at all climatic regions except west and nr fig 2 the results are consistent with well established relationships of enso effects on streamflow levels in the southeast schmidt et al 2001 tootle et al 2005 johnson et al 2013 singh et al 2015 and northwest us harshburger et al 2002 beebee and manga 2004 in the southeast el ni√±o la ni√±a phases resulted in above below normal streamflows while in the northwest el ni√±o la ni√±a phases led to below above normal streamflows apart from these well established findings we also identified significant enso tele connections with streamflows in ne um south and the lower regions of ov fig 2 the stations in nw ne and lower ov showed decreased increased streamflows during el ni√±o la ni√±a phases while in the south and midwest regions el ni√±o la ni√±a phases resulted in higher lower than normal streamflows fig 3 streamflow levels in ne nw and ov were higher by approximately 10 15 and 8 compared to long term median fig 3 during la ni√±a conditions while for south se and um the streamflow levels were lower by 20 10 and 25 compared to long term median respectively fig 3 the results from pls regression analysis shows that the pls coefficient for enso index is highly positive indicating a strong positive teleconnection on streamflow levels i e streamflows increase with increase in enso sst for all regions in conus except ne nw and in some parts of ov fig 4 a and5 where major negative tele connections were found fig 4 a and 5 from fig 5 it is also evident that some stations in upper regions of se also showed positive correlations with enso fig 4 a and5 moreover the pls analysis also quantified the overall scaling rate of enso on streamflow levels across different regions in conus table 2 results show that one standard deviation increase in the enso index 0 8 resulted in an estimated regional median streamflow changes from long term median ranging from a drop of 7 47 m3 s in nw to an increase of 5 23 m3 s in the south table 2 3 1 2 pdo the pdo analysis identified climatic regions nw um ov se and s where pdo showed prominent teleconnections figs 2 and 3 nigam et al 1999 and tootle et al 2005 linked pdo tele connections to the um while beebee and manga 2004 and tootle et al 2005 indicated a pdo signal on pacific northwest streamflows however in this study we also identified stations in other climatic regions viz south lower regions in ov and se which indicated statistically significant tele connections with pdo this difference in results could be attributed to longer period of record and use of powerful non parametric approach in this study in nw and se positive negative phases of pdo resulted in decrease increase in streamflows while the opposite was true for sw um s and ov figs 2 and 3 for the nw and se climatic regions streamflow levels were 8 lower compared to long term medians during the pdo positive phase while being 10 and 8 higher compared to long term medians respectively during the pdo negative phase the results from pls regression analysis shows that the pls coefficient for pdo index is highly positive indicating a strong positive teleconnection on streamflow levels i e streamflows increase with increase in pdo sst for all regions in conus except nw ne northern regions of se and in lower parts of ov figs 4 b and5 where strong negative tele connections were found fig 4 b and5 results on scaling rate show that one standard deviation increase in the pdo index 1 11 resulted in an estimated regional median streamflow changes ranging from a drop of 7 52 m3 s for nw region and to an increase of 9 05 m3 s for the south table 2 3 1 3 amo the amo analysis identified significant tele connections across conus with particularly stronger tele connections along the east coast of the us fig 4 the study conducted by tootle et al 2005 identified negative streamflow correlations with amo phases in the upper to middle mississippi river basin lower appalachians gulf of mexico and southwest while identifying positive streamflow correlation in the northwest however the results of this study indicate a wider range of tele connections across the conus the streamflow levels were below above normal during the positive negative phase of amo in se ne s ov and um climatic regions while it was above normal in the nr sw nw and west irrespective of phases of amo figs 2 3 and 4 a study conducted by enfield et al 2001 also correlated the amo phases with precipitation across the us and identified that precipitation exhibited significant negative correlations with amo phases throughout the us except for in the pacific northwest negative amo phase streamflows were approximately 20 higher compared to the long term medians across all the climate regions while streamflow levels decreased by approximately 10 compared to long term medians during the positive phase for ne ov south se and um regions fig 3 the pls analysis results also showed that pls coefficient for pdo index is highly negative for most of the regions in conus fig 4 b results on scaling rates show that one standard deviation 0 14 increase in amo index leads to estimated regional median streamflow changes ranging from a drop of 16 77 m3 s in ov to an increase of 0 95 m3 s in the west table 2 it is important to note that the pls coefficients and scaling rates for amo are negative for all the regions with higher magnitudes compared to enso pdo and nao highlighting the strong negative teleconnection of amo with streamflows across the conus fig 4 and table 2 3 1 4 nao streamflow generally increased during nao positive phases showing an average increase of approximately 20 compared to long term medians across all the climate regions except the west fig 2 and 3 significant differences in streamflows were found in four distinct regions i e the ne ov south and um where most of the stations showed below normal streamflows approximately 10 25 during the nao negative phase fig 3 tootle et al 2005 found significant differences between the phases of nao and observed an increase streamflows during the positive phase than negative phase of nao in the upper to middle mississippi river basin um and ov only visbeck et al 2001 also identified significant correlations in ne the results from this study validate some of the results from the previous studies however the results from the current research also identified strong teleconnections in other climatic regions viz se s nr and nw the streamflow levels of these regions increased by approximately 8 25 compared to long term medians during the nao positive phase and decreased by 5 12 during the negative phase moreover the results from pls regression analysis also asserts that nao has positive teleconnections with streamflows across all the climatic regions except west fig 4 and 5 it was also found that the overall strength of teleconnection of nao on streamflows in conus was the least among the other climatic oscillations fig 4 an increase of one standard deviation 1 04 in the nao index leads to estimated regional median streamflow changes ranging from a drop of 1 52 m3 s in the west to an increase of 2 02 m3 s in ov region table 2 3 2 coupled analyses the jrfit estimate of interaction term in the linear mixed effect model eq 2 was used to measure the coupled effects of enso with pdo nao and amo on streamflow subsequently the fdr correction was applied to the interaction test significant p 0 10 interaction between enso and any other climate cycles for example pdo is an indicator of unequal modulation of the phases of enso by negative and positive phases of that cycle for example pdo following a significant interaction test simple main effect comparisons were performed by comparing the phases of pdo amo and nao with each phase of enso using jrfit stations that showed significant interactions following an fdr correction p 0 10 were identified and the percent differences of el ni√±o and la ni√±a streamflow medians from the station median when coupled with the phases of pdo amo and nao are presented in fig 6 fig 7 gives the percent differences of streamflow medians from long term station medians for el ni√±o and la ni√±a phases coupled with the positive and negative phases of pdo amo and nao including non significant stations broadly all climate regions exhibited significant coupled effects of enso and pdo as well as enso and amo on streamflow moreover the interaction effect of enso and nao was significant across all the climate regions except in the southeast where only a few stations were found to be significant due to the different types of interactions observed between decadal multidecadal cycles either amo pdo nao and enso we categorize the results in three major interaction types interaction type 1 positive and negative phases of decadal multidecadal cycles amo pdo nao are responsible for modulation of either phases of enso type 1 interaction are further subdivided into two types type 1a interaction when positive and negative phases of decadal multidecadal cycles amo pdo nao modulates el ni√±o phases only type 1b interaction when positive and negative phases of decadal multidecadal cycles amo pdo nao modulates la ni√±a phases only type 2 interaction a phase of decadal multidecadal cycle amo pdo nao modulates either both the phases of enso such that the sign of percentage streamflow change values for either both the phases of enso flip compared to the enso individual analysis type 3 interaction a phase of decadal multidecadal cycle amo pdo nao modulates either both the phases of enso such that the magnitude of streamflow change values for either both the phase of enso shifts considerably without flipping the sign compared to the enso individual analysis however the sign does not change it is important to note that the interaction type 1 and type 2 3 are not mutually exclusive i e type 1 can occur simultaneously with type 2 or type 3 while type 2 and type 3 interactions are by definition mutually exclusive 3 2 1 enso and pdo for the enso pdo analysis type 1 interactions are seen across almost all regions in conus strong influence of pdo negative and positive phases were observed on la ni√±a and el ni√±o streamflows respectively across the conus the most significant combinations are that of la ni√±a associated pdo negative phase and el ni√±o associated pdo positive phase which exhibited above normal streamflow in the nw and se respectively this is consistent with the findings of gershunov and barnett 1998 that pdo has strong influence on enso for sea level pressures and heavy daily precipitation in the contiguous united states and el ni√±o la ni√±a signals were found to be strong and stable during the positive negative pdo phase tootle et al 2005 identified that pdo influence el ni√±o streamflows in the upper to middle mississippi river basin only at higher significance level where the phases of pdo influence el ni√±o streamflow however but they failed to identify pdo enso interaction for the rest of the us in this study due to the introduction of jrfit interactive test the enso pdo interaction on streamflow levels was found to be significant across other climatic regions as well strong significant differences were observed in el ni√±o streamflows when associated with pdo positive and negative phases for the entire conus except for the sw west and nr fig 6 type 1a similarly significant differences were observed in la ni√±a streamflows when coupled with pdo negative and positive phases except for the south and nr regions fig 6 type 1b la ni√±a coupled with positive phases of pdo resulted in 25 decrease in streamflow in the se linked with extreme droughts in this region during these periods fig 7 however la ni√±a associated with the positive phase of pdo resulted in approximately 25 and 100 increase in streamflow in the sw and west respectively compared to overall la ni√±a phases fig 7 type 2 interactions are also seen in the enso pdo interaction analysis contrary to enso individual analysis it was found that for positive phase pdo streamflow levels were higher during the el ni√±o phase and lower during the la ni√±a phase for the ne and ov fig 6 and 7 similar type 2 interactions also suggest that el ni√±o is modulated by the negative phase of pdo in the nw um south and se the percent changes in median streamflow levels were above normal during el ni√±o phase associated with pdo negative phase for nw contrary to enso individual analysis also el ni√±o phase streamflows were below normal approximately 25 during pdo negative phase for the um south and se also contrary to the results of the enso individual analyses figs 6 and 7 these results derived from interaction tests clearly provides new insights on how the enso phases are modulated by the phases of pdo across conus that are contrary to the findings of individual analysis and have not reported in earlier literature studies tootle et al 2005 johnson et al 2013 bhandari et al 2018 tamaddun et al 2017a 2019 these findings also indicate that individual analysis results can sometimes be disinforming if not considered in conjunction of the interaction effects of other decadal multidecadal cycles 3 2 2 enso and amo interaction of enso streamflows due to amo cycles were observed at almost all regions in the conus several researchers have identified this modulation effect for se tootle et al 2005 and singh et al 2015 however in this study we found that the modulation effect exists for other regions in conus as well type 1 interactions were observed in nw um ov nr and west regions type 1a interactions were observed in the nw um and ov where highly significant differences in el ni√±o streamflows when associated with amo positive and negative phases fig 6 similarly type 1b interactions were observed in entire conus region with the exception of nr um and west where significant differences were observed in la ni√±a streamflows when associated with amo positive and negative phases type 2 interaction were observed in some parts of conus as well contrary to the results in enso individual analysis la ni√±a events occurring in an amo positive phase result in decreased streamflow in the ne ov and sw this indicates that la ni√±a does not always cause wetter conditions in these regions rather when associated with amo positive phase can lead to drier conditions in these regions similarly type 2 interactions were also observed in south and se regions significant differences in la ni√±a streamflow levels were observed in these regions when associated with the positive and negative phases of amo as per individual enso analysis la ni√±a events lead to decreased streamflow levels in the south and se figs 6 however la ni√±a events coinciding with the amo negative phase result in above normal streamflow levels countering la ni√±a s negative effect on streamflows in this region type 3 interaction was also observed in the amo enso analysis la ni√±a coupled with amo positive resulted in significantly greater reduction approximately 35 in streamflow than individual la ni√±a phase fig 7 leading to severe droughts in the se and south regions moreover the percentage changes in median streamflows were above normal approximately 15 and below normal approximately 25 during el ni√±o amo positive phase in nw and um respectively compared to individual el ni√±o phase fig 7 3 2 3 enso and nao for enso nao a significant association was seen for el ni√±o with nao phases in um nw and nr regions however la ni√±a association with nao phases were not significant in the conus region from the individual analysis it was found that an el ni√±o phase usually led to an increased streamflow in the um however when coinciding with nao negative phase figs 6 and 7 resulted in below normal streamflow type 2 interaction this result asserts the findings from tootle et al 2005 however in this study different interactions with respect to enso nao were also observed el ni√±o associated with the positive phase of nao resulted in greater increase in streamflow approximately 100 in the um suggesting a modulation effect of both phases of nao on el ni√±o streamflow levels type 1a interaction in nr region el ni√±o during nao negative phase resulted in greater increase in streamflow compared to individual enso approximately 80 type 3 interaction fig 7 higher than normal streamflows were identified in nw during the el ni√±o phase occurring in an nao negative phase which differs from the enso individual analysis where streamflow levels were below normal during el ni√±o phases type 2 interaction moreover el ni√±o phase occurring in an nao positive phase resulted in a greater decrease in streamflow levels approximately 20 as compared to individual el ni√±o results approximately 5 type 3 interaction 4 conclusions this study systematically investigates the relationships between interdecadal and interannual ocean atmospheric phenomena on streamflow levels across nine climate regions of the conus this research made a number of novel contributions towards the understanding of the interplay between large scale interannual and multidecadal ocean atmospheric oscillations and its connection to conus streamflow levels using powerful and robust statistical procedures previous studies used common statistical procedures viz wavelet analysis and wrs to detect teleconnections and infer the interaction between enso and other decadal and multi decadal climate cycles without performing interaction test tootle et al 2005 johnson et al 2013 mitra et al 2014 bhandari et al 2018 tamaddun et al 2019a however in this study we model the interactions using the interaction test to identify newer interactions that were not reported in earlier literature we tested and evaluated the interactions interaction test between enso and other large scale oscillations by directly modelling the interaction using a non parametric lme model we also used a powerful statistical procedure jrfit to fit the mixed effects model and estimate the individual and coupled effects of climatic oscillations on streamflow levels further we quantify the magnitude of the modulation scaling rates teleconnection strength across climate zones in the conus the entire study was divided into individual and coupled analysis the major and new findings in the individual analysis are summarized below 1 in the individual enso analysis almost all the regions showed significant tele connections in this study several new tele connections were also identified viz in ne um west south and the lower regions of ov 2 in pdo individual analysis several regions were identified having tele connections with pdo however in this study south lower regions in ov and se also indicated statistically significant teleconnections with pdo that were not reported in earlier literature 3 the negative correlation of amo with streamflow was apparent across climate regions however some new areas exhibiting significant positive correlation where streamflow increased during positive amo phase were identified in the west and some parts of northwest nr and sw 4 the effect of nao on streamflow levels was found to be positive across all the climatic regions except west sw and nw regions where streamflow decreased during nao negative phase newer tele connections were observed in se s nr and nw 5 the pls coefficients and scaling rates for amo highlight the strong negative tele connection of amo with streamflows across the conus compared to enso pdo and nao coupled analysis reveal the interplay between large scale interannual and decadal variations in climate e g the relationship between the enso with pdo amo and nao which may modulate the teleconnections with streamflow in conus region the study presented here contributes to an improved understanding of how interdecadal phenomena modulate the effect of enso and its impact on streamflow levels in the nine climate regions across the us through interaction test between enso with amo pdo and nao three types of interaction results were identified some of the major and newer findings in the coupled analysis are summarized below 1 significant type 1 enso pdo interactions are seen across all regions in conus such interactions were also observed for enso amo at majority of the regions in conus nw um ov nr um and west 2 type 2 interactions discovered in this study were interesting as they generally go against the results of enso individual analysis for example contrary to the results in enso individual analysis la ni√±a events occurring in an amo positive phase result in decreased streamflow in the ne ov and sw this indicates that la ni√±a does not always cause wetter conditions in these regions rather when associated with amo positive phase can lead to drier conditions in these regions similar type 2 interactions were found for all enso pdo enso amo and enso nao coupled analysis 3 type 3 interactions involve where the results of the enso individual analysis are enhanced due to the interaction of the phases of enso with other cycles for example la ni√±a coupled with amo positive resulted in significantly greater reduction approximately 35 in streamflow than individual la ni√±a phase prominent type 3 interactions were observed with enso amo analysis in the se and south regions moreover in enso nao analysis type 3 interactions were observed in nw and nr regions the results from this study will be helpful in development of better forecasting tools studies have shown that incorporating large scale climate information could lead us to more accurate specificity hydrological forecasts with increase in the lead times signals grantz et al 2005 abrishamchi et al 2006 singh 2016 this current research will help provide important information to water managers responsible for predicting streamflow variability in response to ocean atmospheric oscillations in conus it would also help regional water managers in forecasting regional water availability hydropower generation and help them develop drought adaptation and mitigation strategies by incorporating information based on the large scale ocean atmospheric cycles it is however important to note that the entire analysis is based on non parametric statistics that is primarily data driven and does not consider the physical processes involved in modelling the modulation interaction effect therefore model based studies are needed to validate the findings of this study moreover the record length of 80 years of streamflow data is still limited when considering the analysis with respect to multidecadal cycles as very only few phases of each cycle can be considered especially for modelling interactions limiting the robustness of the results code availability the r codes used in this study can be made available by writing to the

8222,study region choshui river alluvial fan taiwan study focus land subsidence caused by groundwater overexploitation is a critical global problem the spatial distribution of land subsidence is crucial for effective environmental management and land planning in subsidence prone areas because of the nonlinear relationship between subsidence and drawdown due to groundwater exploitation in heterogeneous aquifers a spatial regression sr model is developed to effectively estimate nonlinear and spatially varying land subsidence considering various data inputs in the choshui river alluvial fan the sr model offers a robust method for accurately estimating the spatial patterns of subsidence using only drawdown as input data new hydrological insights for the region without requiring extensive calibration or an elaborate numerical groundwater flow and subsidence model the model provides annual subsidence patterns using a spatially varying relationship between drawdown and resulting land subsidence results show that the largest water level cone of depression occurs in the distal fan area nonetheless the calculated subsidence bowl closely approximates the observed one located much farther inland the root mean square errors rmses of annual subsidence is less or equal to 0 76 cm for the sr results indicate that the sr model reasonably estimates the spatial distribution of the skeletal storage coefficient in the aquifer system the large coefficient that represents high potential of inelastic compaction occurs in the southern inland area whereas the small coefficient that represents elastic compaction occurs in the northern area and proximal fan furthermore this method can be used efficiently for subsidence management regulation and might be widely used for subsidence estimation solely based on drawdown keywords subsidence estimation spatial regression drawdown groundwater 1 introduction land subsidence caused by excessive groundwater exploitation is a severe problem in numerous cities and regions including shanghai shen and xu 2011 xu et al 2016 mexico city kirwan and megonigal 2013 bangkok phien wej et al 2006 iran amiraslani and dragovich 2011 rahmati et al 2019 las vegas bell et al 2008 hoffmann et al 2001 and the san joaquin valley in california faunt et al 2016 jeanne et al 2019 poland 1972 smith and majumdar 2020 these areas with problematic subsidence have long been monitored their distribution and extent of subsidence and water level decline are well established as the result of the compaction of fine grained aquitards and interbeds due to aquifer overexploitation bon√¨ et al 2016 the removal of water from storage in fine grained silts and clays interbedded within the aquifer system causes these highly compressible sediments to compact and cause land subsidence furthermore large scale groundwater utilization from human activities causes environmental problems jeanne et al 2019 rahmati et al 2019 such as land degradation soil salinization and desertification land subsidence is correlated with variations of the aquifer system pore pressures or water level response to pumping burbey 2001 the drawdown of water levels leads to land subsidence from over extraction of groundwater bell et al 2008 galloway and burbey 2011 however generating the subsidence drawdown relation is critical to better understand and predict the spatial distribution of land subsidence accurate modeling requires observations of land deformation and water levels over months to years of time faunt et al 2016 kim 2000 yan and burbey 2008 to model the subsidence drawdown relation traditional numerical groundwater flow models such as modflow mahmoudpour et al 2016 shearer 1998 zhou et al 2003 combined with a post processing software package such as gms parhizkar et al 2015 can provide water level and flow distributions of the system under observation thus land subsidence can be simulated from changes in water pressure within the aquifer system coupled with the sub package hoffmann et al 2003b a coupled numerical model that incorporates the concepts of three dimensional poroelasticity based on biot s consolidation theory biot 1941 1955 is developed for simulating three dimensional displacement of solids within unconsolidated aquifers in response to induced changes in water pressure burbey 2006 burbey and helm 1999 elastic recoverable and inelastic permanent compaction from stress strain diagrams epstein 1987 hanson 1989 riley 1969 can be identified fine grained sediments tend to compact inelastically if the effective stress exceeds the preconsolidation stress decreasing hydraulic heads such as by increasing effective stresses causes a small amount of elastic compaction if the effective stress remains less than the preconsolidation stress galloway and burbey 2011 however uncertainty still exists in nonspatial models because heterogeneous geological variables cannot be in the same condition that occurs in nature reasonable estimates of the subsidence drawdown relation can be obtained from regression models using land subsidence and drawdown data provided sufficient subsidence data and water level records are available for the area of investigation yan and burbey 2008 however drawdown and subsequent compaction of compressible hydrogeologic layers can result in spatially non uniform and heterogeneous land subsidence of the hydrogeological system galloway et al 1998a hoffmann et al 2003a teatini et al 2006 the subsidence drawdown relation is rarely well correlated and therefore seldom readily applied in multi linear regression analyses jiang et al 2015 moreover the subsidence drawdown function is found to be far more heterogenous than most previous studies suggest sundell et al 2019 spatial regression sr i e geographically weighted regression gwr is a local form of linear regression used to model spatially varying relationships fotheringham et al 2003 such methods are powerful for capturing the effects of spatially heterogeneous processes and can identify spatial nonstationarity in the subsidence drawdown relation by allowing regression coefficients to vary spatially however previous studies on sr merely consider the relationship between subsidence and groundwater level variation at starting and ending times without considering any compaction processes shang et al 2011 the present study aims to estimate the spatially variable land subsidence distribution based on annual drawdown between ground based observations and to improve the limitations of linear regression methods which typically fail in spatial hydrogeologic settings the sr based method is developed in this study to model the spatial relationship between annual drawdown and the resulting land subsidence the model coefficients are expected to provide the spatial patterns of elastic and inelastic storage coefficients of the aquifer in addition a spatial subsidence map is proposed based on only the groundwater drawdown distributions in the aquifer system 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the choshui river alluvial fan is located in the mid western coast of taiwan and includes the counties of changhua and yunlin the choshui river runs from east to west through the study area fig 1 a which covers approximately 1800 km2 and bisects the two counties the alluvial plain is surrounded by natural geographical boundaries that include the taiwan strait to the west the central mountain ridge to the east the wu river to the north and the beigang river to the south yu and chu 2010 the measured groundwater levels of the aquifers indicate that the system has two major flow directions one from the eastern mountain area to the northwest in changhua and the other in a southwest direction in yunlin fig 2 shows a hydrogeological profile of the choshui river alluvial fan that comprises aquifers i ii 1 ii 2 iii and iv f1 f4 in fig 2 measured from the land surface downward aquitards t1 t3 separate the aquifers aquifers i ii 1 ii 2 iii are layers 1 2 3 4 in the later aquitards are most relevant in the distal fan and mid fan areas and gradually diminish in thickness toward the east the proximal fan represents the major recharge area of the aquifer system jang et al 2008 yu and chu 2010 the distribution of sediments in the alluvial fan transitions from largely gravel to sand and then to clay from the proximal fan to the distal fan moreover aquifer ii is the major aquifer of the choshui alluvial plain because of its large spatial extent and acceptable depth for groundwater extraction liu et al 2004 yu and chu 2010 given the insufficient surface water supply in the alluvial fan residents extract groundwater to supplement their demands for irrigation aquaculture and household domestic use especially in dry seasons groundwater is the major source of water for civilian and agricultural use and represents approximately 240 000 m3 day in the study area the majority of water is used in agriculture such as rice paddies with 1 8 and 1 5 billion cubic meters per year on average for changhua and yunlin respectively lee et al 2018 groundwater overdraft causes serious land subsidence in the area especially during droughts an area of approximately 300 km2 experiences significant subsidence 3 cm year in 2015 despite the enforced restrictions on groundwater exploitation fig 1c shows spatial pattern of observed annual land subsidence from all aquifer layers 2 2 required data for this investigation this investigation uses monthly groundwater level observations in 2015 the water level observations of aquifer layers 1 2 3 and 4 obtained from 33 40 28 and 28 monitoring wells respectively are evenly distributed over the entire choshui river alluvial fan fig 1a in addition annual subsidence rates for 2015 from 662 leveling points fig 1a have been collected a leveling network amounting to over 1 000 km in length is used to calculate subsidence for every 1 5 km interval along the leveling routes leveling specifications satisfy a loop closure of less than 3 k mm where k is the length of the leveling circuit in kilometers the vertical accuracy of leveling data is generally within 1 cm hung et al 2010 leveling has a high degree of accuracy but is time consuming and expensive compared with gps the leveling and groundwater level data are obtained from the water resources agency of taiwan fig 1b shows groundwater table observations in four layers in addition gps data and insar deformation maps are also used to visually check the calibrated data produced in this study 3 data analysis methods 3 1 model development based on terzaghi s principle of effective stress hoffmann et al 2003a the nonlinear stress compaction relation is typically linearized with respect to preconsolidation stress shen and xu 2011 smith and majumdar 2020 the calculation of total aquifer system compaction subsidence can be linearized where incremental changes in effective stress hydraulic head are typically small as 1 Œ¥ z s k Œ¥ h where Œ¥ z is the subsidence sk is the skeletal storage coefficient and Œ¥ h is the change in hydraulic head if the effective stress remains less than the preconsolidation stress or less than the past maximum drawdown the compaction is entirely elastic in this study the soil rebound volume expansion after removal of mechanical stress is disregarded from Œ¥ h which represents the annual cumulative drawdown or the total annual change in hydraulic head chu and chang 2009 rebound tends to be less than 10 of the original subsidence chaussard et al 2014a the total annual drawdown is then stated as 2 Œ¥ h t Œ¥ h t where Œ¥ h t h t 1 h t if h t 1 h t in this one year case the time step t varies from 1 to 12 representing the months of the year subsidence is a function of accumulated drawdown ali et al 2020 furthermore a regression expression identifies the relation between subsidence and groundwater level eq 1 is extended to yield an estimate of subsidence at observation i in a multi layer aquifer which can be expressed as 3 Œ¥ z i l s k l Œ¥ h i l Œµ i where l is the layer number in the multi layer aquifer s k l is the lth skeletal storage coefficient in a multi layer system and Œ¥ z i is the land subsidence at observation i this study uses the annual subsidence rate for 2015 and Œ¥ h i l is the estimated total groundwater decline drawdown at observation i from aquifer layer l Œµ i is the residual of the regression model eq 3 is further extended to allow for spatially varying subsidence and drawdown in a multi layer aquifer system as follows 4 Œ¥ z i l s k l u i v i Œ¥ h i l Œµ i where s k l u i v i varies with the spatial coordinates u i v i at observation i in the lth layer this spatial coefficient s k l u i v i in eq 4 represents the skeletal storage coefficient in each aquifer which is required to accurately estimate subsidence from drawdown eq 4 exploits the spatial dimension by using the positive autocorrelation between neighboring observations in space and in this way accommodates spatial autocorrelation stojanova et al 2012 3 2 spatial coefficient estimation and model validation the sr is an extension of ordinary least squares ols fotheringham et al 2003 using the sr the estimated parameter matrix Œ≤ ÀÜ u i v i which includes s k l u i v i at each observation i is expressed as 5 Œ≤ ÀÜ u i v i h t w u i v i h 1 h t w u i v i z where 6 h Œ¥ h 11 Œ¥ h 12 Œ¥ h 1 l Œ¥ h n 1 Œ¥ h n 2 Œ¥ h n l z Œ¥ z 1 Œ¥ z n 7 w u i v i d i a g w 1 i w j i w n i and 8 Œ≤ ÀÜ u i v i s k 1 u i v i s k 2 u i v i s k l u i v i t h and z represent the matrix form of Œ¥ h i l and Œ¥ z i for the n observations and l layers used in this study w u i v i is a spatial weight matrix based on the euclidean and gaussian distance decay based functions in the spatial domain in this case the euclidean distance is expressed in meters the parameter w j i between observations i and neighboring j in the spatial weight matrix is commonly used as a kernel and represents a gaussian distance decay based function w j i e x p d i j 2 b 2 where d i j is the euclidian distance between observations i and j d i j u i u j 2 v i v j 2 and b is the non negative parameter known as the bandwidth brunsdon et al 1996 bandwidth b can be determined by several criteria such as the cross validation cv procedure fotheringham et al 2003 chu et al 2018 the cv procedure is used to select the optimal parameters b 9 c v b i Œ¥ z i Œ¥ z i b 2 for comparison the models for linear and spatial regressions i e ols and sr are applied on all four aquifer layers including mixed and single layer drawdowns from different aquifers spatial estimation of the drawdown is applied using inverse distance weighting idw the models are developed using matlab model 1 is based on the cumulative drawdown from all aquifer layers models 2 5 are based on only drawdowns from layers 1 4 without the y intercept respectively as shown at a later stage the data are split into a training set 80 for model calibration while an independent test set 20 is used for validation to evaluate the model performance the common measures r2 and rmses are used on the basis of observation data and estimated values at these points of the test set 4 results and discussion the subsidence accumulated drawdown relation was built in linear and spatial regressions that is the sr model first a relation between total subsidence and multi layer drawdowns was accurately formulated and the spatial patterns of subsidence were subsequently estimated 4 1 overview of subsidence and drawdown fig 3 displays the correlation between subsidence and variations in groundwater level the subsidence drawdown relation is nonlinear correlation coefficient 0 27 0 54 0 57 and 0 54 respectively in each of the four aquifer layers groundwater drawdowns in layers 2 4 are similar correlation coefficient 0 84 in layers 2 and 3 0 78 in layers 2 and 4 drawdowns in layer 1 unconfined aquifer vary spatially over shorter distances compared to those of the confined aquifer layers 2 4 figs 1c and 4 show the spatial distribution of annual observed subsidence and accumulated drawdown respectively for 2015 when the maximum annual permanent subsidence is approximately 7 cm fig 1c the spatial distribution of subsidence reveals a bowl in the central area of yunlin hwang et al 2008 within the study area the maximum accumulated drawdown in layers 1 4 ranges from 15 to 20 m fig 4 the cumulative drawdowns implies that similar cones of depression are located in layers 2 4 in the southwest distal fan area near the coast drawdown cones are located along the distal fan and mountain areas in layer 1 compared with the four layer drawdown pattern the drawdown is greatest in layer 2 in the study area in addition drawdowns in layers 2 4 are highly correlated fig 3 while layer 3 is most closely correlated to the subsidence of the four layer drawdown model fig 3 the compression behavior of clay agrees with terzaghi s consolidation theory liu et al 2004 land subsidence with inelastic compression continues as water levels continuously decline the inelastic compression of fine grained aquifer interbeds is likely responsible for the vast majority of subsidence problems based on the compressibility and total thickness of fine grained deposits throughout the region galloway et al 1998b galloway and sneed 2013 the cone of maximum drawdown occurs in the distal fan area whereas the current major subsidence bowl occurs inland consequently the cone of maximum drawdown fails to fully coincide with the location of the subsidence bowl erban et al 2014 in the coastal area or distal fan area the rate of pumping is proposed to decrease to stabilize or reduce water level declines this subsequently reduces land subsidence given that the largest occurrence in the southern inland area induced by heavy withdrawal of groundwater this is a sensitive environmental concern because the taiwan high speed rail is constructed through the central subsidence area which might pose a serious threat to its operation hwang et al 2008 tung and hu 2012 4 2 model performance the performance of sr such as the rmses in the multi or single aquifer system rmse 0 62 0 76 cm is better than that of ols rmse 1 53 2 12 cm table 1 the best models are appear to be model 1 in the multi aquifer system and model 4 in the single aquifer system however the subsidence drawdown model using ols is not appropriate due to its poor performance table 1 the sr is more accurate than that of ols results of ols reveal a subsidence drawdown function with negative a slope for layer 1 high drawdown low subsidence exists in the proximal fan but a positive slope for layers 2 3 and 4 in model 1 table 2 in addition the rmses of model 4 using ols and sr are 1 53 and 0 63 cm respectively compared with models 2 5 the best sr with the lowest rmses occurs in model 4 because the subsidence drawdown correlation is the highest however the poorest ols model with highest rmse is model 2 due to its low subsidence drawdown correlation fig 3 validation of our subsidence model with available test data provides consistent and accurate results fig 5 shows the total estimated land subsidence calculated from linear regression and sr using all layers model 1 and single layer drawdowns models 2 5 in a linear regression the estimated land subsidence bowl occurs in the distal fan area near the coast but also in the proximal and distal fan areas in model 2 due to the variable drawdown patterns occurring in layer 1 the estimated maximum subsidence in the ols models occurs at the boundary area of yunlin whereas in the sr models subsidence occurs in the inland area of yunlin fig 5 however the estimated pattern using ols does not match the observed subsidence the sr explicitly considers spatially dependent models to overcome the spatial variability of land subsidence mapping because the sr extends the linear regression by estimating a set of spatial parameters rather than one single set of parameters brunsdon et al 1996 fotheringham et al 2003 the model rmses are less than or equal to 0 76 cm so that spatial regression can be used to model the spatially varying relation between subsidence and drawdown in the aquifer system model 1 performs the best but the regression coefficient does not explain the skeletal storage coefficient of each layer independently because land subsidence is a cumulative measurement encompassing all aquifer and aquitard layers the regression estimate is incapable of distinguishing different hydrogeologic layers consequently we estimate the specific storage on the basis of the drawdown occurring in a single aquifer system 4 3 spatial model coefficient and implication fig 6 exhibits the spatial pattern of regression slope coefficients of the sr in layers 1 4 for models 2 5 the regression coefficient distribution varies spatially the patterns of spatial coefficients are typically similar in layers 2 3 and 4 most coefficients have a positive slope for total drawdown and subsidence fig 6 only the proximal fan and the area close to wu river exhibits a negative relation between the total drawdown and land subsidence fig 6 a negative relation can occur where unloading causes a small soil rebound or where drawdown continues but the subsidence rate declines due to recharge effects i e rainfall ponds lakes canals and irrigation the long term trend of hydraulic head and vertical displacements are useful to estimate the inelastic skeletal storage coefficient for subsidence features miller and shirzaei 2015 the spatial patterns of skeletal storage coefficients in four layers can be estimated using the slope coefficients of spatial regression fig 6 which also reflect the skeletal storage coefficients of the aquifers in fig 6 c the large coefficient value purple color represents inelastic compaction in the southern inland area whereas the small coefficient value blue color represents elastic compaction in other areas the resulting subsidence pattern clearly suggests elasto plastic mechanical behavior which includes elastic and inelastic skeletal storage in over consolidated and normally consolidated soils hung et al 2012 liu et al 2004 in recent decades the excessive pumping of groundwater has resulted in serious subsidence problems along the coast this subsidence coincides with the increase of aquaculture fisheries since the 1970s currently the rate of compaction in the coastal area is declining however the subsidence bowl is moving inland due to over pumping in this region hwang et al 2008 chu et al 2021 interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar offers a powerful and useful method for identifying regional land subsidence b√ºrgmann et al 2000 bon√¨ et al 2016 chaussard et al 2014b galloway et al 1998b hoffmann et al 2001 the present findings match the results from previous insar interferograms for the study region tung and hu 2012 moreover the advent and use of gps has made land subsidence monitoring more efficient and cost effective however gps is limited because it measures only the surface deformation at point locations hosseini et al 2007 the approach developed in the present study provides robust and reliable maps of estimated land subsidence that are far more spatially descriptive than point based survey data typically provide in the developed models spatial patterns of subsidence are estimated solely on the basis of drawdown information the effect of groundwater level changes on land subsidence can be modeled using a stress strain relationship with the elastic or inelastic skeletal storage coefficient of the underlying aquifers however the entire system includes leveling surveys borehole extensometer data and multilayer monitoring of groundwater levels with the aim to better understand the hydrological and mechanical processes of the aquifer system and to characterize the spatial distribution of land subsidence with a traditional numerical model zhang et al 2014 characterizing the hydrogeological setting of the aquifer system is a critical step to accomplish this goal liu et al 2004 the observational data used to characterize hydrogeology is limited hubbard and rubin 2000 including the hydraulic diffusivity of the confining layer the distance from the pumping wells length of the recovery cycle and the thickness of confining layers all of these factors can influence the shape of stress strain hysteresis loops burbey 2001 in this study further calibration of the model is not required unlike other numerical models that typically require an inverse modeling component for calibration purposes the fundamental benefit of inverse modeling is its ability to automatically estimate parameter values that produce the best fit between observed and simulated hydraulic heads and flows franssen et al 2009 poeter and hill 1997 however limitations include model uncertainty hydrogeologic characterization of the system and measurement and parameter uncertainties h√∏jberg and refsgaard 2005 for example the numerical model contains parameter uncertainty due to the unknown pumping rates which can limit the ability to adequately characterize key hydrologic parameters therefore this method can be used efficiently for subsidence management and might be widely used for subsidence estimation solely based on drawdown subsidence is influenced by drawdown due to persistent pumping and seasonal variations of groundwater levels from monthly data kouda et al 2015 however the quality of the drawdown information affects the estimation accuracy of subsidence this subsidence drawdown model can be relevant in terms of policy or land subsidence regulation 5 conclusions this study implements a spatial regression based subsidence mapping scheme on the basis of groundwater level observations and offers an effective method to explore the spatial patterns of subsidence through its correlation with drawdowns without the use of complex hydrogeologic models the model developed here is based on a sr method and is easy to fit between the total drawdown and subsidence observations a goodness of fit better than ols rmses are less than or equal to 0 76 cm is achieved without requiring a more detailed hydrogeologic investigation and extensive calibration this model offers reasonable detail regarding the spatial patterns of land subsidence using a non linear and spatially varying relationship between the water level observations and resulting land subsidence this model can be relevant for water resource policy or land subsidence regulation the developed model accurately estimates the spatial pattern of annual land subsidence the estimated subsidence bowl occurs in the inland area of yunlin similar to the actual observed subsidence bowl location however the drawdown cone occurs in the coastal area west of the subsidence bowl the model can estimate the spatial pattern of subsidence that is highly related to the hydrogeological properties and drawdown history which impacts the location of the observed subsidence bowl results also show that the model coefficients accurately reflect the skeletal storage coefficients of the aquifer the large coefficient value represents inelastic compaction in the southern inland area whereas the small coefficient value represents the elastic compaction that occurs in the northern area and proximal fan the coefficient patterns represent elastic and inelastic skeletal storage coefficients in over consolidated and normally consolidated soils in a future study the recharge effects and hydrodynamic lag that exists between the drawdown and subsequent subsidence can be considered the effectiveness of the method using fewer observations will be further investigated to determine if the model can be adaptable to areas with a much lower number of observations than used in this study the prediction of long term subsidence or subsidence time series can then be investigated author s

coefficient that represents elastic compaction occurs in the northern area and proximal fan furthermore this method can be used efficiently for subsidence management regulation and might be widely used for subsidence estimation solely based on drawdown keywords subsidence estimation spatial regression drawdown groundwater 1 introduction land subsidence caused by excessive groundwater exploitation is a severe problem in numerous cities and regions including shanghai shen and xu 2011 xu et al 2016 mexico city kirwan and megonigal 2013 bangkok phien wej et al 2006 iran amiraslani and dragovich 2011 rahmati et al 2019 las vegas bell et al 2008 hoffmann et al 2001 and the san joaquin valley in california faunt et al 2016 jeanne et al 2019 poland 1972 smith and majumdar 2020 these areas with problematic subsidence have long been monitored their distribution and extent of subsidence and water level decline are well established as the result of the compaction of fine grained aquitards and interbeds due to aquifer overexploitation bon√¨ et al 2016 the removal of water from storage in fine grained silts and clays interbedded within the aquifer system causes these highly compressible sediments to compact and cause land subsidence furthermore large scale groundwater utilization from human activities causes environmental problems jeanne et al 2019 rahmati et al 2019 such as land degradation soil salinization and desertification land subsidence is correlated with variations of the aquifer system pore pressures or water level response to pumping burbey 2001 the drawdown of water levels leads to land subsidence from over extraction of groundwater bell et al 2008 galloway and burbey 2011 however generating the subsidence drawdown relation is critical to better understand and predict the spatial distribution of land subsidence accurate modeling requires observations of land deformation and water levels over months to years of time faunt et al 2016 kim 2000 yan and burbey 2008 to model the subsidence drawdown relation traditional numerical groundwater flow models such as modflow mahmoudpour et al 2016 shearer 1998 zhou et al 2003 combined with a post processing software package such as gms parhizkar et al 2015 can provide water level and flow distributions of the system under observation thus land subsidence can be simulated from changes in water pressure within the aquifer system coupled with the sub package hoffmann et al 2003b a coupled numerical model that incorporates the concepts of three dimensional poroelasticity based on biot s consolidation theory biot 1941 1955 is developed for simulating three dimensional displacement of solids within unconsolidated aquifers in response to induced changes in water pressure burbey 2006 burbey and helm 1999 elastic recoverable and inelastic permanent compaction from stress strain diagrams epstein 1987 hanson 1989 riley 1969 can be identified fine grained sediments tend to compact inelastically if the effective stress exceeds the preconsolidation stress decreasing hydraulic heads such as by increasing effective stresses causes a small amount of elastic compaction if the effective stress remains less than the preconsolidation stress galloway and burbey 2011 however uncertainty still exists in nonspatial models because heterogeneous geological variables cannot be in the same condition that occurs in nature reasonable estimates of the subsidence drawdown relation can be obtained from regression models using land subsidence and drawdown data provided sufficient subsidence data and water level records are available for the area of investigation yan and burbey 2008 however drawdown and subsequent compaction of compressible hydrogeologic layers can result in spatially non uniform and heterogeneous land subsidence of the hydrogeological system galloway et al 1998a hoffmann et al 2003a teatini et al 2006 the subsidence drawdown relation is rarely well correlated and therefore seldom readily applied in multi linear regression analyses jiang et al 2015 moreover the subsidence drawdown function is found to be far more heterogenous than most previous studies suggest sundell et al 2019 spatial regression sr i e geographically weighted regression gwr is a local form of linear regression used to model spatially varying relationships fotheringham et al 2003 such methods are powerful for capturing the effects of spatially heterogeneous processes and can identify spatial nonstationarity in the subsidence drawdown relation by allowing regression coefficients to vary spatially however previous studies on sr merely consider the relationship between subsidence and groundwater level variation at starting and ending times without considering any compaction processes shang et al 2011 the present study aims to estimate the spatially variable land subsidence distribution based on annual drawdown between ground based observations and to improve the limitations of linear regression methods which typically fail in spatial hydrogeologic settings the sr based method is developed in this study to model the spatial relationship between annual drawdown and the resulting land subsidence the model coefficients are expected to provide the spatial patterns of elastic and inelastic storage coefficients of the aquifer in addition a spatial subsidence map is proposed based on only the groundwater drawdown distributions in the aquifer system 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the choshui river alluvial fan is located in the mid western coast of taiwan and includes the counties of changhua and yunlin the choshui river runs from east to west through the study area fig 1 a which covers approximately 1800 km2 and bisects the two counties the alluvial plain is surrounded by natural geographical boundaries that include the taiwan strait to the west the central mountain ridge to the east the wu river to the north and the beigang river to the south yu and chu 2010 the measured groundwater levels of the aquifers indicate that the system has two major flow directions one from the eastern mountain area to the northwest in changhua and the other in a southwest direction in yunlin fig 2 shows a hydrogeological profile of the choshui river alluvial fan that comprises aquifers i ii 1 ii 2 iii and iv f1 f4 in fig 2 measured from the land surface downward aquitards t1 t3 separate the aquifers aquifers i ii 1 ii 2 iii are layers 1 2 3 4 in the later aquitards are most relevant in the distal fan and mid fan areas and gradually diminish in thickness toward the east the proximal fan represents the major recharge area of the aquifer system jang et al 2008 yu and chu 2010 the distribution of sediments in the alluvial fan transitions from largely gravel to sand and then to clay from the proximal fan to the distal fan moreover aquifer ii is the major aquifer of the choshui alluvial plain because of its large spatial extent and acceptable depth for groundwater extraction liu et al 2004 yu and chu 2010 given the insufficient surface water supply in the alluvial fan residents extract groundwater to supplement their demands for irrigation aquaculture and household domestic use especially in dry seasons groundwater is the major source of water for civilian and agricultural use and represents approximately 240 000 m3 day in the study area the majority of water is used in agriculture such as rice paddies with 1 8 and 1 5 billion cubic meters per year on average for changhua and yunlin respectively lee et al 2018 groundwater overdraft causes serious land subsidence in the area especially during droughts an area of approximately 300 km2 experiences significant subsidence 3 cm year in 2015 despite the enforced restrictions on groundwater exploitation fig 1c shows spatial pattern of observed annual land subsidence from all aquifer layers 2 2 required data for this investigation this investigation uses monthly groundwater level observations in 2015 the water level observations of aquifer layers 1 2 3 and 4 obtained from 33 40 28 and 28 monitoring wells respectively are evenly distributed over the entire choshui river alluvial fan fig 1a in addition annual subsidence rates for 2015 from 662 leveling points fig 1a have been collected a leveling network amounting to over 1 000 km in length is used to calculate subsidence for every 1 5 km interval along the leveling routes leveling specifications satisfy a loop closure of less than 3 k mm where k is the length of the leveling circuit in kilometers the vertical accuracy of leveling data is generally within 1 cm hung et al 2010 leveling has a high degree of accuracy but is time consuming and expensive compared with gps the leveling and groundwater level data are obtained from the water resources agency of taiwan fig 1b shows groundwater table observations in four layers in addition gps data and insar deformation maps are also used to visually check the calibrated data produced in this study 3 data analysis methods 3 1 model development based on terzaghi s principle of effective stress hoffmann et al 2003a the nonlinear stress compaction relation is typically linearized with respect to preconsolidation stress shen and xu 2011 smith and majumdar 2020 the calculation of total aquifer system compaction subsidence can be linearized where incremental changes in effective stress hydraulic head are typically small as 1 Œ¥ z s k Œ¥ h where Œ¥ z is the subsidence sk is the skeletal storage coefficient and Œ¥ h is the change in hydraulic head if the effective stress remains less than the preconsolidation stress or less than the past maximum drawdown the compaction is entirely elastic in this study the soil rebound volume expansion after removal of mechanical stress is disregarded from Œ¥ h which represents the annual cumulative drawdown or the total annual change in hydraulic head chu and chang 2009 rebound tends to be less than 10 of the original subsidence chaussard et al 2014a the total annual drawdown is then stated as 2 Œ¥ h t Œ¥ h t where Œ¥ h t h t 1 h t if h t 1 h t in this one year case the time step t varies from 1 to 12 representing the months of the year subsidence is a function of accumulated drawdown ali et al 2020 furthermore a regression expression identifies the relation between subsidence and groundwater level eq 1 is extended to yield an estimate of subsidence at observation i in a multi layer aquifer which can be expressed as 3 Œ¥ z i l s k l Œ¥ h i l Œµ i where l is the layer number in the multi layer aquifer s k l is the lth skeletal storage coefficient in a multi layer system and Œ¥ z i is the land subsidence at observation i this study uses the annual subsidence rate for 2015 and Œ¥ h i l is the estimated total groundwater decline drawdown at observation i from aquifer layer l Œµ i is the residual of the regression model eq 3 is further extended to allow for spatially varying subsidence and drawdown in a multi layer aquifer system as follows 4 Œ¥ z i l s k l u i v i Œ¥ h i l Œµ i where s k l u i v i varies with the spatial coordinates u i v i at observation i in the lth layer this spatial coefficient s k l u i v i in eq 4 represents the skeletal storage coefficient in each aquifer which is required to accurately estimate subsidence from drawdown eq 4 exploits the spatial dimension by using the positive autocorrelation between neighboring observations in space and in this way accommodates spatial autocorrelation stojanova et al 2012 3 2 spatial coefficient estimation and model validation the sr is an extension of ordinary least squares ols fotheringham et al 2003 using the sr the estimated parameter matrix Œ≤ ÀÜ u i v i which includes s k l u i v i at each observation i is expressed as 5 Œ≤ ÀÜ u i v i h t w u i v i h 1 h t w u i v i z where 6 h Œ¥ h 11 Œ¥ h 12 Œ¥ h 1 l Œ¥ h n 1 Œ¥ h n 2 Œ¥ h n l z Œ¥ z 1 Œ¥ z n 7 w u i v i

study w u i v i is a spatial weight matrix based on the euclidean and gaussian distance decay based functions in the spatial domain in this case the euclidean distance is expressed in meters the parameter w j i between observations i and neighboring j in the spatial weight matrix is commonly used as a kernel and represents a gaussian distance decay based function w j i e x p d i j 2 b 2 where d i j is the euclidian distance between observations i and j d i j u i u j 2 v i v j 2 and b is the non negative parameter known as the bandwidth brunsdon et al 1996 bandwidth b can be determined by several criteria such as the cross validation cv procedure fotheringham et al 2003 chu et al 2018 the cv procedure is used to select the optimal parameters b 9 c v b i Œ¥ z i Œ¥ z i b 2 for comparison the models for linear and spatial regressions i e ols and sr are applied on all four aquifer layers including mixed and single layer drawdowns from different aquifers spatial estimation of the drawdown is applied using inverse distance weighting idw the models are developed using matlab model 1 is based on the cumulative drawdown from all aquifer layers models 2 5 are based on only drawdowns from layers 1 4 without the y intercept respectively as shown at a later stage the data are split into a training set 80 for model calibration while an independent test set 20 is used for validation to evaluate the model performance the common measures r2 and rmses are used on the basis of observation data and estimated values at these points of the test set 4 results and discussion the subsidence accumulated drawdown relation was built in linear and spatial regressions that is the sr model first a relation between total subsidence and multi layer drawdowns was accurately formulated and the spatial patterns of subsidence were subsequently estimated 4 1 overview of subsidence and drawdown fig 3 displays the correlation between subsidence and variations in groundwater level the subsidence drawdown relation is nonlinear correlation coefficient 0 27 0 54 0 57 and 0 54 respectively in each of the four aquifer layers groundwater drawdowns in layers 2 4 are similar correlation coefficient 0 84 in layers 2 and 3 0 78 in layers 2 and 4 drawdowns in layer 1 unconfined aquifer vary spatially over shorter distances compared to those of the confined aquifer layers 2 4 figs 1c and 4 show the spatial distribution of annual observed subsidence and accumulated drawdown respectively for 2015 when the maximum annual permanent subsidence is approximately 7 cm fig 1c the spatial distribution of subsidence reveals a bowl in the central area of yunlin hwang et al 2008 within the study area the maximum accumulated drawdown in layers 1 4 ranges from 15 to 20 m fig 4 the cumulative drawdowns implies that similar cones of depression are located in layers 2 4 in the southwest distal fan area near the coast drawdown cones are located along the distal fan and mountain areas in layer 1 compared with the four layer drawdown pattern the drawdown is greatest in layer 2 in the study area in addition drawdowns in layers 2 4 are highly correlated fig 3 while layer 3 is most closely correlated to the subsidence of the four layer drawdown model fig 3 the compression behavior of clay agrees with terzaghi s consolidation theory liu et al 2004 land subsidence with inelastic compression continues as water levels continuously decline the inelastic compression of fine grained aquifer interbeds is likely responsible for the vast majority of subsidence problems based on the compressibility and total thickness of fine grained deposits throughout the region galloway et al 1998b galloway and sneed 2013 the cone of maximum drawdown occurs in the distal fan area whereas the current major subsidence bowl occurs inland consequently the cone of maximum drawdown fails to fully coincide with the location of the subsidence bowl erban et al 2014 in the coastal area or distal fan area the rate of pumping is proposed to decrease to stabilize or reduce water level declines this subsequently reduces land subsidence given that the largest occurrence in the southern inland area induced by heavy withdrawal of groundwater this is a sensitive environmental concern because the taiwan high speed rail is constructed through the central subsidence area which might pose a serious threat to its operation hwang et al 2008 tung and hu 2012 4 2 model performance the performance of sr such as the rmses in the multi or single aquifer system rmse 0 62 0 76 cm is better than that of ols rmse 1 53 2 12 cm table 1 the best models are appear to be model 1 in the multi aquifer system and model 4 in the single aquifer system however the subsidence drawdown model using ols is not appropriate due to its poor performance table 1 the sr is more accurate than that of ols results of ols reveal a subsidence drawdown function with negative a slope for layer 1 high drawdown low subsidence exists in the proximal fan but a positive slope for layers 2 3 and 4 in model 1 table 2 in addition the rmses of model 4 using ols and sr are 1 53 and 0 63 cm respectively compared with models 2 5 the best sr with the lowest rmses occurs in model 4 because the subsidence drawdown correlation is the highest however the poorest ols model with highest rmse is model 2 due to its low subsidence drawdown correlation fig 3 validation of our subsidence model with available test data provides consistent and accurate results fig 5 shows the total estimated land subsidence calculated from linear regression and sr using all layers model 1 and single layer drawdowns models 2 5 in a linear regression the estimated land subsidence bowl occurs in the distal fan area near the coast but also in the proximal and distal fan areas in model 2 due to the variable drawdown patterns occurring in layer 1 the estimated maximum subsidence in the ols models occurs at the boundary area of yunlin whereas in the sr models subsidence occurs in the inland area of yunlin fig 5 however the estimated pattern using ols does not match the observed subsidence the sr explicitly considers spatially dependent models to overcome the spatial variability of land subsidence mapping because the sr extends the linear regression by estimating a set of spatial parameters rather than one single set of parameters brunsdon et al 1996 fotheringham et al 2003 the model rmses are less than or equal to 0 76 cm so that spatial regression can be used to model the spatially varying relation between subsidence and drawdown in the aquifer system model 1 performs the best but the regression coefficient does not explain the skeletal storage coefficient of each layer independently because land subsidence is a cumulative measurement encompassing all aquifer and aquitard layers the regression estimate is incapable of distinguishing different hydrogeologic layers consequently we estimate the specific storage on the basis of the drawdown occurring in a single aquifer system 4 3 spatial model coefficient and implication fig 6 exhibits the spatial pattern of regression slope coefficients of the sr in layers 1 4 for models 2 5 the regression coefficient distribution varies spatially the patterns of spatial coefficients are typically similar in layers 2 3 and 4 most coefficients have a positive slope for total drawdown and subsidence fig 6 only the proximal fan and the area close to wu river exhibits a negative relation between the total drawdown and land subsidence fig 6 a negative relation can occur where unloading causes a small soil rebound or where drawdown continues but the subsidence rate declines due to recharge effects i e rainfall ponds lakes canals and irrigation the long term trend of hydraulic head and vertical displacements are useful to estimate the inelastic skeletal storage coefficient for subsidence features miller and shirzaei 2015 the spatial patterns of skeletal storage coefficients in four layers can be estimated using the slope coefficients of spatial regression fig 6 which also reflect the skeletal storage coefficients of the aquifers in fig 6 c the large coefficient value purple color represents inelastic compaction in the southern inland area whereas the small coefficient value blue color represents elastic compaction in other areas the resulting subsidence pattern clearly suggests elasto plastic mechanical behavior which includes elastic and inelastic skeletal storage in over consolidated and normally consolidated soils hung et al 2012 liu et al 2004 in recent decades the excessive pumping of groundwater has resulted in serious subsidence problems along the coast this subsidence coincides with the increase of aquaculture fisheries since the 1970s currently the rate of compaction in the coastal area is declining however the subsidence bowl is moving inland due to over pumping in this region hwang et al 2008 chu et al 2021 interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar offers a powerful and useful method for identifying regional land subsidence b√ºrgmann et al 2000 bon√¨ et al 2016 chaussard et al 2014b galloway et al 1998b hoffmann et al 2001 the present findings match the results from previous insar interferograms for the study region tung and hu 2012 moreover the advent and use of gps has made land subsidence monitoring more efficient and cost effective however gps is limited because it measures only the surface deformation at point locations hosseini et al 2007 the approach developed in the present study provides robust and reliable maps of estimated land subsidence that are far more spatially descriptive than point based survey data typically provide in the developed models spatial patterns of subsidence are estimated solely on the basis of drawdown information the effect of groundwater level changes on land subsidence can be modeled using a stress strain relationship with the elastic or inelastic skeletal storage coefficient of the underlying aquifers however the entire system includes leveling surveys borehole extensometer data and multilayer monitoring of groundwater levels with the aim to better understand the hydrological and mechanical processes of the aquifer system and to characterize the spatial distribution of land subsidence with a traditional numerical model zhang et al 2014 characterizing the hydrogeological setting of the aquifer system is a critical step to accomplish this goal liu et al 2004 the observational data used to characterize hydrogeology is limited hubbard and rubin 2000 including the hydraulic diffusivity of the confining layer the distance from the pumping wells length of the recovery cycle and the thickness of confining layers all of these factors can influence the shape of stress strain hysteresis loops burbey 2001 in this study further calibration of the model is not required unlike other numerical models that typically require an inverse modeling component for calibration purposes the fundamental benefit of inverse modeling is its ability to automatically estimate parameter values that produce the best fit between observed and simulated hydraulic heads and flows franssen et al 2009 poeter and hill 1997 however limitations include model uncertainty hydrogeologic characterization of the system and measurement and parameter uncertainties h√∏jberg and refsgaard 2005 for example the numerical model contains parameter uncertainty due to the unknown pumping rates which can limit the ability to adequately characterize key hydrologic parameters therefore this method can be used efficiently for subsidence management and might be widely used for subsidence estimation solely based on drawdown subsidence is influenced by drawdown due to persistent pumping and seasonal variations of groundwater levels from monthly data kouda et al 2015 however the quality of the drawdown information affects the estimation accuracy of subsidence this subsidence drawdown model can be relevant in terms of policy or land subsidence regulation 5 conclusions this study implements a spatial regression based subsidence mapping scheme on the basis of groundwater level observations and offers an effective method to explore the spatial patterns of subsidence through its correlation with drawdowns without the use of complex hydrogeologic models the model developed here is based on a sr method and is easy to fit between the total drawdown and subsidence observations a goodness of fit better than ols rmses are less than or equal to 0 76 cm is achieved without requiring a more detailed hydrogeologic investigation and extensive calibration this model offers reasonable detail regarding the spatial patterns of land subsidence using a non linear and spatially varying relationship between the water level observations and resulting land subsidence this model can be relevant for water resource policy or land subsidence regulation the developed model accurately estimates the spatial pattern of annual land subsidence the estimated subsidence bowl occurs in the inland area of yunlin similar to the actual observed subsidence bowl location however the drawdown cone occurs in the coastal area west of the subsidence bowl the model can estimate the spatial pattern of subsidence that is highly related to the hydrogeological properties and drawdown history which impacts the location of the observed subsidence bowl results also show that the model coefficients accurately reflect the skeletal storage coefficients of the aquifer the large coefficient value represents inelastic compaction in the southern inland area whereas the small coefficient value represents the elastic compaction that occurs in the northern area and proximal fan the coefficient patterns represent elastic and inelastic skeletal storage coefficients in over consolidated and normally consolidated soils in a future study the recharge effects and hydrodynamic lag that exists between the drawdown and subsequent subsidence can be considered the effectiveness of the method using fewer observations will be further investigated to determine if the model can be adaptable to areas with a much lower number of observations than used in this study the prediction of long term subsidence or subsidence time series can then be investigated author s

8223,study region 42 catchments distributed throughout central and eastern u s study focus enhanced hydroclimatic variability threatens human water uses and there is an urgent need to quantify projected alterations of flow regimes this issue has been largely addressed in unregulated rivers through the development of similarity frameworks relating climate properties with the hydrologic response of catchments however the impact of damming on climate signatures of river flow regimes is largely unexplored to fill this gap this study investigates unregulated streamflows of a selection of sites using a climate based similarity framework then the corresponding regulated regimes are analyzed to understand how the obtained regime classification is affected by regulation new hydrological insights for the region our results reveal that flood control dams retain but dampen climate signatures of flow regimes reducing the regional heterogeneity of downstream hydrographs conversely in the study area urban water supply structures promote climate independence of river regimes and tend to break the link between climate and river flows thereby promoting the spatial diversification of the hydrologic response the observed impact of each specific water use is explained based on quantitative indexes that relates to the regulation capacity of reservoirs and their degree of exploitation overall climatic signatures are still detectable in most regulated streamflows though climatic control on river regimes is largely concealed by the profound hydrological alterations induced by dams 2010 msc 00 01 99 00 keywords hydroclimatic variability similarity frameworks river flow regimes reservoirs 1 introduction streamflow regimes describe the temporal

the relative contribution of climate variability and human regulation in controlling hydrologic regimes downstream of reservoirs becomes a useful supporting tool to improve existing strategies and

infrastructures located downstream of dams as well as for the ecological and geomorphological evolution of engineered reaches poff and zimmerman 2010 ludwig et al 2014 safavi et al 2015 essenfelder et al 2018 in spite of the marked spatial heterogeneity of river regimes catchment classification has emerged among hydrologists as a fundamental tool to enhance understanding of the relationship between the hydroclimatic forcing and river flows to date existing studies have mainly focused on the development of similarity frameworks that classify the hydrologic behavior of pristine catchments on the basis of key climate and landscape physical properties these works shed light on the metrics that better summarize the dominant controls on unregulated streamflow dynamics over a range of hydroclimatic regions and timescales wagener et al 2007 kennard et al 2010 carrillo et al 2011 sawicz et al 2011 coopersmith et al 2012 ye et al 2012 botter et al 2013 berghuijs et al 2014 however to the best of our knowledge the impact of damming on streamflow regime classification still remains unexplored in this study we seek to identify the main climatic controls on unregulated river flow regimes and then we investigate how climate based classifications are affected by river regulation through dams specifically the study aims to explore two research questions are climate signatures that modulate spatial patterns of natural flow regimes still visible in regulated flow regimes how is this related to reservoir functions and features these questions are addressed relying on the similarity framework proposed by berghuijs et al 2014 that summarizes the climatic control on natural streamflow dynamics through three indexes namely the aridity index the precipitation timing and the snow fraction here a fourth climatic index i e the rainfall frequency is included in the analysis to quantify the intra seasonal variability of precipitation and natural discharges crucially the study extends the application to regulated flow regimes to this aim we investigate the existing correlation between discharges upstream and downstream of climatically coherent classes of dams assuming that it would implicitly define the extent of climatic control on regulated streamflows and we relate the observed signature to specific reservoir features and functions the analysis is performed at both the seasonal and annual timescale to account for the temporal patterns of hydrological alterations by dams overall the study focuses on a selection of 42 dammed catchments covering several main functions of u s reservoirs and the heterogeneity of the hydro climatic regimes that characterize central and eastern u s 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and hydroclimatic data the study considers a selection of 42 dams located in central and eastern united states selected dams fulfil specific requirements they are not preceded by other dams along the river network so as to ensure the unregulated nature of incoming flows they are located between two flow gauges providing long term discharge records of upstream and downstream flows they are fed by independent i e not nested catchments so as to maximize the heterogeneity of hydro climatic settings covered by the study finally they are characterized by a storage of the order of 10 3 km3 so as to be eligible to visibly impact river hydrology graf 1999 ferrazzi and botter 2019 information about selected dams are reported in table 1 u s army corps of engineers 1980 2015 in spite of all the different functions reported

similarity framework in this study the extent of climatic control on streamflow regimes upstream and downstream of our selection of dams is investigated through a climate based similarity framework climatic conditions are described through four quantitative indexes each of which represents a primary driver of catchment water balance and streamflow dynamics these indexes are evaluated using climatic data spatially distributed within the contributing catchments of 42 dams between 1980 and 2017 and are used to organize catchments into coherent clusters the nature of climatic controls on unregulated and regulated river flow regimes is then investigated through the analysis of within cluster hydrological similarities and between cluster differences in reaches upstream of selected dams and downstream of the same during the reference time period despite the increasing awareness on the influence of reservoirs on local climatic conditions shibuo et al 2007 degu et al 2011 degu and hossain 2012 jaramillo and destouni 2015 levi et al 2015 for operational reasons in the current analysis we assume that climate indexes are not dependent on reservoir storage and water regulation this is possible thanks to the negligible extent of anthropogenic water bodies in the considered catchments the average ratio between reservoir surface and catchment contributing area among all the

that are ultimately reflected by streamflow regimes finally the snow fraction is responsible for the magnitude of carryover flows that originate from snow accumulation and melting phenomena woods 2009 thayyen and gergan 2010 schaefli et al 2013 the above climate indexes are evaluated across all the pixels belonging to the contributing catchments of selected dams and a spatial average of each index is used in the following analysis evaluation of Œª p relies on daily rainfall time series and simply consists in computing the relative period of time in days in which rainfall depth is at least equal to 1 mm e g doulatyari et al 2017 differently evaluation of œï Œ¥ p and f s is based on the seasonal dynamics of precipitation p air temperature t and potential evapotranspiration pet at extra tropical locations temporal patterns of climatic variables display a one year dominant period being governed by the seasonality of solar irradiance trewartha 1954 seasonal dynamics of p t and pet can be thus modeled as a sine curve milly 1994b potter et al 2005 woods 2009 berghuijs et al 2014 2 p t p Œ¥ p sin 2 œÄ t s p œÑ p 3 t t t Œ¥ t sin 2 œÄ t s t œÑ t 4 pet t pet Œ¥ pet sin 2 œÄ t s pet œÑ

phase shift pertinent to the harmonic of x respectively values of œï Œ¥ p and f s are derived based on the parameters allowing for the best fitting of the sinusoidal models eqs 2 3 and 4 to the observed time series of the relevant quantities during the average year a 45 day moving average is applied to smooth observed data so as to preserve the seasonal behaviour of x while filtering out its short term variability berghuijs et al 2014 the least square minimization problem is solved by means of the newton raphson method after the fitting is performed the values of œï Œ¥ p and f s are

t and pet the term f s in eq 7 instead identifies the fraction of precipitation falling as snow since t 0 is the temperature below which precipitation starts out as snow f s ranges from 0 to 1 where f s 0 f s 1 means that all precipitation falls as rain snow 2 2 2 construction of coherent clusters and assessment of their hydrological similarity the four indexes œï Œ¥ p f s and Œª p are used to organize the considered selection of study catchments into climatically coherent clusters classification is obtained by means of a cluster analysis based on spatially averaged values of the four climate indexes across the contributing catchments of selected dams sawicz et al 2011 coopersmith et al 2012 ye et al 2012 the approach treats each study sites as an object with a specific location in the climate indexes hyper space and evaluates the euclidean distance between each possible couple of objects those located close to each other and relatively far from other objects are grouped together forming a specific cluster additional information on the construction of climatically coherent classes of sites are presented in the supporting information sections s1 and s2 1 the hydrological coherence of clusters is then investigated analyzing the nature of streamflow regimes across the clusters and within each cluster the nature of river flow regimes is first studied through the evaluation of the mean and coefficient of variation of daily flows q and cv q at both the seasonal and annual timescales these are the first two moments of the discharge frequency distribution and quantify the average availability of water and the relative variability of flows in rivers respectively botter et al 2013 lazzaro et al 2013 particularly cv q enables a quantitative differentiation of streamflow regimes cv q 1 implies stable persistent regimes while cv q 1 variable erratic regimes the hydrological coherence of catchment clusters of unregulated reaches is then assessed by evaluating within cluster hydrological similarities and between cluster differences in terms of the two aforementioned streamflow signatures likewise the similarity of the entire hydrograph is analyzed through the evaluation of the rmse observations standard deviation ratio that is computed for each pair of clusters m and k based on the observed time series of unregulated discharges during the average year moriasi et al 2007 saha et al 2014 8 rsr m k 1 n n 1 n i 1 365 q i n q i k 2 i 1 365 q i n q k 2 in eq 8 n indicates the number of sites belonging to cluster m i is the considered day q i n is the streamflow observed in site n on day i q i k is the mean discharge of sites belonging to cluster k on day i and q k is the annual average of q i k low and high values of rsr m k when m k and m k respectively imply that the variance between hydrologic regimes of specific clusters is smaller than that of hydrologic regimes of different clusters proving the hydrological coherence of clusters once the hydrological coherence of clusters is assessed upstream of dams unregulated and regulated flow regimes are compared within and between clusters to understand what is the impact of dams on streamflow regimes and assess to what extent climatic signatures can be identified in regulated flows the main assumption is that the existing degree of correlation between unregulated and regulated flows implicitly define the relation between regulated discharges and climatic conditions this assumption is further justified by the observed internal homogeneity of climatic drivers within each contributing catchments of selected dams see section s2 1 and fig s1 in turn deriving by the enhanced homogeneity of land cover and topography specifically the analysis of cluster coherence in regulated reaches is based on the evaluation of q and cv q in the period of time when synchronous discharge records are available in unregulated and regulated reaches the value of rsr m k based on regulated hydrographs is also calculated for each couple of clusters and compared with the corresponding estimate for unregulated regimes 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic regimes across the central eastern united states the four climatic indexes of the 42 considered catchments exhibit great spatial heterogeneities see fig 1 the aridity index œï is lowest in northeastern u s especially over the appalachians and increases to the south and with distance from the atlantic coast peaking in central u s rainfall frequency Œª p exhibits an opposite pattern declining from approximately 0 40 1 d in high elevation northeastern catchments to 0 20 1 d in relatively flat basins of central plains accordingly while eastern sites are typically humid drier conditions are observed moving westwards with annual water losses from evapotranspiration that can be higher than the annual precipitation in central u s e g kansas and western missouri precipitation timing Œ¥ p is typically characterized by positive values across the entire central eastern u s indicating summer dominant precipitation in phase with temperature and evapotranspiration rainfall seasonality is particularly pronounced in central u s i e Œ¥ p 0 40 and declines towards the east important exceptions are represented by southern catchments located in e g georgia south carolina and southern kentucky where Œ¥ p is always close to zero indicating that precipitation has limited seasonality finally the snow fraction reveals that a significant percentage of precipitation falls as snow in northeastern catchments i e 0 20 f s 0 35 this percentage decreases westward where observed snowfall events mainly derive from east coast winter storms and southward where the percentage of solid precipitation is always close to zero carter et al 2014 pryor et al 2014 schafer et al 2014 despite the significant variability displayed by climatic indexes catchments can be grouped into four classes that show remarkable within cluster climatic similarities and between cluster differences in terms of Œª p œï Œ¥ p and f s see fig 2 b interestingly clusters also exhibit a visible spatial coherence see fig 2 a this pattern is observed both over the entire period of analysis and across different sub periods see section s2 2 and fig s2 classes 1 and 4 include catchments in northeastern and central u s respectively and display contrasting climate regimes sites belonging to class 1 are humid with the lowest values of the aridity index and the shortest rainfall inter arrival time these catchments exhibit a significant snowmelt component and moderate in phase seasonality of rainfall on the other hand sites belonging to class 4 are characterized by infrequent rainfall events and abundant evapotranspiration water losses due to the highest values of the aridity index and significant summer dominant precipitation in phase with temperature and evapotranspiration therein the fraction of precipitation falling as snow is moderate classes 2 and 3 include catchments in southern and midwestern u s respectively they display intermediate climate conditions as compared to classes 1 and 4 though the lack of snowmelt component and rainfall seasonality is a typical feature of southern catchments belonging to class 2 an emblematic example of climatic differences between classes in terms of œï f s Œ¥ p and Œª p is presented in fig s3 3 2 climatic signatures in flow regimes in this section the influence of river regulation through dams on climate signatures of streamflows depending on dam functions and features is evaluated by comparing unregulated and regulated flows of specific catchment groups the analysis is based on a pair watershed framework to avoid the interference of climate change typical of pre dam vs post dam approaches graf 2006 jones and hammond 2020 3 2 1 unregulated streamflows at the annual time scale spatial patterns of climatic conditions are also mirrored by natural flow regimes thereby implying that flow regimes in catchments belonging to the same climatic cluster tend to be similar fig 3 shows the mean annual flow and the coefficient of variation of daily flows in the upstream reaches of selected dams across classes in particular the analysis reveals significant within cluster hydrological similarities and between cluster differences mainly resulting from the observed patterns of aridity precipitation timing and rainfall frequency catchments in class 1 exhibit the largest and least variable streamflows owing to the relatively frequent precipitation events while catchments in class 4 are characterized by limited and highly variable streamflows in response to sporadic rainfall events intermediate river flow regimes are observed in classes 2 and 3 overall while the annual average discharge decreases from class 1 to 4 the annual coefficient of variation exhibits the opposite trend see fig 3 a and b in compliance with previous studies botter et al 2013 destouni et al 2013 rossi et al 2016 deal et al 2018 accordingly discharge frequency distributions look humped shaped as typical of persistent regimes in class 1 and to an increasing extent monotonically decreasing from class 2 to class 4 as typical of erratic regimes see fig 3 c remarkably the hydrological variability cv q of catchments belonging to classes 1 and 2 is similar this might be explained by the absence of rainfall seasonality i e Œ¥ p 0 typical of southern basins i e class 2 therein groundwater contribution to streamflow is relatively stable due to the high rainfall temporal homogeneity thereby reducing river flow fluctuations the ability of climatic clusters to identify spatial patterns of q nat and cv nat is also confirmed by the analysis of the rmse observations standard deviation ratio see table 2 the value of rsr m k is lowest when comparing unregulated discharges of catchments that are part of the same class i e m k diagonal terms of table 2 while larger values emerge from a between class analysis of streamflow time series i e m k off diagonal terms of table 2 in agreement with inter class patterns of q nat and cv nat off diagonal terms showing smaller differences with diagonal terms are those comparing river flow regimes of consequent classes the lowest difference is observed between rsr 2 1 and rsr 2 2 due to the similarity in the hydrological variability of classes 1 and 2 while the largest difference emerges between rsr 1 4 and rsr 1 1 3 2 2 regulated streamflows at the annual time scale the analysis of flow alterations induced by dams reveal a strong dependence on reservoir functions with significant differences emerging between water supply dams and all the other structures ferrazzi and botter 2019 accordingly the impact of dams on the climatic signatures of river flow regimes is first investigated focusing on flood control and multipurpose structures and then the analysis is extended to reservoirs operated to supply freshwater in most cases the annual average discharge observed upstream and downstream of either flood control or multipurpose dams is similar as a consequence the inter class pattern exhibited by unregulated mean flows is preserved also when mean regulated flows are concerned see fig 4 a on the other hand the daily coefficient of variation evaluated at the annual time scale is significantly altered because of flood mitigation that is responsible for a significant reduction of streamflow variability these results are in line with the existing literature poff et al 2007 destouni et al 2013 jaramillo and destouni 2015 overall cv reg maintains the inter class pattern observed in unregulated regimes though a visible reduction of within and between cluster differences are observed see fig 4 b the homogenization of regional streamflow dynamics is attributable to the average regulation capacity of reservoirs belonging to each class r c whose value controls the magnitude of downstream flow alterations graf 1999 jaramillo and destouni 2015 ferrazzi and botter 2019 r c exhibits a spatial pattern that largely resembles that shown by the natural variability of discharges thereby increasing from class 1 to class 4 see fig 4 b and c remarkably this pattern is preserved also when the r c of single structures is related to the variability of the corresponding inflows see section s2 3 and fig s4 a and b accordingly the ability of dams to smooth streamflow fluctuations is enhanced for more erratic regimes with dams in class 1 that exert a limited impact on weakly variable inflows and dams in class 4 that greatly reduce the significant fluctuations of unregulated discharges this is in line with the key role played by the hydrological variability in the design of reservoir regulation capacity with largest design peak flows associated to more erratic regimes basso et al 2016 usace 2018 remarkably though reservoir regulation capacity is responsible for the smoothing of between cluster differences typical of unregulated discharges the inter class pattern of cv nat is maintained also in regulated regimes with cv reg increasing from class 1 to class 4 the observed homogenization of river flow regimes can induce severe consequences on stream ecosystems promoting the emergence of non native organisms and the reduction of the diversity of aquatic habitats moyle and mount 2007 poff et al 2007 the analysis is then extended to include reservoirs only operated to supply freshwater the number of these structures in the four classes is 4 3 2 and 0 respectively therefore no water supply dams belong to class 4 the annual mean and coefficient of variation of flows downstream of water supply dams are significantly impacted by regulation the mean discharge decreases as a consequence of water withdrawn while the relative streamflow variability increases as shown by previous studies ferrazzi and botter 2019 overall the inter class pattern of q typical of unregulated flow regimes is altered significantly as the downstream reduction of the average discharge declines from class 1 to 3 resulting in a lower water availability where more abundant upstream flows are observed see red dots in fig 4 d cv q instead exhibits an opposite trend being strongly anticorrelated with q see fig 4 e this behaviour is explained by the average degree of exploitation typical of each class r e that modulates the reduction of the mean discharge downstream of dams and the consequent increase of the relative streamflow variability for the selected study sites r e is maximum in northeastern u s and declines moving southwards and westwards decreasing from class 1 to class 3 see fig 4 f since two thirds of public water withdrawals in the u s have been almost constantly supplied by surface water resources through dams usgs 1950 2015 sankarasubramanian et al 2017 the pattern of r e is not only associated with the geographic variation of mean water availability but also with the pattern of urban water consumption which in turns depends on population density in the urban areas served by reservoirs this behaviour is confirmed also by a dam by dam analysis of the relationship between r e and the nature of unregulated flows see section s2 3 and fig s4 c and d water supply structures belonging to class 1 are used to supply freshwater to the cities of boston and new york e g pepacton and quabbin table 1 new york city department of environmental protection 2020 department of conservation and recreation 2020 while reservoirs belonging to class 2 and 3 supplies smaller cities or rural areas e g w c bowen and rocky gorge table 1 spartanburg water 2020 washington suburban sanitary commission 2020 accordingly in central eastern u s water supply structures do not simply homogenize streamflow dynamics such as flood control and multipurpose dams but actually reverse regional patterns typical of unregulated regimes and thus conceal the influence of climate on river flows regimes of downstream reaches from an ecological perspective the spatial heterogeneity of discharge variability promoted by diversified exploitation strategies of water supply reservoirs might compensate the loss of diversity of streamflow regimes promoted by flood control dams however regimes characterized by prolonged droughts disrupted by sporadic events downstream of the most exploited dams inevitably alter biophysical attributes of riverine environments e g velocity temperature water depth nutrient and sediment loads and limit the ecosystem size dewson et al 2007 ferrazzi and botter 2019 table 3 presents the analysis of the rmse observations standard deviation ratio calculated based on regulated river flows values of rsr m k are still lower when considering discharge releases typical of reservoirs belonging to the same class implying that cluster hydrological coherence is preserved after river regulation however differences between diagonal and off diagonal terms are reduced in comparison to those observed for unregulated regimes see table 2 this is especially true when including streamflow releases from water supply structures with values of rsr 1 1 and rsr 2 2 that halve their difference with off diagonal terms in spite of the relative small number of dams operated to supply freshwater belonging to classes 1 and 2 since climate signatures are visible in unregulated reaches as well as in most regulated ones our analysis indicates that the application of similarity frameworks of the type presented in this paper could be potentially extended to regulated catchments however particular attention should be paid to the reservoir main function and to the region specific correlation between water supply and climatic conditions responsible for reversing natural patterns of mean water availability and hydrological variability in central eastern u s 3 2 3 unregulated streamflows at the seasonal time scale the hydrological coherence of the climatic clusters identified in section 3 1 and 3 2 1 for unregulated reaches is preserved also at the seasonal time scale the seasonal mean and coefficient of variation of flows exhibit the same inter class patterns observed at the annual time scale with the average discharge decreasing from class 1 to 4 and the coefficient of variation showing the opposite trend see figs s5 s8 a and c little deviations emerge only during the summer in this season the peak of precipitation is particularly pronounced in the central u s Œ¥ p 0 40 in class 4 and declines towards the east 0 10 Œ¥ p 0 20 in class 1 resulting in a relative increase of mean water availability where limited streamflow are typically observed this smooths the inter cluster variability of q nat see fig 5 c at the seasonal time scale the influence of snowiness on natural flow regimes can be detected more clearly this is evident in the spring season on account of the significant difference Œ¥ q between the mean water availability of class 1 the only one with a significant fraction of precipitation falling as snow i e 0 20 f s 0 35 and that of the other classes with Œ¥ q 1 72 1 25 0 84 mm d in the spring season and Œ¥ q 1 19 0 88 0 56 mm d across the entire year note that values are reported for class 2 3 and 4 respectively see fig 5 a this is an indication that in the spring season the average discharge of northeastern catchments is noticeably increased by melting phenomena 3 2 4 regulated streamflows at the seasonal time scale the seasonal mean and coefficient of variation of regulated discharges downstream of flood control and multipurpose reservoirs exhibit the same behaviour observed at the annual time scale both q reg and cv reg maintain the inter class pattern observed upstream of dams in spite of a remarkable homogenization of regional streamflow dynamics see figs s5 s8 however little variations related to the seasonal pattern of downstream flow alterations can be observed flood control dams typically store water during high flow periods and subsequently release the stored water volumes with the goal of supporting downstream social and ecological needs accordingly our results show a reduction of the average discharge downstream of the dams during the spring season when water availability is typically larger compensated for the provision of an increased flow during the other seasons see boxplots in fig 5 a and c these findings agree with the results of a recent study by jones and hammond 2020 that analyzes the management of large reservoirs in the columbia river basin usa and demonstrate the ability of these structures to reduce the imbalance between water availability and demand through a progressive adaptation to the ongoing changes of hydroclimatic properties we observe that the extent of flow reallocation varies significantly among sites and seasons and is thus responsible for slight alterations of the inter class pattern of q reg this is especially true during the summer when between class differences are particularly low in unregulated reaches see fig 5 c thus in such cases the pattern of cv q observed in natural regimes can be partially reversed by regulation accordingly the typical inter class variability of cv reg is smoothed in response to the strong anticorrelation between hydrological variability and mean water availability see fig 5 d whenever water supply reservoirs are included in the analysis the conclusions presented in section 3 2 2 still apply 4 conclusion in this study we seek to identify whether climate signatures that modulate spatial patterns of the hydrologic response can be detected in regulated flow regimes and whether this is conditional on reservoir functions and features to this aim a climate based similarity framework is applied to a selection of sites in central and eastern u s and the impact of reservoirs on the obtained classification is analyzed hydroclimatic conditions observed in the contributing catchments upstream of dams display pronounced spatial patterns particularly we observe the decrease of rainfall frequency and the growth of water losses through evapotranspiration while moving towards the south and central u s with river flow regimes that exhibit an increasing erraticity overall the study sites are classified into four hydroclimatically coherent clusters located in northeastern class 1 southern class 2 midwestern class 3 and central class 4 u s these clusters are characterized by natural mean water availability decreasing from class 1 to 4 and natural streamflow variability showing the opposite trend the comparison between unregulated and regulated flow regimes reveals that climatic signatures in most cases are still visible downstream of dams though the control exerted by climate on flow regimes is partially concealed by the profound hydrological alterations induced by regulation see table 3 specifically flood control and multipurpose structures leave unaltered the regional pattern of the hydrological response observed upstream of each dam but reduce streamflow variability and thus promote river flow homogenization among classes this is explained by spatial variations of reservoir regulation capacity whose pattern resembles that shown by flow variability thereby resulting in a more important reduction of river flow fluctuations for more erratic regimes see fig 4 a c on the other hand water supply reservoirs reverse the patterns of mean water availability and hydrological variability observed upstream of dams hiding the influence of climate on streamflow regimes in downstream reaches thus water supply dams significantly reduce the extent of climatic control on regulated discharges across central and eastern u s this result is explained by the observed trend of reservoir degree of exploitation that grows more rapidly than water availability across the study area driven by pattern of water demand see fig 4 d f despite the site specific nature of the analysis and the limited number of reservoirs included in this study this work provides a first clue for the sustainable operation of water infrastructures in a context of changing climate and increasing freshwater exploitation nowadays climate models are likely to represent a powerful tool for the adaptation of river regulation strategies to climate change a large scale phenomenon which is leading to significant modifications on the hydrological cycle this study indicates that climate based management strategies could be applied to both isolated structures and reservoir systems i e structures built in cascade along the river network as we observe that climate signatures are visible in unregulated reaches as well as in most regulated settings in this context particular attention should be paid to differentiate mitigation strategies depending on the underlying reservoir functions and features in the light of the strong linkages between reservoir characteristics and the type of downstream alterations induced by dams on climate signatures of streamflows authors contribution m f conceptualization software

8223,study region 42 catchments distributed throughout central and eastern u s study focus enhanced hydroclimatic variability threatens human water uses and there is an urgent need to quantify projected alterations of flow regimes this issue has been largely addressed in unregulated rivers through the development of similarity frameworks relating climate properties with the hydrologic response of catchments however the impact of damming on climate signatures of river flow regimes is largely unexplored to fill this gap this study investigates unregulated streamflows of a selection of sites using a climate based similarity framework then the corresponding regulated regimes are analyzed to understand how the obtained regime classification is affected by regulation new hydrological insights for the region our results reveal that flood control dams retain but dampen climate signatures of flow regimes reducing the regional heterogeneity of downstream hydrographs conversely in the study area urban water supply structures promote climate independence of river regimes and tend to break the link between climate and river flows thereby promoting the spatial diversification of the hydrologic response the observed impact of each specific water use is explained based on quantitative indexes that relates to the regulation capacity of reservoirs and their degree of exploitation overall climatic signatures are still detectable in most regulated streamflows though climatic control on river regimes is largely concealed by the profound hydrological alterations induced by dams 2010 msc 00 01 99 00 keywords hydroclimatic variability similarity frameworks river flow regimes reservoirs 1 introduction streamflow regimes describe the temporal

timing and amount of water input losses in the form of precipitation evapotranspiration are known to be the main drivers of the catchment water balance which in turn shapes streamflow dynamics pike

the relative contribution of climate variability and human regulation in controlling hydrologic regimes downstream of reservoirs becomes a useful supporting tool to improve existing strategies and allow a more sustainable exploitation of freshwater resources thompson et al 2013 the relevance of the subject stems from the wide implications of these issues for the management of river infrastructures located downstream of dams as well as for the ecological and geomorphological evolution of engineered reaches poff and zimmerman 2010 ludwig et al 2014 safavi et al 2015 essenfelder et al 2018 in spite of the marked spatial heterogeneity of river regimes catchment classification has emerged among hydrologists as a fundamental tool to enhance understanding of the relationship between the hydroclimatic forcing and river flows to date existing studies have mainly focused on the development of similarity frameworks that classify the hydrologic behavior of pristine catchments on the basis of key climate and landscape physical properties these works shed light on the metrics that better summarize the dominant controls on unregulated streamflow dynamics over a range of hydroclimatic regions and timescales wagener et al 2007 kennard et al 2010 carrillo et al 2011 sawicz et al 2011 coopersmith et al 2012 ye et al 2012 botter et al 2013 berghuijs et al 2014 however to the best of our knowledge the impact of damming on streamflow regime classification still remains unexplored in this study we seek to identify the main climatic controls on unregulated river flow regimes and then we investigate how climate based classifications are affected by river regulation through dams specifically the study aims to explore two research questions are climate signatures that modulate spatial patterns of natural flow regimes still visible in regulated flow regimes how is this related to reservoir functions and features these questions are addressed relying on the similarity framework proposed by berghuijs et al 2014 that summarizes the climatic control on natural streamflow dynamics through three indexes namely the aridity index the precipitation timing and the snow fraction here a fourth climatic index i e the rainfall frequency is included in the analysis to quantify the intra seasonal variability of precipitation and natural discharges crucially the study extends the application to regulated flow regimes to this aim we investigate the existing correlation between discharges upstream and downstream of climatically coherent classes of dams assuming that it would implicitly define the extent of climatic control on regulated streamflows and we relate the observed signature to specific reservoir features and functions the analysis is performed at both the seasonal and annual timescale to account for the temporal patterns of hydrological alterations by dams overall the study focuses on a selection of 42 dammed catchments covering several main functions of u s reservoirs and the heterogeneity of the hydro climatic regimes that characterize central and eastern u s 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and hydroclimatic data the study considers a selection of 42 dams located in central and eastern united states selected dams fulfil specific requirements they are not preceded by other dams along the river network so as to ensure the unregulated nature of incoming flows they are located between two flow gauges providing long term discharge records of upstream and downstream flows they are fed by independent i e not nested catchments so as to maximize the heterogeneity of hydro climatic settings covered by the study finally they are characterized by a storage of the order of 10 3 km3 so as to be eligible to visibly impact river hydrology graf 1999 ferrazzi and botter 2019 information about selected dams are reported in table 1 u s army corps of engineers 1980 2015 in spite of all the different functions reported for each structure only the most important are here considered i e flood control water supply and power generation while specific reservoir features taken into account by the study are reservoir

similarity framework in this study the extent of climatic control on streamflow regimes upstream and downstream of our selection of dams is investigated through a climate based similarity framework climatic conditions are described through four quantitative indexes each of which represents a primary driver of catchment water balance and streamflow dynamics these indexes are evaluated using climatic data spatially distributed within the contributing catchments of 42 dams between 1980 and 2017 and are used to organize catchments into coherent clusters the nature of climatic controls on unregulated and regulated river flow regimes is then investigated through the analysis of within cluster hydrological similarities and between cluster differences in reaches upstream of selected dams and downstream of the same during the reference time period despite the increasing awareness on the influence of reservoirs on local climatic conditions shibuo et al 2007 degu et al 2011 degu and hossain 2012 jaramillo and destouni 2015 levi et al 2015 for operational reasons in the current analysis we assume that climate indexes are not dependent on reservoir storage and water regulation this is possible thanks to the negligible extent of anthropogenic water bodies in the considered catchments the average ratio between reservoir surface and catchment contributing area among all the considered case studies is equal to 0 0124 2 2 1 climate indexes the presented approach relies on the work proposed by berghuijs et al 2014 accordingly four indexes are identified to express the key climatic control over streamflow dynamics i aridity œï ii precipitation timing Œ¥ p iii rainfall frequency Œª p iv snow fraction f s aridity shapes the partition of rainfall into evapotranspiration and streamflow budyko 1974 milly 1994b precipitation timing and frequency govern the dynamics of catchment water storage porporato et al 2004 potter et al 2005 hickel and zhang 2006 botter et al 2009 that are ultimately reflected by streamflow regimes finally the snow fraction is responsible for the magnitude of carryover flows that originate from snow accumulation and melting phenomena woods 2009 thayyen and gergan 2010 schaefli et al 2013 the above climate indexes are evaluated across all the pixels belonging to the contributing catchments of selected dams and a spatial average of each index is used in the following analysis evaluation of Œª p relies on daily rainfall time series and simply consists in computing the relative period of time in days in which rainfall depth is at least equal to 1 mm e g doulatyari et al 2017 differently evaluation of œï Œ¥ p and f s is based on the seasonal dynamics of precipitation p air temperature t and potential evapotranspiration pet at extra tropical locations temporal patterns of climatic variables display a one year dominant period being governed by the seasonality of solar irradiance trewartha 1954 seasonal dynamics of p t and pet can be thus modeled as a sine curve milly 1994b potter et al 2005 woods 2009 berghuijs et al 2014 2 p t p Œ¥ p sin 2 œÄ t s p œÑ p 3 t t t Œ¥ t sin 2 œÄ t s t œÑ t 4 pet t pet Œ¥ pet sin 2 œÄ t s pet œÑ pet where x represents the average value of the climatic variable x i e x p t or pet œÑ x is the duration of the seasonal cycle of x i e 1 year while Œ¥ x and s x are the seasonal amplitude and the phase shift pertinent to the harmonic of x respectively values of œï Œ¥ p and f s are derived based on the parameters allowing for the best fitting of the sinusoidal models eqs 2 3 and 4 to the observed time series of the relevant quantities during the average year a 45 day moving average is applied to smooth observed data so as to preserve the seasonal behaviour of x while filtering out its short term variability berghuijs et al 2014 the least square minimization problem is solved by means of the newton raphson method after the fitting is performed the values of œï Œ¥ p and f s are estimated as explained hereafter the aridity index œï is evaluated as proposed by budyko 1974 5 œï pet p in eq 5 œï represents a first order approximation of the correlation between the atmospheric demand and supply of water i e annual average potential evapotranspiration pet and annual average rainfall p respectively at the basin scale the theoretical range of œï is comprised between 0 i e

between 1 and 1 where Œ¥ p 1 indicates winter dominant precipitation out of phase with temperature and potential evapotranspiration while Œ¥ p 1 implies summer dominant precipitation in agreement with t and pet the term f s in eq 7 instead identifies the fraction of precipitation falling as snow since t 0 is the temperature below which precipitation starts out as snow f s ranges from 0 to 1 where f s 0 f s 1 means that all precipitation falls as rain snow 2 2 2 construction of coherent clusters and assessment of their hydrological similarity the four indexes œï Œ¥ p f s and Œª p are used to organize the considered selection of study catchments into climatically coherent clusters classification is obtained by means of a cluster analysis based on spatially averaged values of the four climate indexes across the contributing catchments of selected dams sawicz et al 2011 coopersmith et al 2012 ye et al 2012 the approach treats each study sites as an object with a specific location in the climate indexes hyper space and evaluates the euclidean distance between each possible couple of objects those located close to each other and relatively far from other objects are grouped together forming a specific cluster additional information on the construction of climatically coherent classes of sites are presented in the supporting information sections s1 and s2 1 the hydrological coherence of clusters is then investigated analyzing the nature of streamflow regimes across the clusters and within each cluster the nature of river flow regimes is first studied through the evaluation of the mean and coefficient of variation of daily flows q and cv q at both the seasonal and annual timescales these are the first two moments of the discharge frequency distribution and quantify the average availability of water and the relative variability of flows in rivers respectively botter et al 2013 lazzaro et al 2013 particularly cv q enables a quantitative differentiation of streamflow regimes cv q 1 implies stable persistent regimes while cv q 1 variable erratic regimes the hydrological coherence of catchment clusters of unregulated reaches is then assessed by evaluating within cluster hydrological similarities and between cluster differences in terms of the two aforementioned streamflow signatures likewise the similarity of the entire hydrograph is analyzed through the evaluation of the rmse observations standard deviation ratio that is computed for each pair of clusters m and k based on the observed time series of unregulated discharges during the average year moriasi et al 2007 saha et al 2014 8 rsr m k 1 n n 1 n i 1 365 q i n q i k 2 i 1 365 q i n q k 2 in eq 8 n indicates the number of sites belonging to cluster m i is the considered day q i n is the streamflow observed in site n on day i q i k is the mean discharge of sites belonging to cluster k on day i and q k is the annual average of q i k low and high values of rsr m k when m k and m k respectively imply that the variance between hydrologic regimes of specific clusters is smaller than that of hydrologic regimes of different clusters proving the hydrological coherence of clusters once the hydrological coherence of clusters is assessed upstream of dams unregulated and regulated flow regimes are compared within and between clusters to understand what is the impact of dams on streamflow regimes and assess to what extent climatic signatures can be identified in regulated flows the main assumption is that the existing degree of correlation between unregulated and regulated flows implicitly define the relation between regulated discharges and climatic conditions this assumption is further justified by the observed internal homogeneity of climatic drivers within each contributing catchments of selected dams see section s2 1 and fig s1 in turn deriving by the enhanced homogeneity of land cover and topography specifically the analysis of cluster coherence in regulated reaches is based on the evaluation of q and cv q in the period of time when synchronous discharge records are available in unregulated and regulated reaches the value of rsr m k based on regulated hydrographs is also calculated for each couple of clusters and compared with the corresponding estimate for unregulated regimes 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic regimes across the central eastern united states the four climatic indexes of the 42 considered catchments exhibit great spatial heterogeneities see fig 1 the aridity index œï is lowest in northeastern u s especially over the appalachians and increases to the south and with distance from the atlantic coast peaking in central u s rainfall frequency Œª p exhibits an opposite pattern declining from approximately 0 40 1 d in high elevation northeastern catchments to 0 20 1 d in relatively flat basins of central plains accordingly while eastern sites are typically humid drier conditions are observed moving westwards with annual water losses from evapotranspiration that can be higher than the annual precipitation in central u s e g kansas and western missouri precipitation timing Œ¥ p is typically characterized by positive values across the entire central eastern u s indicating summer dominant precipitation in phase with temperature and evapotranspiration rainfall seasonality is particularly pronounced in central u s i e Œ¥ p 0 40 and declines towards the east important exceptions are represented by southern catchments located in e g georgia south carolina and southern kentucky where Œ¥ p is always close to zero indicating that precipitation has limited seasonality finally the snow fraction reveals that a significant percentage of precipitation falls as snow in northeastern catchments i e 0 20 f s 0 35 this percentage decreases westward where observed snowfall events mainly derive from east coast winter storms and southward where the percentage of solid precipitation is always close to zero carter et al 2014 pryor et al 2014 schafer et al 2014 despite the significant variability displayed by climatic indexes catchments can be grouped into four classes that show remarkable within cluster climatic similarities and between cluster differences in terms of Œª p œï Œ¥ p and f s see fig 2 b interestingly clusters also exhibit a visible spatial coherence see fig 2 a this pattern is observed both over the entire period of analysis and across different sub periods see section s2 2 and fig s2 classes 1 and 4 include catchments in northeastern and central u s respectively and display contrasting climate regimes sites belonging to class 1 are humid with the lowest values of the aridity index and the shortest rainfall inter arrival time these catchments exhibit a significant snowmelt component and moderate in phase seasonality of rainfall on the other hand sites belonging to class 4 are characterized by infrequent rainfall events and abundant evapotranspiration water losses due to the highest values of the aridity index and significant summer dominant precipitation in phase with temperature and evapotranspiration therein the fraction of precipitation falling as snow is moderate classes 2 and 3 include catchments in southern and midwestern u s respectively they display intermediate climate conditions as compared to classes 1 and 4 though the lack of snowmelt component and rainfall seasonality is a typical feature of southern catchments belonging to class 2 an emblematic example of climatic differences between classes in terms of œï f s Œ¥ p and Œª p is presented in fig s3 3 2 climatic signatures in flow regimes in this section the influence of river regulation through dams on climate signatures of streamflows depending on dam functions and features is evaluated by comparing unregulated and regulated flows of specific catchment groups the analysis is based on a pair watershed framework to avoid the interference of climate change typical of pre dam vs post dam approaches graf 2006 jones and hammond 2020 3 2 1 unregulated streamflows at the annual time scale spatial patterns of climatic conditions are also mirrored by natural flow regimes thereby implying that flow regimes in catchments belonging to the same climatic cluster tend to be similar fig 3 shows the mean annual flow and the coefficient of variation of daily flows in the upstream reaches of selected dams across classes in particular the analysis reveals significant within cluster hydrological similarities and between cluster differences mainly resulting from the observed patterns of aridity precipitation timing and rainfall frequency catchments in class 1 exhibit the largest and least variable streamflows owing to the relatively frequent precipitation events while catchments in class 4 are characterized by limited and highly variable streamflows in response to sporadic rainfall events intermediate river flow regimes are observed in classes 2 and 3 overall while the annual average discharge decreases from class 1 to 4 the annual coefficient of variation exhibits the opposite trend see fig 3 a and b in compliance with previous studies botter et al 2013 destouni et al 2013 rossi et al 2016 deal et al 2018 accordingly discharge frequency distributions look humped shaped as typical of persistent regimes in class 1 and to an increasing extent monotonically decreasing from class 2 to class 4 as typical of erratic regimes see fig 3 c remarkably the hydrological variability cv q of catchments belonging to classes 1 and 2 is similar this might be explained by the absence of rainfall seasonality i e Œ¥ p 0 typical of southern basins i e class 2 therein groundwater contribution to streamflow is relatively stable due to the high rainfall temporal homogeneity thereby reducing river flow fluctuations the ability of climatic clusters to identify spatial patterns of q nat and cv nat is also confirmed by the analysis of the rmse observations standard deviation ratio see table 2 the value of rsr m k is lowest when comparing unregulated discharges of catchments that are part of the same class i e m k diagonal terms of table 2 while larger values emerge from a between class analysis of streamflow time series i e m k off diagonal terms of table 2 in agreement with inter class patterns of q nat and cv nat off diagonal terms showing smaller differences with diagonal terms are those comparing river flow regimes of consequent classes the lowest difference is observed between rsr 2 1 and rsr 2 2 due to the similarity in the hydrological variability of classes 1 and 2 while the largest difference emerges between rsr 1 4 and rsr 1 1 3 2 2 regulated streamflows at the annual time scale the analysis of flow alterations induced by dams reveal a strong dependence on reservoir functions with significant differences emerging between water supply dams and all the other structures ferrazzi and botter 2019 accordingly the impact of dams on the climatic signatures of river flow regimes is first investigated focusing on flood control and multipurpose structures and then the analysis is extended to reservoirs operated to supply freshwater in most cases the annual average discharge observed upstream and downstream of either flood control or multipurpose dams is similar as a consequence the inter class pattern exhibited by unregulated mean flows is preserved also when mean regulated flows are concerned see fig 4 a on the other hand the daily coefficient of variation evaluated at the annual time scale is significantly altered because of flood mitigation that is responsible for a significant reduction of streamflow variability these results are in line with the existing literature poff et al 2007 destouni et al 2013 jaramillo and destouni 2015 overall cv reg maintains the inter class pattern observed in unregulated regimes though a visible reduction of within and between cluster differences are observed see fig 4 b the homogenization of regional streamflow dynamics is attributable to the average regulation capacity of reservoirs belonging to each class r c whose value controls the magnitude of downstream flow alterations graf 1999 jaramillo and destouni 2015 ferrazzi and botter 2019 r c exhibits a spatial pattern that largely resembles that shown by the natural variability of discharges thereby increasing from class 1 to class 4 see fig 4 b and c remarkably this pattern is preserved also when the r c of single structures is related to the variability of the corresponding inflows see section s2 3 and fig s4 a and b accordingly the ability of dams to smooth streamflow fluctuations is enhanced for more erratic regimes with dams in class 1 that exert a limited impact on weakly variable inflows and dams in class 4 that greatly reduce the significant fluctuations of unregulated discharges this is in line with the key role played by the hydrological variability in the design of reservoir regulation capacity with largest design peak flows associated to more erratic regimes basso et al 2016 usace 2018 remarkably though reservoir regulation capacity is responsible for the smoothing of between cluster differences typical of unregulated discharges the inter class pattern of cv nat is maintained also in regulated regimes with cv reg increasing from class 1 to class 4 the observed homogenization of river flow regimes can induce severe consequences on stream ecosystems promoting the emergence of non native organisms and the reduction of the diversity of aquatic habitats moyle and mount 2007 poff et al 2007 the analysis is then extended to include reservoirs only operated to supply freshwater the number of these structures in the four classes is 4 3 2 and 0 respectively therefore no water supply dams belong to class 4 the annual mean and coefficient of variation of flows downstream of water supply dams are significantly impacted by regulation the mean discharge decreases as a consequence of water withdrawn while the relative streamflow variability increases as shown by previous studies ferrazzi and botter 2019 overall the inter class pattern of q typical of unregulated flow regimes is altered significantly as the downstream reduction of the average discharge declines from class 1 to 3 resulting in a lower water availability where more abundant upstream flows are observed see red dots in fig 4 d cv q instead exhibits an opposite trend being strongly anticorrelated with q see fig 4 e this behaviour is explained by the average degree of exploitation typical of each class r e that modulates the reduction of the mean discharge downstream of dams and the consequent increase of the relative streamflow variability for the selected study sites r e is maximum in northeastern u s and declines moving southwards and westwards decreasing from class 1 to class 3 see fig 4 f since two thirds of public water withdrawals in the u s have been almost constantly supplied by surface water resources through dams usgs 1950 2015 sankarasubramanian et al 2017 the pattern of r e is not only associated with the geographic variation of mean water availability but also with the pattern of urban water consumption which in turns depends on population density in the urban areas served by reservoirs this behaviour is confirmed also by a dam by dam analysis of the relationship between r e and the nature of unregulated flows see section s2 3 and fig s4 c and d water supply structures belonging to class 1 are used to supply freshwater to the cities of boston and new york e g pepacton and quabbin table 1 new york city department of environmental protection 2020 department of conservation and recreation 2020 while reservoirs belonging to class 2 and 3 supplies smaller cities or rural areas e g w c bowen and rocky gorge table 1 spartanburg water 2020 washington suburban sanitary commission 2020 accordingly in central eastern u s water supply structures do not simply homogenize streamflow dynamics such as flood control and multipurpose dams but actually reverse regional patterns typical of unregulated regimes and thus conceal the influence of climate on river flows regimes of downstream reaches from an ecological perspective the spatial heterogeneity of discharge variability promoted by diversified exploitation strategies of water supply reservoirs might compensate the loss of diversity of streamflow regimes promoted by flood control dams however regimes characterized by prolonged droughts disrupted by sporadic events downstream of the most exploited dams inevitably alter biophysical attributes of riverine environments e g velocity temperature water depth nutrient and sediment loads and limit the ecosystem size dewson et al 2007 ferrazzi and botter 2019 table 3 presents the analysis of the rmse observations standard deviation ratio calculated based on regulated river flows values of rsr m k are still lower when considering discharge releases typical of reservoirs belonging to the same class implying that cluster hydrological coherence is preserved after river regulation however differences between diagonal and off diagonal terms are reduced in comparison to those observed for unregulated regimes see table 2 this is especially true when including streamflow releases from water supply structures with values of rsr 1 1 and rsr 2 2 that halve their difference with off diagonal terms in spite of the relative small number of dams operated to supply freshwater belonging to classes 1 and 2 since climate signatures are visible in unregulated reaches as well as in most regulated ones our analysis indicates that the application of similarity frameworks of the type presented in this paper could be potentially extended to regulated catchments however particular attention should be paid to the reservoir main function and to the region specific correlation between water supply and climatic conditions responsible for reversing natural patterns of mean water availability and hydrological variability in central eastern u s 3 2 3 unregulated streamflows at the seasonal time scale the hydrological coherence of the climatic clusters identified in section 3 1 and 3 2 1 for unregulated reaches is preserved also at the seasonal time scale the seasonal mean and coefficient of variation of flows exhibit the same inter class patterns observed at the annual time scale with the average discharge decreasing from class 1 to 4 and the coefficient of variation showing the opposite trend see figs s5 s8 a and c little deviations emerge only during the summer in this season the peak of precipitation is particularly pronounced in the central u s Œ¥ p 0 40 in class 4 and declines towards the east 0 10 Œ¥ p 0 20 in class 1 resulting in a relative increase of mean water availability where limited streamflow are typically observed this smooths the inter cluster variability of q nat see fig 5 c at the seasonal time scale the influence of snowiness on natural flow regimes can be detected more clearly this is evident in the spring season on account of the significant difference Œ¥ q between the mean water availability of class 1 the only one with a significant fraction of precipitation falling as snow i e 0 20 f s 0 35 and that of the other classes with Œ¥ q 1 72 1 25 0 84 mm d in the spring season and Œ¥ q 1 19 0 88 0 56 mm d across the entire year note that values are reported for class 2 3 and 4 respectively see fig 5 a this is an indication that in the spring season the average discharge of northeastern catchments is noticeably increased by melting phenomena 3 2 4 regulated streamflows at the seasonal time scale the seasonal mean and coefficient of variation of regulated discharges downstream of flood control and multipurpose reservoirs exhibit the same behaviour observed at the annual time scale both q reg and cv reg maintain the inter class pattern observed upstream of dams in spite of a remarkable homogenization of regional streamflow dynamics see figs s5 s8 however little variations related to the seasonal pattern of downstream flow alterations can be observed flood control dams typically store water during high flow periods and subsequently release the stored water volumes with the goal of supporting downstream social and ecological needs accordingly our results show a reduction of the average discharge downstream of the dams during the spring season when water availability is typically larger compensated for the provision of an increased flow during the other seasons see boxplots in fig 5 a and c these findings agree with the results of a recent study by jones and hammond 2020 that analyzes the management of large reservoirs in the columbia river basin usa and demonstrate the ability of these structures to reduce the imbalance between water availability and demand through a progressive adaptation to the ongoing changes of hydroclimatic properties we observe that the extent of flow reallocation varies significantly among sites and seasons and is thus responsible for slight alterations of the inter class pattern of q reg this is especially true during the summer when between class differences are particularly low in unregulated reaches see fig 5 c thus in such cases the pattern of cv q observed in natural regimes can be partially reversed by regulation accordingly the typical inter class variability of cv reg is smoothed in response to the strong anticorrelation between hydrological variability and mean water availability see fig 5 d whenever water supply reservoirs are included in the analysis the conclusions presented in section 3 2 2 still apply 4 conclusion in this study we seek to identify whether climate signatures that modulate spatial patterns of the hydrologic response can be detected in regulated flow regimes and whether this is conditional on reservoir functions and features to this aim a climate based similarity framework is applied to a selection of sites in central and eastern u s and the impact of reservoirs on the obtained classification is analyzed hydroclimatic conditions observed in the contributing catchments upstream of dams display pronounced spatial patterns particularly we observe the decrease of rainfall frequency and the growth of water losses through evapotranspiration while moving towards the south and central u s with river flow regimes that exhibit an increasing erraticity overall the study sites are classified into four hydroclimatically coherent clusters located in northeastern class 1 southern class 2 midwestern class 3 and central class 4 u s these clusters are characterized by natural mean water availability decreasing from class 1 to 4 and natural streamflow variability showing the opposite trend the comparison between unregulated and regulated flow regimes reveals that climatic signatures in most cases are still visible downstream of dams though the control exerted by climate on flow regimes is partially concealed by the profound hydrological alterations induced by regulation see table 3 specifically flood control and multipurpose structures leave unaltered the regional pattern of the hydrological response observed upstream of each dam but reduce streamflow variability and thus promote river flow homogenization among classes this is explained by spatial variations of reservoir regulation capacity whose pattern resembles that shown by flow variability thereby resulting in a more important reduction of river flow fluctuations for more erratic regimes see fig 4 a c on the other hand water supply reservoirs reverse the patterns of mean water availability and hydrological variability observed upstream of dams hiding the influence of climate on streamflow regimes in downstream reaches thus water supply dams significantly reduce the extent of climatic control on regulated discharges across central and eastern u s this result is explained by the observed trend of reservoir degree of exploitation that grows more rapidly than water availability across the study area driven by pattern of water demand see fig 4 d f despite the site specific nature of the analysis and the limited number of reservoirs included in this study this work provides a first clue for the sustainable operation of water infrastructures in a context of changing climate and increasing freshwater exploitation nowadays climate models are likely to represent a powerful tool for the adaptation of river regulation strategies to climate change a large scale phenomenon which is leading to significant modifications on the hydrological cycle this study indicates that climate based management strategies could be applied to both isolated structures and reservoir systems i e structures built in cascade along the river network as we observe that climate signatures are visible in unregulated reaches as well as in most regulated settings in this context particular attention should be paid to differentiate mitigation strategies depending on the underlying reservoir functions and features in the light of the strong linkages between reservoir characteristics and the type of downstream alterations induced by dams on climate signatures of streamflows authors contribution m f conceptualization software

8224,study region texas usa study focus texas is a large state in the us that experiences a diversity of climate conditions and water demands in this study 130 stream gauging sites and their associated watershed physical and geological properties were used to develop multiple regression models to predict the baseflow index bfi across texas calculated bfi was derived from daily streamflow data from 1980 to 2017 using the two parameter recursive digital filtering approach of the web based hydrograph analysis tool what three scenarios were developed and validated the first two scenarios related bfi to topography climate and land use the third scenario used surface geology soil type and hydrogeology parameters new hydrological insights for the region the models developed showed high performance low bias and low relative errors to predict bfi with r2 values varying from 0 72 to 0 99 and strong agreement with filtered bfi values the results further showed that there was no specific pattern for bfi variation across texas ranging from 0 29 to 0 51 outputs indicated that models developed for scenarios 1 and 3 had higher prediction performance additionally evapotranspiration et contributed to lower model accuracy since the et was not categorized as proportional to the percentages of cultivated areas within each basin but was generalized to represent the whole catchment the developed models that are reported here can support further research in groundwater modeling and baseflow prediction for ungauged sites that have similar characteristics keywords baseflow index geological mapping watershed properties prediction regression texas 1 introduction identifying the key physical processes that influence watershed baseflow are of vital significance in many hydrological research areas this identification is achieved by studying how watershed hydrology responds to different physical properties enabling broader conclusions about the behavior of watersheds estimation of some hydrological behavior of different watersheds based on catchment sizes can be approached by scaling of different physical properties hydrological properties of watersheds such as streamflow and baseflow may be estimated using different physical descriptors including meteorological and physiographic parameters as well as geological and hydrogeological parameters bloomfield et al 2009 baseflow is that part of streamflow derived from groundwater and other delayed sources into the stream hall 1968 it is one of the most important components in watershed hydrology as it sustains flow in the stream during dry seasons moderates seasonal fluctuations in temperature and typically has better quality water compared to surface water baseflow is critical for sustaining flow in rivers and streams and is often assumed to be equal to groundwater recharge aboelnour et al 2020a gebert et al 2007 in turn continual streamflow during dry seasons is integral to maintain stream biota and is required to support recreation based industries neff et al 2005 being able to understand and predict what changes will impact baseflow over time is essential in understanding the current and future changes to a watershed s hydrology especially in the face of climate change and land use alteration an evaluation of baseflow discharge is also valuable for the calibration and validation of groundwater models that are being used to investigate water supply problems cherkauer 2004 gebert et al 2007 however baseflow displays spatial and temporal variability and is dependent on a large number of watershed properties for instance topography lithology land use geomorphology vegetation soil and climatic conditions mwakalila et al 2002 therefore improvements in modeling and evaluating the relationships between these properties and baseflow are important to develop a detailed understanding of baseflow generation for specific areas baseflow evaluation at different spatial scales has been previously studied aboelnour et al 2019 haberlandt et al 2001 longobardi and villani 2008 zhang et al 2013 typically through extensive use of statistical analyzes to empirically relate baseflow to catchment characteristics lacey and grayson 1998 examined the relationship between baseflow index bfi and landscape descriptors haberlandt et al 2001 used regression techniques to derive the empirical relationship for estimation of average bfi suggesting that it was strongly related to topographical hydrogeological and precipitation characteristics another approach used linear regression methods to quantify geological controls on bfi within the thomas basin in the uk which suggested that hydrologic soils influence on bfi has a geological meaning bloomfield et al 2009 in addition regression models using meteorological land use types geomorphological and geological variables could satisfactorily predict streamflow baseflow and storm runoff in indiana wisconsin and pennsylvania under different scenarios ahiablame et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 zhu and day 2009 and in china huang et al 2020 he et al 2016 developed a new approach by combining a non linear reservoir algorithm with a meteorological regression model to correlate baseflow estimation to meteorological parameters zhang et al 2020 used linear and multilevel regression approaches between catchment properties and climate zones to estimate bfi on large scale in australia table 1 summarizes studies that used statistical regression to relate baseflow to catchment properties considering the role of baseflow in quantification and identification of the amount of groundwater storage and direct runoff other research related to baseflow evaluation in watersheds has been carried out using different hydrologic models and other techniques for instance these include conceptual lumped sacsma machbv smarg gr4j hydrologic models darbandsari and coulibaly 2020 semi distributed swat and hec hms models dwarakish and ganasri 2015 lee et al 2018 large scale variable infiltration capacity vic model mao and cherkauer 2009 recession curve displacement method rutledge and mesko 1996 water table fluctuation method healy and cook 2002 flow duration curves frisbee et al 2017 and two component or binary separation stoelzle et al 2020 additionally automated separation methods include the hydrograph separation programs hysep sloto and crouse 1996 bflow arnold and allen 1999 and the web based hydrograph analysis tool what lim et al 2005 however these are mostly limited to estimating baseflow in gauged basins in general geology soil and rock types geomorphological terrain topographical relief subsurface drainage land use change and climate are some of many factors that control the magnitude and pattern of baseflow huang et al 2016 the relationship between these physical properties and groundwater are poorly understood when it comes to which geologic unit and climate category to consider in quantifying impacts on baseflow the goal of this study was to develop regression models in texas to evaluate the relationship between climate lithology catchment properties and baseflow and to estimate the contribution of baseflow to total streamflow texas has experienced extensive changes in land use over time and is also becoming warmer and drier particularly in western areas therefore the amount of water recharging aquifers and appearing as baseflow has likely changed over the past thirty years groundwater has significantly decreased during the last few decades in some texas locations arciniega and bre√±a naranjo 2016 and water rights demands have increased dramatically due to population growth sophocleous and perkins 2000 nevertheless in anticipation of the expansion in human use of water and changes in climate there is a growing need to evaluate surface and groundwater together miller et al 2016 water resources managers need better estimates of water supplies for their planning and management and it is important to know the present contribution of baseflow to total streamflow to ensure that flow to the stream is sustained and meeting public water demands these estimates might be done using models for instance modflow or swatmod however those require extensive data and typically need to be calibrated and validated for each individual basin before application aboelnour and engel 2018 on the other hand methods for predicting baseflow can be derived using physical properties of watersheds by developing regression models that can be easily implemented to estimate baseflow with reasonable accuracy zhang et al 2013 here we report on the development of a model that encompasses theoretical and experimental components to estimate baseflow and the effect of different watershed properties on this low flow to 1 estimate the average annual baseflow in watershed tributaries in texas from gauged sites using a recursive digital filter method 2 develop lithology soil groups for texas to examine the physical relationship between average bfi and lithological geological control in addition to other descriptive catchment properties for instance climate soils and topography and 3 develop statewide numerical regression models calibrated to the hydrograph separation results to estimate baseflow for ungauged areas and validate with regional relationships these models are likely to be useful to evaluate baseflow of other watersheds with similar climatic and geologic conditions potentially beyond the us 2 study area description texas is the second largest

groundwater quality and quantity in texas and the amount of water recharging the aquifers and reappearing as baseflow has likely changed over the past few decades at the same time the demands for water rights have dramatically increased sophocleous and perkins 2000 additionally texas experiences a range of climate and geological conditions this diversity is essential to the goals of this study this research was conducted with a group of watersheds distributed throughout the entire state that range in area from 247 to 1499 km2 data selected for this study were obtained from 130 gauging stations that have long term streamflow records from 1980 2017 however the western part of the state was poorly represented due to the presence of few perennial streams data scarcity and missing values delineated watersheds from the usgs database were selected for this study fig 1 regardless the source of groundwater these watersheds were assumed to be defined by surface water divides 3 materials and methods 3 1 watershed selection all 1 047 continuous recorded gauged stations in texas were accessed through the usgs database https waterdata usgs gov tx nwis sw the screening criteria for the gauged stations were as follows 1 basin for station lies entirely within texas 2 station has a continuous streamflow record from 1980 to 2017 3 at least 90 of the record is available and no missing record in the last 15 years 4 only streams with perennial and intermittent characteristics considered with the exclusion of ephemeral streams and 5 diversion structures and regulations such as dams and man made reservoirs have no impact on the streamflow of the gauged station to avoid biased results from intensifying or mitigating hydrological situations downstream reduce the influence of flow routing and minimize the effects of reservoir release santhi et al 2008 tijdeman et al 2018a 2018b the screening procedure yielded a total of 130 gauged stations across texas 3 2 evaluation of baseflow index bfi the baseflow index was evaluated by calculating the ratio of long term baseflow to total stream flow as this value represents the slow continuous contribution of groundwater to river flow in this study the web based hydrograph analysis tool what was used to calculate bfi for usgs daily streamflow gauging stations lim et al 2005 what is comprised of three models for baseflow separation a local minimum method and two digital filter methods one using a one parameter filter and the other known as eckhardt filtering using a two parameter filter eckhardt 2005 the eckhardt 2008 method consisting of a filter parameter and bfimax used in this research had previously been validated against several baseflow separation methods daily baseflow was computed using the general form of the digital filter method and can be evaluated as follows eckhardt 2005 1 b f t 1 b f i m a x Œ± b t 1 1 Œ± b f i m a x q t 1 Œ± b f i m a x where b f t is the baseflow bfimax is the maximum value of the ratio between baseflow and streamflow b t 1 is the filtered baseflow m3 s at time step t 1 Œ± is the filter parameter 0 98 and q t is the total streamflow m3 s at time step t 3 3 dataset development a qualitative physical properties classification scheme was established to reflect the baseflow rate in terms of bfi the dataset analyzed in this research was selected using a three step procedure that represents the physical conditions of the watersheds step 1 select variables that represent the physical characteristics of the watersheds that we expect will impact baseflow generation these variables were selected based on studies that previously characterized hydrogeomorphic morphometric and geological parameters and found them to be representative of overall watershed properties aboelnour et al 2020a bloomfield et al 2009 hale and mcdonnell 2016 this procedure yielded 37 variables for the watershed characteristics used for developing the model step 2 categorize these variables into two groups to establish scenarios for the subsequent procedures based on models that evaluate the empirical relationships between baseflow and the basin physical properties the first group included variables representing topography stream characteristics meteorological conditions and land use of the selected watersheds this step yielded 19 variables the second group involved variables that represent geomorphology soil types lithology and hydrogeological characteristics of the watersheds this procedure allowed use of 18 variables representing the geological section of this research step 3 establish a well calibrated regression model based on different scenarios to evaluate the relationships between the physical properties of the basins and baseflow the relationship would then be validated by evaluating the bfi of different basins this research took into consideration that the selected watersheds physical properties should be acquired from ready to use sources for hydrologists for instance from geological maps soil data and national databases these watershed properties their symbols and units are presented in table 2 3 4 model development texas climate varies across the state therefore in order to improve predictions for baseflow watersheds in this study were categorized into five texas climatic categories smakhtin 2001 suggested that developing distinct regression models for separate regions across a study area would improve the accuracy of baseflow prediction texas has ten primary climate zones that represent areas with similar properties such as temperature precipitation humidity vegetation and seasonal weather changes twdb 2012 based on these classifications and numbers of watersheds within each zone they were condensed into five categories to develop multiple distinct models for each of them category 1 includes the east texas and upper coastal plain and categories 2 and 3 include the north central and south central zones respectively the edwards plateau the southern plain and the lower valley lie in category 4 finally category 5 includes the high plains low rolling plains and the trans pecos zone fig 1b the bfi values estimated from the digital filter for the period 1980 to 2017 in 108 watersheds were used for model development the remaining 22 basins were randomly selected from each category using bootstrap resampling and were used for model validation and to assess model performance for various spatial conditions before model development watershed variables were logarithm transformed to meet the normality requirement using the following equation 2 log b f i log y 0 y 1 log x 1 y 2 log x 2 y 3 log x 3 y n log x n where y 0 is the regression constant x1 x2 x3 xn are basin physical properties y1 y2 y3 and yn are regression coefficients as used before in similar studies ahiablame et al 2013 zhu and day 2009 preliminary outputs showed that the coefficients of determination r2 of the developed regression model were slightly greater with the use of logarithm transformed variables than with untransformed variables for an ideal model prediction the correlation should include independent parameters and be physically sensible and statistically significant when producing good bfi estimates the auto correlation function acf and spearman s correlation test were applied to evaluate independency and correlation respectively between the selected variables the correlation analysis showed that the transformed variables were independent in this research but there were some correlations among them for instance prcp and et were highly correlated based on the computational complexity and number of variables three scenarios were used to develop the regression models the first two scenarios used variables that represented areas and stream geomorphologies in addition to meteorology and land use as suggested by scanlon et al 2002 the third scenario used topographical hydrogeological soil and lithological variables in relating bfi to surface geology in the region in baseflow research soil and lithology must be considered together since the groundwater flows through both lacey and grayson 1998 this procedure was important to avoid highly correlated variables in the same scenario that might lead to multicollinearity which could increase the coefficient variance estimates and make them sensitive to minor changes in the model negatively affecting model stability and quality therefore to avoid multicollinearity and to attain simplicity in the model scenarios 1 and 2 retained only one parameter from a group of highly correlated parameters in which the absolute value of the correlation coefficient was 0 85 after the selection of independent parameters an initial stepwise multiple regression model was developed using the parameters listed in table 2 this procedure yielded a large number of regression models however the best model was selected based on a combination of explanatory statistical indices and variables including akaike information criteria aic p values coefficient of determination r2 and adjusted r2 the p values were used to check the significance of individual parameters the residuals of the fitted model were also checked for normality however one of the main goals of this research was to evaluate the optimal regression model for bfi prediction therefore all variable combinations were used in developing the model the model that provided a higher correlation coefficient and adjusted r2 lower aic value had all variables that were significant and was represented by a minimum number of variables was finally selected for each scenario tested finally a check afterwards for multicollinearity of the developed model was applied using the variance inflation factor vif this step was necessary to measure the degree of collinearity present for each parameter included in the developed model lin 2008 in this study factors having vif values more than 5 were removed from the developed model a total of 15 best regression models for bfi prediction in the study region were developed one for each of the three scenarios for the five categories listed above multiple linear regression was utilized to develop a model for transferring the filtered bfi at the gauging stations to the prediction of bfi at ungauged stations in the following expression 3 b f i y 0 x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x 3 y 3 x n y n within the inverse logarithmic function eq 3 is the retransformed version of eq 2 hence the multiple linear regression models were created based on the transformed parameters the graphical outputs of these equations were validated using statistical indices to assess the performance of the model the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse pbias and relative error re were used to evaluate the accuracy of the regression outputs a regression with lower re was usually more accurate than one that had a higher re the formulas for r2 and nse pbias and re were previously outlined by gupta et al 2009 and nie et al 2011 a flow chart showing procedures used in this study is provided in fig 2 4 results and discussions 4 1 stream selection streams in the selected watersheds were described and characterized using flow duration curves fdc fdcs were created by calculating maximum exceedance probabilities for the entire record of mean daily streamflow in each watershed dingman 2015 fdcs identify the hydrological properties and flow regime of the drainage area through a graphical representation of cumulative frequency showing the relationship between the frequency and magnitude of streamflow for a certain river basin searcy 1959 in this study streams were classified as ephemeral intermittent and perennial based on maximum exceedance probability and bfi values based on the suggested approach the results of the bfi values were combined with the maximum exceedance probability fig 3 in which watersheds with bfi values less than 0 15 and maximum probability of exceedance less than 70 of the fdcs represented ephemeral streams and were excluded from the analysis intermittent streams exhibit periods of no flow in the low region of the fdcs levick et al 2008 and here they were identified as having maximum exceedance probabilities between 70 and 95 4 2 bfi estimation one aim of this study was to provide an estimate of the contribution of baseflow to total streamflow using the evaluation of statewide datasets from gauged stations across texas baseflow contribution was represented using the bfi a key advantage of using bfi rather than absolute baseflow components was that it provided better comparability across watersheds having different stream densities and total streamflow in addition bfi has previously been shown to give smaller variance and better evaluation of the baseflow and direct runoff at the same time haberlandt et al 2001 the bfimax were adjusted according to eckhardt 2005 suggesting that bfimax values vary from 0 25 to 0 80 the study proposed a bfimax value of 0 25 for perennial streams with hard rock aquifers 0 50 for ephemeral streams with porous aquifers and 0 80 for perennial streams with porous aquifers these values were obtained based on calibration and validation of the filtering approach on basins in maryland pennsylvania illinois and germany lim et al 2005 following the suggested approach values of bfimax were adjusted according to the hydrological and hydrogeological properties of each basin and with the outcomes of the fdcs of each stream bfi values output from what were compared with the outputs from the swat bflow tool that calculates baseflow by filtering streamflow data three times 1 pass 2 pass and 3 pass and was previously validated lim et al 2005 the groundwater contribution to surface water was greatest in east texas and around major aquifers in middle texas the edwards aquifer fig 4 a that lies in a fault zone in central texas produced the greatest bfi with a mean value of 0 51 springs and seeps groundwater in west texas also contribute locally to baseflow to the river system however the filtered bfi for the period 1998 2017 had the lowest mean of 0 29 these baseflow outputs were comparable to previously published reports of the texas water development board twdb george et al 2011 table 3 summarizes bfi values within each category in the study area in general bfi values for the entire study area ranged between 0 14 and 0 73 with a mean value of 0 45 suggesting that 45 of the long term streamflow in texas was coming from shallow subsurface flow and groundwater discharge the lowest bfi calculated was in northwestern texas particularly in the northern ogallala aquifer that is characterized by clayey soil and relatively small thickness that limits the amount of groundwater discharge to streams george et al 2011 in contrast the greatest bfi values were in central southern texas headwaters frio watershed particularly in the edwards trinity plateau aquifer this aquifer is mostly under water table or unconfined aquifers that are composed of sand fractured limestone and dolomite natural discharge to surface water here is primarily from springs along the margins of the aquifer where the water table intersects the ground surface twdb 2016 the edwards is also called the fault zone aquifer in which the highly fractured limestone outcrop at the surface allows for large amounts of natural allogenic recharge streams can cross the permeable formation and go underground e g sinkholes that can receive large amounts of recharge and transmit it directly into the aquifer anaya 2001 overall bfi tended to be greater in eastern texas however there was no specific pattern for bfi variation across texas fig 4b 4 3 regression models 4 3 1 category 1 the category 1 area represents the northern part of the carrizo aquifer and north and central gulf coast aquifers the carrizo aquifer is primarily composed of sand locally interbedded with gravel silt clay and lignite deeds et al 2003 while the gulf coast aquifer is primarily composed of discontinuous miocene to holocene sand silt clay and gravel beds twdb 2003 the best low flow prediction model under the three scenarios involved different variables but had r2 0 80 table 4 significant variables included in scenarios 1 and 2 were similar with the exception that scenario 1 contained variable prcp that was replaced by et in scenario 2 et was found to have no impact on bfi prediction in scenario 2 due to the high humidity for the category 1 region only the wslp and aws variables were significant at 95 and 90 confidence levels respectively for bfi prediction in the third scenario this agrees with a study in scotland in which average water storage was shown to be the main source of baseflow at lower slopes in mountainous headwaters tetzlaff and soulsby 2008 the evaluation of three model scenarios in the 24 watersheds selected in category 1 showed that the random error re for scenario 1 varied from 10 to 22 however for scenario 2 a greater range of re between 20 to 36 were calculated meanwhile re were between 16 and 14 for scenario 3 fig 5 a model assessment statistics for bfi prediction are summarized in table 5 the r2 and nse values for model development ranged between 0 79 and 0 93 while pbias varied between 0 3 and 0 7 table 5 values and the re results suggest that models developed in scenarios 1 and 3 were slightly better than scenario 2 this may be due to having fewer descriptive parameters in the scenario 2 model in addition the presence of the prcp variable in scenario 1 gave greater prediction accuracy precipitation can have a significant impact on the amount of groundwater discharge particularly in humid areas aboelnour et al 2019 zhu and day 2009 as shown in fig 6 the observed and predicted bfi showed similar values indicating some uncertainty in the developed model notably models for scenarios 1 and 3 provided the greatest accuracy one particular prediction that deviates from the observed bfi was observed in scenario 2 for the cypress creek watershed the model overestimated predicted bfi 0 68 compared to the observed bfi value of 0 56 this deviation could be partly attributed to the effect on baseflow by the large forest cover 46 and high topographic index that facilitates baseflow discharge to the stream network within the watershed further garcitas creek had a very low bfi 0 29 despite draining to the coast where enough rainfall for perennial flow was expected this might be because of greater average temperature and annual evapotranspiration and lower annual precipitation compared to other catchments in the category 1 region the developed models in the three scenarios were further validated using randomly selected basins the 22 model validation watersheds produced results having poorer bfi prediction evaluation metrics with median re of 2 92 3 85 and 2 37 for scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 5a for the validation dataset the computed bfi from the filtered usgs streamflow values were reasonably close to the predicted ones however the scenario 2 model had poorer performance than scenarios 1 and 3 models table 5 this was attributed to the absence of the prcp parameter in scenario 2 compared to scenario 1 in general the validation dataset resulted in better bfi prediction in scenario 3 with values of 0 91 0 91 and 0 5 for r2 nse and pbias respectively please refer to the supplementary materials and aboelnour et al 2020b for graphs showing the absolute relative errors and validation charts of all categories 4 3 2 category 2 the category 2 region covers the northern trinity aquifer in northeast texas fig 4a that is composed of multiple water bearing formations limestones sands clays gravels and conglomerates the aquifer productivity is mainly affected by the thickness and distribution of sandstone facies deposited in two different environments resulting in a stratified network of aquitards and aquifers in the northern trinity group covering the region twdb 2016 the regression analysis resulted in development of two similar models for scenarios 1 and 2 with the exception that scenario 2 contained the variable frst that was not statistically significant watershed properties affecting bfi in category 2 included drainage area stream power index maximum temperature and urban cover for scenarios 1 and 2 elevation topographic index hydrologic soil groups a b and c water storage and alluvial deposits influenced bfi prediction in scenario 3 except for hydxb all other parameters were statistically significant the fact that the variables frst and hydxb were not significant in scenarios 2 and 3 respectively can be explained by the presence of highly significant urban and hydxa parameters in scenarios 2 and 3 therefore it makes these variables less important compared to others the regression statistics indicated that the scenario 3 model had greater prediction accuracy with values of 59 0 89 and 0 79 for aic r2 and adjusted r2 respectively table 6 although category 2 represents a humid region scenarios 1 and 2 lacked precipitation variables in the prediction model likely due to delayed precipitation response particularly for large watersheds ahiablame et al 2013b for scenario 3 elevation and topographic index regulate the rate at which soil water moves down a slope and therefore dictate whether runoff after a storm event will be directly flushed to the river system or stored in the soil price 2011 average water storage contributed to bfi prediction in which the aws parameter had an important role in water redistribution towards the basin outlets hector et al 2015 finally alluvial deposits are closely related to the presence and the extent of baseflow in which of groundwater recharge quantity was found to be correlated to topographic positions that have greater alluvial deposits coverage schilling 2009 performance of the three models to predict bfi in category 2 showed a slightly greater re compared to category 1 for the three scenarios re ranged between 26 and 33 for scenario 1 and varied from 25 to 41 for scenario 2 while it had the smallest margins between 21 for scenario 3 fig 5b these results are promising and the model developed for scenario 3 had the best performance for bfi prediction in the category 2 area table 5 the r2 and pbias values were 0 80 0 72 and 0 85 and 0 5 0 9 and 0 2 for scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively although the scenario 1 model had fewer variables compared to scenario 2 it performed slightly better indicating that additional variables did not improve predictions validation for scenario 2 had the poorest model performance with re ranging from 35 to 62 while scenario 3 had the narrowest re range of the three scenarios fig 5b r2 nse and pbias ranged from 0 61 to 0 79 0 57 to 0 79 and 2 4 to 1 2 respectively table 5 based on these statistical outputs and the re the models had adequate performance for the validation datasets moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 fig 7 compares predicted bfi using the equations in table 6 with the observed bfi when the forest land use variable was removed from scenario 2 the bias between the predicted and observed bfi slightly decreased in scenario 1 the greatest deviation was in the lower little river watershed in the scenario 2 model in which predicted bfi was underestimated this might be related its greater watershed temperature compared to the others in category 2 although the annual et variable was not significant in scenario 2 the greater temperature played an important part in increasing evapotranspiration and leading to decreased infiltration in addition waters and wetlands cover only 0 7 and 2 7 of the watershed respectively which would cause a decrease in subsurface water discharged 4 3 3 category 3 the category 3 area is characterized by sub tropical sub humid climates in the south central part of texas that cover the southern trinity aquifer the central parts of carrizo and the gulf coast aquifers the northern parts are mainly covered by limestone and dolomitic rock types while the central part is covered by the middle eocene claiborne and wilcox groups consisting of a vertical sequence of alternating sandstones siltstones and claystones davies and ethridge 1971 the southern part is mainly composed of tertiary and quaternary silt clay sand and gravel twdb 2003 regression equations developed for this category indicated the model could predict bfi with high accuracy table 7 bfi was predicted using variables da spi sti tstrl prcp wtr and wtl covers in scenario 1 with performance statistics of 61 0 95 and 0 87 for aic r2 and adjusted r2 respectively when tstrl prcp and wtl in scenario 1 were replaced with tmax et and frst in scenario 2 an improved predictive model resulted watersheds included in category 3 were characterized by a greater percentage of cultivated 37 and forest 25 cover compared to other regions some research studies have linked higher forest cover with lower bfis due to greater forest evapotranspiration sahin and hall 1996 swank et al 1988 whereas others suggested an increased bfi with more forest areas due to more infiltration to subsurface water storage price 2011 santhi et al 2008 both forest cover and evapotranspiration were included in the scenario 2 model et had a clear negative correlation with bfi since et depletes the water on which baseflow is dependent these results agreed with similar research in indiana usa suggesting that drainage area and precipitation were the main influential variables in baseflow evaluation ahiablame et al 2013 for scenario 3 bfi was predicted using average watershed slope basin relief hydrologic soil group b water storage alluvial and colluvial deposits and hydraulic conductivity however only alluvial and colluvial lithology were statistically significant surface topographic properties may express the amount of colluvial deposits available and this likely explains the existence of the variables relv and coll in scenario 3 colluvial deposits have previously been shown to play an important role in shallow reservoirs and play a significant role in explaining variability in the magnitude of groundwater schulz et al 2008 in category 3 only 9 watersheds had colluvial deposits that appeared to affect the amount of groundwater discharge colluvial deposits that were significant in the scenario 3 model may be related to water movement such that flow from bedrock to colluvium is more likely where the bedrock has layers with strong permeability contrasts that dip out of the slope performance of the three models to predict bfi in ungauged stations showed lower re in category 3 compared to categories 1 and 2 the 1st and 3rd interquartile re ranged from 3 to 5 in all scenarios with a median of 0 69 0 12 and 0 49 for scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 5c scenario 3 had the narrowest re range similarly model validation indicated promising re values the highest prediction accuracy in scenario 3 had a median re of 0 81 although the three scenarios had slight differences in the evaluation indices they predicted the bfi for the development and validation datasets precisely with the development dataset r2 and nse for the three scenarios varied from 0 94 to 0 98 in addition the scenarios had low pbias of 0 1 table 5 however performance decreased when using the validation dataset r2 nse and pbias ranged from 0 56 to 0 85 0 54 to 0 85 and 1 4 to 3 1 respectively this variation might be attributed to the change in meteorological patterns across the state since the validation dataset was randomly selected from each of the five categories and may have important features that specifically affect bfi values such as geology or land cover and use in general the re results together with the statistical indices suggested that bfi can be predicted with high accuracy in the category 3 region this can be clearly seen in fig 8 in which the observed and predicted bfi values show the same pattern for the three scenarios with respect to the model development dataset 4 3 4 category 4 the category 4 area represents the central and the southern part of the state including the edwards plateau that contains the edwards trinity aquifer which is mostly unconfined george et al 2011 however the artesian zone of the aquifer is confined the aquifer is recharged via natural sinkholes i e allogenic recharge anaya and jones 2009 the central and southern part of the category 4 region is mainly covered by fluvial deltaic sediments of the upper paleocene and lower eocene wilcox group carrizo sand of the southern carrizo aquifer deeds et al 2003 and discontinuous silt clay and sand beds of the miocene and holocene ages twdb 2016 the regression equations were developed using three sets of data among the potential bfi response predictors for the scenario 1 model forest and wetland areas were the best predictors for bfi table 8 in addition stream power and sediment transport indices precipitation and water cover descriptors were also included in the model however they were not significant this might be related to the low stream densities in the region which in turn reduced the stream power and sediment transport indices stream power index reductions might be attributed to some of the streams in the plateau being sinking streams that never reach an outlet however they flow into a fracture zone or sinkholes and turn into allogenic recharge in addition there is no pattern in precipitation in the category 4 area and is greatest in late spring and early fall only in the eastern part of the region for the scenario 2 model variables et clt and frst were significant in predicting bfi watersheds selected in category 4 were mainly covered by shrublands forests and cultivated cover with 70 12 and 10 respectively the shrublands had a positive correlation with et while the cultivated and forested areas had negative impacts on et based on their recharge and infiltration rates the shrublands may lead to the reduction of et and bfi in the region these findings suggest why we observed positive correlation of the clt and frst parameters but negative correlation for the et variable in bfi prediction table 8 results from this category agreed with zhu and day 2009 in which baseflow was correlated with drainage area precipitation and evapotranspiration watersheds selected in category 4 were mostly covered by residual 37 and colluvial sediments 23 supporting the use of these two variables in the model developed for scenario 3 average slope water storage hydrologic soil group d and hydraulic conductivity were also included in the model but they were not significant this could be due to the lack of complex topography low water storage and conductivity in this area with an average k of 3 m day 1 barker and ardis 1996 overall the scenario 2 model had the lowest bfi prediction accuracy with r2 and adjusted r2 values of 0 94 and 0 77 respectively this was in contrast to the scenario 1 and 3 models with r2 of 0 99 and 0 94 and adjusted r2 values of 0 90 and 0 87 respectively these accuracies were reflected in the model performance bfi prediction the median re ranged between 1 93 to 0 72 for model development and from 1 59 to 5 38 for the validation dataset fig 5d bfi was predicted with relatively high r2 values indicating that the continuous coverage of the lithological scheme could be used for bfi predictive purposes the r2 and other evaluation statistical indices had lower values for the validation dataset compared to the model development the lowest r2 value was 0 70 for scenario 3 and the highest was 0 76 for scenario 1 table 5 fig 9 compares the observed bfi values to those simulated using the equations in table 8 there was low bias in the predictions for all three scenarios and the developed model equations provide comparable estimates for the bfi some predictions were more divergent from the observed bfi such as the overestimation of bfi in the dry frio watershed in scenarios 2 and 3 the dry frio watershed has greater annual precipitation 924 mm and lower evapotranspiration 399 mm rates compared to other watersheds in the region similarly the model overestimated the predicted bfi for the dry frio watershed in scenario 3 due to high hydraulic conductivity in the watershed 30 m day 1 although this watershed is covered by shallow to very shallow gravelly loam and clay the high conductivity reported was likely caused by the data acquisition for hydrogeological parameters data were collected from well reports and wells are generally sited where values of water storage transmissivity and conductivity are high 4 3 5 category 5 the category 5 area represents the low rolling and high plains in northwestern texas and the trans pecos plain in the far western part of the state the region features the seymour aquifer in northern texas ogallala aquifer in north central texas and the pecos valley aquifer in the west fig 4a the selected watersheds for model development were mainly in the northern part of the ogallala formation of the ogallala aquifer this formation was deposited as alluvial outwash from the rocky mountains with coarse grained pebbles to boulder size gravels near the mountains to fine grained sand and gravel with increased distance from the mountains gustavson 1996 the best low flow regression model developed under the three scenarios in category 5 showed high r2 values compared to other categories 0 99 0 96 and 0 98 for scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively in addition the models for both scenarios 1 and 2 involved similar parameters with the difference being replacement of prcp by the et and brn parameters in scenario 2 although precipitation was not statistically significant in scenario 1 et was significant at a 0 01 probability level this is likely because areas were in the dry western region of the state where rainfall rate is significantly lower on the other hand some of the category 5 watersheds included highly cultivated areas with an et rate up to 400 mm yr category 5 region results indicated that correlation between et and bfi was negative table 9 in addition the presence of the et factor was likely the reason for reduced accuracy of the scenario 2 model as r2 decreased from 0 99 to 0 96 from scenario 1 to scenario 2 topographic factors including elev and ti hydrologic soil group a eolian deposits depth to water transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity were all significant in the model developed for bfi prediction in scenario 3 groundwater recharge in western texas category 5 is mainly due to inter aquifer flow and infiltration from ephemeral streams inter aquifer flow requires higher values of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity within the aquifer media while the seepage from streams needs sufficient rainfall to generate runoff through the ephemeral streams this might provide an explanation for attribution of hydrologic parameters in bfi prediction and the lower bfi values in this category compared to other categories the 1st and 3rd interquartile for re margins for the model developed ranged from 4 to only 5 for the three scenarios with the narrowest re margin observed in scenario 3 fig 5e the r2 and nse values between the observed and predicted bfi ranged between 0 96 and 0 99 while pbias varied between 0 1 and 0 2 table 5 therefore it could be concluded that baseflow has a strong relationship with lithology soil type and climate in this category and that bfi can be explained as an integrated description of the fractional areas of lithology in the basins in addition the predicted bfi values clearly exhibit the same pattern for the three scenarios with respect to the model development dataset in category 5 fig 10 the small deviations and extremely low bias between the observed and predicted bfi in fig 10 might be explained by the constant topography of the plains and meteorological conditions in the area the model validation showed larger margins of re compared to basins used for model development with 1st and 3rd quartile ranging from 14 to 19 and scenario 1 having the largest margin fig 5e the r2 and nse values indicated reduced performance during validation compared to model development table 5 the scenario 2 model had the lowest r2 value 0 59 compared to those for scenarios 2 and 3 0 79 however the low pbias for the validation dataset indicated that the regression model could be used to predict bfi in areas that have similar conditions to that of the category 5 region nevertheless it is important to mention that these findings reflect only intermittent and perennial streams and catchments that had large numbers of ephemeral streams were not included in model development and the interpretation of the relationship between baseflow and watershed properties based on basin characteristics some perennial streams may exhibit low bfi values for instance happy draw watershed and wildhorse creek these watersheds can be informative when evaluating the relationship between baseflow yield and basin properties meanwhile intermittent streams may have some baseflow yield as they can maintain flow over some sections during the dry season due to locally elevated water tables or perched aquifers examples of intermittent stream watersheds in this category are headwater clear fork and deep creek watersheds finally it should be mentioned that in this research we tried to develop a model including all the selected watersheds that represent the five categories 108 watersheds however outputs of these models were not able to predict baseflow adequately regardless of the number of variables included in the model the poorer performance for the statewide models was likely due to variability in climatic and geological conditions and parameters across the state these findings indicated the benefits of determining appropriate study areas to develop regression models within a larger study region although the development of distinct regression equations can be computationally and resource intensive specifically over large regions that have several meteorological geological and topographic features the developed models showed an ability to accurately predict the bfi across the state 5 limitations of our approach findings of this research showed that the deviation between the observed and predicted bfi values were relatively small in all developed and validated models however several limitations of this study should be noted and would benefit from further investigation in future research first the collection of watershed properties representing hydrogeological factors that impact baseflow is a challenging process as most of these parameters were acquired from areas where data from wells were available these were usually located in areas where the water storage conductivity and transmissivity were relatively high and therefore may not be indicative of entire watershed conditions hector et al 2015 mazvimavi et al 2003 this might explain why neither depth to water nor transmissivity were included in any of the developed models of scenario 3 except in category 5 since the data were derived from pumping test wells they were considered as point estimates that were constant across the basin therefore it is recommended to use other representative parameters for instance relative elevation topographic surface in which the floodplain surface was subtracted from the nearest river channel water level elevations rather than depth to water and to involve well data throughout the area or by utilizing an area weighted average to acquire values better representing whole basins another limitation of this study is that the soil properties were represented only by the percentages of hsgs however basins may contain various soil types with different characteristics at different locations based on topography for example some soils can be deep and permeable and others can be shallow and impermeable at small depths below the subsurface within the same basins however it is reasonable to identify representative hydrogeological and lithological categories that are continuous and stable across whole watersheds accuracies of model results were also limited to the input of single time point land use data nlcd 2016 the filtered bfi values were calculated from usgs daily streamflow data from 1980 2017 with the assumption that the land use was constant over this timespan therefore changes in land use patterns over time have not been specifically addressed by the developed models while changes in land uses were reported for texas over the past few decades garner et al 2019 xu 2018 an improvement to consider in future studies would be to acquire at least two land use datasets one from an early time and one current to obtain a percentage of land cover change of each basin lastly intermittent streams may appear to be ephemeral based on their fdc alone and they were much more difficult to identify without creating combined hydrographs and hyetographs although it was possible to identify some of the ephemeral and intermittent streams using the 1 1 plot in section 4 1 fig 3 distinguishing between different stream types is often fuzzy and scale dependent yaeger et al 2012 i e some streams may retain water for decades and then dry out during a prolonged drought period 6 summary and conclusions multiple linear regression models were used to develop three scenarios based on different characteristics affecting baseflow the first two scenarios used variables that represented areas and stream geomorphologies in addition to meteorology and land use the third scenario used topography hydrogeological soil and lithology variables results of the regression showed the models predicted bfi with high accuracy the greatest accuracy was recorded in the category 3 4 and 5 areas while poorest model performance was in the category 2 region this is likely related to the topography complexity and the diversity of lithological data in the category 2 region coefficients of determination r2 relating bfi values to basin properties in this research were relatively high and relative errors were relatively low in general within each category scenarios 1 and 3 models had higher prediction performance while scenario 2 had the lowest independent variables developed for scenarios 1 and 2 were similar with differing degrees of significance levels the major difference between scenarios 1 and 2 was the use of the factor representing evapotranspiration which when applied in the model leads to lower bfi prediction accuracy this might be because et was not categorized as proportional to the percentages of cultivated areas within each basin but was generalized to represent the whole basin independent parameters including precipitation basin area stream power index sediment transport index forests and developed covers were found to correlate directly to bfi predictions in both scenarios 1 and 2 evapotranspiration was negatively correlated to the bfi values in categories 3 4 and 5 for scenario 3 factors including average water storage hydraulic conductivity hydrologic soil groups alluvial and colluvial lithology were the main explanatory parameters for baseflow elevation and topographic index were negatively correlated to groundwater discharge in scenario 3 hydrologic soil groups affected the bfi differently in that increased soil sand percentage increased predicted bfi this research led to the development of models that are able to predict bfi values that are comparable to those determined by what by using categorized areas across the state of texas with high performance moreover these findings indicated that bfis were an integral expression of the fractional areas of each lithology in the basins the regression models were additionally tested using validation datasets and showed high performance indicating that the developed models can be applied to predict bfi in ungauged regions therefore the models developed here can be easily applied in other areas that have similar topographic geologic and climatic arid semi arid or humid conditions where databases for meteorology hydrogeology and soil types are available some limitations should be taken into account when applying these models to other areas and further studies to improve some of the proposed approaches are recommended as discussed above however results from application of these regression models should be beneficial to guide water management strategies and in establishment of water resource plans at local and regional scales the models developed play a vital role in planning for an accurate estimation of factors that impact groundwater discharge in addition these equations can support groundwater modelers by providing independently obtained bfi estimation at ungauged sites credit

8224,study region texas usa study focus texas is a large state in the us that experiences a diversity of climate conditions and water demands in this study 130 stream gauging sites and their associated watershed physical and geological properties were used to develop multiple regression models to predict the baseflow index bfi across texas calculated bfi was derived from daily streamflow data from 1980 to 2017 using the two parameter recursive digital filtering approach of the web based hydrograph analysis tool what three scenarios were developed and validated the first two scenarios related bfi to topography climate and land use the third scenario used surface geology soil type and hydrogeology parameters new hydrological insights for the region the models developed showed high performance low bias and low relative errors to predict bfi with r2 values varying from 0 72 to 0 99 and strong agreement with filtered bfi values the results further showed that there was no specific pattern for bfi variation across texas ranging from 0 29 to 0 51 outputs indicated that models developed for scenarios 1 and 3 had higher prediction performance additionally evapotranspiration et contributed to lower model accuracy since the et was not categorized as proportional to the percentages of cultivated areas within each basin but was generalized to represent the whole catchment the developed models that are reported here can support further research in groundwater modeling and baseflow prediction for ungauged sites that have similar characteristics keywords baseflow index geological mapping watershed properties prediction regression texas 1 introduction identifying the key physical processes that influence watershed baseflow are of vital significance in many hydrological research areas this identification is achieved by studying how watershed hydrology responds to different physical properties enabling broader conclusions about the behavior of watersheds estimation of some hydrological behavior of different watersheds based on catchment sizes can be approached by scaling of different physical properties hydrological properties of watersheds such as streamflow and baseflow may be estimated using different physical descriptors including meteorological and physiographic parameters as well as geological and hydrogeological parameters bloomfield et al 2009 baseflow is that part of streamflow derived from groundwater and other delayed sources into the stream hall 1968 it is one of the most important components in watershed hydrology as it sustains flow in the stream during dry seasons moderates seasonal fluctuations in temperature and typically has better quality water compared to surface water baseflow is critical for sustaining flow in rivers and streams and is often assumed to be equal to groundwater recharge aboelnour et al 2020a gebert et al 2007 in turn continual streamflow during dry seasons is integral to maintain stream biota and is required to support recreation based industries neff et al 2005 being able to understand and predict what changes will impact baseflow over time is essential in understanding the current and future changes to a watershed s hydrology especially in the face of climate change and land use alteration an evaluation of baseflow discharge is also valuable for the calibration and validation of groundwater models that are being used to investigate water supply problems cherkauer 2004 gebert et al 2007 however baseflow displays spatial and temporal variability and is dependent on a large number of watershed properties for instance topography lithology land use geomorphology vegetation soil and climatic conditions mwakalila et al 2002 therefore improvements in modeling and evaluating the relationships between these properties and baseflow are important to develop a detailed understanding of baseflow generation for specific areas baseflow evaluation at different spatial scales has been previously studied aboelnour et al 2019 haberlandt et al 2001 longobardi and villani 2008 zhang et al 2013 typically through extensive use of statistical analyzes to empirically relate baseflow to catchment characteristics lacey and grayson 1998 examined the relationship between baseflow index bfi and landscape descriptors haberlandt et al 2001 used regression techniques to derive the empirical relationship for estimation of average bfi suggesting that it was strongly related to topographical hydrogeological and precipitation characteristics another approach used linear regression methods to quantify geological controls on bfi within the thomas basin in the uk which suggested that hydrologic soils influence on bfi has a geological meaning bloomfield et al 2009 in addition regression models using meteorological land use types geomorphological and geological variables could satisfactorily predict streamflow baseflow and storm runoff in indiana wisconsin and pennsylvania under different scenarios ahiablame et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 zhu and day 2009 and in china huang et al 2020 he et al 2016 developed a new approach by combining a non linear reservoir algorithm with a meteorological regression model to correlate baseflow estimation to meteorological parameters zhang et al 2020 used linear and multilevel regression approaches between catchment properties and climate zones to estimate bfi on large scale in australia table 1 summarizes studies that used statistical regression to relate baseflow to catchment properties considering the role of baseflow in quantification and identification of the amount of groundwater storage and direct runoff other research related to baseflow evaluation in watersheds has been carried out using different hydrologic models and other techniques for instance these include conceptual lumped sacsma machbv smarg gr4j hydrologic models darbandsari and coulibaly 2020 semi distributed swat and hec hms models dwarakish and ganasri 2015 lee et al 2018 large scale variable infiltration capacity vic model mao and cherkauer 2009 recession curve displacement method rutledge and mesko 1996 water table fluctuation method healy and cook 2002 flow duration curves frisbee et al 2017 and two component or binary separation stoelzle et al 2020 additionally automated separation methods include the hydrograph separation programs hysep sloto and crouse 1996 bflow arnold and allen 1999 and the web based hydrograph analysis tool what lim et al 2005 however these are mostly limited to estimating baseflow in gauged basins in general geology soil and rock types geomorphological terrain topographical relief subsurface drainage land use change and climate are some of many factors that control the magnitude and pattern of baseflow huang et al 2016 the relationship between these physical properties and groundwater are poorly understood when it comes to which geologic unit and climate category to consider in quantifying impacts on baseflow the goal of this study was to develop regression models in texas to evaluate the relationship between climate lithology catchment properties and baseflow and to estimate the contribution of baseflow to total streamflow texas has experienced extensive changes in land use over time and is also becoming warmer and drier particularly in western areas therefore the amount of water recharging aquifers and appearing as baseflow has likely changed over the past thirty years groundwater has significantly decreased during the last few decades in some texas locations arciniega and bre√±a naranjo 2016 and water rights demands have increased dramatically due to population growth sophocleous and perkins 2000 nevertheless in anticipation of the expansion in human use of water and changes in climate there is a growing need to evaluate surface and groundwater together miller et al 2016 water resources managers need better estimates of water supplies for their planning and management and it is important to know the present contribution of baseflow to total streamflow to ensure that flow to the stream is sustained and meeting public water demands these estimates might be done using models for instance modflow or swatmod however those require extensive data and typically need to be calibrated and validated for each individual basin before application aboelnour and engel 2018 on the other hand methods for predicting baseflow can be derived using physical properties of watersheds by developing regression models that can be easily implemented to estimate baseflow with reasonable accuracy zhang et al 2013 here we report on the development of a model that encompasses theoretical and experimental components to estimate baseflow and the effect of different watershed properties on this low flow to 1 estimate the average annual baseflow in watershed tributaries in texas from gauged sites using a recursive digital filter method 2 develop lithology soil groups for texas to examine the physical relationship between average bfi and lithological geological control in addition to other descriptive catchment properties for instance climate soils and topography and 3 develop statewide numerical regression models calibrated to the hydrograph separation results to estimate baseflow for ungauged areas and validate with regional relationships these models are likely to be useful to evaluate baseflow of other watersheds with similar climatic and geologic conditions potentially beyond the us 2 study area description texas is the second largest state with an area of 691 027 km2 hudak 2000 and the second most populated state in the united states www census gov texas represents both the wetter eastern and the drier western regions of the country zhang and wurbs 2018 climate topography hydrology and water management vary dramatically across the state mean annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm at el paso in west texas to 1500 mm in the sabine river basin on the eastern border average temperatures rarely go above 35 c or below 5 c zhang and wurbs 2018 groundwater is a major source of water in texas land use change threatens groundwater quality and quantity in texas and the amount of water recharging the aquifers and reappearing as baseflow has likely changed over the past few decades at the same time the demands for water rights have dramatically increased sophocleous and perkins 2000 additionally texas experiences a range of climate and geological conditions this diversity is essential to the goals of this study this research was conducted with a group of watersheds distributed throughout the entire state that range in area from 247 to 1499 km2 data selected for this study were obtained from 130 gauging stations that have long term streamflow records from 1980 2017 however the western part of the state was poorly represented due to the presence of few perennial streams data scarcity and missing values delineated watersheds from the usgs database were selected for this study fig 1 regardless the source of groundwater these watersheds were assumed to be defined by surface water divides 3 materials and methods 3 1 watershed selection all 1 047 continuous recorded gauged stations in texas were accessed through the usgs database https waterdata usgs gov tx nwis sw the screening criteria for the gauged stations were as follows 1 basin for station lies entirely within texas 2 station has a continuous streamflow record from 1980 to 2017 3 at least 90 of the record is available and no missing record in the last 15 years 4 only streams with perennial and intermittent characteristics considered with the exclusion of ephemeral streams and 5 diversion structures and regulations such as dams and man made reservoirs have no impact on the streamflow of the gauged station to avoid biased results from intensifying or mitigating hydrological situations downstream reduce the influence of flow routing and minimize the effects of reservoir release santhi et al 2008 tijdeman et al 2018a 2018b the screening procedure yielded a total of 130 gauged stations across texas 3 2 evaluation of baseflow index bfi the baseflow index was evaluated by calculating the ratio of long term baseflow to total stream flow as this value represents the slow continuous contribution of groundwater to river flow in this study the web based hydrograph analysis tool what was used to calculate bfi for usgs daily streamflow gauging stations lim et al 2005 what is comprised of three models for baseflow separation a local minimum method and two digital filter methods one using a one parameter filter and the other known as eckhardt filtering using a two parameter filter eckhardt 2005 the eckhardt 2008 method consisting of a filter parameter and bfimax used in this research had previously been validated against several baseflow separation methods daily baseflow was computed using the general form of the digital filter method and can be evaluated as follows eckhardt 2005 1 b f t 1 b f i m a x Œ± b t 1 1 Œ± b f i m a x q t 1 Œ± b f i m a x where b f t is the baseflow bfimax is the maximum value of the ratio between baseflow and streamflow b t 1 is the filtered baseflow m3 s at time step t 1 Œ± is the filter parameter 0 98 and q t is the total streamflow m3 s at time step t 3 3 dataset development a qualitative physical properties classification scheme was established to reflect the baseflow rate in terms of bfi the dataset analyzed in this research was selected using a three step procedure that represents the physical conditions of the watersheds step 1 select variables that represent the physical characteristics of the watersheds that we expect will impact baseflow generation these variables were selected based on studies that previously characterized hydrogeomorphic morphometric and geological parameters and found them to be representative of overall watershed properties aboelnour et al 2020a bloomfield et al 2009 hale and mcdonnell 2016 this procedure yielded 37 variables for the watershed characteristics used for developing the model step 2 categorize these variables into two groups to establish scenarios for the subsequent procedures based on models that evaluate the empirical relationships between baseflow and the basin physical properties the first group included variables representing topography stream characteristics meteorological conditions and land use of the selected watersheds this step yielded 19 variables the second group involved variables that represent geomorphology soil types lithology and hydrogeological characteristics of the watersheds this procedure allowed use of 18 variables representing the geological section of this research step 3 establish a well calibrated regression model based on different scenarios to evaluate the relationships between the physical properties of the basins and baseflow the relationship would then be validated by evaluating the bfi of different basins this research took into consideration that the selected watersheds physical properties should be acquired from ready to use sources for hydrologists for instance from geological maps soil data and national databases these watershed properties their symbols and units are presented in table 2 3 4 model development texas climate varies across the state therefore in order to improve predictions for baseflow watersheds in this study were categorized into five texas climatic categories smakhtin 2001 suggested that developing distinct regression models for separate regions across a study area would improve the accuracy of baseflow prediction texas has ten primary climate zones that represent areas with similar properties such as temperature precipitation humidity vegetation and seasonal weather changes twdb 2012 based on these classifications and numbers of watersheds within each zone they were condensed into five categories to develop multiple distinct models for each of them category 1 includes the east texas and upper coastal plain and categories 2 and 3 include the north central and south central zones respectively the edwards plateau the southern plain and the lower valley lie in category 4 finally category 5 includes the high plains low rolling plains and the trans pecos zone fig 1b the bfi values estimated from the digital filter for the period 1980 to 2017 in 108 watersheds were used for model development the remaining 22 basins were randomly selected from each category using bootstrap resampling and were used for model validation and to assess model performance for various spatial conditions before model development watershed variables were logarithm transformed to meet the normality requirement using the following equation 2 log b f i log y 0 y 1 log x 1 y 2 log x 2 y 3 log x 3 y n log x n where y 0 is the regression constant x1 x2 x3 xn are basin physical properties y1 y2 y3 and yn are regression coefficients as used before in similar studies ahiablame et al 2013 zhu and day 2009 preliminary outputs showed that the coefficients of determination r2 of the developed regression model were slightly greater with the use of logarithm transformed variables than with untransformed variables for an ideal model prediction the correlation should include independent parameters and be physically sensible and statistically significant when producing good bfi estimates the auto correlation function acf and spearman s correlation test were applied to evaluate independency and correlation respectively between the selected variables the correlation analysis showed that the transformed variables were independent in this research but there were some correlations among them for instance prcp and et were highly correlated based on the computational complexity and number of variables three scenarios were used to develop the regression models the first two scenarios used variables that represented areas and stream geomorphologies in addition to meteorology and land use as suggested by scanlon et al 2002 the third scenario used topographical hydrogeological soil and lithological variables in relating bfi to surface geology in the region in baseflow research soil and lithology must be considered together since the groundwater flows through both lacey and grayson 1998 this procedure was important to avoid highly correlated variables in the same scenario that might lead to multicollinearity which could increase the coefficient variance estimates and make them sensitive to minor changes in the model negatively affecting model stability and quality therefore to avoid multicollinearity and to attain simplicity in the model scenarios 1 and 2 retained only one parameter from a group of highly correlated parameters in which the absolute value of the correlation coefficient was 0 85 after the selection of independent parameters an initial stepwise multiple regression model was developed using the parameters listed in table 2 this procedure yielded a large number of regression models however the best model was selected based on a combination of explanatory statistical indices and variables including akaike information criteria aic p values coefficient of determination r2 and adjusted r2 the p values were used to check the significance of individual parameters the residuals of the fitted model were also checked for normality however one of the main goals of this research was to evaluate the optimal regression model for bfi prediction therefore all variable combinations were used in developing the model the model that provided a higher correlation coefficient and adjusted r2 lower aic value had all variables that were significant and was represented by a minimum number of variables was finally selected for each scenario tested finally a check afterwards for multicollinearity of the developed model was applied using the variance inflation factor vif this step was necessary to measure the degree of collinearity present for each parameter included in the developed model lin 2008 in this study factors having vif values more than 5 were removed from the developed model a total of 15 best regression models for bfi prediction in the study region were developed one for each of the three scenarios for the five categories listed above multiple linear regression was utilized to develop a model for transferring the filtered bfi at the gauging stations to the prediction of bfi at ungauged stations in the following expression 3 b f i y 0 x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x 3 y 3 x n y n within the inverse logarithmic function eq 3 is the retransformed version of eq 2 hence the multiple linear regression models were created based on the transformed parameters the graphical outputs of these equations were validated using statistical indices to assess the performance of the model the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse pbias and relative error re were used to evaluate the accuracy of the regression outputs a regression with lower re was usually more accurate than one that had a higher re the formulas for r2 and nse pbias and re were previously outlined by gupta et al 2009 and nie et al 2011 a flow chart showing procedures used in this study is provided in fig 2 4 results and discussions 4 1 stream selection streams in the selected watersheds were described and characterized using flow duration curves fdc fdcs were created by calculating maximum exceedance probabilities for the entire record of mean daily streamflow in each watershed dingman 2015 fdcs identify the hydrological properties and flow regime of the drainage area through a graphical representation of cumulative frequency showing the relationship between the frequency and magnitude of streamflow for a certain river basin searcy 1959 in this study streams were classified as ephemeral intermittent and perennial based on maximum exceedance probability and bfi values based on the suggested approach the results of the bfi values were combined with the maximum exceedance probability fig 3 in which watersheds with bfi values less than 0 15 and maximum probability of exceedance less than 70 of the fdcs represented ephemeral streams and were excluded from the analysis intermittent streams exhibit periods of no flow in the low region of the fdcs levick et al 2008 and here they were identified as having maximum exceedance probabilities between 70 and 95 4 2 bfi estimation one aim of this study was to provide an estimate of the contribution of baseflow to total streamflow using the evaluation of statewide datasets from gauged stations across texas baseflow contribution was represented using the bfi a key advantage of using bfi rather than absolute baseflow components was that it provided better comparability across watersheds having different stream densities and total streamflow in addition bfi has previously been shown to give smaller variance and better evaluation of the baseflow and direct runoff at the same time haberlandt et al 2001 the bfimax were adjusted according to eckhardt 2005 suggesting that bfimax values vary from 0 25 to 0 80 the study proposed a bfimax value of 0 25 for perennial streams with hard rock aquifers 0 50 for ephemeral streams with porous aquifers and 0 80 for perennial streams with porous aquifers these values were obtained based on calibration and validation of the filtering approach on basins in maryland pennsylvania illinois and germany lim et al 2005 following the suggested approach values of bfimax were adjusted according to the hydrological and hydrogeological properties of each basin and with the outcomes of the fdcs of each stream bfi values output from what were compared with the outputs from the swat bflow tool that calculates baseflow by filtering streamflow data three times 1 pass 2 pass and 3 pass and was previously validated lim et al 2005 the groundwater contribution to surface water was greatest in east texas and around major aquifers in middle texas the edwards aquifer fig 4 a that lies in a fault zone in central texas produced the greatest bfi with a mean value of 0 51 springs and seeps groundwater in west texas also contribute locally to baseflow to the river system however the filtered bfi for the period 1998 2017 had the lowest mean of 0 29 these baseflow outputs were comparable to previously published reports of the texas water development board twdb george et al 2011 table 3 summarizes bfi values within each category in the study area in general bfi values for the entire study area ranged between 0 14 and 0 73 with a mean value of 0 45 suggesting that 45 of the long term streamflow in texas was coming from shallow subsurface flow and groundwater discharge the lowest bfi calculated was in northwestern texas particularly in the northern ogallala aquifer that is characterized by clayey soil and relatively small thickness that limits the amount of groundwater discharge to streams george et al 2011 in contrast the greatest bfi values were in central southern texas headwaters frio watershed particularly in the edwards trinity plateau aquifer this aquifer is mostly under water table or unconfined aquifers that are composed of sand fractured limestone and dolomite natural discharge to surface water here is primarily from springs along the margins of the aquifer where the water table intersects the ground surface twdb 2016 the edwards is also called the fault zone aquifer in which the highly fractured limestone outcrop at the surface allows for large amounts of natural allogenic recharge streams can cross the permeable formation and go underground e g sinkholes that can receive large amounts of recharge and transmit it directly into the aquifer anaya 2001 overall bfi tended to be greater in eastern texas however there was no specific pattern for bfi variation across texas fig 4b 4 3 regression models 4 3 1 category 1 the category 1 area represents the northern part of the carrizo aquifer and north and central gulf coast aquifers the carrizo aquifer is primarily composed of sand locally interbedded with gravel silt clay and lignite deeds et al 2003 while the gulf coast aquifer is primarily composed of discontinuous miocene to holocene sand silt clay and gravel beds twdb 2003 the best low flow prediction model under the three scenarios involved different variables but had r2 0 80 table 4 significant variables included in scenarios 1 and 2 were similar with the exception that scenario 1 contained variable prcp that was replaced by et in scenario 2 et was found to have no impact on bfi prediction in scenario 2 due to the high humidity for the category 1 region only the wslp and aws variables were significant at 95 and 90 confidence levels respectively for bfi prediction in the third scenario this agrees with a study in scotland in which average water storage was shown to be the main source of baseflow at lower slopes in mountainous headwaters tetzlaff and soulsby 2008 the evaluation of three model scenarios in the 24 watersheds selected in category 1 showed that the random error re for scenario 1 varied from 10 to 22 however for scenario 2 a greater range of re between 20 to 36 were calculated meanwhile re were between 16 and 14 for scenario 3 fig 5 a model assessment statistics for bfi prediction are summarized in table 5 the r2 and nse values for model development ranged between 0 79 and 0 93 while pbias varied between 0 3 and 0 7 table 5 values and the re results suggest that models developed in scenarios 1 and 3 were slightly better than scenario 2 this may be due to having fewer descriptive parameters in the scenario 2 model in addition the presence of the prcp variable in scenario 1 gave greater prediction accuracy precipitation can have a significant impact on the amount of groundwater discharge particularly in humid areas aboelnour et al 2019 zhu and day 2009 as shown in fig 6 the observed and predicted bfi showed similar values indicating some uncertainty in the developed model notably models for scenarios 1 and 3 provided the greatest accuracy one particular prediction that deviates from the observed bfi was observed in scenario 2 for the cypress creek watershed the model overestimated predicted bfi 0 68 compared to the observed bfi value of 0 56 this deviation could be partly attributed to the effect on baseflow by the large forest cover 46 and high topographic index that facilitates baseflow discharge to the stream network within the watershed further garcitas creek had a very low bfi 0 29 despite draining to the coast where enough rainfall for perennial flow was expected this might be because of greater average temperature and annual evapotranspiration and lower annual precipitation compared to other catchments in the category 1 region the developed models in the three scenarios were further validated using randomly selected basins the 22 model validation watersheds produced results having poorer bfi prediction evaluation metrics with median re of 2 92 3 85 and 2 37 for scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 5a for the validation dataset the computed bfi from the filtered usgs streamflow values were reasonably close to the predicted ones however the scenario 2 model had poorer performance than scenarios 1 and 3 models table 5 this was attributed to the absence of the prcp parameter in scenario 2 compared to scenario 1 in general the validation dataset resulted in better bfi prediction in scenario 3 with values of 0 91 0 91 and 0 5 for r2 nse and pbias respectively please refer to the supplementary materials and aboelnour et al 2020b for graphs showing the absolute relative errors and validation charts of all categories 4 3 2 category 2 the category 2 region covers the northern trinity aquifer in northeast texas fig 4a that is composed of multiple water bearing formations limestones sands clays gravels and conglomerates the aquifer productivity is mainly affected by the thickness and distribution of sandstone facies deposited in two different environments resulting in a stratified network of aquitards and aquifers in the northern trinity group covering the region twdb 2016 the regression analysis resulted in development of two similar models for scenarios 1 and 2 with the exception that scenario 2 contained the variable frst that was not statistically significant watershed properties affecting bfi in category 2 included drainage area stream power index maximum temperature and urban cover for scenarios 1 and 2 elevation topographic index hydrologic soil groups a b and c water storage and alluvial deposits influenced bfi prediction in scenario 3 except for hydxb all other parameters were statistically significant the fact that the variables frst and hydxb were not significant in scenarios 2 and 3 respectively can be explained by the presence of highly significant urban and hydxa parameters in scenarios 2 and 3 therefore it makes these variables less important compared to others the regression statistics indicated that the scenario 3 model had greater prediction accuracy with values of 59 0 89 and 0 79 for aic r2 and adjusted r2 respectively table 6 although category 2 represents a humid region scenarios 1 and 2 lacked precipitation variables in the prediction model likely due to delayed precipitation response particularly for large watersheds ahiablame et al 2013b for scenario 3 elevation and topographic index regulate the rate at which soil water moves down a slope and therefore dictate whether runoff after a storm event will be directly flushed to the river system or stored in the soil price 2011 average water storage contributed to bfi prediction in which the aws parameter had an important role in water redistribution towards the basin outlets hector et al 2015 finally alluvial deposits are closely related to the presence and the extent of baseflow in which of groundwater recharge quantity was found to be correlated to topographic positions that have greater alluvial deposits coverage schilling 2009 performance of the three models to predict bfi in category 2 showed a slightly greater re compared to category 1 for the three scenarios re ranged between 26 and 33 for scenario 1 and varied from 25 to 41 for scenario 2 while it had the smallest margins between 21 for scenario 3 fig 5b these results are promising and the model developed for scenario 3 had the best performance for bfi prediction in the category 2 area table 5 the r2 and pbias values were 0 80 0 72 and 0 85 and 0 5 0 9 and 0 2 for scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively although the scenario 1 model had fewer variables compared to scenario 2 it performed slightly better indicating that additional variables did not improve predictions validation for scenario 2 had the poorest model performance with re ranging from 35 to 62 while scenario 3 had the narrowest re range of the three scenarios fig 5b r2 nse and pbias ranged from 0 61 to 0 79 0 57 to 0 79 and 2 4 to 1 2 respectively table 5 based on these statistical outputs and the re the models had adequate performance for the validation datasets moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 fig 7 compares predicted bfi using the equations in table 6 with the observed bfi when the forest land use variable was removed from scenario 2 the bias between the predicted and observed bfi slightly decreased in scenario 1 the greatest deviation was in the lower little river watershed in the scenario 2 model in which predicted bfi was underestimated this might be related its greater watershed temperature compared to the others in category 2 although the annual et variable was not significant in scenario 2 the greater temperature played an important part in increasing evapotranspiration and leading to decreased infiltration in addition waters and wetlands cover only 0 7 and 2 7 of the watershed respectively which would cause a decrease in subsurface water discharged 4 3 3 category 3 the category 3 area is characterized by sub tropical sub humid climates in the south central part of texas that cover the southern trinity aquifer the central parts of carrizo and the gulf coast aquifers the northern parts are mainly covered by limestone and dolomitic rock types while the central part is covered by the middle eocene claiborne and wilcox groups consisting of a vertical sequence of alternating sandstones siltstones and claystones davies and ethridge 1971 the southern part is mainly composed of tertiary and quaternary silt clay sand and gravel twdb 2003 regression equations developed for this category indicated the model could predict bfi with high accuracy table 7 bfi was predicted using variables da spi sti tstrl prcp wtr and wtl covers in scenario 1 with performance statistics of 61 0 95 and 0 87 for aic r2 and adjusted r2 respectively when tstrl prcp and wtl in scenario 1 were replaced with tmax et and frst in scenario 2 an improved predictive model resulted watersheds included in category 3 were characterized by a greater percentage of cultivated 37 and forest 25 cover compared to other regions some research studies have linked higher forest cover with lower bfis due to greater forest evapotranspiration sahin and hall 1996 swank et al 1988 whereas others suggested an increased bfi with more forest areas due to more infiltration to subsurface water storage price 2011 santhi et al 2008 both forest cover and evapotranspiration were included in the scenario 2 model et had a clear negative correlation with bfi since et depletes the water on which baseflow is dependent these results agreed with similar research in indiana usa suggesting that drainage area and precipitation were the main influential variables in baseflow evaluation ahiablame et al 2013 for scenario 3 bfi was predicted using average watershed slope basin relief hydrologic soil group b water storage alluvial and colluvial deposits and hydraulic conductivity however only alluvial and colluvial lithology were statistically significant surface topographic properties may express the amount of colluvial deposits available and this likely explains the existence of the variables relv and coll in scenario 3 colluvial deposits have previously been shown to play an important role in shallow reservoirs and play a significant role in explaining variability in the magnitude of groundwater schulz et al 2008 in category 3 only 9 watersheds had colluvial deposits that appeared to affect the amount of groundwater discharge colluvial deposits that were significant in the scenario 3 model may be related to water movement such that flow from bedrock to colluvium is more likely where the bedrock has layers with strong permeability contrasts that dip out of the slope performance of the three models to predict bfi in ungauged stations showed lower re in category 3 compared to categories 1 and 2 the 1st and 3rd interquartile re ranged from 3 to 5 in all scenarios with a median of 0 69 0 12 and 0 49 for scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 5c scenario 3 had the narrowest re range similarly model validation indicated promising re values the highest prediction accuracy in scenario 3 had a median re of 0 81 although the three scenarios had slight differences in the evaluation indices they predicted the bfi for the development and validation datasets precisely with the development dataset r2 and nse for the three scenarios varied from 0 94 to 0 98 in addition the scenarios had low pbias of 0 1 table 5 however performance decreased when using the validation dataset r2 nse and pbias ranged from 0 56 to 0 85 0 54 to 0 85 and 1 4 to 3 1 respectively this variation might be attributed to the change in meteorological patterns across the state since the validation dataset was randomly selected from each of the five categories and may have important features that specifically affect bfi values such as geology or land cover and use in general the re results together with the statistical indices suggested that bfi can be predicted with high accuracy in the category 3 region this can be clearly seen in fig 8 in which the observed and predicted bfi values show the same pattern for the three scenarios with respect to the model development dataset 4 3 4 category 4 the category 4 area represents the central and the southern part of the state including the edwards plateau that contains the edwards trinity aquifer which is mostly unconfined george et al 2011 however the artesian zone of the aquifer is confined the aquifer is recharged via natural sinkholes i e allogenic recharge anaya and jones 2009 the central and southern part of the category 4 region is mainly covered by fluvial deltaic sediments of the upper paleocene and lower eocene wilcox group carrizo sand of the southern carrizo aquifer deeds et al 2003 and discontinuous silt clay and sand beds of the miocene and holocene ages twdb 2016 the regression equations were developed using three sets of data among the potential bfi response predictors for the scenario 1 model forest and wetland areas were the best predictors for bfi table 8 in addition stream power and sediment transport indices precipitation and water cover descriptors were also included in the model however they were not significant this might be related to the low stream densities in the region which in turn reduced the stream power and sediment transport indices stream power index reductions might be attributed to some of the streams in the plateau being sinking streams that never reach an outlet however they flow into a fracture zone or sinkholes and turn into allogenic recharge in addition there is no pattern in precipitation in the category 4 area and is greatest in late spring and early fall only in the eastern part of the region for the scenario 2 model variables et clt and frst were significant in predicting bfi watersheds selected in category 4 were mainly covered by shrublands forests and cultivated cover with 70 12 and 10 respectively the shrublands had a positive correlation with et while the cultivated and forested areas had negative impacts on et based on their recharge and infiltration rates the shrublands may lead to the reduction of et and bfi in the region these findings suggest why we observed positive correlation of the clt and frst parameters but negative correlation for the et variable in bfi prediction table 8 results from this category agreed with zhu and day 2009 in which baseflow was correlated with drainage area precipitation and evapotranspiration watersheds selected in category 4 were mostly covered by residual 37 and colluvial sediments 23 supporting the use of these two variables in the model developed for scenario 3 average slope water storage hydrologic soil group d and hydraulic conductivity were also included in the model but they were not significant this could be due to the lack of complex topography low water storage and conductivity in this area with an average k of 3 m day 1 barker and ardis 1996 overall the scenario 2 model had the lowest bfi prediction accuracy with r2 and adjusted r2 values of 0 94 and 0 77 respectively this was in contrast to the scenario 1 and 3 models with r2 of 0 99 and 0 94 and adjusted r2 values of 0 90 and 0 87 respectively these accuracies were reflected in the model performance bfi prediction the median re ranged between 1 93 to 0 72 for model development and from 1 59 to 5 38 for the validation dataset fig 5d bfi was predicted with relatively high r2 values indicating that the continuous coverage of the lithological scheme could be used for bfi predictive purposes the r2 and other evaluation statistical indices had lower values for the validation dataset compared to the model development the lowest r2 value was 0 70 for scenario 3 and the highest was 0 76 for scenario 1 table 5 fig 9 compares the observed bfi values to those simulated using the equations in table 8 there was low bias in the predictions for all three scenarios and the developed model equations provide comparable estimates for the bfi some predictions were more divergent from the observed bfi such as the overestimation of bfi in the dry frio watershed in scenarios 2 and 3 the dry frio watershed has greater annual precipitation 924 mm and lower evapotranspiration 399 mm rates compared to other watersheds in the region similarly the model overestimated the predicted bfi for the dry frio watershed in scenario 3 due to high hydraulic conductivity in the watershed 30 m day 1 although this watershed is covered by shallow to very shallow gravelly loam and clay the high conductivity reported was likely caused by the data acquisition for hydrogeological parameters data were collected from well reports and wells are generally sited where values of water storage transmissivity and conductivity are high 4 3 5 category 5 the category 5 area represents the low rolling and high plains in northwestern texas and the trans pecos plain in the far western part of the state the region features the seymour aquifer in northern texas ogallala aquifer in north central texas and the pecos valley aquifer in the west fig 4a the selected watersheds for model development were mainly in the northern part of the ogallala formation of the ogallala aquifer this formation was deposited as alluvial outwash from the rocky mountains with coarse grained pebbles to boulder size gravels near the mountains to fine grained sand and gravel with increased distance from the mountains gustavson 1996 the best low flow regression model developed under the three scenarios in category 5 showed high r2 values compared to other categories 0 99 0 96 and 0 98 for scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively in addition the models for both scenarios 1 and 2 involved similar parameters with the difference being replacement of prcp by the et and brn parameters in scenario 2 although precipitation was not statistically significant in scenario 1 et was significant at a 0 01 probability level this is likely because areas were in the dry western region of the state where rainfall rate is significantly lower on the other hand some of the category 5 watersheds included highly cultivated areas with an et rate up to 400 mm yr category 5 region results indicated that correlation between et and bfi was negative table 9 in addition the presence of the et factor was likely the reason for reduced accuracy of the scenario 2 model as r2 decreased from 0 99 to 0 96 from scenario 1 to scenario 2 topographic factors including elev and ti hydrologic soil group a eolian deposits depth to water transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity were all significant in the model developed for bfi prediction in scenario 3 groundwater recharge in western texas category 5 is mainly due to inter aquifer flow and infiltration from ephemeral streams inter aquifer flow requires higher values of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity within the aquifer media while the seepage from streams needs sufficient rainfall to generate runoff through the ephemeral streams this might provide an explanation for attribution of hydrologic parameters in bfi prediction and the lower bfi values in this category compared to other categories the 1st and 3rd interquartile for re margins for the model developed ranged from 4 to only 5 for the three scenarios with the narrowest re margin observed in scenario 3 fig 5e the r2 and nse values between the observed and predicted bfi ranged between 0 96 and 0 99 while pbias varied between 0 1 and 0 2 table 5 therefore it could be concluded that baseflow has a strong relationship with lithology soil type and climate in this category and that bfi can be explained as an integrated description of the fractional areas of lithology in the basins in addition the predicted bfi values clearly exhibit the same pattern for the three scenarios with respect to the model development dataset in category 5 fig 10 the small deviations and extremely low bias between the observed and predicted bfi in fig 10 might be explained by the constant topography of the plains and meteorological conditions in the area the model validation showed larger margins of re compared to basins used for model development with 1st and 3rd quartile ranging from 14 to 19 and scenario 1 having the largest margin fig 5e the r2 and nse values indicated reduced performance during validation compared to model development table 5 the scenario 2 model had the lowest r2 value 0 59 compared to those for scenarios 2 and 3 0 79 however the low pbias for the validation dataset indicated that the regression model could be used to predict bfi in areas that have similar conditions to that of the category 5 region nevertheless it is important to mention that these findings reflect only intermittent and perennial streams and catchments that had large numbers of ephemeral streams were not included in model development and the interpretation of the relationship between baseflow and watershed properties based on basin characteristics some perennial streams may exhibit low bfi values for instance happy draw watershed and wildhorse creek these watersheds can be informative when evaluating the relationship between baseflow yield and basin properties meanwhile intermittent streams may have some baseflow yield as they can maintain flow over some sections during the dry season due to locally elevated water tables or perched aquifers examples of intermittent stream watersheds in this category are headwater clear fork and deep creek watersheds finally it should be mentioned that in this research we tried to develop a model including all the selected watersheds that represent the five categories 108 watersheds however outputs of these models were not able to predict baseflow adequately regardless of the number of variables included in the model the poorer performance for the statewide models was likely due to variability in climatic and geological conditions and parameters across the state these findings indicated the benefits of determining appropriate study areas to develop regression models within a larger study region although the development of distinct regression equations can be computationally and resource intensive specifically over large regions that have several meteorological geological and topographic features the developed models showed an ability to accurately predict the bfi across the state 5 limitations of our approach findings of this research showed that the deviation between the observed and predicted bfi values were relatively small in all developed and validated models however several limitations of this study should be noted and would benefit from further investigation in future research first the collection of watershed properties representing hydrogeological factors that impact baseflow is a challenging process as most of these parameters were acquired from areas where data from wells were available these were usually located in areas where the water storage conductivity and transmissivity were relatively high and therefore may not be indicative of entire watershed conditions hector et al 2015 mazvimavi et al 2003 this might explain why neither depth to water nor transmissivity were included in any of the developed models of scenario 3 except in category 5 since the data were derived from pumping test wells they were considered as point estimates that were constant across the basin therefore it is recommended to use other representative parameters for instance relative elevation topographic surface in which the floodplain surface was subtracted from the nearest river channel water level elevations rather than depth to water and to involve well data throughout the area or by utilizing an area weighted average to acquire values better representing whole basins another limitation of this study is that the soil properties were represented only by the percentages of hsgs however basins may contain various soil types with different characteristics at different locations based on topography for example some soils can be deep and permeable and others can be shallow and impermeable at small depths below the subsurface within the same basins however it is reasonable to identify representative hydrogeological and lithological categories that are continuous and stable across whole watersheds accuracies of model results were also limited to the input of single time point land use data nlcd 2016 the filtered bfi values were calculated from usgs daily streamflow data from 1980 2017 with the assumption that the land use was constant over this timespan therefore changes in land use patterns over time have not been specifically addressed by the developed models while changes in land uses were reported for texas over the past few decades garner et al 2019 xu 2018 an improvement to consider in future studies would be to acquire at least two land use datasets one from an early time and one current to obtain a percentage of land cover change of each basin lastly intermittent streams may appear to be ephemeral based on their fdc alone and they were much more difficult to identify without creating combined hydrographs and hyetographs although it was possible to identify some of the ephemeral and intermittent streams using the 1 1 plot in section 4 1 fig 3 distinguishing between different stream types is often fuzzy and scale dependent yaeger et al 2012 i e some streams may retain water for decades and then dry out during a prolonged drought period 6 summary and conclusions multiple linear regression models were used to develop three scenarios based on different characteristics affecting baseflow the first two scenarios used variables that represented areas and stream geomorphologies in addition to meteorology and land use the third scenario used topography hydrogeological soil and lithology variables results of the regression showed the models predicted bfi with high accuracy the greatest accuracy was recorded in the category 3 4 and 5 areas while poorest model performance was in the category 2 region this is likely related to the topography complexity and the diversity of lithological data in the category 2 region coefficients of determination r2 relating bfi values to basin properties in this research were relatively high and relative errors were relatively low in general within each category scenarios 1 and 3 models had higher prediction performance while scenario 2 had the lowest independent variables developed for scenarios 1 and 2 were similar with differing degrees of significance levels the major difference between scenarios 1 and 2 was the use of the factor representing evapotranspiration which when applied in the model leads to lower bfi prediction accuracy this might be because et was not categorized as proportional to the percentages of cultivated areas within each basin but was generalized to represent the whole basin independent parameters including precipitation basin area stream power index sediment transport index forests and developed covers were found to correlate directly to bfi predictions in both scenarios 1 and 2 evapotranspiration was negatively correlated to the bfi values in categories 3 4 and 5 for scenario 3 factors including average water storage hydraulic conductivity hydrologic soil groups alluvial and colluvial lithology were the main explanatory parameters for baseflow elevation and topographic index were negatively correlated to groundwater discharge in scenario 3 hydrologic soil groups affected the bfi differently in that increased soil sand percentage increased predicted bfi this research led to the development of models that are able to predict bfi values that are comparable to those determined by what by using categorized areas across the state of texas with high performance moreover these findings indicated that bfis were an integral expression of the fractional areas of each lithology in the basins the regression models were additionally tested using validation datasets and showed high performance indicating that the developed models can be applied to predict bfi in ungauged regions therefore the models developed here can be easily applied in other areas that have similar topographic geologic and climatic arid semi arid or humid conditions where databases for meteorology hydrogeology and soil types are available some limitations should be taken into account when applying these models to other areas and further studies to improve some of the proposed approaches are recommended as discussed above however results from application of these regression models should be beneficial to guide water management strategies and in establishment of water resource plans at local and regional scales the models developed play a vital role in planning for an accurate estimation of factors that impact groundwater discharge in addition these equations can support groundwater modelers by providing independently obtained bfi estimation at ungauged sites credit
