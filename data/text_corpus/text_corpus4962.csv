24810,potential woody cover of savanna ecosystems is highly relevant to their dynamics and management especially with regard to the widespread phenomenon of woody plant encroachment prior studies suggest that water availability is the primary factor limiting potential woody cover to this end variations in future water availability due to climate change are likely to alter localized potential woody cover this study aims to test this hypothesis in the savanna of central texas usa during the 21st century with application of climate projection of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 the established relationship between potential woody cover and observed mean annual precipitation map of 1981 2010 in the study area works as the basis in this study it turns out that the vast majority of texas savanna will receive less precipitation in the rest of the 21st century to different degrees depending on temporal stages and representative concentration pathways rcps however the potential woody cover does not necessarily change with precipitation the semiarid region of texas savanna and the very west portion of the mesic region will have lower potential woody cover whereas potential woody cover in the arid region and most of the mesic region will remain the same it is worth noting that discrepancy in projected potential woody cover maps exists between rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this discrepancy highlights the varying effect that different government policies of greenhouse gas emission can impose on savanna ecosystems in the long run keywords texas savanna potential woody cover climate change projection cmip5 21st century 1 introduction savanna ecosystems are featured by the mixture of woody plants trees shrubs and bushes and herbaceous vegetation frost et al 1986 they cover about 20 of our land surface and accommodate a large proportion of human population wildlife and livestock scholes and archer 1997 they also play an important role in global biodiversity carbon cycle and net primary production grace et al 2006 solbrig et al 2013 poulter et al 2014 however the structure and function of savanna ecosystems are being threatened globally by woody plant encroachment the directional increase of woody plants in biomass density and cover at the expense of herbaceous vegetation stevens et al 2017 axelsson and hanan 2018 for instance the encroachment reduced species richness in southern australia and promoted soil carbon sequestration in a mesic savanna of zambia price and morgan 2008 blaser et al 2014 it also lowered livestock production in north and south america and jeopardized other ecosystem services anadón et al 2014 archer et al 2017 therefore conservation organizations ranchers and government agencies are highly concerned about this phenomenon among others the upper bound of woody plant cover also known as potential woody cover is of particular interest sankaran 2005 it is because that potential woody cover defines the end point of woody plant encroachment and indicates where the existing woody cover lies relative to its maximum realizable level scholtz et al 2018 savannas with higher potential woody cover are more vulnerable to the encroachment and deserve more urgent management since they could shift to woodland as a result of the encroachment yang et al 2016 potential woody cover can also provide insight into the underlying mechanism of the ecosystems a low potential woody cover rules out the possibility of woody canopy closure and makes patch dynamics a possible approach to understand the dynamics of savanna ecosystems wiegand et al 2006 meyer et al 2009 scheffer 2009 in addition with regard to the huge geographic occurrence of savanna ecosystems potential woody cover has huge implications on terrestrial carbon pool huang et al 2018 there have been a lot of studies on potential woody cover in savanna ecosystems for instance it is found that potential woody cover is limited by water availability breshears and barnes 1999 kerkhoff et al 2004 bond et al 2005 fensham et al 2005 and increases with mean annual precipitation map fernandez illescas and rodriguez iturbe 2004 bucini and hanan 2007 good and caylor 2011 prove that the upper bound of woody plant cover is affected by the quantity and intensity of precipitation events lehmann et al 2011 suggest that potential woody cover is regulated by precipitation total and seasonality according to the above mean annual precipitation limiting scheme sankaran et al 2005 modeled potential woody cover over the rainfall gradient of african savannas scholtz et al 2018 estimated potential woody cover of north american great plains yang and crews 2019 assessed the potential woody cover pattern over the rainfall gradient in texas savanna these studies provide pertinent guidance on the management of respective savanna ecosystems it is worth noting that all these studies are based on current precipitation regime whereas the precipitation regime is expected to change due to climate change particularly in savanna regions knapp et al 2008 trenberth 2011 kitoh and endo 2016 garcía criado et al 2020 with regard to the limiting role of precipitation potential woody cover is likely to change with future precipitation this study aims to test the above hypothesis in the savanna of central texas usa the availability of climate projection data provides us an opportunity to perform the test meehl et al 2007 taylor et al 2012 the result is expected to enlighten the changing trend of potential woody cover and inform savanna management strategy in face of climate change 2 study area the savanna in central texas usa roots in a shallow and clay rich soil layer which results from the bedrock of hard limestone schmid 1969 fig 1 a it spans a broad rainfall gradient and encompasses arid semiarid and mesic regions yang and crew 2019 mean annual precipitation 1981 2010 ranges from 360 mm to 950 mm in west east direction fig 1b juniper juniperus oak quercus and mesquite prosopis glandulosa are presently the most popular woody species across this area fowler and simmons 2009 this savanna area is home to a lot of ranches state parks and wildlife alofs and fowler 2010 however these services have been vulnerable to woody plant encroachment in recent decades for instance reduction in livestock productivity decrease in groundwater recharge habitat fragmentation and herbaceous species loss have been reported due to the encroachment lyons et al 2009 wilcox and huang 2010 alofs and fowler 2013 consequently ranchers and conservation ecologists in this region are haunted by the encroachment potential woody cover the end point of woody plant encroachment has been an important point of focus yang and crews 2019 modeled the potential woody cover of texas savanna at 250 m spatial scale later in response to the hierarchy of woody plant density in savanna ecosystems gillson 2004 yang et al 2020 systematically explored the relationship between the upper bound woody plant cover and mean annual precipitation at various observation scales in texas savanna fig 2 it is found that the upper bound woody plant cover under given precipitation conditions decreases with observation scale but stabilizes by 250 m scale 3 data and preprocessing 3 1 cmip5 climate projection of the climate model intercomparison project phase five cmip5 was used in this study taylor et al 2012 the cmip5 comprises of 20 climate modeling groups around the world who apply different global climate models gcm each of these modeling groups projects the 21th century climate independently under various greenhouse gas emission scenarios that result from different assumed government policies moss et al 2010 meinshausen et al 2011 those emission scenarios are referred to as representative concentration pathways rcps the four proposed rcps namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 and rcp8 5 in the order of increasing total radiative forcing cover a wide range of future climate scenarios for instance the total radiative forcing of rcp2 6 peaks at about 3 w m2 by the middle of the 21st century while the total radiative forcing of rcp8 5 continuously rises to 8 5 w m2 by the end of the 21st century the output variables of cmip5 include temperature precipitation radiation humidity and wind all of which have been widely utilized in research and application dai 2013 pierce et al 2013 wild et al 2015 carvalho et al 2017 farsani et al 2019 coro et al 2020 it has to be noted that these outputs have a coarse spatial resolution of one to several latitude longitude degrees the applied climate science lab at the university of idaho downscaled the coarse resolution outputs of the contiguous united states under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to a fine resolution of 4 km or 6 km depending on specific variables the method of multivariate adaptive constructed analogs maca was used in the downscaling process abatzoglou and brown 2012 the downscaled precipitation projection is on a monthly basis and has a spatial resolution of 4509 m it spans the time period of 2006 to 2099 it is worth noting that these fine resolution precipitation projection is available for 18 of the 20 cmip5 modeling groups namely bcc csm1 1 bcc csm1 1 m bnu esm ccsm4 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 canesm2 gfdl esm2g gfdl esm2m hadgem2 cc365 hadgem2 es365 ipsl cm5a lr ipsl cm5a mr ipsl cm5b lr miroc esm chem miroc esm miroc5 and mri cgcm3 these available fine resolution precipitation data was projected to the coordinate system of nad 1983 albers for further analysis 3 2 mean annual precipitation projection in texas savanna the established relationship between potential woody cover and mean annual precipitation in fig 2 was based on the observed mean annual precipitation of 1981 to 2010 to match the 30 year period this study will focus on three time periods namely 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 potential woody cover of texas savanna will be modeled for each time period with respective projected mean annual precipitation firstly we developed a mean annual precipitation surface 4509 m for the time period 2011 2040 based on each of the 18 cmip5 modeling groups downscaled precipitation projection under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively secondly the 18 result map surfaces under each rcp were averaged the average map surfaces 2011 2040 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are displayed in fig 3 a and b these steps were then repeated for the time periods 2041 2070 fig 3c and d and 2071 2099 fig 3e and f it is evident that the very eastern part wet area of texas savanna will experience a decrease in map in all the three time periods and under both rcps when compared to current map 1981 2010 fig 3g but difference exists between the projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 while the map is relatively stable across the three time periods under rcp4 5 fig 3a c e a prominent drying trend is noticeable under rcp8 5 fig 3b d f 3 3 uncertainty analysis of the multi model projection it has to be noted that variation exists among the projections of the 18 cmip5 modeling groups to assess the credibility of the average projection of the 18 modeling groups signal to noise ratio λ was calculated for each average projection in fig 3 zhou and yu 2006 signal refers to the absolute difference between each average projection and a base value map of 1981 to 2010 in this study and noise refers to the standard deviation among the projections of the 18 modeling groups while λ 1 suggests that signal is larger than noise and the average projection is credible to a certain extent λ 1 indicates a low credibility of the average projection li and zhou 2010 firstly we calculated the difference of each average map projection from the map of 1981 2010 fig 4 a general trend over the three time periods is clear that most of texas savanna will receive less precipitation and the magnitude of decrease increases from the west to east only a few scattered plots will receive a little more precipitation in the rest of the 21st century the most significant decrease in map 238 mm occurs during 2071 2099 under rcp8 5 while the most significant increase 68 mm occurs during 2011 2040 under rcp8 5 it is evident from fig 4a c e that the projected change in map is similar across the three time periods under rcp4 5 whereas the trend of increasing drought is pronounced under rcp8 5 fig 4b d f secondly we calculated the standard deviation among the 18 modeling groups for each average projection in fig 3 thirdly on the basis of the first and second steps we calculated the signal to noise ratio for each average projection fig 5 it is evident that the average projection of map under both rcps are credible to a certain extent λ 1 in vast majority of the study area for all the three time periods 4 potential woody cover modeling under precipitation projection despite climate change other aspects of the savanna ecosystem in central texas such as woody plant species and soil type which may affect potential woody cover are presumed to be relatively consistent during the rest of the 21st century in this regard it is reasonable to suppose that the relationship between potential woody cover and mean annual precipitation established based on current precipitation regime fig 2 will hold under future varying precipitation regimes as shown by fig 2 the relationship between upper bound woody plant cover and mean annual precipitation stabilizes by 250 m scale to best match the spatial resolution of the precipitation projection data 4509 m we chose to apply the relationship at 500 m scale to model the potential woody cover of texas savanna in the rest of the 21st century the mathematical form of the relationship between upper bound woody plant cover and map at 500 m scale is displayed in equation 1 yang et al 2020 while pcs represents potential woody cover of plot s map s represents its mean annual precipitation 1 p c s 0 496 0 35739 e e 0 02718 m a p s 626 78419 by applying equation 1 and the map projections in fig 3 we calculated the potential woody cover of texas savanna for each of the three time periods under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively it should be noted that equation 1 was developed based on current precipitation regime fig 1b and is valid for the map range of 361 to 954 mm therefore areas out of this map range under future climate scenarios will not have a potential woody cover value in this study the result potential woody cover maps are displayed in fig 6 each map is overlaid with the boundary of the semiarid region 591 mm map 662 mm under current precipitation regime 1981 2010 where the potential woody cover transitions from the low stable level to high stable level fig 6g yang et al 2020 the area west of the semiarid region in fig 6g is arid region and east is mesic region under current precipitation regime 5 discussion and conclusion this study aims to test whether potential woody cover in texas savanna will change with precipitation during the rest of the 21st century to achieve this goal this study modeled potential woody cover of texas savanna with projected precipitation by 18 cmip5 modeling groups it was based on the established relationship between potential woody cover and mean annual precipitation under current precipitation regime 1981 2010 specifically mean annual precipitation map of texas savanna was calculated for each of the three time periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 2071 2099 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively from the outputs of 18 cmip5 modeling groups it is revealed that most area of texas savanna will experience a decrease in precipitation to different extents depending on time periods and rcps fig 3 this finding agrees with the reported global drying trend of the 21st century mariotti et al 2008 cook et al 2014 however potential woody cover does not necessarily change with precipitation across texas savanna under current precipitation regime 1981 2010 as shown in fig 6g potential woody cover stays at the low end in the arid region and at the high end in the mesic region it gradually transitions from the low end to high end over the semiarid region the black polygon area in all the three time periods and under both rcps potential woody cover in the arid zone remains at the low end regardless of precipitation change while potential woody cover in majority of the mesic region east portion keeps at the high end despite severe decrease in precipitation the most significant change in potential woody cover occurs in the semiarid region and the very west portion of the mesic region as for the semiarid region the spectrum of low to high potential woody cover is much encroached by the low end value across all the three time periods due to decreased precipitation the very west portion of the mesic region also experiences a decrease in potential woody cover in response to the drying trend it is implied that the semiarid region and the low end in terms of precipitation of the mesic region will be most susceptible to climate change with respect to potential woody cover this result is consistent with the finding by viglizzo et al 2015 that transition between different vegetation types savannas shrublands and forests is more likely to occur in sub humid regions than in high precipitation regions and the transition is more reversible in sub humid regions than in dry regions it is worth noting that the trend of potential woody cover over the three time periods differs between rcp4 5 fig 6a c e and rcp8 5 fig 6b d f as for the starting period 2011 2040 the potential woody cover map under rcp4 5 fig 6a is very similar to that under rcp8 5 fig 6b however while the potential woody cover map changes very slightly during 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 from 2011 2040 under rcp4 5 it changes significantly under rcp8 5 as revealed by fig 6f the current semiarid region the black polygon area will be mostly occupied by the low end potential woody cover value by 2071 2099 under rcp8 5 the different trends highlight the varying effect of different rcps on the potential woody cover of texas savanna in a larger picture this discrepancy stresses the difference that different government policies on greenhouse gas emission can make in the development of our terrestrial ecosystem in the long term qiu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 limitations of this study should be acknowledged firstly a small area in the southwest corner of the study area is missing in fig 6a to f when compared to fig 6g it is because that this small area experiences a decrease in precipitation across all the three time periods which lowers its map below the valid map range of equation 1 secondly we applied the mean annual precipitation of three 30 year periods it is possible that precipitation varies within each 30 year period more dynamics of the potential woody cover could have been reflected if 10 year or 20 year map data were used thirdly mean annual precipitation was used as the proxy of plant water availability in this study to model potential woody cover it has to be noted that besides precipitation the actual soil moisture levels are also affected by other factors such as evapotranspiration and runoff to different degrees rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 nonetheless mean annual precipitation provides the best available means to assess the potential woody cover pattern given the lack of large scale soil moisture data good and caylor 2011 lastly the relationship between potential woody cover and mean annual precipitation was originally modeled with gompertz function it is possible that very slight difference in the potential woody cover pattern could be observed if other more complex functions were used in conclusion texas savanna will experience a decrease in potential woody cover in the semiarid region and west part of the mesic region and consequently undergo a decrease in carbon storage capacity due to the drying trend of the 21st century this trend may relieve the severity of woody plant encroachment in the semiarid and mesic regions to some extent while highlighting the huge effect climate change can impose on savanna ecosystems this study also underscores the necessity of appropriate government policies on greenhouse gas emission credit authorship contribution statement xuebin

each of the 18 cmip5 modeling groups downscaled precipitation projection under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively secondly the 18 result map surfaces under each rcp were averaged the average map surfaces

eastern part wet area of texas savanna will experience a decrease in map in all the three time periods and under both rcps when compared to current map 1981 2010 fig 3g but difference exists between

of 1981 2010 fig 4 a general trend over the three time periods is clear that most of texas savanna will receive less precipitation and the magnitude of decrease increases from the west to east only a few scattered plots will receive a little more precipitation in the rest of the 21st century the most significant decrease in map 238 mm occurs during 2071 2099 under rcp8 5 while the most significant increase 68 mm occurs during 2011 2040 under rcp8 5 it is evident from fig 4a c e that the projected change in map is similar across the three time periods under rcp4 5 whereas the trend of increasing

majority of the study area for all the three time periods 4 potential woody cover modeling under precipitation projection despite climate change other aspects of the savanna ecosystem in central texas such as woody plant species and soil type which may affect potential woody cover are presumed to be relatively consistent during the rest of the 21st century in this regard it is reasonable to suppose that the relationship between potential woody cover and mean annual precipitation established based on current precipitation regime fig 2 will hold under future varying precipitation regimes as shown by fig 2 the relationship between upper bound woody plant cover and mean annual precipitation stabilizes by 250 m scale to best match the spatial resolution of the precipitation projection data 4509 m we chose to apply the relationship at 500 m scale to model the potential woody cover of texas savanna in the rest of the 21st century the mathematical form of the relationship between upper bound

under future climate scenarios will not have a potential woody cover value in this study the result potential woody cover maps are displayed in fig 6 each map is overlaid with the boundary of the semiarid region 591 mm map 662 mm under current precipitation regime 1981 2010 where the potential woody cover transitions from the low stable level to high stable level fig 6g yang et al 2020 the area west of the semiarid region in fig 6g is arid region and east is mesic region under current precipitation regime 5 discussion and conclusion this study aims to test whether potential woody cover in texas savanna will change with precipitation during the rest of the 21st century to achieve this goal this study modeled potential woody cover of texas savanna with projected precipitation by 18 cmip5 modeling groups it was based on the established relationship between potential woody cover and mean annual precipitation under current precipitation regime 1981 2010 specifically mean annual precipitation map of texas savanna was calculated for each of the three time periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 2071 2099 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively from the outputs of 18 cmip5 modeling groups it is revealed that most area of texas savanna will experience a decrease in precipitation to different extents depending on time periods and rcps fig 3 this finding agrees with the reported global drying trend of the 21st century mariotti et al 2008 cook et al 2014 however potential woody cover does not necessarily change with precipitation across texas savanna under current precipitation regime 1981 2010 as shown in fig 6g potential woody cover stays at the low end in the arid region and at the high end in the mesic region it gradually transitions from the low end to high end over the semiarid region the black polygon area in all the three time periods and under both rcps potential woody cover in the arid zone remains at the low end regardless of precipitation change while potential woody cover in majority of the mesic region east portion keeps at the high end despite severe decrease in precipitation the most significant change in potential woody cover occurs in the semiarid region and the very west portion of the mesic region as for the semiarid region the spectrum of low to high potential woody cover is much encroached by the low end value across all the three time periods due to decreased precipitation the very west portion of the mesic region also experiences a decrease in potential woody cover in response to the drying trend it is implied that the semiarid region and the low end in terms of precipitation of the mesic region will be most susceptible to climate change with respect to potential woody cover this result is consistent with the finding by viglizzo et al 2015 that transition between different vegetation types savannas shrublands and forests is more likely to occur in sub humid regions than in high precipitation regions and the transition is more reversible in sub humid regions than in dry regions it is worth noting that the trend of potential woody cover over the three time periods differs between rcp4 5 fig 6a c e and rcp8 5 fig 6b d f as for the starting period 2011 2040 the potential woody cover map under rcp4 5 fig 6a is very similar to that under rcp8 5 fig 6b however while the potential woody cover map changes very slightly during 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 from 2011 2040 under rcp4 5 it changes significantly under rcp8 5 as revealed by fig 6f the current semiarid region the black polygon area will be mostly occupied by the low end potential woody cover value by 2071 2099 under rcp8 5 the different trends highlight the varying effect of different rcps on the potential woody cover of texas savanna in a larger picture this discrepancy stresses the difference that different government policies on greenhouse gas emission can make in the development of our terrestrial ecosystem in the long term qiu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 limitations of this study should be acknowledged firstly a small area in the southwest corner of the study area is missing in fig 6a to f when compared to fig 6g it is because that this small area experiences a decrease in precipitation across all the three time periods which lowers its map below the valid map range of equation 1 secondly we applied the mean annual precipitation of three 30 year periods it is possible that precipitation varies within each 30 year period more dynamics of the potential woody cover could have been reflected if 10 year or 20 year map data were used thirdly mean annual precipitation was used as the proxy of plant water availability in this study to model potential woody cover it has to be noted that besides precipitation the actual soil moisture levels are also affected by other factors such as evapotranspiration and runoff to different degrees rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 nonetheless mean annual precipitation provides the best available means to assess the potential woody cover pattern given the lack of large scale soil moisture data good and caylor 2011 lastly the relationship between potential woody cover and mean annual precipitation was originally modeled with gompertz function it is possible that very slight difference in the potential woody cover pattern could be observed if other more complex functions were used in conclusion texas savanna will experience a decrease in potential woody cover in the semiarid region and west part of the mesic region and consequently undergo a decrease in carbon storage capacity due to the drying trend of the 21st century this trend may relieve the severity of woody plant encroachment in the semiarid and mesic regions to some extent while highlighting the huge effect climate change can impose on savanna ecosystems this study also underscores the necessity of appropriate government policies on greenhouse gas emission credit authorship contribution statement xuebin

24811,this paper investigates the impacts from natural gas development hunting and cattle grazing on a typical western u s rangeland ecosystem using a general equilibrium model that describes ecosystem dynamics the study area is located in the region surrounding the atlantic rim natural gas project in southern central wyoming and analyzes the population densities of various species net hunting benefits cattle profits and existence value of sage grouse the general equilibrium model analyzes the responses of six animal species two plant species and accounts for differences in prey scarcity inside and outside the disturbed areas around the wells the differences in scarcity arise from sage grouse mule deer and elk experiencing stress in the disturbed areas and the changes in foraging behavior from the rest of the species the simulations highlight the advantage of a general equilibrium ecosystem model because it is capable of capturing the complex changes that occur between plant and animal species when natural gas development reduces the habitat of vulnerable species for the study area the present value loss in ecosystem services is 58 40 million or 2 796 per ha but could vary between 0 12 and 81 67 million depending on the size of the disturbed area and coordination of government agencies keywords ecosystem modelling sage brush ecosystem biodiversity habitat loss energy development ecosystem services 1 introduction natural gas development ngd in the u s is proceeding at a rapid pace to meet the increasing national and international demand for energy needed to fuel economic activities u s production increased from 23 5 trillion cubic feet tcf in 2005 to 32 5 tcf in 2016 and the main reason for this growth was the shale gas revolution comprising a combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing joskow 2013 mason and roberts 2018 in colorado and wyoming the two largest producing states in the intermountain west the number of natural gas wells increased fivefold from the mid 1990s to 2017 u s energy information administration 2018 while the benefits of ngd are fairly well understood and measurable gillingham and huang 2019 as are the economic costs of procuring the natural gas chermak and patrick 1995 the costs to ecosystems that ngd generates are more nebulous and difficult to measure naugle 2011 brady et al 2015 these latter costs are a type of externality that is a cost external to the marketplace that negatively impacts people who receive no compensation for their loss specifically in the ngd case there are ecosystem externalities crocker and tschirhart 1992 that occur when ngd alters the equilibrium of an ecosystem and diminishes the ecosystem services provided the objective of this research is to build an ecological model that quantifies how ngd impacts important ecosystem services and how economic activities affect each other the model tracks over time the populations of seven native species in a sagebrush ecosystem in the intermountain west we choose to focus on three services provided by the ecosystem in the form of cattle bovidae gray 1821 grazing existence value of the greater sage grouse centrocercus urophasianus bonaparte 1827 and hunting of elk cervus elaphus canadensis erxleben 1777 mule deer odocoileus hemionus rafinesque 1817 and pronghorn antilocapra americana ord 1815 a steady state of this system previous to ngd disturbances is determined based on historic levels of grazing and hunting then ngd is introduced which allows us to estimate changes in the ecosystem services based on how ngd alters the native species populations which in turn alters the grazing and hunting opportunities while some species will experience immediate habitat loss from ngd the long run impacts on populations will depend on the complex interactions between plant and animal species estes et al 1998 in the model these interactions include predator prey e g elk grass foraging and competitive realtionships e g pronghorn and jackrabbits foraging on shrubs among the native species in addition to ungulate competition with cattle ngd infrastructure includes well pads gathering pipelines roads and structures although we focus exclusively on areas surrounding well pads the impact on species populations is measured in the model by considering their relative abundance in areas disturbed or undisturbed by ngd studies indicate that species such as the sage grouse elk and mule deer avoid natural gas wells and the areas surrounding them e g walker et al 2007 doherty et al 2008 to include this effect we assume that some species experience energy losses due to stress from foraging close to the wells species populations are then affected over time in complicated ways because of differential forage and prey availability between disturbed areas and undisturbed areas our approach tracks how differing changes in prey forage availability across areas impacts the accumulation of individual organisms net energies biomass consumptions predation rates natural death rates and birth rates the combination of these impacts provides a prediction of how ngd affects an ecosystem and the associated services northrup and wittemyer 2013 reviewed the literature on the ecological ramifications of the disturbances caused by development of alternative and unconventional sources of energy they advocate that future studies should take a comprehensive approach incorporating a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between development caused impacts and species ecology that will enable effective mitigation p 112 this type of comprehensive approach employing an integrated ecological model is the primary contribution of our paper our simulation results show that the introduction of ngd into a rangeland ecosystem generally has negative effects on the population of some species other than the ones directly affected by ngd although these effects can be mitigated to some extent by adjusting the intensity of other human disturbance such as cattle grazing and hunting 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the atlantic rim natural gas arng development project in carbon county wyoming the arng in the south central part of the state covers 109 339 ha that is 64 federal 31 private and 5 state owned arng development is within the sagebrush steppe ecosystem that covers about 43 million ha in eleven western states and one canadian province rowland et al 2010 according to the u s bureau of land management u s bureau of land management 2007 the arng is home to 338 recorded species of wildlife and it provides ecosystem services both to ranchers who graze cattle on public land managed by blm and to elk mule deer and pronghorn hunters we chose the arng because the development represents a large sudden shock to a rangeland ecosystem and the blm 2007 produced an environmental impact statement eis that provides an additional source of information regarding the project and relevant ecosystem the arng project develops coalbed methane natural gas which is considered an unconventional form of natural gas that is deposited in coal seams the natural gas is reached with vertical and horizontal drilling and for some wells in arng hydraulic fracturing is necessary warren resources inc annual report 2014 the arng development started in 1998 it consisted of 627 natural gas wells during 2005 2010 but it is scheduled to contain up to 2 000 wells that will be operated by multiple companies throughout the 30 50 year life of the project u s bureau of land management 2007 even at historically low current natural gas prices the project is predicted to generate approximately 1 35 trillion ft3 of natural gas over its lifetime annual u s consumption of natural gas was about 27 trillion ft3 in 2017 u s bureau of land management 2007 the arng is not only disturbed by ngd the region is also under constant pressure from other types of human activities such as transmission lines roads and housing hanser et al 2011 p 24 however we focus on ngd because it represents a substantial relatively sudden disturbance to the rangeland ecosystem 2 2 ngd affects species in different ways for example roads built because of natural gas extraction affect sage grouse more directly declines in lek attendance were positively correlated with vehicle traffic levels and vehicular activity during the daily strutting period on roads within 1 3km of a lek reducing overall traffic volumes and isolating traffic disturbance within gas fields could reduce road effects holloran 2005 in 2007 both the national and the wyoming wildlife federations appealed blm s arng management plan claiming that the plan did not adequately protect species in the region and adversely impacts ecosystem services such as hunting fishing and wildlife viewing nwf 2007 the appeal was dismissed although in 2012 both groups again appealed claiming blm did not consider new environmental information and impacts on recreational opportunities the outcome of this appeal is pending warren resources inc annual report 2014 2 2 ecological model the food web for arng is limited to seven native species and one non native species cattle as shown in figure 1 there are two trophic levels with two plants comprising the first trophic level and six herbivores the second the relationships in the food web are modeled using the general equilibrium ecosystem model geem tschirhart 2000 the basic premise behind geem is that ecosystem properties and species populations in particular are ultimately determined by individual organisms behaviors therefore population updating equations should be derived from individual behaviors geem accomplishes this by assuming species individuals are energy optimizers similar to optimal foraging theory and the results of the optimization problems are used to construct population updating equations abrams 1999 pointed out that most studies employing optimum foraging ignore population dynamics and most studies of population dynamics ignore optimum foraging geem is an attempt to bridge the gap by showing that multiple optimal foragers can interact in a single model that yields reasonable and consistent results for other applications of geem see finnoff and tschirhart 2009 kim et al 2007 tschirhart 2004 the geem has four main components individuals net energy functions r first order conditions for maximizing net energy focs predator prey biomass balance equations mb and population updating equations each component is described next 2 2 1 individuals net energy functions in general in geem the sun is the source of all energy and solar energy is converted to biomass by the two groups of primary producers grass and shrubs there is a fixed amount of land available where plants compete for light acquire essential macronutrients such as nitrogen grow and reproduce the animals in the food web consume plants and other animals thus solar energy enters the system through the plants and indirectly to the animals through herbivore foraging and predator prey relationships all solar energy entering the ecosystem is accounted for as energy leaving the system through respiration or as energy stored in the plants and animals tschirhart 2000 predation risk is incorporated in the prey net energy objective functions because it has been shown to be important in sage brush ecosystems gude et al 2006 each species i i 1 8 is comprised of ni identical individuals that act as if they maximize the accumulation of net energy ri in every time period t plants choose their biomass accumulation via photosynthesis animals choose their biomass consumption via grazing or predation a general form for the net energy measured in kcal that an individual of species i accumulates is 1 r i e e x y i e x r i x d i e x β i where e kcal kg is either the set of energy expenditure prices for an animal preying on another animal or plant or the energy expenditure price for a plant preying on the sun e kcal kg is the set of the energy expenditure prices paid by the predators of species i and x kg is the set of biomass consumptions by an animal or biomass growth of a plant the functions in 1 represent inflows or outflows of energy y i is the energy gain from predation or photosynthesis r i is the energy loss from variable respiration d i is the energy loss from predation and predation risk and finally βi is the basal metabolic rate which is the fixed cost of energy each animal and plant maximizes net energy by balancing the gains and losses of biomass consumption animal gains come from energy embodied in the animal or plant biomass consumed and the losses come from paying the energy prices from predation avoidance and from respiration that includes territory defense locomotion feces and reproduction plant gains come from growing photosynthetic biomass and their losses come from respiration animal foraging and the energy lost by growing photosynthetic biomass 2 2 2 specific individuals net energy function foc and mass balance by way of example the net energy functions for an individual jackrabbit i j r and an individual grass species i g r are presented in 2 and 3 respectively the two letter indices in 2 4 are from fig 1 2 r j r e e x e g r e j r g r x j r g r e s h e j r s h x j r s h x j r g r x j r s h 0 5 x j r g r 2 x j r s h 2 x j r g r x j r s h r j r β j r 3 r g r e e x i s u s e l g r l ξ x g r s g r r g r x g r 2 1 p g r e e l g r g e l g r 1 p g r e j r g r g j r g r 1 p g r e c a g r g c a g r e g r x g r 0 5 β g r where 4 se l g r l 1 exp k g r l i su and 5 l 1 a n s h x s h s s h n g r x g r s g r in 2 the first and second terms are the jackrabbit s incoming energy from consuming grass and shrub respectively the total energy gained from grass is equal to the energy contained in each kg of grass egr times the kg of grass consumed x jr gr the energy loss from foraging on grass is the energy expenditure price times the kg of grass consumed e jr gr x jr gr thus the first term is the jackrabbit s net energy income from consuming grass the second term is similar for the jackrabbit consuming shrub following gurney and nisbet 1998 jackrabbit or other animal species respiration is divided into two parts a variable part in the third term that depends on biomass consumption and a fixed part in the last term that is resting metabolic rate 3 3 temperature and animal age are omitted from the metabolic rate but will be addressed in future research the form of the variable respiration function implies that greater consumption yields greater respiration loss which follows because animals that forage or hunt more use more energy in territory defense locomotion feces and reproduction the two variable respiration terms have a quadratic form which allows for specializing in one prey or continuously substituting between prey which is more likely baalen et al 2001 the net energy for a grass individual in 3 is similar to the jackrabbit net energy in 2 the second term and last term are respectively a quadratic form for variable respiration and a constant term for basal metabolism the third represents the grass energy losses to its three foragers elk jackrabbit and cattle however the incoming energy given by the first term in 3 differs from the jackrabbit because plants derive their energy directly from the sun in the first term i su is the is the annual intensity of the sun s energy per square meter 4 4 according to the water resources data 2008 the solar insolation annual average for wyoming is in between 5 1 and 5 5 kwh m2 day or 1 664 486 kcal m2 year starting with the solar spectrum falling on a leaf 47 is lost due to photons outside the active region chlorophyll utilizes photons between 400 and 700 nm 30 is lost due to incomplete absorption or absorption by components other than chloroplasts and 24 is lost due to conversion of excitation energy at 700 nm to chemical energy of d glucose 16 p 4 therefore the sun intensity is 1 664 486 1 0 3 1 0 47 1 0 24 469 318 kcal m2 year ξ is a parameter that measures the percentage of energy that is effectively converted to glucose xgr is the biomass kg that the individual grows and sgr is the ground area m2 that grass photosythetic biomass shades per kg the term sel gr l in the first term of 3 is the shading energy loss that is comparable to the energy prices paid by animals to capture prey although here it is the energy price paid by the plant for growing more biomass the third term in 3 is the energy that an individual grass loses to predation by elk jackrabbits and cattle this loss consists of the energy in the grass biomass lost to grazers plus the energy lost in avoiding predation the former loss is interpreted as an average loss over all grass individuals the term e g r x g r 0 5 g j r g r is the energy content of a kg of grass biomass egr multiplied by the average biomass lost to predation x g r 0 5 g j r g r the g jr gr is a parameter that measures the rate at which an individual grass supplies biomass to a jackrabbit and the functional form of the biomass loss is consistent with satisfying the second order conditions for maximizing 2 tschirhart 2000 the parenthetical expression in the third term of 2 represents the energy lost in avoiding predation such as defense mechanisms or escaping for example some plants produce noxious odors or repellent tastes to discourage predators the more effort a predator must employ in the hunt the more energy the prey must use avoiding being captured the function form for this energy loss is assumed to be linear in the energy price paid by the predator p g r e j r g r p g r e j r g r where pgr is a parameter that measures predation risk lima 1998 the energy gain of plants increases with the surface of their photosynthetic biomass but decreases with the shade created by their own leaves and the leaves of other plants therefore the space occupied by all the leaves imposes a cost on each individual plant this explains why the population and biomass accumulation of one plant species can affect other plant species the sel is given in 4 and it is a function of the leaf area index l given in 5 the surface area occupied by the leaves of an individual grass is xgrsgr the leaf area index sums these individul areas over all shrub and grass individuals in 5 by multiplying the individuals areas by the shrub and grass populations and dividing the result by a the area of arng the leaf area index is a measure of the density of all plants the higher lower the proportion of land used by plants the higher lower the sel energy price paid by the plants for accumulating biomass the energy available for absorption per m2 of photosythetic biomass will depend on the orientation of the biomass therefore the leaf area index is multiplied by a species specific extinction coefficient ki to account for the inclination of biomass surface area finally the sun s intensity minus the loss of energy to shading is mutlitplied by ξ 32 to account for the efficient conversion of atp and nadph to d glucose hall and rao 1999 p 4 each individual acts as if it maximizes the net energy accumulated over a defined time period which reflects the idea that the evolution of species must lead to an efficient use of energy pennycuick 1979 yun et al 2006 optimization is a useful way of modeling efficient energy use the first order conditions focs for optimization require setting to zero the derivatives of each species individual s net energy function with respect to the individuals choice variables for the jackrabbit presented above the choice variables are the biomass consumptions x jr gr and x jr sh and for the grass the choice variable is the biomass growth xgr for example the foc for jackrabbit consumption of grass is given by 6 r j r e e x x j r g r e g r e j r g r 1 x j r g r 0 5 x j r s h r j r 0 equation 6 indicates that at the optimum the marginal benefit of consuming a kg of grass must equal its marginal cost the first term is the jackrabbits s energy income from consuming a kg of grass it is equal to two marginal losses from consuming the kg paying the energy price second term and the marginal respiration loss third term if jackrabbit had any predator then the marginal loss from being preyed on which includes predation risk should also be considered the focs provide the biomasses consumed by individual animals and summing over all individuals in a species provides the species biomasses consumed to ensure mass balance in the model it must be the case that the biomass consumed by one species must equal the biomass given up by the species consumed therefore a mass balance equation is required for each demand supply relationship between a predator and prey or grazer and plant equation 7 illustrates this category of equations for jackrabbit consumption of grass 7 n j r x j r s h n s h x s h 0 5 g j r s h in the simulations the focs and the mass balance equations are solved for the biomass consumptions and the energy expenditures or prices there are 9 focs 2 for plants and 7 for herbivores which includes cattle discussed below and 7 mass balance equations 3 for grass eaters and 4 for shrub eaters essentially there is one equation for every solid arrow in fig 1 except for the arrows that connect plants and the sun 5 5 we assume that plants behave as if they are taking account of how their choice of biomass impacts overall shading self shading equilibrium see finnoff and tschirhart 2009 for more details the calculated biomasses and energy prices constitute a general equilibrium which is defined as a state of the ecosystem when all individuals are maximizing their net energy and mass balance holds over all species interactions a general equilibrium holds in each period but this does not imply a steady state in which populations are unchanging over time 2 2 3 population updating after a general equilibrium is calculated in each period the resulting biomass and price values are used to update populations species updates are based on annual energy accumulations of the average individuals and on predation and death rates increasing decreasing populations correspond to positive negative individual net energy if all populations are unchanging over time then a steady state is said to be obtained 6 6 the time step for geem is one year this matches the reproductive cycle of the vertebrates but we acknowledge that it is likely coarser than the processes for biomass accumulation of plants and leaf area index growth in steady state the net energy for all the species is equal to zero except for cattle as explained below steady state implies that the average individual has accumulated exactly the necessary amount of energy to locate its prey realize the activities related to respiration avoid being hunted expend its metabolic rate and reproduce such that the deaths of old age natural death and predation are exactly offset by births after a perturbation the general equilibrium biomass and energy price values change which drive new population changes if not in steady state there are forces that tend to move the system to a new steady state for example suppose that following a perturbation that individuals in a species have high optimum ri then they will have high birth rates and the species population will increase in subsequent periods but high birth rates for a species will create more intraspecific competition and higher energy prices thereby decreasing individual s optimum ri and decreasing the population thus the impact of the initial pertubation is dampened by countervailing adjustments in the energy prices and eventually individuals will move toward zero ri and a new steady state the speed at which a new steady state is attained largely depends on the magnitude of the perturbation and on the responsiveness of plants positive or zero prices follow from applying kuhn tucker analysis to the general equilibrium optimization problem see tschirhart 2012 for more detail formally we have the following definitions of competition that will be applicable below in the results defn 1 if the solution to the general equilibrium yields n j r x j r g r n g r x g r 0 5 g j r g r then e j r g r 0 and there is said to be no competition among jackrabbit for grass defn 2 if e jr gr 0 then n j r x j r g r n g r x g r 0 5 g j r g r and there is said to be competition among jackrabbit for grass that is increasing in e jr gr the predation rate per capita for species i in the absence of satiation is 8 pr d i e 1 w i k k n k g k i x k i 0 5 n i where e e k i k k wi is the average individual s weight and k is the set of all predators of species i with satiation the willingness to supply biomass g k i x k i 0 5 becomes the biomass demanded by the satiated predator and it will be less than what the prey is actually willing to supply based on its own optimization problem in that case the term in the summation in 8 for satiated prey k is n k x k i n i the natural death rate per capita is the percentage of the species population that was not preyed upon during the current period and has lived an average lifespan the average lifespan of an individual from the species i is denoted by li if we assume that each species is divided into li identically aged groups the groups have the same number of individuals and the preyed upon individuals are evenly distributed among the groups then the death mortality rate per capita of species i is 9 dt h i e pr d i e 1 pr d i e l i l i the birth rate per capita depends on the amount of energy allocated to reproduction we assume that the energy used for reproduction is a fixed portion of the sum of respiration and any additional energy accumulated during the relevant period if at the undisturbed steady state the net energy is equal to zero and the birth rate is equal to the death rate then the birthrate per capita of species i is bt h i e e x dt h i e i ss r i e e x r i x r i x i ss 10 r i e e x y i e x r i x d i e β i where d i e e k i k k e i k k 1 t i e k i n i n k x k i since the relevant net energy accounts for actual supply of biomass and not the willingness to supply it also the ss superscript indicates the biomass accumulation biomass consumptions or energy expenditure prices are annual and unchanging finally the growth rate per capita gth of species i is the birth rate minus the death rate or 11 gt h i e e x dt h i e i ss r i e e x r i x r i x i ss pr d i e i 1 pr d i e i l i l i 2 3 ecosystem data and calibration in the calibration we assume that the biomass accumulations biomass consumptions and population densities depict an arng ecosystem in a scenario without ngd this is a strong assumption because the data obtained are contaminated by human disturbances however much of our data comes from sources where the data were collected before major development in the arng data were obtained for plant and animal populations ni plant biomasses xi and animal biomass consumptions xi j energy content per unit of biomass ej basal metabolisms βi plant and animal weights wi lifespans li predation risks pi solar intensity i su and plant extinction parameters ki these data and their sources are provided in table 1 of the supplementary information section calibration is used to obtain parameter values that are not available in the literature these include initial energy expenditure prices seli e i j respiration function terms ri and parameters in the willingness to supply functions g k i in the calibration there are two net energy ri equations for plant species and five net energy equations for animals plus an equation that defines the average annual weight gain w once cattle is introduced to the ecosystem these equations are all set to zero to be consistent with a steady state there is very limited information in the literature for how much energy prey species use to avoid predation for plants it was possible to define a value for pi that would fit reasonable assumptions see the appendix of finnoff et al 2008 in 12 non green biomass respiration of plant species is 39 of total incoming energy 12 0 39 exp k i n gr ss x gr ss s gr n sh ss x sh ss s sh 109339 ξ i su s i x i ss β i which follows from considering that the percent of carbohydrates produced in photosynthesis consumed in non green respiration for slow growing grass species is 16 by roots and 25 by shoots lambers et al 2006 7 7 this yields 16 16 25 39 for the non green biomass this adds conditions to the calibration and allows solutions for the predation risk of plants 2 4 plant competition and nitrogen subject to caveats the resource ratio hypothesis states that the number of competing plant species can be no greater than the number of limiting resources tilman 1985 miller et al 2005 geem is consistent with the resource ratio hypothesis finnoff and tschirhart 2009 because there are two plant species in the arng model nitrogen is introduced as a second resource to allow coexistence of the plant species the availability of nitrogen is the primary factor limiting plant growth in many ecosystems chapin et al 1986 tilman et al 1996 and in a prairie system the competition between grasses and shrubs is strongest for nitrogen köchy and wilson 2000 in the model there is a restriction that limits how much nitrogen can be absorbed from divergent layers of soil according to the grass versus shrub root structures and biomass accumulations this absorption of nitrogen then regulates plant growth and biomass accumulation the details on how nitrogen enters the model and how the plants compete for it are in the supplementary information section 2 5 ecosystem services grazing and hunting the seven native arng species use a portion of their energy to reproduce and when prey or forage is abundant these species expend less energy and reproduce at a greater rate cattle however are assumed to use their acquired energy to gain weight rather than reproduce the net energy of cattle must be positive at the steady state because ranchers will introduce cattle only if they gain weight that is their net energy is positive therefore to complete the calibration some assumptions regarding the profitability of grazing cattle are needed ranchers are assumed to employ a stocker operation where they acquire young adult steers or heifers and graze them for one season before they are sent to market since much of this grazing occurs on public land under grazing permits the density of cattle on the rangeland ecosystem is at least in part under the control of the blm following the literature a stocking rate for steers or heifers of 0 22 0 57 0 90 per ha is considered low heavy very heavy density derner and hart 2007 jablonski et al 2018 for the arng density according to the eis there are 31 relevant blm grazing allotments in the arng and the surrounding area which allows for a total of 39 695 animal unit months aums assuming the number of aums inside the arng is proportional to its acreage yields 21 135 aums also assuming each animal is allowed to graze five months implies a total of 4 227 individual steers and heifers since there are 109 297 ha in the arng the estimated grazing density is 4 227 109 297 0 0387 animals per hectare this density is lower than what the literature considers low density but many of those studies refer to more fertile land and dense grass cattle consume only grass as shown in fig 1 which puts them in direct competition with the native grass eaters we assume that a new steady state occurs after cattle are introduced to the ecosystem where indidivuals consume enough grass biomass to gain 180 kg of additional weight by the end of the stocking season if the initial weight is 247 kg and cattle consume about 1 2 kg per day during an average stocking season of 150 days i e about five months the weight of each individual at the end of the stocking season is 427 kg the consumed energy of an individual stocker can be converted to an average annual weight gain w in kg with the formula national research council 2000 13 w r ca 182 5 0 956 r ca 182 5 1000 0 0635 0 891 w b 0 75 1 1 097 where r ca is the net energy in kcal for each individual stocker over a grazing season and wb is the average weight when introduced into the ecosystem the weight gain cannot be less than zero in the calibration of the model we assume that ranchers introduce 4 227 individuals and after the ecosystem reaches a steady state each individual consumes 1 326 kg of grass biomass 8 8 weights of stocked cattle vary we use typical weights of 247 kg per stocked feeder calf and 427 kg market weight at the end of the stocking season based on derner et al 2008 according to hironaka and freeze 1992 one animal unit requires 11 8 kg of dry matter per day per 450 kg of body weight this was adjusted for the different weights and summed over 150 days by using these values and solving for r ca in equation 13 every individual stocker is able to accumulate 620 801 kcal within a year to meet the goal weight the following equation to calculate the profit per period for cattle ranchers πca has been proposed in previous research on cattle grazing activities hussain and tschirhart 2013 14 π ca w r ca w b p f w b p b n ca where n ca is the population of cattle introduced to the ecosystem pf is the price per kg for a stocker at the end of the period and pb is the price per kg for a stocker at the beginning of the period the total weight of an individual stocker at the end of the period is the sum of the initial weight plus the weight gained and therefore the total benefit of grazing cattle is the total weight times the final price the economic cost of cattle grazing is the weight of the individual stocker at the beginning of the period multiplied by the input price the total arng ranching profit is the number of cattle introduced times the profit per individual neither the w nor the profits can be negative since equation 13 does not allow negative net energy values introducing cattle requires including another r equation its corresponding focs and a mb equation once geem is calibrated to be consistent with the nitrogen restriction and the natural rangeland ecosystem first cattle are introduced and once a new steady state occurs then hunting is introduced hunting is modeled as a percentage reduction of the elk pronghorn and mule deer populations at the end of each period the percentage or hunting rate is fixed but the number of harvested animals varies over time to calibrate geem for recent hunting rates we collected 2014 data from published wyoming game and fish department wgfd harvest reports wyoming game and fish department 2014 the hunting areas or units intersect with the arng region but none falls entirely inside we calculated the percentage of each unit that falls inside the arng region and then assumed that the same percentage of elk pronghorn and mule deer from the total animals hunted were harvested inside the arng region the population of the hunted species sh during period t 1 is 15 n i t 1 1 gt h i e i e i x i n i t h i t 1 where n i t is the population of the hunted species i at the end of period t and h i t 1 is the number of individuals hunted from the species i during period t 1 the estimation of hunting net benefits πhu is based on previous research that uses geem and calculates the value of the ecosystem services hussain and tschirhart 2013 we adapted the net benefits by making the cost of hunting a function of the total number of hunters 16 π hu i sh m i v n i h i τ h i h i v n i c i sh τ h i where hi is the number of individuals animals harvested from species i and mi is the meat value of an animal the function τ is the total number of hunters or hunter congestion that is increasing in hi that is τ h 0 and c τ 64 τ 0 9 is the cost function for hunting trips the number of hunters τ hi and the harvest hi are not equal because not all hunters are successful i e to hunt hi animals more than hi hunting licenses must be issued also the function v n 4200 n 0 8 3 5 n 1 6 represents the value of the trip itself regardless of sucessful hunting where the hunters experience a benefit from observing wildlife during the trip as a result the value of the trip increases whenever the population of wildlife increases v n 0 because the trip includes various subjective or non pecuniary benefits enjoyed on a hunting trip the formulation in 16 shows that meat value is enjoyed only for a successful hunter but the trip value is enjoyed by all hunters we used the same functions described in hussain and tschirhart 2013 except for the function τ h i we use 17 τ h i h i s r i where sr i is the success rate for hunting the hunted species i 9 9 for example if the success rate of elk is 50 then 100 hunting licenses must be issued in order to have 50 successfully hunted elk τ 50 50 0 5 100 the average success rate and the hunting rates used for elk pronghorn and mule deer during the simulations are presented in the supplemental information section 2 6 energy development and disturbed areas previous research has found that various species avoid natural gas wells but the magnitude of the impact depends on the intensity of the development the affected species and the season kauffman et al 2018 a study of the powder river basin in wyoming and montana shows that coalbed methane natural gas development has a negative impact on sage grouse leks with the disturbed region ranging somewhere between 0 8 km and 3 2 km from the wells walker et al 2007 doherty et al 2008 estimate that sage grouse were 1 3 times less likely to occupy sagebrush habitat in a 4 km2 area around coalbed methane natural gas wells equivalent to a circle with radius of 1 13 km similarly studies suggest that elk and mule deer avoid oil and gas development areas hebblewhite 2011 in particular elk avoided areas within 2 km of major roads and active gas oil wells during the summer and 1 km during winter powell 2003 and mule deer have a higher probability to avoid areas up to 3 7 km from gas development sawyer et al 2006 however van dyke et al 2012 show that elk in particular are capable of modifying their behavior in response to habitat disturbances if they can find alternative routes where forage is sufficiently abundant to account for the impact of ngd we assume that elk mule deer and sage grouse experience stress whenever they forage inside the areas surrounding the natural gas well which are labelled disturbed areas das stress is included in the model by assuming that the animals lose energy depending on how much time they spend foraging in the das if biomass consumption occurs in the the undisturbed area ua no additional losses are experienced by the animal 10 10 for example the energy that elk el gain from grazing upon grass at the ua are e g r e e l g r u a x e l g r u a while the losses at the da3 are e g r x e l g r d a 3 δ d a 3 where δ da3 is a parameter that measures sensitivity to ngd in da3 if δ d a 3 1 elk would not gain any energy by grazing in da3 because the stress is at its highest value conversely if δ d a 3 0 elk would not experience any stress by grazing in da3 there are three das in total the first da is located within a radius of 500 m around all well pads meanwhile the second da is located between 500 and 1 000 m from the closest well pad and the third one is located between 1 000 m and 1 500 m the area outside the das is labelled ua based on the evidence above we assume that elk are less sensitive to ngd therefore they experience the lowest levels of stress when exposed to ngd in each da meanwhile the mule deer are the most sensitive to ngd finally sage grouse are not as affected as mule deer but more affected than elk 11 11 in our baseline scenario we assumed that elk experience some stress 0 2 in the da3 experience stress at a sensitivity of 0 5 in the da2 and 0 8 in the da1 sage grouse experience stress at the level of 0 25 0 55 and 0 85 in das 3 2 and 1 respectively finally mule deer experience stress at the level of 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 in das 3 2 and 1 respectively all other species in the rangeland ecosystem forage in the das and ua without experiencing any stress a simple schematic of habitat loss and ngd stress is shown in fig 2 fig 3 shows the location of the active natural gas wells in 2010 and the total da in the arng region from 1980 to 2010 assuming the three different radii around each well fig 4 shows the number of wells that were active in each year from 1980 to 2010 although the number of wells has generally been growing it started increasing sharply in 1998 for tractability we assume that all gas wells new since 1999 are assumed to be introduced simultaneously absent this assumption all the das in the model would need to be indexed by their age given the das the total affected area is equal to 20 889 ha or 19 of the arng area 12 12 the total unaffected area is 88 408 ha the total affected area is comprised of 10 193 ha for the da1 that produces the highest stress on the affected species 5 187 ha for the da2 that produces a moderate stress and 5 509 ha for the da3 that produces the lowest stress interestingly the maximum allowable da in the eis is significantly smaller u s bureau of land management 2007 but the eis only considered actual cleared habitat and not the avoided area around gas wells the eis plan calls for active reclamation that would stabilize disturbed soils and vegetation communities while allowing for no more than 3 075 ha of total da 3 of the total arng area at any time 3 results given the lack of complete ecological and economic data for the arng region the model is calibrated using ecological parameters economic parameters and functional forms that are sometimes imprecise therefore we quantify the inherent uncertainty in the model s predictions by undertaking a thorough sensitivity analysis whereby the parameter values are varied up and down by a fixed percentage the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in the supplementary information section and will be discussed in more detail below fig 5 shows the simulated time paths for plant biomasses and animal populations for various combinations of disturbances the top panel of fig 5 shows the time paths for four scenarios before ngd in the first scenario the ecosystem starts at the natural undisturbed steady state then cattle grazing is introduced for scenarios 2 and 4 once the system settles down to a new post ranching steady state hunting is introduced for scenarios 3 and 4 in the bottom panel of fig 5 the simulations continue and ngd is introduced starting at the post disturbance steady states from the four scenarios in the top panel of fig 5 we discuss the simulations results below 3 1 responses to hunting in geem as expected the introduction of elk pronghorn and mule deer hunting immediately increases the amount of forage available for surviving individual herbivores hunting also indirectly impacts plants consider grass first with fewer elk after hunting the population of grass increases for both cattle grazing and cattle grazing hunting scenarios however nitrogen limits the total biomass of grass such that a new steady state is attained with a larger population of smaller plants as shown in the supplementary information bai et al 2012 meanwhile even though there are fewer pronghorn and mule deer the population of shrubs decreases the energy price shrubs expend to grow biomass increases because of interspecies competition fueled by the higher total biomass of grass this in turn leads to a smaller population of smaller shrubs even though both plant species experience less pressure from herbivores grass partially displaces shrubs this follows because after hunting total elk consumption individual consumption times population of grass biomass as a percent of total grass biomass decreases whereas total deer plus pronghorn consumption of shrub biomass as a percent of total shrub biomass increases after the initial responses from hunting grass and shrub populations converge slowly to a new post hunting steady state the impact on non hunted species depends on their plant consumption and whether they have competitive relationships with other animals for example removing elk benefits cattle by lowering inter specific competition because removal lowers the energy price cattle pay for grass the effect on sage grouse is particularly interesting since their population decreases even though this species is not hunted this negative impact on sage grouse occurs because elk hunting releases more foraging pressure on grass than pronghorn and mule deer hunting on shrubs which is the primary food source of sage grouse this result would not hold if only elk were hunted interactions between the forage consumption patterns of ungulates and their interactions with other key species such as cattle have been studied by authors such as hobbs et al 1996 who found that higher elk density lowers forage intake by cattle through competitive effects the combination of cattle grazing and hunting results in completely different population dynamics if only hunting is considered but no cattle grazing the sage grouse population is slightly lower than the undisturbed scenario if only cattle grazing is considered the sage grouse population is significantly higher than at the undisturbed scenario when both economic activities are considered the sage grouse population is higher than in the undisturbed case but lower than when only cattle grazing is modeled 3 2 predicted ecological impacts of ngd plants are affected by ngd because the mix of herbivores that consume them differ between the ua and das in particular elk mule deer and sage grouse are less willing to forage in the das the populations of the directly affected species will initially decline because they gather less energy in the relatively more congested ua but this impact can be partially reversed if the forage availability redistribution favors them other herbivores will choose to forage relatively more heavily inside the da after ngd due to less inter specific competition this result can be seen in the general equilibrium calculations pre and post ngd as discussed in section 2 above to attain an ecosystem general equilibrium in each period an individual herbivore s marginal energy gains inside the da and the ua must be equal this follows because if a herbivore enjoyed greater energy gain in the da for example it would switch to more da grazing which would increase the da s energy price and lower the ua s energy price this behavior would continue until the energy prices stabilize and the incentive to switch vanishes in effect the effort that it takes for animals to find prey must be equal inside and outside the das and ua which is consistent with the marginal value theorem charnov 1976 stephens and krebs 1986 the negative impact of ngd on the species in the short run can reverse in the long run in the short run the species that experience no stress when foraging close to the well pads are better off for example when ngd is introduced to the ecosystem sage grouse and mule deer significantly reduce their foraging in the das allowing pronghorn and jackrabbits which do not experience stress when foraging in the das to take advantage of the higher abundance of forage near the disturbance this leads to a population increase in pronghorn and jackrabbits and a decline in sage grouse and mule deer however this dynamic is a short term phenomenon and only part of the story in the long run the two plant species will compete for space sunlight and nitrogen with the plant species receiving less pressure from foragers outcompeting the other plant species over time pfeiffer et al 2019 for our calibration shrubs in the da experience relatively less forage pressure than grass and as a result the population of grass in the das eventually declines and the population of shrubs increases until a new steady state is reached the long run population dynamics of introducing ngd can offset some of the damage caused in the short run for example sage grouse choose to forage much less in the das which in turn leads to a decrease in their population depending on which economic activities are considered previous to the introduction of ngd the population of sage grouse may partially recover before reaching a new steady state for our baseline calibration sage grouse populations fluctuate between a loss of 1 4 ngd scenario and 7 7 cattle grazing ngd scenario by comparing pre and post disturbance steady states nevertheless the population of sage grouse can drop as low as 13 1 in the short run cattle grazing ngd scenario the impact of ngd on elk populations fluctuates between a decrease of 13 2 hunting ngd scenario and a decrease of 18 5 cattle grazing ngd scenario positive effects on the populations of directly impacted species are less likely to occur when the sensitivities to ngd are higher these scenarios are explored in the appendix 3 3 impacts on ecosystem services here we calculate the impact of ngd on the value of ecosystem services i e cattle ranching hunting and the existence value of sage grouse in the arng region although sage grouse are only one of many species in the arng ecosystem they are a high profile species that have been repeatedly considered for listing under the u s endangered species act u s fish and wildlife service 2015a the species also receives significant media attention such as the recently publicized plans of the trump administration to ease oil and natural gas drilling restrictions given in the greater sage grouse resource management plan 13 13 https www doi gov sites doi gov files uploads so 3353 pdf the total discounted sum of the values of the ecosystem services tdves is defined as 18 t d v e s lim t t t n g d t π c a t π h u t π s g t 1 r t t n g d where tngd is the time period when ngd is introduced π c a t is the profits of cattle ranching in period t π h u t are the net benefits of hunting π s g t is the existence value of sage grouse and r is the discount rate set at 3 in the simulations in section 2 of the supplementary information we describe in detail the calculations regarding the existence value of sage grouse the animals that are willing to graze close to the well pads are better off in the short run which has an effect on the value of the ecosystem services associated to them fig 6 shows the annual value of the ecosystem services over the same time period and combination of economic activities as used in fig 5 cattle accumulate more net energy by foraging in the less crowded das because elk avoid the well pads and the profits of cattle grazing increase in the short run meanwhile the net benefits of overall hunting decrease because the reduced net benefits of hunting mule deer and elk species that avoid well pads more than compensate the increased net benefits of pronghorn hunting species that are willing to graze close to well pads the net benefits of hunting continue to decrease in the long run the profits of cattle grazing fall in the long run and the existence value of sage grouse recovers from the initial drop the main message from fig 6 is that while ngd leads to a decrease in tdves the size of the total loss and the stakeholder groups that experience losses vary significantly depending on which disturbances and economic activities are modeled 4 discussion previous studies have tended to focus on how ngd affects a narrow set of species such as caribou and elk without analyzing the feedback paths from the rest of the species in the food web sorensen et al 2008 wasser et al 2011 dzialak et al 2011 the advantage of using geem is that a multi species food web can be used to capture the feedback effects and the ecosystem externalities that cattle ranching hunting and ngd impose on each other this is important because policymakers scientists and academics might draw the wrong conclusions about ecosystem management if the models used only consider a small number of species or do not involve the complex feedback mechanisms policymakers could also draw incorrect conclusions or unintentionally misinform the public if they do not fully account for the larger disturbed area caused by ngd when publishing environmenal impact statements u s bureau of land management 2007 as an illustration consider the impacts in fig 6 the profits of cattle ranching are nearly seven times lower if only cattle grazing and ngd are assessed but hunting is not modeled grazing ngd vs grazing hunting ngd scenarios because the positive ecosystem externalities that hunters impose on ranchers are not taken into account similarly if only hunting is considered and the impact of cattle grazing is ignored the geem model estimates lower net benefits of hunting because the positive externality that ranchers impose on hunters is ignored although it is hard to appreciate in fig 6 the ecosystem externalities do not simply stack up the negative impact of ngd may be excerbated or dampened depending upon which economic activities are modelled the pure negative impact of ngd by constrasting the pre and post development sss on the profits of cattle ranching is 0 1 million higher if hunting is ignored and only grazing activities are considered analogously the negative impact of ngd on the net benefits of hunting is 0 02 million lower if cattle grazing is ignored and only hunting activities are considered although these impacts are relatively small for cattle grazing and hunting the negative impact can be much larger depending upon the circumstances in the case of the existence value of sage grouse the negative impact of ngd is 0 83 million when hunting and cattle grazing are considered but it can be as low as 0 11 million if neither hunting nor cattle grazing are considered or as high as 1 09 million if only cattle grazing is considered another advantage of adressing the interactions of cattle grazing hunting and ngd in geem is that it more accurately reflects the long run population dynamics when only ngd is considered without the other disturbances the sage grouse population is predicted to experience a fairly rapid partial recovery after the initial decline which seems at odds with the empirical evidence we highlight two other findings of our research first although ngd provides substantial economic benefits to society it generally harms biodiversity xiao et al 2018 although overall biodiversity falls after ngd it has the potential to create winners and losers in terms of species populations on the one hand species such as sage grouse mule deer and elk that avoid the area around the natural gas wells will lose habitat and experience population declines on the other hand the populations of herbivores that are willing to graze in the das may increase due to reduced forage competition the introduction of ngd also creates winners and losers in terms of ecosystem services but similar to the population dynamics the wins losses can be amplified or reversed depending upon the disturbances modeled and the sensitvity of the species to ngd second there are important ecosystem externalities that hunting and cattle grazing and the agencies that represent them impose on each other given this context it is necessary to promote coordination between these economic agents to reach a social optimum particularly after the introduction of ngd for example a higher elk hunting rate will cause cattle to experience less competition for grass gain more weight and increases the overall value of ecosystem services in terms of biodiversity decreasing the density of cattle will cause grass to become more abundant ameliorating the reduction in the elk population caused by ngd this implies that the energy companies wgfd officials and blm officials can coordinate to generate a management strategy that balances energy production changes in ecosystem services and potential losses in biodiversity crawford et al 2004 show the linkage of habitat and population dynamics of sage grouse by considering factors such as the effects of fire ecology cattle grazing and herbicide based control of big sagebrush they conclude that solving management issues associated with the decline of sage grouse will require cooperation among wildlife biology range science and other professional abilities see section 4 of the supplementary information for a detailed analysis of the possible coordination failures and the opportunites to mitigate the loss of ecosystem serivces and biodiversity our research supports this conclusion we close by mentioning a few caveats to our work first there is substantial uncertainty in some of the calibrated parameters and modeling assumptions we vary parameters related to 1 the sensitivity to ngd of the affected species 2 the availability and plant uptake of nitrogen in the soil layers and 3 the existence value for sage grouse per household in all cases the impact of introducing ngd is negative and measured in terms of the total discounted value of ecosystem services tdves the loss varies between 0 12 and 81 67 million in the baseline scenario 14 14 the lower bound on the loss from ngd is negative and indicates a benefit of ngd in terms of tdves however the number is relatively small approximately 120 000 and the vast majority of the range of estimates indicate a tdves loss from ngd as a reference point the negative impact estimated in our baseline scenario is 58 40 million see section 3 of the supplementary information for further details second there are other factors besides nitrogen and light that restrict plant growth for example we included the role of precipitation in the model as a random variable where plants that are exposed to less than ideal amounts of water experience stress the results from modeling precipitation were not fundamentally different than the results presented here therefore we decided to focus exclusively on nitrogen and sunlight restrictions in this paper and explore the role of precipitation in future research third plants and animals may be impacted by ngd for various reasons for example studies show that sage grouse populations may decline if established leks are abandoned due to increased human or predator activity from the introduction of roads and power lines ellis 1984 lyon and anderson 2003 holloran 2005 kaiser 2006 doherty et al 2008 also our research does not address the carnivore herbivore interactions such as coyotes ferrets and swift foxes and some other herbivores such as grasshoppers and prairie dogs that could play an important role in the sagebrush ecosystem we have observed that plants reactions to disturbances tend to be more pronounced when fewer species are considered another limitation of the model is that it does not explicitly model space or the migration of species over the landscape this is something we are currently working on adding to the geem framework finally in future research we intend to further investigate other modelling assumptions such as those related to boundary issues water as a limiting resource and plant competition for sunlight lastly one of the main advantages of using a model such as geem is that it provides a unified framework for modeling the various interactions within a food web the downside is that like many models it oversimplifies animal and plant behaviors therefore the goal of our research is not to provide precise predictions of how human development impacts an ecosystem but rather to inform government agencies and relevant stakeholder groups at a high level how various economic activities and species interact

24811,this paper investigates the impacts from natural gas development hunting and cattle grazing on a typical western u s rangeland ecosystem using a general equilibrium model that describes ecosystem dynamics the study area is located in the region surrounding the atlantic rim natural gas project in southern central wyoming and analyzes the population densities of various species net hunting benefits cattle profits and existence value of sage grouse the general equilibrium model analyzes the responses of six animal species two plant species and accounts for differences in prey scarcity inside and outside the disturbed areas around the wells the differences in scarcity arise from sage grouse mule deer and elk experiencing stress in the disturbed areas and the changes in foraging behavior from the rest of the species the simulations highlight the advantage of a general equilibrium ecosystem model because it is capable of capturing the complex changes that occur between plant and animal species when natural gas development reduces the habitat of vulnerable species for the study area the present value loss in ecosystem services is 58 40 million or 2 796 per ha but could vary between 0 12 and 81 67 million depending on the size of the disturbed area and coordination of government agencies keywords ecosystem modelling sage brush ecosystem biodiversity habitat loss energy development ecosystem services 1 introduction natural gas development ngd in the u s is proceeding at a rapid pace to meet the increasing national and international demand for energy needed to fuel economic activities u s production increased from 23 5 trillion cubic feet tcf in 2005 to 32 5 tcf in 2016 and the main reason for this growth was the shale gas revolution comprising a combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing joskow 2013 mason and roberts 2018 in colorado and wyoming the two largest producing states in the intermountain west the number of natural gas wells increased fivefold from the mid 1990s to 2017 u s energy information administration 2018 while the benefits of ngd are fairly well understood and measurable gillingham and huang 2019 as are the economic costs of procuring the natural gas chermak and patrick 1995 the costs to ecosystems that ngd generates are more nebulous and difficult to measure naugle 2011 brady et al 2015 these latter costs are a type of externality that is a cost external to the marketplace that negatively impacts people who receive no compensation for their loss specifically in the ngd case there are ecosystem externalities crocker and tschirhart 1992 that occur when ngd alters the equilibrium of an ecosystem and diminishes the ecosystem services provided the objective of this research is to build an ecological model that quantifies how ngd impacts important ecosystem services and how economic activities affect each other the model tracks over time the populations of seven native species in a sagebrush ecosystem in the intermountain west we choose to focus on three services provided by the ecosystem in the form of cattle bovidae gray 1821 grazing existence value of the greater sage grouse centrocercus urophasianus bonaparte 1827 and hunting of elk cervus elaphus canadensis erxleben 1777 mule deer odocoileus hemionus rafinesque 1817 and pronghorn antilocapra americana ord 1815 a steady state of this system previous to ngd disturbances is determined based on historic levels of grazing and hunting then ngd is introduced which allows us to estimate changes in the ecosystem services based on how ngd alters the native species populations which in turn alters the grazing and hunting opportunities while some species will experience immediate habitat loss from ngd the long run impacts on populations will depend on the complex interactions between plant and animal species estes et al 1998 in the model these interactions include predator prey e g elk grass foraging and competitive realtionships e g pronghorn and jackrabbits foraging on shrubs among the native species in addition to ungulate competition with cattle ngd infrastructure includes well pads gathering pipelines roads and structures although we focus exclusively on areas surrounding well pads the impact on species populations is measured in the model by considering their relative abundance in areas disturbed or undisturbed by ngd studies indicate that species such as the sage grouse elk and mule deer avoid natural gas wells and the areas surrounding them e g walker et al 2007 doherty et al 2008 to include this effect we assume that some species experience energy losses due to stress from foraging close to the wells species populations are then affected over time in complicated ways because of differential forage and prey availability between disturbed areas and undisturbed areas our approach tracks how differing changes in prey forage availability across areas impacts the accumulation of individual organisms net energies biomass consumptions predation rates natural death rates and birth rates the combination of these impacts provides a prediction of how ngd affects an ecosystem and the associated services northrup and wittemyer 2013 reviewed the literature on the ecological ramifications of the disturbances caused by development of alternative and unconventional sources of energy they advocate that future studies should take a comprehensive approach incorporating a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between development caused impacts and species ecology that will enable effective mitigation p 112 this type of comprehensive approach employing an integrated ecological model is the primary contribution of our paper our simulation results show that the introduction of ngd into a rangeland ecosystem generally has negative effects on the population of some species other than the ones directly affected by ngd although these effects can be mitigated to some extent by adjusting the intensity of other human disturbance such as cattle grazing and hunting 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the atlantic rim natural gas arng development project in carbon county wyoming the arng in the south central part of the state covers 109 339 ha that is 64 federal 31 private and 5 state owned arng development is within the sagebrush steppe ecosystem that covers about 43 million ha in eleven western states and one canadian province rowland et al 2010 according to the u s bureau of land management u s bureau of land management 2007 the arng is home to 338 recorded species of wildlife and it provides ecosystem services both to ranchers who graze cattle on public land managed by blm and to elk mule deer and pronghorn hunters we chose the arng because the development represents a large sudden shock to a rangeland ecosystem and the blm 2007 produced an environmental impact statement eis that provides an additional source of information regarding the project and relevant ecosystem the arng project develops coalbed methane natural gas which is considered an unconventional form of natural gas that is deposited in coal seams the natural gas is reached with vertical and horizontal drilling and for some wells in arng hydraulic fracturing is necessary warren resources inc annual report 2014 the arng development started in 1998 it consisted of 627 natural gas wells during 2005 2010 but it is scheduled to contain up to 2 000 wells that will be operated by multiple companies throughout the 30 50 year life of the project u s bureau of land management 2007 even at historically low current natural gas prices the project is predicted to generate approximately 1 35 trillion ft3 of natural gas over its lifetime annual u s consumption of natural gas was about 27 trillion ft3 in 2017 u s bureau of land management 2007 the arng is not only disturbed by ngd the region is also under constant pressure from other types of human activities such as transmission lines roads and housing hanser et al 2011 p 24 however we focus on ngd because it represents a substantial relatively sudden disturbance to the rangeland ecosystem 2 2 ngd affects species in different ways for example roads built because of natural gas extraction affect sage grouse more directly declines in lek attendance were positively correlated with vehicle traffic levels and vehicular activity during the daily strutting period on roads within 1 3km of a lek reducing overall traffic volumes and isolating traffic disturbance within gas fields could reduce road effects holloran 2005 in 2007 both the national and the wyoming wildlife federations appealed blm s arng management plan claiming that the plan did not adequately protect species in the region and adversely impacts ecosystem services such as hunting fishing and wildlife viewing nwf 2007 the appeal was dismissed although in 2012 both groups again appealed claiming blm did not consider new environmental information and impacts on recreational opportunities the outcome of this appeal is pending warren resources inc annual report 2014 2 2 ecological model the food web for arng is limited to seven native species and one non native species cattle as shown in figure 1 there are two trophic levels with two plants comprising the first trophic level and six herbivores the second the relationships in the food web are modeled using the general equilibrium ecosystem model geem tschirhart 2000 the basic premise behind geem is that ecosystem properties and species populations in particular are ultimately determined by individual organisms behaviors therefore population updating equations should be derived from individual behaviors geem accomplishes this by assuming species individuals are energy optimizers similar to optimal foraging theory and the results of the optimization problems are used to construct population updating equations abrams 1999 pointed out that most studies employing optimum foraging ignore population dynamics and most studies of population dynamics ignore optimum foraging geem is an attempt to bridge the gap by showing that multiple optimal foragers can interact in a single model that yields reasonable and consistent results for other applications of geem see finnoff and tschirhart 2009 kim et al 2007 tschirhart 2004 the geem has four main components individuals net energy functions r first order conditions for maximizing net energy focs predator prey biomass balance equations mb and population updating equations each component is described next 2 2 1 individuals net energy functions in general in geem the sun is the source of all energy and solar energy is converted to biomass by the two groups of primary producers grass and shrubs there is a fixed amount of land available where plants compete for light acquire essential macronutrients such as nitrogen grow and reproduce the animals in the food web consume plants and other animals thus solar energy enters the system through the plants and indirectly to the animals through herbivore foraging and predator prey relationships all solar energy entering the ecosystem is accounted for as energy leaving the system through respiration or as energy stored in the plants and animals tschirhart 2000 predation risk is incorporated in the prey net energy objective functions because it has been shown to be important in sage brush ecosystems gude et al 2006 each species i i 1 8 is comprised of ni identical individuals that act as if they maximize the accumulation of net energy ri in every time period t plants choose their biomass accumulation via photosynthesis animals choose their biomass consumption via grazing or predation a general form for the net energy measured in kcal that an individual of species i accumulates is 1 r i e e x y i e x r i x d i e x β i where e kcal kg is either the set of energy expenditure prices for an animal preying on another animal or plant or the energy expenditure price for a plant preying on the sun e kcal kg is the set of the energy expenditure prices paid by the predators of species i and x kg is the set of biomass consumptions by an animal or biomass growth of a plant the functions in 1 represent inflows or outflows of energy y i is the energy gain from predation or photosynthesis r i is the energy loss from variable respiration d i is the energy loss from predation and predation risk and finally βi is the basal metabolic rate which is the fixed cost of energy each animal and plant maximizes net energy by balancing the gains and losses of biomass consumption animal gains come from energy embodied in the animal or plant biomass consumed and the losses come from paying the energy prices from predation avoidance and from respiration that includes territory defense locomotion feces and reproduction plant gains come from growing photosynthetic biomass and their losses come from respiration animal foraging and the energy lost by growing photosynthetic biomass 2 2 2 specific individuals net energy function foc and mass balance by way of example the net energy functions for an individual jackrabbit i j r and an individual grass species i g r are presented in 2 and 3 respectively the two letter indices in 2 4 are from fig 1 2 r j r e e x e g r e j r g r x j r g r e s h e j r

incoming energy from consuming grass and shrub respectively the total energy gained from grass is equal to the energy contained in each kg of grass egr times the kg of grass consumed x jr gr the energy loss from foraging on grass is the energy expenditure price times the kg of grass consumed e jr gr x jr gr thus the first term is the jackrabbit s net energy income from consuming grass the second term is similar for the jackrabbit consuming shrub following gurney and nisbet 1998 jackrabbit or other animal species respiration is divided into two parts a variable part in the third term that depends on biomass consumption and a fixed part in the last term that is resting metabolic rate 3 3 temperature and animal age are omitted from the metabolic rate but will be addressed in future research the form of the variable respiration function implies that greater consumption yields greater respiration loss which follows because animals that forage or hunt more use more energy in territory defense locomotion feces and reproduction the two variable respiration terms have a quadratic form which allows for specializing in one prey or continuously substituting between prey which is more likely baalen et al 2001 the net energy for a grass individual in 3 is similar to the jackrabbit net energy in 2 the second term and last term are respectively a quadratic form for variable respiration and a constant term for basal metabolism the third represents the grass energy losses to its three foragers elk jackrabbit and cattle however the incoming energy given by the first term in 3 differs from the jackrabbit because plants derive their energy directly from the sun in the first term i su is the is the annual intensity of the sun s energy per square meter 4 4 according to the water resources data 2008 the solar insolation annual average for wyoming is in between 5 1 and 5 5 kwh m2 day or 1 664 486 kcal m2 year starting with the solar spectrum falling on a leaf 47 is lost due to photons outside the active region chlorophyll utilizes photons between 400 and 700 nm 30 is lost due to incomplete absorption or absorption by components other than chloroplasts and 24 is lost due to conversion of excitation energy at 700 nm to chemical energy of d glucose 16 p 4 therefore the sun intensity is 1 664 486 1 0 3 1 0 47 1 0 24 469 318 kcal m2 year ξ is a parameter that measures the percentage of energy that is effectively converted to glucose xgr is the biomass kg that the individual grows and sgr is the ground area m2 that grass photosythetic biomass shades per kg the term sel gr l in the first term of 3 is the shading energy loss that is comparable to the energy prices paid by animals to capture prey although here it is the energy price paid by the plant for growing more biomass the third term in 3 is the energy that an individual grass loses to predation by elk jackrabbits and cattle this loss consists of the energy in the grass biomass lost to grazers plus the energy lost in avoiding predation the former loss is interpreted as an average loss over all grass individuals the term e g r x g r 0 5 g j r g r is the energy content of a kg of grass biomass egr multiplied by the average biomass lost to predation x g r 0 5 g j r g r the g jr gr is a parameter that measures the rate at which an individual grass supplies biomass to a jackrabbit and the functional form of the biomass loss is consistent with satisfying the second order conditions for maximizing 2 tschirhart 2000 the parenthetical expression in the third term of 2 represents the energy lost in avoiding predation such as defense mechanisms or escaping for example some plants produce noxious odors or repellent tastes to discourage predators the more effort a predator must employ in the hunt the more energy the prey must use avoiding being captured the function form for this energy loss is assumed to be linear in the energy price paid by the predator p g r e j r g r p g r e j r g r where pgr is a parameter that measures predation risk lima 1998 the energy gain of plants increases with the surface of their photosynthetic biomass but decreases with the shade created by their own leaves and the leaves of other plants therefore the space occupied by all the leaves imposes a cost on each individual plant this explains why the population and biomass accumulation of one plant species can affect other plant species the sel is given in 4 and it is a function of the leaf area index l given in 5 the surface area occupied by the leaves of an individual grass is xgrsgr the leaf area index sums these individul areas over all shrub and grass individuals in 5 by multiplying the individuals areas by the shrub and grass populations and dividing the result by a the area of arng the leaf area index is a measure of the density of all plants the higher lower the proportion of land used by plants the higher lower the sel energy price paid by the plants for accumulating biomass the energy available for absorption per m2 of photosythetic biomass will depend on the orientation of the biomass therefore the leaf area index is multiplied by a species specific extinction coefficient ki to account for the inclination of biomass surface area finally the sun s intensity minus the loss of energy to shading is mutlitplied by ξ 32 to account for the efficient conversion of atp and nadph to d glucose hall and rao 1999 p 4 each individual acts as if it maximizes the net energy accumulated over a defined time period which reflects the idea that the evolution of species must lead to an efficient use of energy pennycuick 1979 yun et al 2006 optimization is a useful way of modeling efficient energy use the first order conditions focs for optimization require setting to zero the derivatives of each species individual s net energy function with respect to the individuals choice variables for the jackrabbit presented above the choice variables are the biomass consumptions x jr gr and x jr sh and for the grass the choice variable is the biomass growth xgr for example the foc for jackrabbit consumption of grass is given by 6 r j r e e x x j r g r e g r e j r g r 1 x j r g r 0 5 x j r s h r j r 0 equation 6 indicates that at the optimum the marginal benefit of consuming a kg of grass must equal its marginal cost the first term is the jackrabbits s energy income from consuming a kg of grass it is equal to two marginal losses from consuming the kg paying the energy price second term and the marginal respiration loss third term if jackrabbit had any predator then the marginal loss from being preyed on which includes predation risk should also be considered the focs provide the biomasses consumed by individual animals and summing over all individuals in a species provides the species biomasses consumed to ensure mass balance in the model it must be the case that the biomass consumed by one species must equal the biomass given up by the species consumed therefore a mass balance equation is required for each demand supply relationship between a predator and prey or grazer and plant equation 7 illustrates this category of equations for jackrabbit consumption of grass 7 n j r x j r s h n s h x s h 0 5 g j r s h in the simulations the focs and the mass balance equations are solved for the biomass consumptions and the energy expenditures or prices there are 9 focs 2 for plants and 7 for herbivores which includes cattle discussed below and 7 mass balance equations 3 for grass eaters and 4 for shrub eaters essentially there is one equation for every solid arrow in fig 1 except for the arrows that connect plants and the sun 5 5 we assume that plants behave as if they are taking account of how their choice of biomass impacts overall shading self shading equilibrium see finnoff and tschirhart 2009 for more details the calculated biomasses and energy prices constitute a general equilibrium which is defined as a state of the ecosystem when all individuals are maximizing their net energy and mass balance holds over all species interactions a general equilibrium holds in each period but this does not imply a steady state in which populations are unchanging over time 2 2 3 population updating after a general equilibrium is calculated in each period the resulting biomass and price values are used to update populations species updates are based on annual energy accumulations of the average individuals and on predation and death rates increasing decreasing populations correspond to positive negative individual net energy if all populations are unchanging over time then a steady state is said to be obtained 6 6 the time step for geem is one year this matches the reproductive cycle of the vertebrates but we acknowledge that it is likely coarser than the processes for biomass accumulation of plants and leaf area index growth in steady state the net energy for all the species is equal to zero except for cattle as explained below steady state implies that the average individual has accumulated exactly the necessary amount of energy to locate its prey realize the activities related to respiration avoid being hunted expend its metabolic rate and reproduce such that the deaths of old age natural death and predation are exactly offset by births after a perturbation the general equilibrium biomass and energy price values change which drive new population changes if not in steady state there are forces that tend to move the system to a new steady state for example suppose that following a perturbation that individuals in a species have high optimum ri then they will have high birth rates and the species population will increase in subsequent periods but high birth rates for a species will create more intraspecific competition and higher energy prices thereby decreasing individual s optimum ri and decreasing the population thus the impact of the initial pertubation is dampened by countervailing adjustments in the energy prices and eventually individuals will move toward zero ri and a new steady state the speed at which a new steady state is attained largely depends on the magnitude of the perturbation and on the responsiveness of plants positive or zero prices follow from applying kuhn tucker analysis to the general equilibrium optimization problem see tschirhart 2012 for more detail formally we have the following definitions of competition that will be applicable below in the results defn 1 if the solution to the general equilibrium yields n j r x j r g r n g r x g r 0 5 g j r g r then e j r g r 0 and there is said to be no competition among jackrabbit for grass defn 2 if e jr gr 0 then n j r x j r g r n g r x g r 0 5 g j r g r and there is said to be competition among jackrabbit for grass that is increasing in e jr gr the predation rate per capita for species i in the absence of satiation is 8 pr d i e 1 w i k k n k g k i x k i 0 5 n i where e e k i k k wi is the average individual s weight and k is the set of all predators of species i with satiation the willingness to supply biomass g k i x k i 0 5 becomes the biomass demanded by the satiated predator and it will be less than what the prey is actually willing to supply based on its own optimization problem in that case the term in the summation in 8 for satiated prey k is n k x k i n i the natural death rate per capita is the percentage of the species population that was not preyed upon during the current period and has lived an average lifespan the average lifespan of an individual from the species i is denoted by li if we assume that each species is divided into li identically aged groups the groups have the same number of individuals and the preyed upon individuals are evenly distributed among the groups then the death mortality rate per capita of species i is 9 dt h i e pr d i e 1 pr d i e l i l i the birth rate per capita depends on the amount of energy allocated to reproduction we assume that the energy used for reproduction is a fixed portion of the sum of respiration and any additional energy accumulated during the relevant period if at the undisturbed steady state the net energy is equal to zero and the birth rate is equal to the death rate then the birthrate per capita of species i is bt h i e e x dt h i e i ss r i e e x r i x r i x i ss 10 r i e e x y i e x r i x d i e β i where d i e e k i k k e i k k 1 t i e k i n i n k x k i since the relevant net energy accounts for actual supply of biomass and not the willingness to

biomass accumulations biomass consumptions and population densities depict an arng ecosystem in a scenario without ngd this is a strong assumption because the data obtained are contaminated by human disturbances however much of our data comes from sources where the data were collected before major development in the arng data were obtained for plant and animal populations ni plant biomasses xi and animal biomass consumptions xi j energy content per unit of biomass ej basal metabolisms βi plant and animal weights wi lifespans li predation risks pi solar intensity i su and plant extinction parameters ki these data and their sources are provided in table 1 of the supplementary information section calibration is used to obtain parameter values that are not available in the literature these include initial energy expenditure prices seli e i j respiration function terms ri and parameters in the willingness to supply functions g k i in the calibration there are two net energy ri equations for plant species and five net energy equations for animals plus an equation that defines the average annual weight gain w once cattle is introduced to the ecosystem these equations are all set to zero to be consistent with a steady state there is very limited information in the literature for how much energy prey species use to avoid predation for plants it was possible to define a value for pi that would fit reasonable assumptions see the appendix of finnoff et al 2008 in 12 non green biomass respiration of plant species is 39 of total incoming energy 12 0 39 exp k i n gr ss x gr ss s gr n sh ss x sh ss s sh 109339 ξ i su s i x i ss β i which follows from considering that the percent of carbohydrates produced in photosynthesis consumed in non green respiration for slow growing grass species is 16 by roots and 25 by shoots lambers et al 2006 7 7 this yields 16 16 25 39 for the non green biomass this adds conditions to the calibration and allows solutions for the predation risk of plants 2 4 plant competition and nitrogen subject to caveats the resource ratio hypothesis states that the number of competing plant species can be no greater than the number of limiting resources tilman 1985 miller et al 2005 geem is consistent with the resource ratio hypothesis finnoff and tschirhart 2009 because there are two plant species in the arng model nitrogen is introduced as a second resource to allow coexistence of the plant species the availability of nitrogen is the primary factor limiting plant growth in many ecosystems chapin et al 1986 tilman et al 1996 and in a prairie system the competition between grasses and shrubs is strongest for nitrogen köchy and wilson 2000 in the model there is a restriction that limits how much nitrogen can be absorbed from divergent layers of soil according to the grass versus shrub root structures and biomass accumulations this absorption of nitrogen then regulates plant growth and biomass accumulation the details on how nitrogen enters the model and how the plants compete for it are in the supplementary information section 2 5 ecosystem services grazing and hunting the seven native arng species use a portion of their energy to reproduce and when prey or forage is abundant these species expend less energy and reproduce at a greater rate cattle however are assumed to use their acquired energy to gain weight rather than reproduce the net energy of cattle must be positive at the steady state because ranchers will introduce cattle only if they gain weight that is their net energy is positive therefore to complete the calibration some assumptions regarding the profitability of grazing cattle are needed ranchers are assumed to employ a stocker operation where they acquire young adult steers or heifers and graze them for one season before they are sent to market since much of this grazing occurs on public land under grazing permits the density of cattle on the rangeland ecosystem is at least in part under the control of the blm following the literature a stocking rate for steers or heifers of 0 22 0 57 0 90 per ha is considered low heavy very heavy density derner and hart 2007 jablonski et al 2018 for the arng density according to the eis there are 31 relevant blm grazing allotments in the arng and the surrounding area which allows for a total of 39 695 animal unit months aums assuming the number of aums inside the arng is proportional to its acreage yields 21 135 aums also assuming each animal is allowed to graze five months implies a total of 4 227 individual steers and heifers since there are 109 297 ha in the arng the estimated grazing density is 4 227 109 297 0 0387 animals per hectare this density is lower than what the literature considers low density but many of those studies refer to more fertile land and dense grass cattle consume only grass as shown in fig 1 which puts them in direct competition with the native grass eaters we assume that a new steady state occurs after cattle are introduced to the ecosystem where indidivuals consume enough grass biomass to gain 180 kg of additional weight by the end of the stocking season if the initial weight is 247 kg and cattle consume about 1 2 kg per day during an average stocking season of 150 days i e about five months the weight of each individual at the end of the stocking season is 427 kg the consumed energy of an individual stocker can be converted to an average annual weight gain w in kg with the formula national research council 2000 13 w r ca 182 5 0 956 r ca 182 5 1000 0 0635 0 891 w b 0 75 1 1 097 where r ca is the net energy in kcal for each individual stocker over a grazing season and wb is the average weight when introduced into the ecosystem the weight gain cannot be less than zero in the calibration of the model we assume that ranchers introduce 4 227 individuals and after the ecosystem reaches a steady state each individual consumes 1 326 kg of grass biomass 8 8 weights of stocked cattle vary we use typical weights of 247 kg per stocked feeder calf and 427 kg market weight at the end of the stocking season based on derner et al 2008 according to hironaka and freeze 1992 one animal unit requires 11 8 kg of dry matter per day per 450 kg of body weight this was adjusted for the different weights and summed over 150 days by using these values and solving for r ca in equation 13 every individual stocker is able to accumulate 620 801 kcal within a year to meet the goal weight the following equation to calculate the profit per period for cattle ranchers πca has been proposed in previous research on cattle grazing activities hussain and tschirhart 2013 14 π ca w r ca w b p f w b p b n ca where n ca is the population of cattle introduced to the ecosystem pf is the price per kg for a stocker at the end of the period and pb is the price per kg for a stocker at the beginning of the period the total weight of an individual stocker at the end of the period is the sum of the initial weight plus the weight gained and therefore the total benefit of grazing cattle is the total weight times the final price the economic cost of cattle grazing is the weight of the individual stocker at the beginning of the period multiplied by the input price the total arng ranching profit is the number of cattle introduced times the profit per individual neither the w nor the profits can be negative since equation 13 does not allow negative net energy values introducing cattle requires including another r equation its corresponding focs and a mb equation once geem is calibrated to be consistent with the nitrogen restriction and the natural rangeland ecosystem first cattle are introduced and once a new steady state occurs then hunting is introduced hunting is modeled as a percentage reduction of the elk pronghorn and mule deer populations at the end of each period the percentage or hunting rate is fixed but the number of harvested animals varies over time to calibrate geem for recent hunting rates we collected 2014 data from published wyoming game and fish department wgfd harvest reports wyoming game and fish department 2014 the hunting areas or units intersect with the arng region but none falls entirely inside we calculated the percentage of each unit that falls inside the arng region and then assumed that the same percentage of elk pronghorn and mule deer from the total animals hunted were harvested inside the arng region the population of the hunted species sh during period t 1 is 15 n i t 1 1 gt h i e i e i x i n i t h i t 1 where n i t is the population of the hunted species i at the end of period t and h i t 1 is the number of individuals hunted from the species i during period t 1 the estimation of hunting net benefits πhu is based on previous research that uses geem and calculates the value of the ecosystem services hussain and tschirhart 2013 we adapted the net benefits by making the cost of hunting a function of the total number of hunters 16 π hu i sh m i v n i h i τ h i h i v n i c i sh τ h i where hi is the number of individuals animals harvested from species i and mi is the meat value of an animal the function τ is the total number of hunters or hunter congestion that is increasing in hi that is τ h 0 and c τ 64 τ 0 9 is the cost function for hunting trips the number of hunters τ hi and the harvest hi are not equal because not all hunters are successful i e to hunt hi animals more than hi hunting licenses must be issued also the function v n 4200 n 0 8 3 5 n 1 6 represents the value of the trip itself regardless of sucessful hunting where the hunters experience a benefit from observing wildlife during the trip as a result the value of the trip increases whenever the population of wildlife increases v n 0 because the trip includes various subjective or non pecuniary benefits enjoyed on a hunting trip the formulation in 16 shows that meat value is enjoyed only for a successful hunter but the trip value is enjoyed by all hunters we used the same functions described in hussain and tschirhart 2013 except for the function τ h i we use 17 τ h i h i s r i where sr i is the success rate for hunting the hunted species i 9 9 for example if the success rate of elk is 50 then 100 hunting licenses must be issued in order to have 50 successfully hunted elk τ 50 50 0 5 100 the average success rate and the hunting rates used for elk pronghorn and mule deer during the simulations are presented in the supplemental information section 2 6 energy development and disturbed areas previous research has found that various species avoid natural gas wells but the magnitude of the impact depends on the intensity of the development the affected species and the season kauffman et al 2018 a study of the powder river basin in wyoming and montana shows that coalbed methane natural gas development has a negative impact on sage grouse leks with the disturbed region ranging somewhere between 0 8 km and 3 2 km from the wells walker et al 2007 doherty et al 2008 estimate that sage grouse were 1 3 times less likely to occupy sagebrush habitat in a 4 km2 area around coalbed methane natural gas wells equivalent to a circle with radius of 1 13 km similarly studies suggest that elk and mule deer avoid oil and gas development areas hebblewhite 2011 in particular elk avoided areas within 2 km of major roads and active gas oil wells during the summer and 1 km during winter powell 2003 and mule deer have a higher probability to avoid areas up to 3 7 km from gas development sawyer et al 2006 however van dyke et al 2012 show that elk in particular are capable of modifying their behavior in response to habitat disturbances if they can find alternative routes where forage is sufficiently abundant to account for the impact of ngd we assume that elk mule deer and sage grouse experience stress whenever they forage inside the areas surrounding the natural gas well which are labelled disturbed areas das stress is included in the model by assuming that the animals lose energy depending on how much time they spend foraging in the das if biomass consumption occurs in the the undisturbed area ua no additional losses are experienced by the animal 10 10 for example the energy that elk el gain from grazing upon grass at the ua are e g r e e l g r u a x e l g r u a while the losses at the da3 are e g r x e l g r d a 3 δ d a 3 where δ da3 is a parameter that measures sensitivity to ngd in da3 if δ d a 3 1 elk would not gain any energy by grazing in da3 because the stress is at its highest value conversely if δ d a 3 0 elk would not experience any stress by grazing in da3 there are three das in total the first da is located within a radius of 500 m around all well pads meanwhile the second da is located between 500 and 1 000 m from the closest well pad and the third one is located between 1 000 m and 1 500 m the area outside the das is labelled ua based on the evidence above we assume that elk are less sensitive to ngd therefore they experience the lowest levels of stress when exposed to ngd in each da meanwhile the mule deer are the most sensitive to ngd finally sage grouse are not as affected as mule deer but more affected than elk 11 11 in our baseline scenario we assumed that elk experience some stress 0 2 in the da3 experience stress at a sensitivity of 0 5 in the da2 and 0 8 in the da1 sage grouse experience stress at the level of 0 25 0 55 and 0 85 in das 3 2 and 1 respectively finally mule deer experience stress at the level of 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 in das 3 2 and 1 respectively all other species in the rangeland ecosystem forage in the das and ua without experiencing any stress a simple schematic of habitat loss and ngd stress is shown in fig 2 fig 3 shows the location of the active natural gas wells in 2010 and the total da in the arng region from 1980 to 2010 assuming the three different radii around each well fig 4 shows the number of wells that were active in each year from 1980 to 2010 although the number of wells has generally been growing it started increasing sharply in 1998 for tractability we assume that all gas wells new since 1999 are assumed to be introduced simultaneously absent this assumption all the das in the model would need to be indexed by their age given the das the total affected area is equal to 20 889 ha or 19 of the arng area 12 12 the total unaffected area is 88 408 ha the total affected area is comprised of 10 193 ha for the da1 that produces the highest stress on the affected species 5 187 ha for the da2 that produces a moderate stress and 5 509 ha for the da3 that produces the lowest stress interestingly the maximum allowable da in the eis is significantly smaller u s bureau of land management 2007 but the eis only considered actual cleared habitat and not the avoided area around gas wells the eis plan calls for active reclamation that would stabilize disturbed soils and vegetation communities while allowing for no more than 3 075 ha of total da 3 of the total arng area at any time 3 results given the lack of complete ecological and economic data for the arng region the model is calibrated using ecological parameters economic parameters and functional forms that are sometimes imprecise therefore we quantify the inherent uncertainty in the model s predictions by undertaking a thorough sensitivity analysis whereby the parameter values are varied up and down by a fixed percentage the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in the supplementary information section and will be discussed in more detail below fig 5 shows the simulated time paths for plant biomasses and animal populations for various combinations of disturbances the top panel of fig 5 shows the time paths for four scenarios before ngd in the first scenario the ecosystem starts at the natural undisturbed steady state then cattle grazing is introduced for scenarios 2 and 4 once the system settles down to a new post ranching steady state hunting is introduced for scenarios 3 and 4 in the bottom panel of fig 5 the simulations continue and ngd is introduced starting at the post disturbance steady states from the four scenarios in the top panel of fig 5 we discuss the simulations results below 3 1 responses to hunting in geem as expected the introduction of elk pronghorn and mule deer hunting immediately increases the amount of forage available for surviving individual herbivores hunting also indirectly impacts plants consider grass first with fewer elk after hunting the population of grass increases for both cattle grazing and cattle grazing hunting scenarios however nitrogen limits the total biomass of grass such that a new steady state is attained with a larger population of smaller plants as shown in the supplementary information bai et al 2012 meanwhile even though there are fewer pronghorn and mule deer the population of shrubs decreases the energy price shrubs expend to grow biomass increases because of interspecies competition fueled by the higher total biomass of grass this in turn leads to a smaller population of smaller shrubs even though both plant species experience less pressure from herbivores grass partially displaces shrubs this follows because after hunting total elk consumption individual consumption times population of grass biomass as a percent of total grass biomass decreases whereas total deer plus pronghorn consumption of shrub biomass as a percent of total shrub biomass increases after the initial responses from hunting grass and shrub populations converge slowly to a new post hunting steady state the impact on non hunted species depends on their plant consumption and whether they have competitive relationships with other animals for example removing elk benefits cattle by lowering inter specific competition because removal lowers the energy price cattle pay for grass the effect on sage grouse is particularly interesting since their population decreases even though this species is not hunted this negative impact on sage grouse occurs because elk hunting releases more foraging pressure on grass than pronghorn and mule deer hunting on shrubs which is the primary food source of sage grouse this result would not hold if only elk were hunted interactions between the forage consumption patterns of ungulates and their interactions with other key species such as cattle have been studied by authors such as hobbs et al 1996 who found that higher elk density lowers forage intake by cattle through competitive effects the combination of cattle grazing and hunting results in completely different population dynamics if only hunting is considered but no cattle grazing the sage grouse population is slightly lower than the undisturbed scenario if only cattle grazing is considered the sage grouse population is significantly higher than at the undisturbed scenario when both economic activities are considered the sage grouse population is higher than in the undisturbed case but lower than when only cattle grazing is modeled 3 2 predicted ecological impacts of ngd plants are affected by ngd because the mix of herbivores that consume them differ between the ua and das in particular elk mule deer and sage grouse are less willing to forage in the das the populations of the directly affected species will initially decline because they gather less energy in the relatively more congested ua but this impact can be partially reversed if the forage availability redistribution favors them other herbivores will choose to forage relatively more heavily inside the da after ngd due to less inter specific competition this result can be seen in the general equilibrium calculations pre and post ngd as discussed in section 2 above to attain an ecosystem general equilibrium in each period an individual herbivore s marginal energy gains inside the da and the ua must be equal this follows because if a herbivore enjoyed greater energy gain in the da for example it would switch to more da grazing which would increase the da s energy price and lower the ua s energy price this behavior would continue until the energy prices stabilize and the incentive to switch vanishes in effect the effort that it takes for animals to find prey must be equal inside and outside the das and ua which is consistent with the marginal value theorem charnov 1976 stephens and krebs 1986 the negative impact of ngd on the species in the short run can reverse in the long run in the short run the species that experience no stress when foraging close to the well pads are better off for example when ngd is introduced to the ecosystem sage grouse and mule deer significantly reduce their foraging in the das allowing pronghorn and jackrabbits which do not experience stress when foraging in the das to take advantage of the higher abundance of forage near the disturbance this leads to a population increase in pronghorn and jackrabbits and a decline in sage grouse and mule deer however this dynamic is a short term phenomenon and only part of the story in the long run the two plant species will compete for space sunlight and nitrogen with the plant species receiving less pressure from foragers outcompeting the other plant species over time pfeiffer et al 2019 for our calibration shrubs in the da experience relatively less forage pressure than grass and as a result the population of grass in the das eventually declines and the population of shrubs increases until a new steady state is reached the long run population dynamics of introducing ngd can offset some of the damage caused in the short run for example sage grouse choose to forage much less in the das which in turn leads to a decrease in their population depending on which economic activities are considered previous to the introduction of ngd the population of sage grouse may partially recover before reaching a new steady state for our baseline calibration sage grouse populations fluctuate between a loss of 1 4 ngd scenario and 7 7 cattle grazing ngd scenario by comparing pre and post disturbance steady states nevertheless the population of sage grouse can drop as low as 13 1 in the short run cattle grazing ngd scenario the impact of ngd on elk populations fluctuates between a decrease of 13 2 hunting ngd scenario and a decrease of 18 5 cattle grazing ngd scenario positive effects on the populations of directly impacted species are less likely to occur when the sensitivities to ngd are higher these scenarios are explored in the appendix 3 3 impacts on ecosystem services here we calculate the impact of ngd on the value of ecosystem services i e cattle ranching hunting and the existence value of sage grouse in the arng region although sage grouse are only one of many species in the arng ecosystem they are a high profile species that have been repeatedly considered for listing under the u s endangered species act u s fish and wildlife service 2015a the species also receives significant media attention such as the recently publicized plans of the trump administration to ease oil and natural gas drilling restrictions given in the greater sage grouse resource management plan 13 13 https www doi gov sites doi gov files uploads so 3353 pdf the total discounted sum of the values of the ecosystem services tdves is defined as 18 t d v e s lim t t t n g d t π c a t π h u t π s g t 1 r t t n g d where tngd is the time period when ngd is introduced π c a t is the profits of cattle ranching in period t π h u t are the net benefits of hunting π s g t is the existence value of sage grouse and r is the discount rate set at 3 in the simulations in section 2 of the supplementary information we describe in detail the calculations regarding the existence value of sage grouse the animals that are willing to graze close to the well pads are better off in the short run which has an effect on the value of the ecosystem services associated to them fig 6 shows the annual value of the ecosystem services over the same time period and combination of economic activities as used in fig 5 cattle accumulate more net energy by foraging in the less crowded das because elk avoid the well pads and the profits of cattle grazing increase in the short run meanwhile the net benefits of overall hunting decrease because the reduced net benefits of hunting mule deer and elk species that avoid well pads more than compensate the increased net benefits of pronghorn hunting species that are willing to graze close to well pads the net benefits of hunting continue to decrease in the long run the profits of cattle grazing fall in the long run and the existence value of sage grouse recovers from the initial drop the main message from fig 6 is that while ngd leads to a decrease in tdves the size of the total loss and the stakeholder groups that experience losses vary significantly depending on which disturbances and economic activities are modeled 4 discussion previous studies have tended to focus on how ngd affects a narrow set of species such as caribou and elk without analyzing the feedback paths from the rest of the species in the food web sorensen et al 2008 wasser et al 2011 dzialak et al 2011 the advantage of using geem is that a multi species food web can be used to capture the feedback effects and the ecosystem externalities that cattle ranching hunting and ngd impose on each other this is important because policymakers scientists and academics might draw the wrong conclusions about ecosystem management if the models used only consider a small number of species or do not involve the complex feedback mechanisms policymakers could also draw incorrect conclusions or unintentionally misinform the public if they do not fully account for the larger disturbed area caused by ngd when publishing environmenal impact statements u s bureau of land management 2007 as an illustration consider the impacts in fig 6 the profits of cattle ranching are nearly seven times lower if only cattle grazing and ngd are assessed but hunting is not modeled grazing ngd vs grazing hunting ngd scenarios because the positive ecosystem externalities that hunters impose on ranchers are not taken into account similarly if only hunting is considered and the impact of cattle grazing is ignored the geem model estimates lower net benefits of hunting because the positive externality that ranchers impose on hunters is ignored although it is hard to appreciate in fig 6 the ecosystem externalities do not simply stack up the negative impact of ngd may be excerbated or dampened depending upon which economic activities are modelled the pure negative impact of ngd by constrasting the pre and post development sss on the profits of cattle ranching is 0 1 million higher if hunting is ignored and only grazing activities are considered analogously the negative impact of ngd on the net benefits of hunting is 0 02 million lower if cattle grazing is ignored and only hunting activities are considered although these impacts are relatively small for cattle grazing and hunting the negative impact can be much larger depending upon the circumstances in the case of the existence value of sage grouse the negative impact of ngd is 0 83 million when hunting and cattle grazing are considered but it can be as low as 0 11 million if neither hunting nor cattle grazing are considered or as high as 1 09 million if only cattle grazing is considered another advantage of adressing the interactions of cattle grazing hunting and ngd in geem is that it more accurately reflects the long run population dynamics when only ngd is considered without the other disturbances the sage grouse population is predicted to experience a fairly rapid partial recovery after the initial decline which seems at odds with the empirical evidence we highlight two other findings of our research first although ngd provides substantial economic benefits to society it generally harms biodiversity xiao et al 2018 although overall biodiversity falls after ngd it has the potential to create winners and losers in terms of species populations on the one hand species such as sage grouse mule deer and elk that avoid the area around the natural gas wells will lose habitat and experience population declines on the other hand the populations of herbivores that are willing to graze in the das may increase due to reduced forage competition the introduction of ngd also creates winners and losers in terms of ecosystem services but similar to the population dynamics the wins losses can be amplified or reversed depending upon the disturbances modeled and the sensitvity of the species to ngd second there are important ecosystem externalities that hunting and cattle grazing and the agencies that represent them impose on each other given this context it is necessary to promote coordination between these economic agents to reach a social optimum particularly after the introduction of ngd for example a higher elk hunting rate will cause cattle to experience less competition for grass gain more weight and increases the overall value of ecosystem services in terms of biodiversity decreasing the density of cattle will cause grass to become more abundant ameliorating the reduction in the elk population caused by ngd this implies that the energy companies wgfd officials and blm officials can coordinate to generate a management strategy that balances energy production changes in ecosystem services and potential losses in biodiversity crawford et al 2004 show the linkage of habitat and population dynamics of sage grouse by considering factors such as the effects of fire ecology cattle grazing and herbicide based control of big sagebrush they conclude that solving management issues associated with the decline of sage grouse will require cooperation among wildlife biology range science and other professional abilities see section 4 of the supplementary information for a detailed analysis of the possible coordination failures and the opportunites to mitigate the loss of ecosystem serivces and biodiversity our research supports this conclusion we close by mentioning a few caveats to our work first there is substantial uncertainty in some of the calibrated parameters and modeling assumptions we vary parameters related to 1 the sensitivity to ngd of the affected species 2 the availability and plant uptake of nitrogen in the soil layers and 3 the existence value for sage grouse per household in all cases the impact of introducing ngd is negative and measured in terms of the total discounted value of ecosystem services tdves the loss varies between 0 12 and 81 67 million in the baseline scenario 14 14 the lower bound on the loss from ngd is negative and indicates a benefit of ngd in terms of tdves however the number is relatively small approximately 120 000 and the vast majority of the range of estimates indicate a tdves loss from ngd as a reference point the negative impact estimated in our baseline scenario is 58 40 million see section 3 of the supplementary information for further details second there are other factors besides nitrogen and light that restrict plant growth for example we included the role of precipitation in the model as a random variable where plants that are exposed to less than ideal amounts of water experience stress the results from modeling precipitation were not fundamentally different than the results presented here therefore we decided to focus exclusively on nitrogen and sunlight restrictions in this paper and explore the role of precipitation in future research third plants and animals may be impacted by ngd for various reasons for example studies show that sage grouse populations may decline if established leks are abandoned due to increased human or predator activity from the introduction of roads and power lines ellis 1984 lyon and anderson 2003 holloran 2005 kaiser 2006 doherty et al 2008 also our research does not address the carnivore herbivore interactions such as coyotes ferrets and swift foxes and some other herbivores such as grasshoppers and prairie dogs that could play an important role in the sagebrush ecosystem we have observed that plants reactions to disturbances tend to be more pronounced when fewer species are considered another limitation of the model is that it does not explicitly model space or the migration of species over the landscape this is something we are currently working on adding to the geem framework finally in future research we intend to further investigate other modelling assumptions such as those related to boundary issues water as a limiting resource and plant competition for sunlight lastly one of the main advantages of using a model such as geem is that it provides a unified framework for modeling the various interactions within a food web the downside is that like many models it oversimplifies animal and plant behaviors therefore the goal of our research is not to provide precise predictions of how human development impacts an ecosystem but rather to inform government agencies and relevant stakeholder groups at a high level how various economic activities and species interact within an ecosystem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

24812,one of the most applied tools to create ecosystem models to support management decisions in the light of ecosystem based fisheries management is ecopath with ecosim ewe recently its spatial routine ecospace has evolved due to the addition of the habitat foraging capacity model hfcm a spatial temporal dynamic niche model to drive the foraging capacity to distribute biomass over model grid cells the hfcm allows for continuous implementation of externally derived habitat preference maps based on single species distribution models so far guidelines are lacking on how to best define habitat preferences for inclusion in process oriented trophic modeling studies as one of the first studies we applied the newest ecospace development to an existing ewe model of the southern north sea with the aim to identify which definition of habitat preference leads to the best model fit another key aim of our study was to test for the sensitivity of implementing externally derived habitat preference maps within ecospace to different time scales seasonal yearly multi year and static for this purpose generalized additive models gam were fit to scientific survey data using either presence absence or abundance as differing criteria of habitat preference our results show that ecospace runs using habitat preference maps based on presence absence data compared best to empirical data the optimal time scale for habitat updating differed for biomass and catch but implementing variable habitats was generally superior to a static habitat representation our study hence highlights the importance of a sigmoidal representation of habitat e g presence absence and variable habitat preferences e g multi year when combining species distribution models with an ecosystem model it demonstrates that the interpretation of habitat preference can have a major influence on the model fit and outcome keywords ecospace spatial temporal framework habitat capacity species distribution model food web model ecopath with ecosim 1 introduction habitat preference of species is a widely known concept in ecology first defined as the tendency of a species to choose one resource over another if both are equally available johnson et al 1980 since then multiple definitions and extensions of the concept have been suggested e g rosenzweig and abramsky 1986 hall et al 1997 aarts et al 2008 next to numerous definitions of habitat itself and whether it comprises only abiotic factors or biotic relationships as well e g darwin 1859 allee et al 2000 valentine et al 2005 these different interpretations of habitat and habitat preferences or lack of a common definition might lead to miscommunication between and misinterpretations by scientists hall et al 1997 additionally there are still ongoing discussions about how to quantify habitat preferences in the light of their use and availability beyer et al 2010 modeling these preferences faces certain problems such as an unequal access of individuals to all habitats and areas as well as variations of habitat availability and quality over time garshelis 2000 combining a spatially resolved trophic ecosystem model with habitat preference maps based on single species distribution models sdm can be a solution to better account for habitat preferences within the ecosystem model in the recent years spatially explicit ecosystem models are increasingly being applied to study the effects of climate change spatial fisheries management or to support marine spatial planning e g romagnoni et al 2015 alexander et al 2016 bossier et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to establish best practices when it comes to working with spatially explicit ecosystem models as well as protocols on how to best combine these ecosystem models with sdms a popular ecosystem modeling approach with an increasing number of models worldwide is implemented in the ecopath with ecosim software ewe christensen et al 2004 colleter et al 2015 heymans et al 2016 ewe encompasses three modeling components the static mass balanced ecopath that is used to construct a snapshot of the trophic food web of individual species or functional groups fgs originally proposed by polovina 1984 and further developed since christensen and pauly 1992 the temporal simulation module ecosim uses the ecopath parameterization as a baseline to assess ecosystem dynamics over time with the main goal to evaluate the impact of environmental stressors and fisheries on the ecosystem walters et al 1997 2000 ecospace adds the spatial dimension to the model walters et al 1999 christensen et al 2014 providing a routine which allows for impact analysis of spatial management measures such as marine protected areas and physical structures like wind farms christensen and walters 2004 many ecopath and ecosim models have been published in the past while publications applying ecospace are comparably rare but increase in appearance recently colleter et al 2015 in recent releases of the ewe software the options to inform ecospace about habitat preferences have become very flexible one of the first possibilities was to assign absence presence preferences connected to static habitat layers implemented in the basemap to include multiple environmental stressors a new habitat foraging capacity model hfcm was implemented that allowed the user to implement continuous rather than binary habitat preferences christensen et al 2014 the foraging capacity of a cell is based on the foraging arena theory implemented in ecosim defining the capacity of a cell for a predator to forage on a prey ahrens et al 2012 it is used as a multiplier to the search area a in the foraging arena equation christensen et al 2014 from here on multiple cumulative environmental drivers could also affect the computed foraging capacity of the fgs in a given cell implemented via environmental preference functions this increased the variation between the cells to distribute the fgs over the map where they are most likely to occur christensen et al 2014 furthermore it opened the opportunity to close the gap between sdms and ecosystem models by allowing the user to implement environmental response functions derived from sdms grüss et al 2016 one of the most recent improvements to relate fgs distributions in ecospace directly to scientific surveys is the possibility to implement scaled habitat preferences predicted by external sdms directly as foraging capacity maps into ecospace fig 1 this increases the interchangeability between different model types further thus far temporal abundance changes of each fg in ecosim are reproduced in each grid cell of ecospace the new spatial temporal data framework allows for time dynamic inclusion of geospatial data such as habitat maps during each ecospace run steenbeek et al 2013 including dynamically changing environmental driver maps and a dynamic redistribution of biomass based on species environmental preferences allows for a better representation of changes in the physical habitat christensen et al 2014 this also allows implementing time dynamic foraging capacity maps based on external sdms during the ecospace run this enables the modeler to bypass the necessity to enter environmental preference functions in ecospace implementing these maps can be done just like the environmental driver maps in different temporal frequencies e g seasonally annually or once every few years to integrate them with the computed foraging capacity and to account for shifts in habitat preferences over the period of the model run increases the realism in distributing the biomass of fgs over the grid cells combining the single species distribution modeling approach with a trophic ecosystem model in this way bears potentials to increase our knowledge on impacts of changes in biotic and abiotic factors on species and fisheries yield this increases ecospace usefulness as a support tool for spatial management decisions the application of this approach to many fgs simultaneously in a strongly exploited ecosystem like the north sea has so far not been reported neither has the test for the sensitivity of different implementation frequencies of external foraging capacity maps which might show how inertia and sensitivity of the ecosystem model differs with forcing frequencies therefore this study aims to analyze which representation of habitat preference best serves to create foraging capacity maps and is capable to interact with the information contributed by the tropho dynamic model furthermore the sensitivity of the updating frequency of foraging capacity maps e g seasonal annual multiannual on ecospace s biomass and catch predictions compared to the empirical data is being evaluated 2 material and methods 2 1 ecopath with ecosim model of the southern north sea our ecospace model is based on a previously published ewe model stäbler et al 2016 representing the ecosystem of the southern north sea in the base year 1991 up to 2010 statistical areas ivb and ivc defined by the international council for the exploration of the sea ices the southern north sea model has a focus on commercially important species and higher trophic levels and comprises 68 groups of which 35 represent multi species groups and 30 single species particulate organic matter dissolved organic matter and discards are represented in three additional groups life history changes are implemented for seven commercially important species cod gadus morhua whiting merlangius merlangus haddock melanogrammus aeglefinus herring clupea harengus sole solea solea plaice pleuronectes platessa and brown shrimp crangon crangon through the multi stanza approach walters et al 2010 these stanzas characterize juvenile and adult life stages of the fish species while brown shrimp was split according to the body size they need to reach to be targeted by the fishery fishery exploitation is implemented in the model through twelve fleets representing the diversity of the fishing sector in this region there have been several adaptations to the original ecopath and ecosim model of the southern north sea these were changes in the diet matrix and the addition of off vessel prices in ecopath as well as some changes to the reference time series in ecosim for more detail see appendix a to account for these alterations in ecopath and ecosim we used the new stepwise fitting routine to fit predator prey vulnerabilities and primary production anomaly splines that resulted in the lowest discrepancies between the model and the observed time series scott et al 2016 the fitting routine automatically repeats the sensitivity search and ecosim runs with an increasing number of vulnerability parameters these different parameterizations towards reference time series were fitted the resulting measures of fit include residual sum of squares ss log scaled biomass catches and akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 the ecosim settings with the lowest aics aics that differed more than 2 compared to the lowest aic were excluded were then tested for their model efficiency see table 2 stow et al 2009 in reproducing the reference time series of biomass and catch for further information on this ecopath and ecosim model of the southern north sea see stäbler et al 2016 2018 2019 and appendix a 2 2 ecospace of the southern north sea the software used to construct the ecospace model is ewe version 6 6 professional edition and fit to time series for the period 1991 2010 and run in monthly time steps as a basis for distributing biomasses simulated by ecosim in space a basemap of the study area was constructed as a georeferenced esri american standard code for information interchange map esri ascii with a resolution of 0 125 per edge length of each grid cell the bounding box for the study area ranged from 4 to 9 longitude and from 51 to 57 25 latitude we assigned static habitats to the basemap encompassing various sediment structures a distance to coast measure and fishing habitats all habitat maps were binary defined by 1 present and 0 not present sediment types were derived from the european marine observation and data network emodnet 2017 using a seabed substrate map that includes five substrate classes mud to muddy sand sand coarse sediment mixed sediment rock and boulders to account for seabirds living close to the coast to breed on land the habitats near coast and marine were added the 12 nautical mile zone representing territorial waters of each surrounding country was used as a proxy to separate coastal from offshore areas additionally depth was included as an environmental driver ranging from 0 to 100 m data used to reproduce the bathymetry of the study area was retrieved from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco 2019 these have a higher resolution than ecospace therefore within each grid cell the mean depth was taken and then classified into ten discrete depth categories in ten meter intervals starting with 5 m fishing effort allocation across the grid implements the effect of spatially explicit exploitation christensen et al 2008 christensen and walters 2004 walters et al 1999 usually fishing fleets are assigned simply to the same habitats as fgs targeted in order to distribute fishing effort on the basemap we attempted a more realistic representation of the spatial dynamics of the fisheries using spatially resolved effective fishing effort data scientific technical and economic committee for fisheries 2017 however for a few fleets that have very specific target fgs like sandeel and nephrops trawlers the fleets follow the distribution of these fgs while all others were assigned to the before mentioned habitat structures mean annual primary production was added to the basemap as a static layer based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis ocean color data from 2002 to the present behrenfeld and falkowski 1997 http www science oregonstate edu ocean productivity index php and was kept constant over time to solely examine the influence of varying foraging capacity ecospace takes a habitat preference approach and allocates ecosim s biomass dynamically over a basemap of grid cells with respective preferred and non preferred habitats the spatial allocation of the biomass is based on the foraging capacity for each fg within a cell within cells with preferred habitats fgs have increased feeding rates allowing for increased growth rate and survival rates outside of these cells dispersal rates which depict random movement within the model area may be higher to escape the non preferred habitats christensen et al 2008 in the hfcm the computed foraging capacity within ecospace can be overwritten by external foraging capacity or multiplied by cell specific habitat capacity and environmental capacity as external foraging capacity scaled habitat preference maps predicted by sdms can be integrated into ecospace directly these maps have the same spatial extent and resolution as the ecospace basemap and each grid cell has a specific foraging capacity between 0 and 1 assigned to from here on habitat preferences refers to the predicted results of the sdms while they are referred to as external foraging capacity as soon as they enter ecospace to overwrite the computed foraging capacity in addition ecospace can calculate foraging capacity from fgs affinity for given habitats and from fgs functional responses to environmental conditions habitat capacity is based on the habitat layers implemented in the basemap here sediment and distance to coast each habitat type gets a proportion assigned of how suitable the habitat is for a certain fg environmental capacity is based on environmental driver maps here depth it is being ascertained by applying an environmental response function specific to each fg to the environmental driver map all aforementioned possibilities within ecospace can be applied individually or combined fig 2 in this study foraging capacity for most fgs was pre defined by external foraging capacity maps while for some fgs the foraging capacity was calculated from affinity for habitats and or environmental preferences distributions for six fgs were affected though habitat affinities while for eleven fgs an environmental response function depending on depth was implemented foraging capacity maps for 32 fgs were driven from external habitat preferences through the spatial temporal data framework see fig 1 the multi stanza modus of ecospace computes the distributions of multi stanza groups to be highly correlated within each group which sometimes leads to a better fit if only one of the stanzas is distributed by temporarily changing the foraging capacity we followed this approach for the fg plaice where only the distribution of the juvenile stanza was driven by its foraging capacity the adult stanzas distribution was a result of the distribution of juveniles as well as presence of predators and prey for crangon the stanza smaller than commercial catch size followed the distribution of the stanza targeted by fisheries in ecospace biomass is time variant within a cell even if no external forcing occurred since a fraction of biomass is always dispersing randomly around the basemap represented by the dispersal rate km year the base dispersal rate set as default within ecospace is 300 km year except for detritus christensen et al 2008 for our model we chose five different dispersal rates to represent the mobility of fgs based on their life form i e 1000 km year for fast top predators 600 km year for pelagic fgs 300 km year for faster moving demersal fish fgs 30 km year for mainly flat fish and zooplankton fgs 3 km year for nearly stationary or sessile groups primarily benthic fgs these dispersal rates were chosen based on the general 300 30 3 rule similar to chen et al 2009 expanding the classes for more differentiation in speed using a custom built plug in for ewe each ecospace run was started with a 10 year spin up or burn in period to stabilize fg distributions for more details about the ecospace structure see the appendix a 2 3 species distribution models the new spatial temporal data framework within ecospace allows for the implementation of time dynamic foraging capacity maps these are habitat preferences generated by sdms prior to implementation and then applied directly as foraging capacity with a range of 0 1 this method was applied for thirty two fgs representing most single species fgs including six multi stanza groups and eleven multi species fgs see appendix a these groups represent mainly commercially important species and also groups that were well represented within the scientific surveys that sampled the data used for the sdms data on species abundance for this analysis was gathered from two different surveys due to the different catchability of the surveys for certain groups catch per unit effort data cpue number per hour from quarter 3 q3 only sampled quarter of the ices beam trawl survey bts from 1991 to 2010 was used for juvenile and adult sole solea solea brill scophthalmus rhombus and turbot scophthalmus maximus long rough dab hippoglossoides platessoides and monkfish lophius piscatorius for the remaining 25 fgs cpue data was used for quarter 1 q1 and q3 of the ices international bottom trawl survey ibts from 1991 to 2010 see appendix a for the chosen timeframe q1 and q3 are the only two quarters that were sampled continuously one of the major aims of this study is to identify the best representation of habitat preference when combining an sdm with a trophic food web model we tested two representations in this study a more general representation based on binary data presence absence model versus one that accounts for gradations in quality by considering abundance hurdle model the idea is to identify if a sigmoidal or an exponential response is best suited when combined with the trophic model the hurdle model contains binary presence absence and continuous response abundance sub models that are applied to the data separately and the predicted distribution resulting them are being multiplied at the end cragg 1971 maunder and punt 2004 a hurdle model approach is widely used in sdms due to its ability to deal with data sets that contain a high number of zeros i e zero inflated in their recent published paper coll et al 2019 used bayesian models integrated nested laplace approximation inla to create single fg distribution maps we tested the applicability of inla for our study against the fitting method commonly used for generalized additive models gam hastie and tibshirani 1986 i e pirls penalized iteratively re weighted least squares the gams were created using the mgcv package wood 2009 while inla was applied with the r inla package rue et al 2009 due to high computational costs we modelled only key groups with either high commercial importance or a small sample size cod adult whiting adult starry ray others sole adult and plaice adult both modeling approaches were fitted to presence absence pa data and a combined hurdle model for the hurdle model a gam was fitted to cpue with cpue 0 data using the classical approach pirls and using inla and the resulting predictions were subsequently multiplied with the results of the pa model to consider time dependency both the gam and r inla were run for each year separately a k fold cross validation approach with 4 folds was applied to compare the predictive skill of the different model types the fit was assessed with the area under the response curve auc swets 1988 for the presence absence and with the root mean squared error rmse for the hurdle model the results of this assessment showed that for this study inla does not outperform the less time consuming fitting method used in a gam therefore gam was chosen and will be described in more detail in the following paragraph for more information about the comparison of these two sdms see appendix 1 presence absence data were modelled using a gam with the canonical link logit for the hurdle model also cpue data was modelled with a non zero abundance gam c p u e cpue 0 using the gamma distribution with a log link to assess the abundance 1 l o g i t p a s l a t l o n k 10 and 2 l o g c p u e s l a t l o n k 10 with lat and lon representing sampling locations p a and c p u e being the modelled dependent variables respectively the s lat lon smoother is a thin plate regression spline wood 2003 using the basis dimensions k wood 2017 the results were then used to predict the occurrence and the presence in survey catches on a spatial grid implemented in ecospace i e 0 125 x 0 125 consequently the hurdle model hurd was applied combining the resulting predictions of the two models p a and c p u e 3 h u r d p a c p u e finally all model predictions were standardized between 0 and 1 dividing all predictions by their annual maximum for the later use in ecospace in some cases the annual cpue was n 10 and could not be modelled for these specific years pertains six fgs even though over all the species were well represented within the data in these cases maps from the previous year were taken see appendix b 2 4 ecospace scenarios eight scenarios were tested to evaluate the influence of the different habitat preferences representations pa versus hurdle and to address the second aim of the paper the analysis of the best input frequency each representation was applied at each frequency table 1 the baseline scenario was used to compare the originally static version of ecospace to the time dynamic foraging capacity for each scenario skill assessments for the model predictions of biomass and catch have been conducted for all fgs that have been fitted to time series in the underlying ecosim table 2 see appendix b for a list of fgs used for the skill assessment before calculating fit statistics these biomass and catch time series were smoothed by applying a gam to represent general trends furthermore since the reference time series of biomass and catch are relative measures only they were scaled to the absolute values resulting from ecospace for more information see appendix b we used a set of measures for the skill assessment they inform about either the temporal the spatial or the spatial temporal fit of ecospace the root mean square error rmse describes the distance between simulated and observed time series model efficiency mef is a measure of model skill with respect to the range of natural variations a value 0 indicates a close match between the time series while values 0 indicate that a constant value would be a better predictor than the simulations stow et al 2009 in this study for biomass and catch the mef was calculated in relation to the biomass or catch value of the base year 1991 to assess the spatial fit of the different scenarios the schoener s d index was used it serves as a metric to calculate spatial niche overlap and therefore enabling the spatial comparison between the sdms and ecospace it is based on the probability of occurrence ranging from 0 no match to 1 maps are identical schoener 1968 warren et al 2008 here we applied the hurdle based habitat preference maps from the sdm models a second time not as input maps into ecospace but as a reference of observed habitat preferences we used the hurdle maps rather than the pa maps because they include species abundance here survey based cpue and not just presence absence and the resulting maps in ecospace are representing biomass rather than just presence absence distributions to avoid confusion with the hurdle scenarios it will be called abundance reference from here on the overlap was therefore calculated between the ecospace biomass distributions at the end of every year and the abundance reference spatially resolved catch data for the entire time period in this study was not available therefore a comparison between observed fishing distribution and spatially disaggregated ecospace catch results was not an option we calculated the pearson correlation pear between reference time series used in ecosim for catch and catch results derived from ecospace as an additional metric to evaluate the fit of the model in terms of spatially aggregated catch thresholds were applied to assess the number of fgs that achieve a good fit in relation to a satisfactory threshold some of the thresholds were chosen ad hoc others were defined based on their general range like schoener s d index additionally a taylor diagram taylor 2001 was created between the abundance reference and the scenario outputs to directly evaluate the spatial temporal fit each grid cell of each year for each fg was compared between observation and scenario output to account for differences in space and time 3 results 3 1 comparison of ecospace scenarios biomass the model fit of ecospace was evaluated for three aspects temporal spatial and spatial temporal fit and for two variables catch and biomass results for the skill assessment metrics evaluating the temporal fit of the mean biomass revealed that scenarios forced with capacity maps from pa gams provide better fits than the scenarios that were forced with capacity maps from the hurdle model table 3 among the pa forced scenarios the multi year scenario achieved the best results for mef and rmse while the static baseline scenario performed worst in terms of rmse in contrast to the pa scenarios the temporally variable hurdle scenarios performed worse than the static baseline scenario in the case of metrics that evaluate the temporal fit the seasonal hurdle scenario had to be excluded from all following skill assessments since it resulted in the depletion of the fg mature herring implying a bad fit already within the ecospace run when comparing the spatial distribution of the abundance reference with the ecospace maps the schoener s d index showed the best results for the temporally variable hurdle scenarios all pa scenarios followed this and the worst fit was achieved with the static hurdle baseline scenario evaluating individual schoener s d indices on fg level revealed only small differences within the pa or hurdle scenarios therefore in the following only the example of the pa annual scenario is discussed in detail see appendix b for the other individual results only two of the thirty two fgs with foraging capacity maps displayed medians below the threshold of 0 5 for the individual schoener s d indices fig 3 gurnards and herring adult had the worst fits in all pa scenarios with time dynamic maps some fgs showed a large range of values in between years e g monkfish norway pout thornback and spotted ray while others showed outliers identified by the boxplot there was no evident correlation between the trophic level and the fit of the model in addition there was no evident difference between fgs for which the foraging capacity was forced by habitat preference maps based on data of the ibts and the bts survey due to sampling design the former were forced by a mean map between q1 and q3 while maps based on data collected in q3 only forced the latter multi stanza fgs displayed no pattern within these results ranking mef of all scenarios 1 best to 7 worst for the different fgs individually revealed differences in the best fitting scenarios fig 4 the pa multi years scenario showed the worst fit for only two fgs which also reflected the general trend towards the multi year scenario as the one with the best fit for biomass fgs for which this scenario had the worst fit were nephrops and sandeels for most fgs the temporally variable hurdle scenarios ranked lowest among the mef as expected based on the summarized results over all fgs nevertheless some fgs seemed to benefit from these scenarios the majority being mostly fgs with quite low trophic levels the pa baseline scenario also showed fifteen ranks five and higher while the hurdle baseline scenario shows twenty three ranks five and higher this indicates that adding variability in the foraging capacity during the run by updating the habitat maps increases the mef overall the preference for scenarios between the different fgs was quite diverse there was no evident pattern or clustering based on trophic levels or ecological niches what became apparent was the dominance of the pa scenarios over the hurdle scenarios when condensing the fgs into larger groups and calculating the mean rank for the mefs of the scenarios the hurdle baseline or the hurdle multi year scenario have a positive effect only on other demersal fish and crustaceans the latter being the only group where solely a hurdle scenario is beneficial mean biomass over time evaluated for four commercially important fgs mature cod whiting sole and plaice as examples revealed distinctive patterns for each scenario fig 5 these displayed fgs were subjected to different kinds of spatial temporal forcing the foraging capacity of cod adult and whiting adult was based on the ibts survey thus the maps varied for q1 and q3 they were therefore the class of fgs that were directly influenced by changing foraging capacity within the seasonal scenario for sole adult on the other hand the distribution was based on the bts survey so solely on q3 plaice adult is shown as an example of fgs which was only forced by the distribution of the connected stanza plaice juvenile and a static basemap therefore within these four fgs there was an increase in complexity of forcing all four revealed that the hurdle scenarios which represented the abundance based maps underestimated the biomass for these fgs in most cases especially in the beginning of the run only in the case of cod adult the annual and multi years hurdle biomass exceeded the reference time series after 2000 in most cases for the pa scenarios the trend depicted in the ecospace scenarios matched those of the time series and with increased periodicity of map input the peaks of the reference time series were being matched what did become apparent especially in the case of pa scenarios was that steep and abrupt changes in biomass were not accounted for in all ecospace scenarios the steep decrease of cod adult biomass beginning in 1998 was not represented additionally there was a lack of biomass decrease for plaice adult and sole adult in the beginning of the time series to evaluate the temporal and spatial fit in combination the correlation and the centered root mean squared error rmse between ecospace biomass layers and the abundance reference for all scenarios were evaluated with a taylor diagram fig 6 within this diagram the abundance reference is represented by the circle labeled observation therefore the closer a symbol for the scenario is to the observation the better the fit for this analysis the variation between the standard deviation of the ecospace output and the observed abundance reference was smaller for the hurdle scenarios this was to be expected since the abundance reference is the output of the hurdle sdm therefore the spatial overlap is closely related yet the pa scenarios result in better rmse and correlation than the hurdle scenarios within the hurdle scenarios the annual scenario had the best correlation and rmse which were quite similar for the other two scenarios yet these two scenarios hurdle multi years and hurdle baseline perform better in terms of standard deviation for pa the three temporally variable scenarios reached quite similar results while the static baseline scenario had a better standard deviation but a worse correlation and rmse 3 2 comparison of ecospace scenarios catch since the distribution of catch was not based on a gam and has therefore no spatially resolved maps to compare to the catch skill assessment only evaluates the temporal fit it is based on a comparison between the observed relative time series included in ecosim and the mean catch values obtained from the different ecospace scenarios table 4 the metrics used to distinguish between the fits of the models shown here were mef rmse and pear similar to biomass the time dynamic hurdle scenarios showed the worst fit in all metrics while the hurdle baseline scenario comes close to the results achieved with the pa scenarios overall the seasonal as well as the multi years pa scenario showed the best fit supporting once more the decision towards a multi year pa scenario a more concise picture emerged based on the ranked mef for the single fgs fig 7 similar to biomass and expected based on the skill assessment metrics table the temporally variable hurdle scenarios showed the worst fit for most of the fgs only for a few foraging fish demersal fish and flatfish the fit was better for these scenarios especially for the higher trophic levels the annual hurdle scenario almost always resulted in the worst overall mef this was also reflected in the grouped mef ranks displayed by the fg silhouette in different colors the pa seasonal and the pa multi years scenario showed the best fit for most of the ecological groups three times red pa seasonal and four times orange pa multi years the hurdle baseline scenario had a good fit for three of the ecological groups but also received the lowest rank seven times this shows a high variation in model fit for the different scenarios among the ecological groups especially when it comes to the hurdle scenario the two annual scenarios and the hurdle multi years scenario did not achieve the best grouped mef for any ecological group mean catch over time was analyzed for the same fgs as for biomass in section 3 1 they therefore underlie the same foraging capacity forcing fig 8 the increasing variability over time was visible here as well but not quite as apparent as for biomass the pa based scenarios matched the time series especially in trend and in most cases they matched the observations yet here again the southern north sea ecospace model failed to account for strong changes in the catch time series as it was visible for biomass time series comparison of cod adult the hurdle scenario on the other hand completely underestimated the catch for cod plaice and sole especially in the beginning of the time series in most cases even the trend was not that precise within the hurdle scenarios overall the results showed that the fit of these scenarios differed between the different metrics applied and that each aspect had to be taken into account temporal spatial and spatial temporal even between catch and biomass the scenarios with the best fit differed yet one concise result was the dominance of varying foraging capacity over time and the necessity of a broader definition of this capacity by applying maps based on presence absence table 5 4 discussion 4 1 goals insights and uncertainties within the spatial temporal framework of ewe it is now possible to combine habitat preference maps based on sdms with ecospace and update these maps during its execution one of the main goals of this study was to analyze the effect of implementing either presence absence or abundance based maps as habitat preferences into a mechanistic trophic food web model our study showed that the interpretation of habitat preference could largely affect model s outcomes and fits we demonstrate that it is necessary to select sdm settings that can inform habitat preference maps without overly constraining trophic or other processes to be addressed by the food web model this can be achieved by choosing a model with a sigmoidal response for instance the logistic model which leads to a spatial distribution allowing a broader foraging capacity than with a model with exponential response as the hurdle model furthermore the aim was to evaluate and illustrate the benefits of accounting for changes in habitat preferences over time all modeling performance metrics employed showed that accounting for changes over time leads to better fits than static maps additionally we displayed a way of how to assess the performance of an ecospace model outside of ewe this ecospace model is also subject to structural and parameter uncertainties building on two other components ecopath and ecosim ecospace already inherits uncertainties introduced by these like data on diets that stem from a single year only stäbler et al 2016 or missing processes as encountered for the stock dynamics of cod fig 5 these uncertainties may increase when combining sdms and models with trophic interactions there is a wide range of species distribution models guisan and zimmermann 2000 of which we tested two approaches to find the best model for our purposes furthermore it is an important issue that there is no standard routine to optimize ecospace parameterizations while for ecopath and ecosim there are implemented routines to evaluate the model fit and uncertainties steenbeek et al 2018 ecospace models have to be assessed outside of ewe we tried to overcome this shortcoming by creating a routine outside of ewe to evaluate the fitting performance of different scenarios by temporal and spatial comparisons to empirical data we were able to give insight into problems and pitfalls when combining sdm based distribution maps with trophodynamic modeling in ecospace which is quite a new approach therefore this work may serve as basis for further case studies and developments in this field 4 2 defining habitat capacity in combination with trophodynamic modeling implementing sdms into ecospace can be a good asset to make food web modeling more robust a recently published approach by coll et al 2019 implemented results from a bayesian sdm model either as foraging capacity maps or as environmental forcing function for their data poor case study the combination of both modeling techniques increased the fit compared to an ecospace that is not informed via sdm before the possibility of implementing foraging capacity maps sdms could only be incorporated by applying a response curve to environmental layers based on the sdm results chagaris 2013 for these it has to be decided on which factors to include and all chosen drivers have to be incorporated into ecospace separately grüss et al 2018 this envelope approach expects a certain mechanistic understanding of the different abiotic drivers that influence habitat preferences which brings about the possibility that certain influencing factors might be missed by this method nevertheless one advantage of this method is the flexibility of changing abiotic driver maps to existing preference functions to test for example climate change scenarios also it poses a good approach for models in populations and areas that are data poor coll et al 2019 for areas with good data availability like the southern north sea the need for previous knowledge about mechanistic processes can be overcome by applying sdms with latitude and longitude as predictors bypassing the necessity to include other abiotic factors that drive the distribution this may be sufficient to evaluate e g the impact of a closed area under the assumption of non changing foraging capacity however the way the single species gams were built for this study does not allow to test the influence of different environmental parameters in predictions and forecasts based on varying environmental factors e g analysis of the influence of climate change however other environmental factors can easily be incorporated into the gams for future endeavors e g núñez et al 2019 compared to coll et al 2019 we used the spatial temporal framework to update the habitat preferences derived from sdms directly as foraging capacity maps during the execution of ecospace rather than inducing changes in the abiotic driver maps connected to forcing functions implementing habitat preference maps within the spatial temporal framework opens the possibility to account for different influences and their strength over time steenbeek et al 2013 yet there is no common agreement on what habitat preferences to incorporate e g which abiotic and biotic factors and there are no clear guidelines on how to include these preferences into a complex ecosystem model where trophic interactions and fishing pressure have to be accounted for it was demonstrated that presence absence based habitat preferences overall performed better than the abundance weighted hurdle model based preferences this might be an effect of the data used as survey data constitute a representation of spatial abundance distributions in a single point of time but we would argue that it is rather a general effect of the mathematical profile underlying the models the presence absence model was fitted with a logit link resulting in a sigmoidal profile while the presence only model was fitted with a log link which results in an exponential profile combining these two models leads to an exponential profile for the final hurdle model while the sigmoidal profile allows a more general representation of distribution the exponential profile highlights the areas with high abundances both profiles come with benefits but also restrictions combining the sigmoidal profile with a trophodynamic model allows for enough flexibility for further interactions that might influence the habitat preference of a species moreover even though the hurdle scenarios yielded better results for the schoener s d index it showed that the more general approach of implementing the presence absence maps was able to represent the distribution of the single fgs as well when combined with the ecosystem model yet this profile lacks the opportunity to include known hot spots with high interests for the species and good foraging opportunities example maps in fig 9 the skill assessment of the hurdle model on the other hand showed that the implementation of maps based on an exponential profile creates too much spatial restriction this constraint can have multiple effects within a spatial food web model it can induce perfect overlap with the predator and fleets which leads to high pressure on the fg and not much space to escape alternatively as opposed to this there can be no or hardly any overlap with predators and fleets which in turn leads to an uncontrolled increase in biomass furthermore there can be no or just minimal overlap with the own prey which can lead to starvation implementing these habitat preferences into ecospace during the run raised the question on the best periodicity our results show that accounting for changes in distribution of species over time increases the overall fit of the model to spatial temporal data it could be argued that the hurdle scenarios with the generally inferior fit implied a different conclusion here the static baseline scenario had the best fit but this was only the case when concentrating on the metrics evaluating the temporal fit the spatial metric schoener s d index revealed that the static baseline scenario had the worst fit among all hurdle scenarios this implies that even though this scenario is good in reproducing temporal trends it does so on the cost of spatial redistribution and thus becoming more unrealistic compared to the other scenarios for catch the multi years scenario and the seasonal scenario displayed the best results most fishing habitats were created based on known fishing areas wide enough to redistribute the effort in case of shifts in habitat preferences therefore adapting to more rapid changes over time might not be as crucial as for biomass this is in line with findings by romagnoni et al 2015 who also found that changes in different parameters for their ecospace of the entire north sea iv a b and c affected biomass and catch differently this can be justified by the way effort is distributed in ecospace each fleet s effort is proportionally distributed over the cells by a gravity model dependent on the sum over the fgs biomass caught by the fleet times the off vessel prices and the catchability for each fg walters et al 1999 if the fishing area covers enough ground to react to shifts in distribution it follows the redistribution considering all results it reveals that in terms of periodicity the multi years scenario performs best yet the periodicity should support the time period one would like to study e g short period seasonal might work better long period seasonal may not be necessary annual or even multi years can suffice and the research questions the model was built for e g long term changes in the ecosystem vs effects of rapid increase of fishing mortality in the distribution of species furthermore changes within the ecosystem during the run were only represented by the changes in foraging capacity including monthly seasonal or annual changes of the chlorophyll a maps or accounting for changes in water temperature might be necessary to adequately represent the changes over time and to reach a better model fit 4 3 best practice suggestions for applying a spatial temporal framework to foraging capacity and shortcomings identified there are several key best practice suggestions arising from this study for forcing the foraging capacity via the new ecospace spatial temporal capabilities first when applying scaled habitat preferences predicted with sdms as foraging capacity the best performing sdm may not be the best to use in an ecosystem model context although the exponential profile of the hurdle model has a better representation of the cpue data ecospace performed worse when fed with its output this is likely because the sigmoidal profile of the presence absence maps is more informative as overall habitat capacity measure and additionally more flexible towards further mechanistic structures within the ecosystem model and therefore improving our knowledge on habitat preferences implementing time dynamic maps is the preferred option over a constant base map time dynamic maps are an important improvement in ecospace especially in times of climate change where in future work the temporal shift in temperature can be accounted for within the foraging capacity maps the study also identifies a few caveats first there is still no automated routine to evaluate the fit of ecospace we chose to test the fits using a set of skill assessment metrics and it has proven a good way to find the settings with the best fit it is important to apply a wide set of different metrics to assess the fit of an ecosystem model to account for the temporal and spatial fit olsen et al 2016 model efficiency with the value for the base year 1991 as well as the pearson correlation for catch and root mean squared error served as metrics that informed about the mean temporal fit over the years nevertheless these metrics did not account for spatial dynamics in habitat preference maps over time when compared to the empirical time series this could be accomplished with the schoener s d index which measures the niche overlap and therefore allows the spatial comparison between the ecospace output maps and the abundance reference the combination of the spatial and temporal fit could be achieved with the taylor diagram comparing ecospace and abundance reference standardized maps for all years per grid cell one major issue within ecospace is the current inability to react to situations like partial spatial mismatch between predator and prey by changing vulnerabilities based on occurrences in space vulnerabilities are only fitted to ecosim time series not taking the amount of spatial overlap into account as done with this model for brown shrimp changing single vulnerabilities within ecosim is possible and justifiable too much pressure of the adult stanza on the juvenile while they are both common within a narrow area at the coast nevertheless there is no other way than visibly checking the fit and using skill metrics as done here to validate the changes an automated routine like the automated fitting routine for vulnerabilities and primary production splines applicable to ecosim mackinson et al 2009 scott et al 2016 would be a necessary improvement to account for species overlap in narrow areas additionally as seen in fig 5 most sharp changes of biomass compared to the observation are hard to meet in this complex ecosystem model especially steep downward trends within the time series as seen for cod sole and plaice have proven to be a challenge there is a need for additional spatial processes for example by implementing mediation functions or account for biomass accumulation based on spatial conditions to match these trends and to force a steeper biomass trend in ecospace when fitting ecospace multi stanza groups have to be fitted with caution as seen in this study for plaice distributions of juveniles and adults of the same species are linked through the implementation of multi stanza group settings walters et al 2010 so it may improve the fit if forcing of stanzas distributions separately were possible therefore the distribution of plaice was driven by forcing the foraging capacity of only the juvenile life history stage over time to avoid overfitting the model in agreement with the schoener s d index the results showed a good niche overlap for the spatial distribution of plaice juvenile and adults confirming that forcing the foraging capacity of only one of the two multi stanza was sufficient to drive spatial distributions of both stages for highly cannibalistic groups however it might be necessary to force one part of the multi stanza e g by migration to spawning grounds to account for changes that only apply to one species life stage this would be particular relevant when using multi stanza for species that have very different ecological and trophic ontogenetic changes across their life stages e g eggs larvae juveniles and adults even though the schoener s d index of most fgs surpassed the threshold there is a difference in variability fig 3 the highest variabilities are displayed in pelagic fgs and fgs where the survey coverage might not have been extensive enough this has two implications first it is important to carefully select fgs and the corresponding data when applying sdms to ecospace the smaller the data coverage for the sdm the more variability in the spatial fit second ecospace seems to perform better when reproducing spatial distributions of more spatially bound fgs than for the fast moving pelagic fgs 5 conclusion in our study the new capabilities of ecospace have proven to be a beneficial asset when reconstructing species spatial distributions and their shifts over time it also showed that in an ecosystem model like the one for the southern north sea implementing temporally changing habitat preferences maps based on pa on a sigmoidal profile generate better results than an exponential profile based on cpue furthermore combining sdms with this trophic model has the potential to further inform about habitat preferences that include biotic interactions introduced by ecospace nevertheless our knowledge about the best practice in the new spatial temporal external foraging capacity implementation could benefit from testing further strategies of fitting in the future the new capabilities inside ecospace can be applied to assess changes in ecological indicators over time as well as to test different management strategies within the framework of marine spatial planning in the light of climate change it is possible to test how ecosystems react to temperature driven foraging capacities finally there is not one best practice how to construct an ecosystem model as with all models the best model is always the one that best answers your research question in your part of the world s oceans and the best periodicity might differ between models and research questions however our study adds insights on the impact of habitat capacity maps on ecospace results and helps to identify the issues that need to be taken into account when using sdms as

24812,one of the most applied tools to create ecosystem models to support management decisions in the light of ecosystem based fisheries management is ecopath with ecosim ewe recently its spatial routine ecospace has evolved due to the addition of the habitat foraging capacity model hfcm a spatial temporal dynamic niche model to drive the foraging capacity to distribute biomass over model grid cells the hfcm allows for continuous implementation of externally derived habitat preference maps based on single species distribution models so far guidelines are lacking on how to best define habitat preferences for inclusion in process oriented trophic modeling studies as one of the first studies we applied the newest ecospace development to an existing ewe model of the southern north sea with the aim to identify which definition of habitat preference leads to the best model fit another key aim of our study was to test for the sensitivity of implementing externally derived habitat preference maps within ecospace to different time scales seasonal yearly multi year and static for this purpose generalized additive models gam were fit to scientific survey data using either presence absence or abundance as differing criteria of habitat preference our results show that ecospace runs using habitat preference maps based on presence absence data compared best to empirical data the optimal time scale for habitat updating differed for biomass and catch but implementing variable habitats was generally superior to a static habitat representation our study hence highlights the importance of a sigmoidal representation of habitat e g presence absence and variable habitat preferences e g multi year when combining species distribution models with an ecosystem model it demonstrates that the interpretation of habitat preference can have a major influence on the model fit and outcome keywords ecospace spatial temporal framework habitat capacity species distribution model food web model ecopath with ecosim 1 introduction habitat preference of species is a widely known concept in ecology first defined as the tendency of a species to choose one resource over another if both are equally available johnson et al 1980 since then multiple definitions and extensions of the concept have been suggested e g rosenzweig and abramsky 1986 hall et al 1997 aarts et al 2008 next to numerous definitions of habitat itself and whether it comprises only abiotic factors or biotic relationships as well e g darwin 1859 allee et al 2000 valentine et al 2005 these different interpretations of habitat and habitat preferences or lack of a common definition might lead to miscommunication between and misinterpretations by scientists hall et al 1997 additionally there are still ongoing discussions about how to quantify habitat preferences in the light of their use and availability beyer et al 2010 modeling these preferences faces certain problems such as an unequal access of individuals to all habitats and areas as well as variations of habitat availability and quality over time garshelis 2000 combining a spatially resolved trophic ecosystem model with habitat preference maps based on single species distribution models sdm can be a solution to better account for habitat preferences within the ecosystem model in the recent years spatially explicit ecosystem models are increasingly being applied to study the effects of climate change spatial fisheries management or to support marine spatial planning e g romagnoni et al 2015 alexander et al 2016 bossier et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to establish best practices when it comes to working with spatially explicit ecosystem models as well as protocols on how to best combine these ecosystem models with sdms a popular ecosystem modeling approach with an increasing number of models worldwide is implemented in the ecopath with ecosim software ewe christensen et al 2004 colleter et al 2015 heymans et al 2016 ewe encompasses three modeling components the static mass balanced ecopath that is used to construct a snapshot of the trophic food web of individual species or functional groups fgs originally proposed by polovina 1984 and further developed since christensen and pauly 1992 the temporal simulation module ecosim uses the ecopath parameterization as a baseline to assess ecosystem dynamics over time with the main goal to evaluate the impact of environmental stressors and fisheries on the ecosystem walters et al 1997 2000 ecospace adds the spatial dimension to the model walters et al 1999 christensen et al 2014 providing a routine which allows for impact analysis of spatial management measures such as marine protected areas and physical structures like wind farms christensen and walters 2004 many ecopath and ecosim models have been published in the past while publications applying ecospace are comparably rare but increase in appearance recently colleter et al 2015 in recent releases of the ewe software the options to inform ecospace about habitat preferences have become very flexible one of the first possibilities was to assign absence presence preferences connected to static habitat layers implemented in the basemap to include multiple environmental stressors a new habitat foraging capacity model hfcm was implemented that allowed the user to implement continuous rather than binary habitat preferences christensen et al 2014 the foraging capacity of a cell is based on the foraging arena theory implemented in ecosim defining the capacity of a cell for a predator to forage on a prey ahrens et al 2012 it is used as a multiplier to the search area a in the foraging arena equation christensen et al 2014 from here on multiple cumulative environmental drivers could also affect the computed foraging capacity of the fgs in a given cell implemented via environmental preference functions this increased the variation between the cells to distribute the fgs over the map where they are most likely to occur christensen et al 2014 furthermore it opened the opportunity to close the gap between sdms and ecosystem models by allowing the user to implement environmental response functions derived from sdms grüss et al 2016 one of the most recent improvements to relate fgs distributions in ecospace directly to scientific surveys is the possibility to implement scaled habitat preferences predicted by external sdms directly as foraging capacity maps into ecospace fig 1 this increases the interchangeability between different model types further thus far temporal abundance changes of each fg in ecosim are reproduced in each grid cell of ecospace the new spatial temporal data framework allows for time dynamic inclusion of geospatial data such as habitat maps during each ecospace run steenbeek et al 2013 including dynamically changing environmental driver maps and a dynamic redistribution of biomass based on species environmental preferences allows for a better representation of changes in the physical habitat christensen et al 2014 this also allows implementing time dynamic foraging capacity maps based on external sdms during the ecospace run this enables the modeler to bypass the necessity to enter environmental preference functions in ecospace implementing these maps can be done just like the environmental driver maps in different temporal frequencies e g seasonally annually or once every few years to integrate them with the computed foraging capacity and to account for shifts in habitat preferences over the period of the model run increases the realism in distributing the biomass of fgs over the grid cells combining the single species distribution modeling approach with a trophic ecosystem model in this way bears potentials to increase our knowledge on impacts of changes in biotic and abiotic factors on species and fisheries yield this increases ecospace usefulness as a support tool for spatial management decisions the application of this approach to many fgs simultaneously in a strongly exploited ecosystem like the north sea has so far not been reported neither has the test for the sensitivity of different implementation frequencies of external foraging capacity maps which might show how inertia and sensitivity of the ecosystem model differs with forcing frequencies therefore this study aims to analyze which representation of habitat preference best serves to create foraging capacity maps and is capable to interact with the information contributed by the tropho dynamic model furthermore the sensitivity of the updating frequency of foraging capacity maps e g seasonal annual multiannual on ecospace s biomass and catch predictions compared to the empirical data is being evaluated 2 material and methods 2 1 ecopath with ecosim model of the southern north sea our ecospace model is based on a previously published ewe model stäbler et al 2016 representing the ecosystem of the southern north sea in the base year 1991 up to 2010 statistical areas ivb and ivc defined by the international council for the exploration of the sea ices the southern north sea model has a focus on commercially important species and higher trophic levels and comprises 68 groups of which 35 represent multi species groups and 30 single species particulate organic matter dissolved organic matter and discards are represented in three additional groups life history changes are implemented for seven commercially important species cod gadus morhua whiting merlangius merlangus haddock melanogrammus aeglefinus herring clupea harengus sole solea solea plaice pleuronectes platessa and brown shrimp crangon crangon through the multi stanza approach walters et al 2010 these stanzas characterize juvenile and adult life stages of the fish species while brown shrimp was split according to the body size they need to reach to be targeted by the fishery fishery exploitation is implemented in the model through twelve fleets representing the diversity of the fishing sector in this region there have been several adaptations to the original ecopath and ecosim model of the southern north sea these were changes in the diet matrix and the addition of off vessel prices in ecopath as well as some changes to the reference time series in ecosim for more detail see appendix a to account for these alterations in ecopath and ecosim we used the new stepwise fitting routine to fit predator prey vulnerabilities and primary production anomaly splines that resulted in the lowest discrepancies between the model and the observed time series scott et al 2016 the fitting routine automatically repeats the sensitivity search and ecosim runs with an increasing number of vulnerability parameters these different parameterizations towards reference time series were fitted the resulting measures of fit include residual sum of squares ss log scaled biomass catches and akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 the ecosim settings with the lowest aics aics that differed more than 2 compared to the lowest aic were excluded were then tested for their model efficiency see table 2 stow et al 2009 in reproducing the reference time series of biomass and catch for further information on this ecopath and ecosim model of the southern north sea see stäbler et al 2016 2018 2019 and appendix a 2 2 ecospace of the southern north sea the software used to construct the ecospace model is ewe version 6 6 professional edition and fit to time series for the period 1991 2010 and run in monthly time steps as a basis for distributing biomasses simulated by ecosim in space a basemap of the study area was constructed as a georeferenced esri american standard code for information interchange map esri ascii with a resolution of 0 125 per edge length of each grid cell the bounding box for the study area ranged from 4 to 9 longitude and from 51 to 57 25 latitude we assigned static habitats to the basemap encompassing various sediment structures a distance to coast measure and fishing habitats all habitat maps were binary defined by 1 present and 0 not present sediment types were derived from the european marine observation and data network emodnet 2017 using a seabed substrate map that includes five substrate classes mud to muddy sand sand coarse sediment mixed sediment rock and boulders to account for seabirds living close to the coast to breed on land the habitats near coast and marine were added the 12 nautical mile zone representing territorial waters of each surrounding country was used as a proxy to separate coastal from offshore areas additionally depth was included as an environmental driver ranging from 0 to 100 m data used to reproduce the bathymetry of the study area was retrieved from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco 2019 these have a higher resolution than ecospace therefore within each grid cell the mean depth was taken and then classified into ten discrete depth categories in ten meter intervals starting with 5 m fishing effort allocation across the grid implements the effect of spatially explicit exploitation christensen et al 2008 christensen and walters 2004 walters et al 1999 usually fishing fleets are assigned simply to the same habitats as fgs targeted in order to distribute fishing effort on the basemap we attempted a more realistic representation of the spatial dynamics of the fisheries using spatially resolved effective fishing effort data scientific technical and economic committee for fisheries 2017 however for a few fleets that have very specific target fgs like sandeel and nephrops trawlers the fleets follow the distribution of these fgs while all others were assigned to the before mentioned habitat structures mean annual primary production was added to the basemap as a static layer based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis ocean color data from 2002 to the present behrenfeld and falkowski 1997 http www science oregonstate edu ocean productivity index php and was kept constant over time to solely examine the influence of varying foraging capacity ecospace takes a habitat preference approach and allocates ecosim s biomass dynamically over a basemap of grid cells with respective preferred and non preferred habitats the spatial allocation of the biomass is based on the foraging capacity for each fg within a cell within cells with preferred habitats fgs have increased feeding rates allowing for increased growth rate and survival rates outside of these cells dispersal rates which depict random movement within the model area may be higher to escape the non preferred habitats christensen et al 2008 in the hfcm the computed foraging capacity within ecospace can be overwritten by external foraging capacity or multiplied by cell specific habitat capacity and environmental capacity as external foraging capacity scaled habitat preference maps predicted by sdms can be integrated into ecospace directly these maps have the same spatial extent and resolution as the ecospace basemap and each grid cell has a specific foraging capacity between 0 and 1 assigned to from here on habitat preferences refers to the predicted results of the sdms while they are referred to as external foraging capacity as soon as they enter ecospace to overwrite the computed foraging capacity in addition ecospace can calculate foraging capacity from fgs affinity for given habitats and from fgs functional responses to environmental conditions habitat capacity is based on the habitat layers implemented in the basemap here sediment and distance to coast each habitat type gets a proportion assigned of how suitable the habitat is for a certain fg environmental capacity is based on environmental driver maps here depth it is being ascertained by applying an environmental response function specific to each fg to the environmental driver map all aforementioned possibilities within ecospace can be applied individually or combined fig 2 in this study foraging capacity for most fgs was pre defined by external foraging capacity maps while for some fgs the foraging capacity was calculated from affinity for habitats and or environmental preferences distributions for six fgs were affected though habitat affinities while for eleven fgs an environmental response function depending on depth was implemented foraging capacity maps for 32 fgs were driven from external habitat preferences through the spatial temporal data framework see fig 1 the multi stanza modus of ecospace computes the distributions of multi stanza groups to be highly correlated within each group which sometimes leads to a better fit if only one of the stanzas is distributed by temporarily changing the foraging capacity we followed this approach for the fg plaice where only the distribution of the juvenile stanza was driven by its foraging capacity the adult stanzas distribution was a result of the distribution of juveniles as well as presence of predators and prey for crangon the stanza smaller than commercial catch size followed the distribution of the stanza targeted by fisheries in ecospace biomass is time variant within a cell even if no external forcing occurred since a fraction of biomass is always dispersing randomly around the basemap represented by the dispersal rate km year the base dispersal rate set as default within ecospace is 300 km year except for detritus christensen et al 2008 for our model we chose five different dispersal rates to represent the mobility of fgs based on their life form i e 1000 km year for fast top predators 600 km year for pelagic fgs 300 km year for faster moving demersal fish fgs 30 km year for mainly flat fish and zooplankton fgs 3 km year for nearly stationary or sessile groups primarily benthic fgs these dispersal rates were chosen based on the general 300 30 3 rule similar to chen et al 2009 expanding the classes for more differentiation in speed using a custom built plug in for ewe each ecospace run was started with a 10 year spin up or burn in period to stabilize fg distributions for more details about the ecospace structure see the appendix a 2 3 species distribution models the new spatial temporal data framework within ecospace allows for the implementation of time dynamic foraging capacity maps these are habitat preferences generated by sdms prior to implementation and then applied directly as foraging capacity with a range of 0 1 this method was applied for thirty two fgs representing most single species fgs including six multi stanza groups and eleven multi species fgs see appendix a these groups represent mainly commercially important species and also groups that were well represented within the scientific surveys that sampled the data used for the sdms data on species abundance for this analysis was gathered from two different surveys due to the different catchability of the surveys for certain groups catch per unit effort data cpue number per hour from quarter 3 q3 only sampled quarter of the ices beam trawl survey bts from 1991 to 2010 was used for juvenile and adult sole solea solea brill scophthalmus rhombus and turbot scophthalmus maximus long rough dab hippoglossoides platessoides and monkfish lophius piscatorius for the remaining 25 fgs cpue data was used for quarter 1 q1 and q3 of the ices international bottom trawl survey ibts from 1991 to 2010 see appendix a for the chosen timeframe q1 and q3 are the only two quarters that were sampled continuously one of the major aims of this study is to identify the best representation of habitat preference when combining an sdm with a trophic food web model we tested two representations in this study a more general representation based on binary data presence absence model versus one that accounts for gradations in quality by considering abundance hurdle model the idea is to identify if a sigmoidal or an exponential response is best suited when combined with the trophic model the hurdle model contains binary presence absence and continuous response abundance sub models that are applied to the data separately and the predicted distribution resulting them are being multiplied at the end cragg 1971 maunder and punt 2004 a hurdle model approach is widely used in sdms due to its ability to deal with data sets that contain a high number of zeros i e zero inflated in their recent published paper coll et al 2019 used bayesian models integrated nested laplace approximation inla to create single fg distribution maps we tested the applicability of inla for our study against the fitting method commonly used for generalized additive models gam hastie and tibshirani 1986 i e pirls penalized iteratively re weighted least squares the gams were created using the mgcv package wood 2009 while inla was applied with the r inla package rue et al 2009 due to high computational costs we modelled only key groups with either high commercial importance or a small sample size cod adult whiting adult starry ray others sole adult and plaice adult both modeling approaches were fitted to presence absence pa data and a combined hurdle model for the hurdle model a gam was fitted to cpue with cpue 0 data using the classical approach pirls and using inla and the resulting predictions were subsequently multiplied with the results of the pa model to consider time dependency both the gam and r inla were run for each year separately a k fold cross validation approach with 4 folds was applied to compare the predictive skill of the different model types the fit was assessed with the area under the response curve auc swets 1988 for the presence absence and with the root mean squared error rmse for the hurdle model the results of this assessment showed that for this study inla does not outperform the less time consuming fitting method used in a gam therefore gam was chosen and will be described in more detail in the following paragraph for more information about the comparison of these two sdms see appendix 1 presence absence data were modelled using a gam with the canonical link logit for the hurdle model also cpue data was modelled with a non zero abundance gam c p u e cpue 0 using the gamma distribution with a log link to assess the abundance 1 l o g i t p a s l a t l o n k 10 and 2 l o g c p u e s l a t l o n k 10 with lat and lon representing sampling locations p a and c p u e being the modelled dependent variables respectively the s lat lon smoother is a thin plate regression spline wood 2003 using the basis dimensions k wood 2017 the results were then used to predict the occurrence and the presence in survey catches on a spatial grid implemented in ecospace i e 0 125 x 0 125 consequently the hurdle model hurd was applied combining the resulting predictions of the two models p a and c p u e 3 h u r d p a c p u e finally all model predictions were standardized between 0 and 1 dividing all predictions by their annual maximum for the later use in ecospace in some cases the annual cpue was n 10 and could not be modelled for these specific years pertains six fgs even though over all the species were well represented within the data in these cases maps from the previous year were taken see appendix b 2 4 ecospace scenarios eight scenarios were tested to evaluate the influence of the different habitat preferences representations pa versus hurdle and to address the second aim of the paper the analysis of the best input frequency each representation was applied at each frequency table 1 the baseline scenario was used to compare the originally static version of ecospace to the time dynamic foraging capacity for each scenario skill assessments for the model predictions of biomass and catch have been conducted for all fgs that have been fitted to time series in the underlying ecosim table 2 see appendix b for a list of fgs used for the skill assessment before calculating fit statistics these biomass and catch time series were smoothed by applying a gam to represent general trends furthermore since the reference time series of biomass and catch are relative measures only they were scaled to the absolute values resulting from ecospace for more information see appendix b we used a set of measures for the skill assessment they inform about either the temporal the spatial or the spatial temporal fit of ecospace the root mean square error rmse describes the distance between simulated and observed time series model efficiency mef is a measure of model skill with respect to the range of natural variations a value 0 indicates a close match between the time series while values 0 indicate that a constant value would be a better predictor than the simulations stow et al 2009 in this study for biomass and catch the mef was calculated in relation to the biomass or catch value of the base year 1991 to assess the spatial fit of the different scenarios the schoener s d index was used it serves as a metric to calculate spatial niche overlap and therefore enabling the spatial comparison between the sdms and ecospace it is based on the probability of occurrence ranging from 0 no match to 1 maps are identical schoener 1968 warren et al 2008 here we applied the hurdle based habitat preference maps from the sdm models a second time not as input maps into ecospace but as a reference of observed habitat preferences we used the hurdle maps rather than the pa maps because they include species abundance here survey based cpue and not just presence absence and the resulting maps in ecospace are representing biomass rather than just presence absence distributions to avoid confusion with the hurdle scenarios it will be called abundance reference from here on the overlap was therefore calculated between the ecospace biomass distributions at the end of every year and the abundance reference spatially resolved catch data for the entire time period in this study was not available therefore a comparison between observed fishing distribution and spatially disaggregated ecospace catch results was not an option we calculated the pearson correlation pear between reference time series used in ecosim for catch and catch results derived from ecospace as an additional metric to evaluate the fit of the model in terms of spatially aggregated catch thresholds were applied to assess the number of fgs that achieve a good fit in relation to a satisfactory threshold some of the thresholds were chosen ad hoc others were defined based on their general range like schoener s d index additionally a taylor diagram taylor 2001 was created between the abundance reference and the scenario outputs to directly evaluate the spatial temporal fit each grid cell of each year for each fg was compared between observation and scenario output to account for differences in space and time 3 results 3 1 comparison of ecospace scenarios biomass the model fit of ecospace was evaluated for three aspects temporal spatial and spatial temporal fit and for two variables catch and biomass results for the skill assessment metrics evaluating the temporal fit of the mean biomass revealed that scenarios forced with capacity maps from pa gams provide better fits than the scenarios that were forced with capacity maps from the hurdle model table 3 among the pa forced scenarios the multi year scenario achieved the best results for mef and rmse while the static baseline scenario performed worst in terms of rmse in contrast to the pa scenarios the temporally variable hurdle scenarios performed worse than the static baseline scenario in the case of metrics that evaluate the temporal fit the seasonal hurdle scenario had to be excluded from all following skill assessments since it resulted in the depletion of the fg mature herring implying a bad fit already within the ecospace run when comparing the spatial distribution of the abundance reference with the ecospace maps the schoener s d index showed the best results for the temporally variable hurdle scenarios all pa scenarios followed this and the worst fit was achieved with the static hurdle baseline scenario evaluating individual schoener s d indices on fg level revealed only small differences within the pa or hurdle scenarios therefore in the following only the example of the pa annual scenario is discussed in detail see appendix b for the other individual results only two of the thirty two fgs with foraging capacity maps displayed medians below the threshold of 0 5 for the individual schoener s d indices fig 3 gurnards and herring adult had the worst fits in all pa scenarios with time dynamic maps some fgs showed a large range of values in between years e g monkfish norway pout thornback and spotted ray while others showed outliers identified by the boxplot there was no evident correlation between the trophic level and the fit of the model in addition there was no evident difference between fgs for which the foraging capacity was forced by habitat preference maps based on data of the ibts and the bts survey due to sampling design the former were forced by a mean map between q1 and q3 while maps based on data collected in q3 only forced the latter multi stanza fgs displayed no pattern within these results ranking mef of all scenarios 1 best to 7 worst for the different fgs individually revealed differences in the best fitting scenarios fig 4 the pa multi years scenario showed the worst fit for only two fgs which also reflected the general trend towards the multi year scenario as the one with the best fit for biomass fgs for which this scenario had the worst fit were nephrops and sandeels for most fgs the temporally variable hurdle scenarios ranked lowest among the mef as expected based on the summarized results over all fgs nevertheless some fgs seemed to benefit from these scenarios the majority being mostly fgs with quite low trophic levels the pa baseline scenario also showed fifteen ranks five and higher while the hurdle baseline scenario shows twenty three ranks five and higher this indicates that adding variability in the foraging capacity during the run by updating the habitat maps increases the mef overall the preference for scenarios between the different fgs was quite diverse there was no evident pattern or clustering based on trophic levels or ecological niches what became apparent was the dominance of the pa scenarios over the hurdle scenarios when condensing the fgs into larger groups and calculating the mean rank for the mefs of the scenarios the hurdle baseline or the hurdle multi year scenario have a positive effect only on other demersal fish and crustaceans the latter being the only group where solely a hurdle scenario is beneficial mean biomass over time evaluated for four commercially important fgs mature cod whiting sole and plaice as examples revealed distinctive patterns for each scenario fig 5 these displayed fgs were subjected to different kinds of spatial temporal forcing the foraging capacity of cod adult and whiting adult was based on the ibts survey thus the maps varied for q1 and q3 they were therefore the class of fgs that were directly influenced by changing foraging capacity within the seasonal scenario for sole adult on the other hand the distribution was based on the bts survey so solely on q3 plaice adult is shown as an example of fgs which was only forced by the distribution of the connected stanza plaice juvenile and a static basemap therefore within these four fgs there was an increase in complexity of forcing all four revealed that the hurdle scenarios which represented the abundance based maps underestimated the biomass for these fgs in most cases especially in the beginning of the run only in the case of cod adult the annual and multi years hurdle biomass exceeded the reference time series after 2000 in most cases for the pa scenarios the trend depicted in the ecospace scenarios matched those of the time series and with increased periodicity of map input the peaks of the reference time series were being matched what did become apparent especially in the case of pa scenarios was that steep and abrupt changes in biomass were not accounted for in all ecospace scenarios the steep decrease of cod adult biomass beginning in 1998 was not represented additionally there was a lack of biomass decrease for plaice adult and sole adult in the beginning of the time series to evaluate the temporal and spatial fit in combination the correlation and the centered root mean squared error rmse between ecospace biomass layers and the abundance reference for all scenarios were evaluated with a taylor diagram fig 6 within this diagram the abundance reference is represented by the circle labeled observation therefore the closer a symbol for the scenario is to the observation the better the fit for this analysis the variation between the standard deviation of the ecospace output and the observed abundance reference was smaller for the hurdle scenarios this was to be expected since the abundance reference is the output of the hurdle sdm therefore the spatial overlap is closely related yet the pa scenarios result in better rmse and correlation than the hurdle scenarios within the hurdle scenarios the annual scenario had the best correlation and rmse which were quite similar for the other two scenarios yet these two scenarios hurdle multi years and hurdle baseline perform better in terms of standard deviation for pa the three temporally variable scenarios reached quite similar results while the static baseline scenario had a better standard deviation but a worse correlation and rmse 3 2 comparison of ecospace scenarios catch since the distribution of catch was not based on a gam and has therefore no spatially resolved maps to compare to the catch skill assessment only evaluates the temporal fit it is based on a comparison between the observed relative time series included in ecosim and the mean catch values obtained from the different ecospace scenarios table 4 the metrics used to distinguish between the fits of the models shown here were mef rmse and pear similar to biomass the time dynamic hurdle scenarios showed the worst fit in all metrics while the hurdle baseline scenario comes close to the results achieved with the pa scenarios overall the seasonal as well as the multi years pa scenario showed the best fit supporting once more the decision towards a multi year pa scenario a more concise picture emerged based on the ranked mef for the single fgs fig 7 similar to biomass and expected based on the skill assessment metrics table the temporally variable hurdle scenarios showed the worst fit for most of the fgs only for a few foraging fish demersal fish and flatfish the fit was better for these scenarios especially for the higher trophic levels the annual hurdle scenario almost always resulted in the worst overall mef this was also reflected in the grouped mef ranks displayed by the fg silhouette in different colors the pa seasonal and the pa multi years scenario showed the best fit for most of the ecological groups three times red pa seasonal and four times orange pa multi years the hurdle baseline scenario had a good fit for three of the ecological groups but also received the lowest rank seven times this shows a high variation in model fit for the different scenarios among the ecological groups especially when it comes to the hurdle scenario the two annual scenarios and the hurdle multi years scenario did not achieve the best grouped mef for any ecological group mean catch over time was analyzed for the same fgs as for biomass in section 3 1 they therefore underlie the same foraging capacity forcing fig 8 the increasing variability over time was visible here as well but not quite as apparent as for biomass the pa based scenarios matched the time series especially in trend and in most cases they matched the observations yet here again the southern north sea ecospace model failed to account for strong changes in the catch time series as it was visible for biomass time series comparison of cod adult the hurdle scenario on the other hand completely underestimated the catch for cod plaice and sole especially in the beginning of the time series in most cases even the trend was not that precise within the hurdle scenarios overall the results showed that the fit of these scenarios differed between the different metrics applied and that each aspect had to be taken into account temporal spatial and spatial temporal even between catch and biomass the scenarios with the best fit differed yet one concise result was the dominance of varying foraging capacity over time and the necessity of a broader definition of this capacity by applying maps based on presence absence table 5 4 discussion 4 1 goals insights and uncertainties within the spatial temporal framework of ewe it is now possible to combine habitat preference maps based on sdms with ecospace and update these maps during its execution one of the main goals of this study was to analyze the effect of implementing either presence absence or abundance based maps as habitat preferences into a mechanistic trophic food web model our study showed that the interpretation of habitat preference could largely affect model s outcomes and fits we demonstrate that it is necessary to select sdm settings that can inform habitat preference maps without overly constraining trophic or other processes to be addressed by the food web model this can be achieved by choosing a model with a sigmoidal response for instance the logistic model which leads to a spatial distribution allowing a broader foraging capacity than with a model with exponential response as the hurdle model furthermore the aim was to evaluate and illustrate the benefits of accounting for changes in habitat preferences over time all modeling performance metrics employed showed that accounting for changes over time leads to better fits than static maps additionally we displayed a way of how to assess the performance of an ecospace model outside of ewe this ecospace model is also subject to structural and parameter uncertainties building on two other components ecopath and ecosim ecospace already inherits uncertainties introduced by these like data on diets that stem from a single year only stäbler et al 2016 or missing processes as encountered for the stock dynamics of cod fig 5 these uncertainties may increase when combining sdms and models with trophic interactions there is a wide range of species distribution models guisan and zimmermann 2000 of which we tested two approaches to find the best model for our purposes furthermore it is an important issue that there is no standard routine to optimize ecospace parameterizations while for ecopath and ecosim there are implemented routines to evaluate the model fit and uncertainties steenbeek et al 2018 ecospace models have to be assessed outside of ewe we tried to overcome this shortcoming by creating a routine outside of ewe to evaluate the fitting performance of different scenarios by temporal and spatial comparisons to empirical data we were able to give insight into problems and pitfalls when combining sdm based distribution maps with trophodynamic modeling in ecospace which is quite a new approach therefore this work may serve as basis for further case studies and developments in this field 4 2 defining habitat capacity in combination with trophodynamic modeling implementing sdms into ecospace can be a good asset to make food web modeling more robust a recently published approach by coll et al 2019 implemented results from a bayesian sdm model either as foraging capacity maps or as environmental forcing function for their data poor case study the combination of both modeling techniques increased the fit compared to an ecospace that is not informed via sdm before the possibility of implementing foraging capacity maps sdms could only be incorporated by applying a response curve to environmental layers based on the sdm results chagaris 2013 for these it has to be decided on which factors to include and all chosen drivers have to be incorporated into ecospace separately grüss et al 2018 this envelope approach expects a certain mechanistic understanding of the different abiotic drivers that influence habitat preferences which brings about the possibility that certain influencing factors might be missed by this method nevertheless one advantage of this method is the flexibility of changing abiotic driver maps to existing preference functions to test for example climate change scenarios also it poses a good approach for models in populations and areas that are data poor coll et al 2019 for areas with good data availability like the southern north sea the need for previous knowledge about mechanistic processes can be overcome by applying sdms with latitude and longitude as predictors bypassing the necessity to include other abiotic factors that drive the distribution this may be sufficient to evaluate e g the impact of a closed area under the assumption of non changing foraging capacity however the way the single species gams were built for this study does not allow to test the influence of different environmental parameters in predictions and forecasts based on varying environmental factors e g analysis of the influence of climate change however other environmental factors can easily be incorporated into the gams for future endeavors e g núñez et al 2019 compared to coll et al 2019 we used the spatial temporal framework to update the habitat preferences derived from sdms directly as foraging capacity maps during the execution of ecospace rather than inducing changes in the abiotic driver maps connected to forcing functions implementing habitat preference maps within the spatial temporal framework opens the possibility to account for different influences and their strength over time steenbeek et al 2013 yet there is no common agreement on what habitat preferences to incorporate e g which abiotic and biotic factors and there are no clear guidelines on how to include these preferences into a complex ecosystem model where trophic interactions and fishing pressure have to be accounted for it was demonstrated that presence absence based habitat preferences overall performed better than the abundance weighted hurdle model based preferences this might be an effect of the data used as survey data constitute a representation of spatial abundance distributions in a single point of time but we would argue that it is rather a general effect of the mathematical profile underlying the models the presence absence model was fitted with a logit link resulting in a sigmoidal profile while the presence only model was fitted with a log link which results in an exponential profile combining these two models leads to an exponential profile for the final hurdle model while the sigmoidal profile allows a more general representation of distribution the exponential profile highlights the areas with high abundances both profiles come with benefits but also restrictions combining the sigmoidal profile with a trophodynamic model allows for enough flexibility for further interactions that might influence the habitat preference of a species moreover even though the hurdle scenarios yielded better results for the schoener s d index it showed that the more general approach of implementing the presence absence maps was able to represent the distribution of the single fgs as well when combined with the ecosystem model yet this profile lacks the opportunity to include known hot spots with high interests for the species and good foraging opportunities example maps in fig 9 the skill assessment of the hurdle model on the other hand showed that the implementation of maps based on an exponential profile creates too much spatial restriction this constraint can have multiple effects within a spatial food web model it can induce perfect overlap with the predator and fleets which leads to high pressure on the fg and not much space to escape alternatively as opposed to this there can be no or hardly any overlap with predators and fleets which in turn leads to an uncontrolled increase in biomass furthermore there can be no or just minimal overlap with the own prey which can lead to starvation implementing these habitat preferences into ecospace during the run raised the question on the best periodicity our results show that accounting for changes in distribution of species over time increases the overall fit of the model to spatial temporal data it could be argued that the hurdle scenarios with the generally inferior fit implied a different conclusion here the static baseline scenario had the best fit but this was only the case when concentrating on the metrics evaluating the temporal fit the spatial metric schoener s d index revealed that the static baseline scenario had the worst fit among all hurdle scenarios this implies that even though this scenario is good in reproducing temporal trends it does so on the cost of spatial redistribution and thus becoming more unrealistic compared to the other scenarios for catch the multi years scenario and the seasonal scenario displayed the best results most fishing habitats were created based on known fishing areas wide enough to redistribute the effort in case of shifts in habitat preferences therefore adapting to more rapid changes over time might not be as crucial as for biomass this is in line with findings by romagnoni et al 2015 who also found that changes in different parameters for their ecospace of the entire north sea iv a b and c affected biomass and catch differently this can be justified by the way effort is distributed in ecospace each fleet s effort is proportionally distributed over the cells by a gravity model dependent on the sum over the fgs biomass caught by the fleet times the off vessel prices and the catchability for each fg walters et al 1999 if the fishing area covers enough ground to react to shifts in distribution it follows the redistribution considering all results it reveals that in terms of periodicity the multi years scenario performs best yet the periodicity should support the time period one would like to study e g short period seasonal might work better long period seasonal may not be necessary annual or even multi years can suffice and the research questions the model was built for e g long term changes in the ecosystem vs effects of rapid increase of fishing mortality in the distribution of species furthermore changes within the ecosystem during the run were only represented by the changes in foraging capacity including monthly seasonal or annual changes of the chlorophyll a maps or accounting for changes in water temperature might be necessary to adequately represent the changes over time and to reach a better model fit 4 3 best practice suggestions for applying a spatial temporal framework to foraging capacity and shortcomings identified there are several key best practice suggestions arising from this study for forcing the foraging capacity via the new ecospace spatial temporal capabilities first when applying scaled habitat preferences predicted with sdms as foraging capacity the best performing sdm may not be the best to use in an ecosystem model context although the exponential profile of the hurdle model has a better representation of the cpue data ecospace performed worse when fed with its output this is likely because the sigmoidal profile of the presence absence maps is more informative as overall habitat capacity measure and additionally more flexible towards further mechanistic structures within the ecosystem model and therefore improving our knowledge on habitat preferences implementing time dynamic maps is the preferred option over a constant base map time dynamic maps are an important improvement in ecospace especially in times of climate change where in future work the temporal shift in temperature can be accounted for within the foraging capacity maps the study also identifies a few caveats first there is still no automated routine to evaluate the fit of ecospace we chose to test the fits using a set of skill assessment metrics and it has proven a good way to find the settings with the best fit it is important to apply a wide set of different metrics to assess the fit of an ecosystem model to account for the temporal and spatial fit olsen et al 2016 model efficiency with the value for the base year 1991 as well as the pearson correlation for catch and root mean squared error served as metrics that informed about the mean temporal fit over the years nevertheless these metrics did not account for spatial dynamics in habitat preference maps over time when compared to the empirical time series this could be accomplished with the schoener s d index which measures the niche overlap and therefore allows the spatial comparison between the ecospace output maps and the abundance reference the combination of the spatial and temporal fit could be achieved with the taylor diagram comparing ecospace and abundance reference standardized maps for all years per grid cell one major issue within ecospace is the current inability to react to situations like partial spatial mismatch between predator and prey by changing vulnerabilities based on occurrences in space vulnerabilities are only fitted to ecosim time series not taking the amount of spatial overlap into account as done with this model for brown shrimp changing single vulnerabilities within ecosim is possible and justifiable too much pressure of the adult stanza on the juvenile while they are both common within a narrow area at the coast nevertheless there is no other way than visibly checking the fit and using skill metrics as done here to validate the changes an automated routine like the automated fitting routine for vulnerabilities and primary production splines applicable to ecosim mackinson et al 2009 scott et al 2016 would be a necessary improvement to account for species overlap in narrow areas additionally as seen in fig 5 most sharp changes of biomass compared to the observation are hard to meet in this complex ecosystem model especially steep downward trends within the time series as seen for cod sole and plaice have proven to be a challenge there is a need for additional spatial processes for example by implementing mediation functions or account for biomass accumulation based on spatial conditions to match these trends and to force a steeper biomass trend in ecospace when fitting ecospace multi stanza groups have to be fitted with caution as seen in this study for plaice distributions of juveniles and adults of the same species are linked through the implementation of multi stanza group settings walters et al 2010 so it may improve the fit if forcing of stanzas distributions separately were possible therefore the distribution of plaice was driven by forcing the foraging capacity of only the juvenile life history stage over time to avoid overfitting the model in agreement with the schoener s d index the results showed a good niche overlap for the spatial distribution of plaice juvenile and adults confirming that forcing the foraging capacity of only one of the two multi stanza was sufficient to drive spatial distributions of both stages for highly cannibalistic groups however it might be necessary to force one part of the multi stanza e g by migration to spawning grounds to account for changes that only apply to one species life stage this would be particular relevant when using multi stanza for species that have very different ecological and trophic ontogenetic changes across their life stages e g eggs larvae juveniles and adults even though the schoener s d index of most fgs surpassed the threshold there is a difference in variability fig 3 the highest variabilities are displayed in pelagic fgs and fgs where the survey coverage might not have been extensive enough this has two implications first it is important to carefully select fgs and the corresponding data when applying sdms to ecospace the smaller the data coverage for the sdm the more variability in the spatial fit second ecospace seems to perform better when reproducing spatial distributions of more spatially bound fgs than for the fast moving pelagic fgs 5 conclusion in our study the new capabilities of ecospace have proven to be a beneficial asset when reconstructing species spatial distributions and their shifts over time it also showed that in an ecosystem model like the one for the southern north sea implementing temporally changing habitat preferences maps based on pa on a sigmoidal profile generate better results than an exponential profile based on cpue furthermore combining sdms with this trophic model has the potential to further inform about habitat preferences that include biotic interactions introduced by ecospace nevertheless our knowledge about the best practice in the new spatial temporal external foraging capacity implementation could benefit from testing further strategies of fitting in the future the new capabilities inside ecospace can be applied to assess changes in ecological indicators over time as well as to test different management strategies within the framework of marine spatial planning in the light of climate change it is possible to test how ecosystems react to temperature driven foraging capacities finally there is not one best practice how to construct an ecosystem model as with all models the best model is always the one that best answers your research question in your part of the world s oceans and the best periodicity might differ between models and research questions however our study adds insights on the impact of habitat capacity maps on ecospace results and helps to identify the issues that need to be taken into account when using sdms as input for ecosystem models like ecospace credit authorship contribution statement miriam püts conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing marc taylor

university albury australia corresponding author species distribution modelling sdm is an important tool for ecologists but different algorithms and different sampling strategies produce different results using virtual species with differing characteristics this study investigated the effect of sampling strategy choices on sdm predictions across multiple algorithms and species including the impacts of different sample size and prevalence choices and the effects of validating models using presence and background data as opposed to true absences we also assessed the consistency of predictions between algorithms and investigated the effectiveness of using stability assessment of spatial predictions in geographic space to evaluate sdm predictions maxent performed most consistently under all scenarios both in regards to performance metrics and spatial prediction stability and should be considered for most scenarios either on its own or as part of a model ensemble in particular when true absences are not available a key recommendation of this study is the use of metrics to assess agreement between replicate predictions as a measure of spatial stability rather than relying solely on performance metrics such as area under the curve auc graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords species distribution sample size presence only model comparison model evaluation 1 introduction species distribution modelling sdm is an important tool for ecologists used to identify potential areas of suitable species habitat e g williams et al 2009 predict potential invasive species risks e g václavík et al 2012 and model the impacts of climate change on species distributions e g stralberg et al 2015 when modelling the distribution of species occurrence models are ideally calibrated using both presence and absence observations however there is often a significant degree of uncertainty around the accuracy of absence observations due to issues such as detectability and sampling effort required to ensure a modelling unit i e raster cell is truly an absence lobo et al 2010 the effort required to obtain robust absence observations limits the availability of reliable datasets and this has implications for the use of those methods that rely on presence absence datasets this often necessitates the use of presence only datasets when calibrating an sdm which can have significant impacts depending on the modelling algorithms used examples of modelling algorithms used in sdm studies range from climatic envelope methods such as bioclim booth et al 2014 to classical statistical methods including generalised linear models glm and generalised additive models gam guisan et al 2002 increasingly researchers are using machine learning methods such as maxent phillips et al 2006 and random forest rf breiman 2001 vincenzi et al 2011 other methods include support vector machines svm vapnik 1995 and boosted regression trees de ath 2007 elith et al 2008 it is important to note that some algorithms such as maxent and bioclim only require observations of occurrence in other words presence data however many such as glm and rf require absence observations as well as presence only algorithms fail to account for locations where a species has not been recorded and presence absence algorithms rely on difficult to verify true absences there has been a significant amount of research effort into sdm algorithms using background or pseudo absences in place of true absences background samples are typically obtained by randomly sampling a large number of locations across the study area representing all available environmental conditions pseudo absences are background samples that have been made to appear more like true absences although we note the terms background and pseudo absence are often used interchangeably in the literature pseudo absences mitigate the issue that background observations will invariably introduce false absences into a model potentially biasing model predictions methods for deriving pseudo absences include the exclusion of locations selected within a certain distance of a known presence observation vanderwal et al 2009 or increasing the likelihood that background samples are true absences by comparing locations of species similar to that being modelled the assumption is that if a similar species has been observed in a given location it is more likely to be a true absence for the species being modelled which has not been observed mateo et al 2010 another method is to use presence only data to identify initial areas of likely suitable habitat and then bias pseudo absence selection away from these areas iturbide et al 2015 while in the studies cited above using pseudo absences instead of background has been shown to improve model performance pseudo absences involve significant assumptions being made about what constitutes a pseudo absence that can have adverse effects on model performance wisz and guisan 2009 støa et al 2018 when implementing sdms there is often little choice in the selection and use of presence observations but background and pseudo absences can be selected in several ways various studies have investigated the impact of background pseudo absence selection on different sdm algorithms liu et al 2019 and barbet massin et al 2012 both tested the effect of changing presence and background sample sizes along with the weighting of background observations while barbet massin et al 2012 also tested pseudo absence selection methods with generally consistent findings for example glm was found to perform better with large background sample sizes and large background samples performed better than the same algorithm using pseudo absences liu et al 2019 barbet massin et al 2012 wisz and guisan 2009 large background sample sizes were also recommended by lobo and tognelli 2011 for gam random forest was found to perform better with balanced sample sizes i e equal numbers of presence and background liu et al 2019 barbet massin et al 2012 boosted regression trees were also found to perform best with equal numbers of background and presences with use of pseudo absences recommended liu et al 2019 barbet massin et al 2012 optimal selection of background samples for methods such as svm and artificial neural networks was shown to depend on the number and prevalence of presence observations liu et al 2019 the role of background sampling strategies in different algorithms is still not completely understood another important consideration is how the performance of model predictions is evaluated in comparison studies as well as in general use sdm studies comparing the performance of algorithms under different scenarios typically use performance metrics such as area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic auc fielding and bell 1997 cohen s kappa cohen 1960 or true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 elith et al 2006 marmion et al 2009 qiao et al 2015 renwick et al 2018 wisz et al 2008 all these measures are problematic when using presence only data in that they use absences in their formulation with the assumption that these are true absences the use of discriminatory metrics have come under criticism due to their sensitivity to predicted prevalence jiménez valverde 2012 lobo et al 2008 and often poor correlation between measured accuracy and true accuracy aguirre gutiérrez et al 2013 mainali et al 2015 warren et al 2019 because these measures may not fully characterise model performance under different scenarios it is important to consider other aspects of model performance elith and graham 2009 another method to compare sdm performance is to evaluate the differences in spatial predictions between models maps can be produced showing variance and spatial uncertainty explained by different algorithms sampling strategies and other factors such as climate change scenarios iturbide et al 2018 diniz filho et al 2009 this geographic variance can also be quantified as changes to predicted distribution extent vanderwal et al 2009 percentage area of disagreement giovanelli et al 2010 or by using cohen s kappa to assess consistency of spatial predictions aguirre gutiérrez et al 2013 the first aim of this research is to investigate the effect of sampling strategy choices on sdm predictions across multiple algorithms and species using presence background data in particular we evaluate the impact of different presence sample size and presence prevalence because it is difficult to carry out this assessment in a robust way using only real species where true absences are seldom known we use virtual species in this assessment in addition virtual species allow us to represent a range of scenarios in a controlled manner e g moudrý 2015 we then assess the uncertainty that is introduced in accuracy metrics when using background samples as is commonly done see e g leroy et al 2017 by recreating these metrics using background samples instead of true absences secondly we assess the consistency of predictions between algorithms to further evaluate how choice of sampling strategy and algorithm combine to produce different results finally we investigate the effectiveness of using stability assessment of spatial predictions in geographic space to evaluate sdm predictions and show how traditional metrics do not always capture sufficient information in particular when they assume true absences in contrast accuracy metrics that account for geographic patterns in predictions can uncover issues in predictions that are masked using traditional metrics 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area was defined by the state boundaries of new south wales and victoria including australian capital territory of mainland south eastern australia fig 1 this region was chosen due to the variability of climate and topography ranging from sea level to 2228 m with climate ranging from hot desert in the west of the region to humid subtropical and oceanic in the east climatic variables for this region were obtained from the worldclim global climate dataset bioclimatic variables fick and hijmans 2017 this dataset contains 19 individual climate surfaces derived from temperature and precipitation averaged over the years 1970 2000 climate surfaces were used to define the virtual species see 2 2 and as environmental predictors in the models see 2 5 each variable was clipped to the study area and reprojected to the australian albers equal area conic projection epsg 2577 with a cell size of 1km2 2 2 virtual species creation ten virtual species were created using the virtualspecies package in r leroy et al 2016 four variables were selected from the worldclim surfaces annual mean temperature isothermality annual temperature range and annual precipitation these variables were selected because of their diverse spatial patterns meaning resulting species will have diverse distributions for example annual precipitation has an east west spatial trend while annual mean temperature has a north south trend each species was created using a gaussian response function for each environmental variable with each response linearly rescaled to contain values between 0 and 1 see supplementary material for details the habitat suitability function was defined as the product of each of these response functions with the response used as the probability of occurrence parameters for the response functions for each species were chosen manually to create species distributions with geographic prevalence ranging from 0 05 narrowly distributed species to 0 35 broadly distributed species vs1 3 were calibrated to be broadly distributed vs7 10 narrowly distributed and vs4 6 in between fig 1 the habitat suitability function was projected onto geographic space defined by the environmental variables to create probability of occurrence rasters 2 3 sampling strategies for model calibration in order to test different modelling scenarios five sample sizes were used to generate calibration sub samples ranging from 20 a small but viable number of observations for sdm to 100 to generate presence observations presence absence maps were generated stochastically by applying bernoulli trials to each cell of the probability of occurrence rasters and a random sample was selected leroy et al 2016 meynard and kaplan 2013 each presence sample was selected from a different presence absence realisation background samples were randomly selected using the randompoints function in the r package dismo hijmans et al 2017 sample sizes were determined using five sample presence prevalence categories ranging from 0 005 to 0 5 where 0 5 prevalence means equal numbers of presence and background points each presence size presence prevalence combination created a total of 25 sampling strategies table 1 and 20 replicates were generated for each sampling strategy presence and background datasets for each replicate were unique with a minimum of one observation difference between replicates 2 4 model validation datasets to compare the results of validating models using true absences generally unavailable when using real species but known for virtual species and using background observations a common approach presence absence pa and presence background pb were created for each virtual species a set of presence observations n 150 background observations n 1000 and absence observations were selected the number of absences was determined by the species geographic prevalence see supplementary material for details presence and absence observations were sampled stochastically from the virtual distribution leroy et al 2016 while background observations were sampled using the randomsample function in the r package dismo hijmans et al 2017 2 5 species distribution modelling algorithms four sdm algorithms were chosen to investigate the effects of calibration and validation dataset selection and characteristics maxent is one of the most commonly used algorithms and one of the few that explicitly requires background observations rather than absences or pseudo absences phillips et al 2006 generalised linear models glm provide a flexible framework to implement various regression techniques lindsey 2000 nelder and wedderburn 1972 and is a model commonly used by ecologists random forest rf is a machine learning algorithm which predicts classifications of presence and absence by averaging individual decision trees breiman 2001 and has recently become popular in sdm applications due to its ease of use in terms of parameterisation and implementation support vector machines svm attempt to achieve maximum separation of observations from two response classes presence and absence within the predictor feature space hastie et al 2009 this last method is not used as frequently in the sdm literature but has been shown to produce good results in some circumstances drake et al 2006 pouteau et al 2012 and could give useful insights into algorithm behaviour in different scenarios each algorithm was used to generate a model for each of the 25 sampling strategies with the same 20 replicates in each in total 20 000 models were calibrated 10 species x 4 algorithms x 25 sampling strategies x 20 replicates the same four bioclimatic variables used to create the virtual species were used as environmental predictors for all models maxent was implemented using the dismo package in r hijmans et al 2017 using default parameter settings and logistic output the glm was implemented using the core r packages r core team 2019 with a binomial distribution logit link function and first order terms for all predictors the rf algorithm was implemented using the randomforest package in r liaw and wiener 2002 with default settings finally the svm was implemented in r using the kernlab package karatzoglou et al 2004 using a radial basis function kernel with kernel width σ set to 0 5 and cost parameter c set to 1 with insensitive zone width ε left at the default value 0 1 both rf and svm can be implemented as either classification or regression models to keep model prediction consistent between all four algorithms i e continuous with values between 0 and 1 regression was specified for both rf and svm 2 6 model performance metrics in order to address the aims of the research spatial predictions were evaluated in three ways a predictive success assessment i e agreement between prediction and validation data for a single algorithm b consistency assessment i e agreement between predictions for multiple algorithms calibrated using the same training data and c stability assessment i e how similar are predictions between replicates of a single algorithm to assess predictive success of models sensitivity specificity auc and cohen s kappa were calculated for the virtual species using the pa validation datasets this allowed us to evaluate the impact of different sample size and presence prevalence for different algorithms in the most robust way possible we then repeated these same metric calculations using the pb validation datasets sensitivity se or true positive rate and specificity sp or true negative rate are defined as 1 s e t p t p f n 2 s p t n t n f p where tp number of true positives or cells that are classed as presences in both prediction and validation datasets tn number of true negatives or cells that are classed as absences in both prediction and validation datasets fp number of false positives or cells that are classed as presences in prediction but absences in the validation dataset and fn number of false negatives or cells that are classed as absences in prediction but presences in the validation dataset to calculate these model outputs must first be converted to binary presence absence by applying a threshold which was calculated by maximising the sum of sensitivity and specificity jiménez valverde and lobo 2007 liu et al 2016 the auc is derived by calculating the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic roc this curve is defined by sensitivity on the y axis and 1 specificity on the x axis all possible thresholds and associated confusion matrices are calculated to create the roc curve fielding and bell 1997 the area under this curve that is greater than 0 5 suggest better discriminatory capacity than might occur by chance with 1 being perfect discriminatory capacity cohen s kappa κc is used to measure agreement between two categorical rasters cohen 1960 in an sdm context the rasters are the predicted presence absences observations and the known observations validation data or two different binary spatial predictions this metric can be considered as estimating the proportion of agreement not expected by chance eq 3 the numerator calculates the agreement not expected by chance by subtracting the observed agreement po with the expected difference by chance pc the denominator is the expected amount of disagreement by chance 3 κ c p o p c 1 p c a value of one indicates perfect agreement while zero indicates agreement no better than random a rule of thumb by landis and koch 1977 is often cited when interpreting kappa values with values of 0 4 0 6 indicating moderate agreement while 0 8 1 indicates near perfect agreement however these measures are sensitive to sample prevalence allouche et al 2006 so caution should be taken when comparing between species of different range sizes relative to the study area the consistency of predictions between algorithms was evaluated by calculating the pearson s correlation coefficient between predictions for each species using the same dataset in each algorithm the stability of spatial predictions for each algorithm was assessed by measuring the agreement between replicate predictions of each sampling strategy using fleiss kappa κf this metric serves a similar purpose to cohen s kappa but is a measure of agreement between multiple raters fleiss 1971 it uses a similar formula as cohen s kappa except it uses the mean agreement between all raters p o and the expected mean agreement by chance p e eq 4 4 k f p o p e 1 p e 3 results 3 1 predictive success assessment for all algorithms models using true absences for validation have better performance metrics than those using background data fig 2 cohen s kappa as a measure of model performance has similar patterns to auc but with greater differences between pa validated models and pb validated models on both measures maxent is the highest performing algorithm on average across all strategies overall increasing presence sample size results in increased model accuracy fig 3 auc and cohen s kappa both increase with larger sample sizes for all species and algorithms for both pa and pb validation maxent and glm are more sensitive to changes in presence size while svm has consistently poor model accuracy compared to the other methods and a wider range of values between species as expected sensitivity remains the same when using pa and pb validation because this measure only relies on true positives specificity is consistently lower with pb validation compared to pa validation with consistent effects on auc and kappa increasing presence prevalence has little impact on any of the performance metrics for maxent and glm with a slight decline in specificity and therefore also auc and kappa at high presence prevalence fig 4 rf and svm both improve performance metrics with increased presence prevalence with svm in particular showing a marked improvement at 0 5 prevalence while rf displays a more linear improvement with increasing presence prevalence it is noteworthy that at 0 5 prevalence all performance metrics have similar means across the four algorithms again the differences between pa validated and pb validated metrics are driven by specificity and for rf and svm the difference between these metrics is more pronounced at higher presence prevalence in other words pb validation always produces lower performance metrics compared to pa validation but the gap is bigger at higher presence prevalence for rf and svm species geographic prevalence may have some impact on performance metrics supp fig 1 in particular all algorithms have a general pattern of higher auc kappa values for low geographic prevalence species in addition there is a pattern to the differences between pa and pb validated models when examined by species geographic prevalence for the broadly distributed species the gain in using pa validation over pb validation is much smaller than for the narrowly distributed species supp fig 2 3 2 consistency assessment between algorithms mean pairwise pearson s correlation between algorithms show overall greatest agreement between maxent and glm and greatest agreement between all algorithm pairs at high presence sample size and high presence prevalence fig 5 while increasing presence sample size improves this agreement its effect is slight compared to the effect of increasing presence prevalence 3 3 stability assessment agreement between replicates also increases as presence sample size increases fig 6 see fig supp 3 for breakdown by species presence prevalence influences different algorithms in different ways glm and maxent show better consistency between replicates with proportionally larger background samples decreasing fleiss kappa with increasing presence prevalence while rf has better consistency between replicates with equal numbers of background and presence samples increasing fleiss kappa with increasing presence prevalence and svm has variable responses but models with the highest presence prevalence 0 5 equal number of presence and background samples have values between 0 5 and 0 8 for all species indicating moderate to good agreement fig 6 a visual assessment of spatial prediction shows that maxent and glm have consistent spatial predictions across all presence prevalence values for all species rf shows the best consistency at high presence prevalence but displays some noise due to false presences in a small number of replicates at lower presence prevalence svm is only stable at high presence prevalence with many false absences introduced at lower presence prevalence at the very low presence prevalence value 0 005 presences are well predicted but the models appear to be overspecified so the agreement of presences between replicates is potentially not meaningful see e g fig 7 and supp fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 predictive success assessment this study compared the response of four sdm algorithms to different sampling strategies focusing on size of presence sample in conjunction with background sampling strategies previous comparative studies of sdm performance have found that algorithm choice is a significant source of uncertainty in sdm prediction diniz filho et al 2009 of the algorithms included in this study maxent is the only one that explicitly uses background observations to represent the availability of habitat conditions within the study area recent work demonstrating the link between maxent and inhomogenous point process ipp models aarts et al 2012 fithian and hastie 2013 provides greater clarity on the role of background observations in this algorithm rather than predicting presence and absence locations the raw output of maxent is predicting the expected density of observed presences per spatial unit given the sampling constraints and environmental conditions phillips et al 2017 it has also been shown that glm with very large background sizes approximates an ipp model warton and shepherd 2010 this means that with large background samples maxent and glm should be more reliable and behave similarly which agrees with our findings although glm did tend to overpredict given consistently lower specificity fig 3 and demonstrated visually in fig 7 this is also a possible explanation for why these two algorithms were the most stable with respect to both performance metrics and spatial predictions warton and shepherd 2010 demonstrated that logistic regression parameter estimates and their standard error were comparable to an ipp however when using smaller background samples both parameter estimates become significantly different and standard errors become larger this agrees with our findings that glm was more sensitive to smaller background sample size for rf and svm the role of background samples in relation to changing presence prevalence is less clear but our results show that these models both perform better with higher presence prevalence one of the benefits of non parametric methods like rf and svm is that they are able to model non linear relationships and interactions between predictor variables however this can be an issue as these methods may become susceptible to finding erroneous relationships caused by noise merow et al 2014 our results suggest that at high presence size and presence prevalence this issue may be small as predictions from each algorithm are quite similar however at low presence prevalence rf and svm predictions suffer with less agreement between replicates and other algorithms demonstrated by figs 5 and 6 and visually supported by fig 7 fleiss kappa for svm did show high agreement at low presence prevalence but this is due to consistent severe overprediction in many cases as indicated by high specificity and low sensitivity fig 3 a possible reason for this is that as the number of background observations increases the prevalence of presence observations in the species niche region of environmental space will decrease liu et al 2019 also noted that larger background sample sizes reduced svm and rf performance however in their study they also tested weighting observations so that the presence sample was balanced with background at different background sample sizes improving the performance of both algorithms while rf and svm suffer when presence prevalence decreases they do so in different ways the sensitivity of svm to the choice of model parameters and kernel is known cherkassky and ma 2004 and seems a likely cause of svms observed behaviour for example the radial basis function kernel has the potential to transform the feature space in which the algorithm is calibrated into infinite dimensions possibly resulting in unrealistic model fit on the other hand each tree within a random forest model is calibrated with different subsets of the input observations as well as subsets of predictor variables at each tree node with each tree averaged to give the final prediction this means one algorithm transforms the feature space while the other explores subsets of it when fitting the model which could be responsible for observed differences in behaviour between svm and rf however it is beyond the scope of this paper to delve into the mathematical differences between algorithms to comprehensively explain what was observed rather this discussion aims to place the results in the context of the mechanics of these algorithms and highlight the need for a better understanding of why certain modelling methods behave the way they do we also emphasise that our results do not necessarily mean svm is a poor choice of algorithm as it has been shown to produce accurate sdms in past studies drake et al 2006 pouteau et al 2012 rather our results emphasise that greater care is needed when selecting kernels model parameters and background selection methods with svm as it is more sensitive to these choices than the other algorithms tested in real world scenarios true absences are seldom available yet commonly used performance metrics e g auc invariably rely on an assumption of known absences our comparison of validation metrics using pa and pb data showed that measures of sensitivity were largely the same for both methods our threshold selection method maximised the sum of sensitivity and specificity which has been shown to be a robust method to use with pa data and produce the same thresholds when using pb data liu et al 2016 liu et al 2013 specificity and measures that incorporate it auc cohen s kappa did show differences between values calculated using pa and pb data the magnitude of these differences remained largely consistent across sampling strategies for individual algorithms and species supp fig 5 6 however the magnitude of these differences decreased as the true geographic prevalence of virtual species decreased due to smaller modelled distribution extents resulting in lower specificity because background observations are more likely to represent true absences in narrowly distributed species supp fig 2 this has implications for the interpretation of performance metrics applied to real species data and for studies that compare the performance of models using background data for validation estimates of sensitivity can be considered accurate while specificity is more reflective of the predicted geographic prevalence of the species as such species of low geographic prevalence are more likely to have a greater proportion of background observations correspond to true absences by chance lobo et al 2008 which is likely why the difference between pa and pb validation decreased with increased presence prevalence in our models in the context of our study the fact that pa and pb metrics gave different absolute values was not an issue as both pa and pb values demonstrated the same trends in performance under different sampling scenarios however it is important that users recognise that these metrics assessing discriminatory power of a model do not necessarily reflect a model s ability to capture the true distribution of a species predicted distribution patterns uncorrelated with the true probability of occurrence can produce high metric values warren et al 2019 and give misleading assessments of model performance mainali et al 2015 therefore it is important that if users report auc and kappa or similar metrics that they are interpreted alongside sensitivity specificity and evaluations of the spatial predictions 4 2 assessments of spatial predictions our assessments of spatial predictions involved assessing the consistency of predictions between algorithms and the stability of predictions across replicate models the consistency assessment highlighted that with certain presence size presence prevalence combinations algorithms can give quite different results datasets with high presence prevalence tend to give similar results regardless of algorithm or species but as shown in fig 3 higher presence prevalence leads to models with slightly lower accuracy metrics for both maxent and glm the analysis on agreement between replicates with changing sample characteristics figs 6 7 demonstrated that spatial predictions can be sensitive to changing sample characteristics as well as random selection of samples for replicates even in cases where performance metrics were not however a poor model that consistently overpredicts can still have a high fleiss kappa as seen for example in the glm and svm models in fig 7 high fleiss kappa along with high sensitivity but low specificity is a good indicator that models consistently overpredict and are not informative the value of the assessments of spatial predictions is that they can be used as single metrics describing the uncertainty of spatial predictions alternative methods could be used when modelling a single species such as visual assessments e g fig 7 the standard deviation or coefficient of variation of each pixel from a suite of candidate predictions e g stralberg et al 2015 or the use of indices that compare the spatial structure surrounding each cell such as the spatial similarity index robertson et al 2014 however when performing comparative assessments of models under many different scenarios metric based approaches may be preferred as adequately describing visual assessments of large numbers of candidate models becomes infeasible while the assessment of spatial predictions does not guarantee good model predictions it does inform the user on the spatial uncertainty caused by steps in the model building process this could be particularly useful when developing ensembles of models ensembles consist of a suite of models from different algorithms that are typically combined by taking average predictions weighted by accuracy metrics like auc or tss hao et al 2019 thuiller et al 2009 given the questionable reliability of these accuracy metrics assessments of spatial predictions presented here could inform model selection for inclusion in an ensemble identifying candidate models obtained using model parameters with low replicate variability could reduce model uncertainty in the ensemble 4 3 use of virtual species in sdm assessment there are obvious issues with using real species in a study such as this one due to inevitable sampling bias in the presence data and lack of true absence data this study emphasises the benefits of using virtual species to assess model predictions with complete knowledge of the true distribution of the species and the ability to select unbiased presence and absence samples this has allowed us to show the additional uncertainty present in performance metrics when these are calculated using background observations instead of true absences 5 conclusions all four of the algorithms tested performed well in some scenarios with maxent performing consistently well across all scenarios rf and svm were particularly sensitive to large background sample sizes relative to presence sample size i e small presence prevalence as such we recommend using equal numbers of presence and background samples for these algorithms as well as testing of equal weighting of background samples in line with liu et al 2019 for maxent and glm in contrast large background samples should be used we refrain from recommending a single algorithm for all modelling as different sdms may outperform others in certain situations qiao et al 2015 ensembles of algorithms are typically recommended to mitigate and quantify uncertainty introduced by different algorithms and appropriate selection of algorithms for this purpose is important maxent was the most consistently performing algorithm and given that it is explicitly designed to work with presence background data it certainly warrants selection amongst other candidate algorithms however the rationale behind selecting other algorithms for presence background modelling is less clear in most cases glm performed similarly to maxent but with slightly lower performance metrics and more variability between replicates in most scenarios when true absence samples are available rf may also be a good candidate algorithm but its use is cautioned against with low presence prevalence svm may be appropriate in some scenarios but parameters should be carefully selected due to the relative instability of the algorithm when evaluating model performance it is important to assess more than just a single performance metric elith and graham 2009 zurell et al 2012 indeed as we have shown relying on auc alone may masque instability in spatial predictions stability of replicate spatial predictions for single algorithms as measured by fleiss kappa along with agreement between predictions of different algorithms using pearson s correlation coefficient is an important consideration when describing the variability of model performance under different scenarios studies comparing a range of sdm algorithms under different scenarios are common e g elith et al 2006 graham and hijmans 2006 li and wang 2013 liu et al 2019 oppel et al 2012 but typically rely on performance metrics such as auc and cohen s kappa alone to describe model performance comparison and assessment of spatial predictions to assess stability should be standard for these types of studies to provide a more rounded evaluation of model performance finally model comparison studies should use virtual species where possible to calculate more accurate performance metrics future work to increase understanding of sdms and performance assessment should repeat aspects of our research with a greater range of characteristics defining the virtual species to better determine the influence of species geographic prevalence and other characteristics on sdm predictions the comparison between pa validated and pb validated metrics shows that these and other findings are likely to be valid in real world scenarios where only pb validation is possible in the majority of cases provided users consider the limitations of these metrics credit authorship contribution statement liam grimmett conceptualization methodology formal

university albury australia corresponding author species distribution modelling sdm is an important tool for ecologists but different algorithms and different sampling strategies produce different results using virtual species with differing characteristics this study investigated the effect of sampling strategy choices on sdm predictions across multiple algorithms and species including the impacts of different sample size and prevalence choices and the effects of validating models using presence and background data as opposed to true absences we also assessed the consistency of predictions between algorithms and investigated the effectiveness of using stability assessment of spatial predictions in geographic space to evaluate sdm predictions maxent performed most consistently under all scenarios both in regards to performance metrics and spatial prediction stability and should be considered for most scenarios either on its own or as part of a model ensemble in particular when true absences are not available a key recommendation of this study is the use of metrics to assess agreement between replicate predictions as a measure of spatial stability rather than relying solely on performance metrics such as area under the curve auc graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords species distribution sample size presence only model comparison model evaluation 1 introduction species distribution modelling sdm is an important tool for ecologists used to identify potential areas of suitable species habitat e g williams et al 2009 predict potential invasive species risks e g václavík et al 2012 and model the impacts of climate change on species distributions e g stralberg et al 2015 when modelling the distribution of species occurrence models are ideally calibrated using both presence and absence observations however there is often a significant degree of uncertainty around the accuracy of absence observations due to issues such as detectability and sampling effort required to ensure a modelling unit i e raster cell is truly an absence lobo et al 2010 the effort required to obtain robust absence observations limits the availability of reliable datasets and this has implications for the use of those methods that rely on presence absence datasets this often necessitates the use of presence only datasets when calibrating an sdm which can have significant impacts depending on the modelling algorithms used examples of modelling algorithms used in sdm studies range from climatic envelope methods such as bioclim booth et al 2014 to classical statistical methods including generalised linear models glm and generalised additive models gam guisan et al 2002 increasingly researchers are using machine learning methods such as maxent phillips et al 2006 and random forest rf breiman 2001 vincenzi et al 2011 other methods include support vector machines svm vapnik 1995 and boosted regression trees de ath 2007 elith et al 2008 it is important to note that some algorithms such as maxent and bioclim only require observations of occurrence in other words presence data however many such as glm and rf require absence observations as well as presence only algorithms fail to account for locations where a species has not been recorded and presence absence algorithms rely on difficult to verify true absences there has been a significant amount of research effort into sdm algorithms using background or pseudo absences in place of true absences background samples are typically obtained by randomly sampling a large number of locations across the study area representing all available environmental conditions pseudo absences are background samples that have been made to appear more like true absences although we note the terms background and pseudo absence are often used interchangeably in the literature pseudo absences mitigate the issue that background observations will invariably introduce false absences into a model potentially biasing model predictions methods for deriving pseudo absences include the exclusion of locations selected within a certain distance of a known presence observation vanderwal et al 2009 or increasing the likelihood that background samples are true absences by comparing locations of species similar to that being modelled the assumption is that if a similar species has been observed in a given location it is more likely to be a true absence for the species being modelled which has not been observed mateo et al 2010 another method is to use presence only data to identify initial areas of likely suitable habitat and then bias pseudo absence selection away from these areas iturbide et al 2015 while in the studies cited above using pseudo absences instead of background has been shown to improve model performance pseudo absences involve significant assumptions being made about what constitutes a pseudo absence that can have adverse effects on model performance wisz and guisan 2009 støa et al 2018 when implementing sdms there is often little choice in the selection and use of presence observations but background and pseudo absences can be selected in several ways various studies have investigated the impact of background pseudo absence selection on different sdm algorithms liu et al 2019 and barbet massin et al 2012 both tested the effect of changing presence and background sample sizes along with the weighting of background observations while barbet massin et al 2012 also tested pseudo absence selection methods with generally consistent findings for example glm was found to perform better with large background sample sizes and large background samples performed better than the same algorithm using pseudo absences liu et al 2019 barbet massin et al 2012 wisz and guisan 2009 large background sample sizes were also recommended by lobo and tognelli 2011 for gam random forest was found to perform better with balanced sample sizes i e equal numbers of presence and background liu et al 2019 barbet massin et al 2012 boosted regression trees were also found to perform best with equal numbers of background and presences with use of pseudo absences recommended liu et al 2019 barbet massin et al 2012 optimal selection of background samples for methods such as svm and artificial neural networks was shown to depend on the number and prevalence of presence observations liu et al 2019 the role of background sampling strategies in different algorithms is still not completely understood another important consideration is how the performance of model predictions is evaluated in comparison studies as well as in general use sdm studies comparing the performance of algorithms under different scenarios typically use performance metrics such as area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic auc fielding and bell 1997 cohen s kappa cohen 1960 or true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 elith et al 2006 marmion et al 2009 qiao et al 2015 renwick et al 2018 wisz et al 2008 all these measures are problematic when using presence only data in that they use absences in their formulation with the assumption that these are true absences the use of discriminatory metrics have come under criticism due to their sensitivity to predicted prevalence jiménez valverde 2012 lobo et al 2008 and often poor correlation between measured accuracy and true accuracy aguirre gutiérrez et al 2013 mainali et al 2015 warren et al 2019 because these measures may not fully characterise model performance under different scenarios it is important to consider other aspects of model performance elith and graham 2009 another method to compare sdm performance is to evaluate the differences in spatial predictions between models maps can be produced showing variance and spatial uncertainty explained by different algorithms sampling strategies and other factors such as climate change scenarios iturbide et al 2018 diniz filho et al 2009 this geographic variance can also be quantified as changes to predicted distribution extent vanderwal et al 2009 percentage area of disagreement giovanelli et al 2010 or by using cohen s kappa to assess consistency of spatial predictions aguirre gutiérrez et al 2013 the first aim of this research is to investigate the effect of sampling strategy choices on sdm predictions across multiple algorithms and species using presence background data in particular we evaluate the impact of different presence sample size and presence prevalence because it is difficult to carry out this assessment in a robust way using only real species where true absences are seldom known we use virtual species in this assessment in addition virtual species allow us to represent a range of scenarios in a controlled manner e g moudrý 2015 we then assess the uncertainty that is introduced in accuracy metrics when using background samples as is commonly done see e g leroy et al 2017 by recreating these metrics using background samples instead of true absences secondly we assess the consistency of predictions between algorithms to further evaluate how choice of sampling strategy and algorithm combine to produce different results finally we investigate the effectiveness of using stability assessment of spatial predictions in geographic space to evaluate sdm predictions and show how traditional metrics do not always capture sufficient information in particular when they assume true absences in contrast accuracy metrics that account for geographic patterns in predictions can uncover issues in predictions that are masked using traditional metrics 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area was defined by the state boundaries of new south wales and victoria including australian capital territory of mainland south eastern australia fig 1 this region was chosen due to the variability of climate and topography ranging from sea level to 2228 m with climate ranging from hot desert in the west of the region to humid subtropical and oceanic in the east climatic variables for this region were obtained from the worldclim global climate dataset bioclimatic variables fick and hijmans 2017 this dataset contains 19 individual climate surfaces derived from temperature and precipitation averaged over the years 1970 2000 climate surfaces were used to define the virtual species see 2 2 and as environmental predictors in the models see 2 5 each variable was clipped to the study area and reprojected to the australian albers equal area conic projection epsg 2577 with a cell size of 1km2 2 2 virtual species creation ten virtual species were created using the virtualspecies package in r leroy et al 2016 four variables were selected from the worldclim surfaces annual mean temperature isothermality annual temperature range and annual precipitation these variables were selected because of their diverse spatial patterns meaning resulting species will have diverse distributions for example annual precipitation has an east west spatial trend while annual mean temperature has a north south trend each species was created using a gaussian response function for each environmental variable with each response linearly rescaled to contain values between 0 and 1 see supplementary material for details the habitat suitability function was defined as the product of each of these response functions with the response used as the probability of occurrence parameters for the response functions for each species were chosen manually to create species distributions with geographic prevalence ranging from 0 05 narrowly distributed species to 0 35 broadly distributed species vs1 3 were calibrated to be broadly distributed vs7 10 narrowly distributed and vs4 6 in between fig 1 the habitat suitability function was projected onto geographic space defined by the environmental variables to create probability of occurrence rasters 2 3 sampling strategies for model calibration in order to test different modelling scenarios five sample sizes were used to generate calibration sub samples ranging from 20 a small but viable number of observations for sdm to 100 to generate presence observations presence absence maps were generated stochastically by applying bernoulli trials to each cell of the probability of occurrence rasters and a random sample was selected leroy et al 2016 meynard and kaplan 2013 each presence sample was selected from a different presence absence realisation background samples were randomly selected using the randompoints function in the r package dismo hijmans et al 2017 sample sizes were determined using five sample presence prevalence categories ranging from 0 005 to 0 5 where 0 5 prevalence means equal numbers of presence and background points each presence size presence prevalence combination created a total of 25 sampling strategies table 1 and 20 replicates were generated for each sampling strategy presence and background datasets for each replicate were unique with a minimum of one observation difference between replicates 2 4 model validation datasets to compare the results of validating models using true absences generally unavailable when using real species but known for virtual species and using background observations a common approach presence absence pa and presence background pb were created for each virtual species a set of presence observations n 150 background observations n 1000 and absence observations were selected the number of absences was determined by the species geographic prevalence see supplementary material for details presence and absence observations were sampled stochastically from the virtual distribution leroy et al 2016 while background observations were sampled using the randomsample function in the r package dismo hijmans et al 2017 2 5 species distribution modelling algorithms four sdm algorithms were chosen to investigate the effects of calibration and validation dataset selection and characteristics maxent is one of the most commonly used algorithms and one of the few that explicitly requires background observations rather than absences or pseudo absences phillips et al 2006 generalised linear models glm provide a flexible framework to implement various regression techniques lindsey 2000 nelder and wedderburn 1972 and is a model commonly used by ecologists random forest rf is a machine learning algorithm which predicts classifications of presence and absence by averaging individual decision trees breiman 2001 and has recently become popular in sdm applications due to its ease of use in terms of parameterisation and implementation support vector machines svm attempt to achieve maximum separation of observations from two response classes presence and absence within the predictor feature space hastie et al 2009 this last method is not used as frequently in the sdm literature but has been shown to produce good results in some circumstances drake et al 2006 pouteau et al 2012 and could give useful insights into algorithm behaviour in different scenarios each algorithm was used to generate a model for each of the 25 sampling strategies with the same 20 replicates in each in total 20 000 models were calibrated 10 species x 4 algorithms x 25 sampling strategies x 20 replicates the same four bioclimatic variables used to create the virtual species were used as environmental predictors for all models maxent was implemented using the dismo package in r hijmans et al 2017 using default parameter settings and logistic output the glm was implemented using the core r packages r core team 2019 with a binomial distribution logit link function and first order terms for all predictors the rf algorithm was implemented using the randomforest package in r liaw and wiener 2002 with default settings finally the svm was implemented in r using the kernlab package karatzoglou et al 2004 using a radial basis function kernel with kernel width σ set to 0 5 and cost parameter c set to 1 with insensitive zone width ε left at the default value 0 1 both rf and svm can be implemented as either classification or regression models to keep model prediction consistent between all four algorithms i e continuous with values between 0 and 1 regression was specified for both rf and svm 2 6 model performance metrics in order to address the aims of the research spatial predictions were evaluated in three ways a predictive success assessment i e agreement between prediction and validation data for a single algorithm b consistency assessment i e agreement between predictions for multiple algorithms calibrated using the same training data and c stability assessment i e how similar are predictions between replicates of a single algorithm to assess predictive success of models sensitivity specificity auc and cohen s kappa were calculated for the virtual species using the pa validation datasets this allowed us to evaluate the impact of different sample size and presence prevalence for different algorithms in the most robust way possible we then repeated these same metric calculations using the pb validation datasets sensitivity se or true positive rate and specificity sp or true negative rate are defined as 1 s e t p t p f n 2 s p t n t n f p where tp number of true positives or cells that are classed as presences in both prediction and validation datasets tn number of true negatives or cells that are classed as absences in both prediction and validation datasets fp number of false positives or cells that are classed as presences in prediction but absences in the validation dataset and fn number of false negatives or cells that are classed as absences in prediction but presences in the validation dataset to calculate these model outputs must first be converted to binary presence absence by applying a threshold which was calculated by maximising the sum of sensitivity and specificity jiménez valverde and lobo 2007 liu et al 2016 the auc is derived by calculating the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic roc this curve is defined by sensitivity on the y axis and 1 specificity on the x axis all possible thresholds and associated confusion matrices are calculated to create the roc curve fielding and bell 1997 the area under this curve that is greater than 0 5 suggest better discriminatory capacity than might occur by chance with 1 being perfect discriminatory capacity cohen s kappa κc is used to measure agreement between two categorical rasters cohen 1960 in an sdm context the rasters are the predicted presence absences observations and the known observations validation data or two different binary spatial predictions this metric can be considered as estimating the proportion of agreement not expected by chance eq 3 the numerator calculates the agreement not expected by chance by subtracting the observed agreement po with the expected difference by chance pc the denominator is the expected amount of disagreement by chance 3 κ c p o p c 1 p c a value of one indicates perfect agreement while zero indicates agreement no better than random a rule of thumb by landis and koch 1977 is often cited when interpreting kappa values with values of 0 4 0 6 indicating moderate agreement while 0 8 1 indicates near perfect agreement however these measures are sensitive to sample prevalence allouche et al 2006 so caution should be taken when comparing between species of different range sizes relative to the study area the consistency of predictions between algorithms was evaluated by calculating the pearson s correlation coefficient between predictions for each species using the same dataset in each algorithm the stability of spatial predictions for each algorithm was assessed by measuring the agreement between replicate predictions of each sampling strategy using fleiss kappa κf this metric serves a similar purpose to cohen s kappa but is a measure of agreement between multiple raters fleiss 1971 it uses a similar formula as cohen s kappa except it uses the mean agreement between all raters p o and the expected mean agreement by chance p e eq 4 4 k f p o p e 1 p e 3 results 3 1 predictive success assessment for all algorithms models using true absences for validation have better performance metrics than those using background data fig 2 cohen s kappa as a measure of model performance has similar patterns to auc but with greater differences between pa validated models and pb validated models on both measures maxent is the highest performing algorithm on average across all strategies overall increasing presence sample size results in increased model accuracy fig 3 auc and cohen s kappa both increase with larger sample sizes for all species and algorithms for both pa and pb validation maxent and glm are more sensitive to changes in presence size while svm has consistently poor model accuracy compared to the other methods and a wider range of values between species as expected sensitivity remains the same when using pa and pb validation because this measure only relies on true positives specificity is consistently lower with pb validation compared to pa validation with consistent effects on auc and kappa increasing presence prevalence has little impact on any of the performance metrics for maxent and glm with a slight decline in specificity and therefore also auc and kappa at high presence prevalence fig 4 rf and svm both improve performance metrics with increased presence prevalence with svm in particular showing a marked improvement at 0 5 prevalence while rf displays a more linear improvement with increasing presence prevalence it is noteworthy that at 0 5 prevalence all performance metrics have similar means across the four algorithms again the differences between pa validated and pb validated metrics are driven by specificity and for rf and svm the difference between these metrics is more pronounced at higher presence prevalence in other words pb validation always produces lower performance metrics compared to pa validation but the gap is bigger at higher presence prevalence for rf and svm species geographic prevalence may have some impact on performance metrics supp fig 1 in particular all algorithms have a general pattern of higher auc kappa values for low geographic prevalence species in addition there is a pattern to the differences between pa and pb validated models when examined by species geographic prevalence for the broadly distributed species the gain in using pa validation over pb validation is much smaller than for the narrowly distributed species supp fig 2 3 2 consistency assessment between algorithms mean pairwise pearson s correlation between algorithms show overall greatest agreement between maxent and glm and greatest agreement between all algorithm pairs at high presence sample size and high presence prevalence fig 5 while increasing presence sample size improves this agreement its effect is slight compared to the effect of increasing presence prevalence 3 3 stability assessment agreement between replicates also increases as presence sample size increases fig 6 see fig supp 3 for breakdown by species presence prevalence influences different algorithms in different ways glm and maxent show better consistency between replicates with proportionally larger background samples decreasing fleiss kappa with increasing presence prevalence while rf has better consistency between replicates with equal numbers of background and presence samples increasing fleiss kappa with increasing presence prevalence and svm has variable responses but models with the highest presence prevalence 0 5 equal number of presence and background samples have values between 0 5 and 0 8 for all species indicating moderate to good agreement fig 6 a visual assessment of spatial prediction shows that maxent and glm have consistent spatial predictions across all presence prevalence values for all species rf shows the best consistency at high presence prevalence but displays some noise due to false presences in a small number of replicates at lower presence prevalence svm is only stable at high presence prevalence with many false absences introduced at lower presence prevalence at the very low presence prevalence value 0 005 presences are well predicted but the models appear to be overspecified so the agreement of presences between replicates is potentially not meaningful see e g fig 7 and supp fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 predictive success assessment this study compared the response of four sdm algorithms to different sampling strategies focusing on size of presence sample in conjunction with background sampling strategies previous comparative studies of sdm performance have found that algorithm choice is a significant source of uncertainty in sdm prediction diniz filho et al 2009 of the algorithms included in this study maxent is the only one that explicitly uses background observations to represent the availability of habitat conditions within the study area recent work demonstrating the link between maxent and inhomogenous point process ipp models aarts et al 2012 fithian and hastie 2013 provides greater clarity on the role of background observations in this algorithm rather than predicting presence and absence locations the raw output of maxent is predicting the expected density of observed presences per spatial unit given the sampling constraints and environmental conditions phillips et al 2017 it has also been shown that glm with very large background sizes approximates an ipp model warton and shepherd 2010 this means that with large background samples maxent and glm should be more reliable and behave similarly which agrees with our findings although glm did tend to overpredict given consistently lower specificity fig 3 and demonstrated visually in fig 7 this is also a possible explanation for why these two algorithms were the most stable with respect to both performance metrics and spatial predictions warton and shepherd 2010 demonstrated that logistic regression parameter estimates and their standard error were comparable to an ipp however when using smaller background samples both parameter estimates become significantly different and standard errors become larger this agrees with our findings that glm was more sensitive to smaller background sample size for rf and svm the role of background samples in relation to changing presence prevalence is less clear but our results show that these models both perform better with higher presence prevalence one of the benefits of non parametric methods like rf and svm is that they are able to model non linear relationships and interactions between predictor variables however this can be an issue as these methods may become susceptible to finding erroneous relationships caused by noise merow et al 2014 our results suggest that at high presence size and presence prevalence this issue may be small as predictions from each algorithm are quite similar however at low presence prevalence rf and svm predictions suffer with less agreement between replicates and other algorithms demonstrated by figs 5 and 6 and visually supported by fig 7 fleiss kappa for svm did show high agreement at low presence prevalence but this is due to consistent severe overprediction in many cases as indicated by high specificity and low sensitivity fig 3 a possible reason for this is that as the number of background observations increases the prevalence of presence observations in the species niche region of environmental space will decrease liu et al 2019 also noted that larger background sample sizes reduced svm and rf performance however in their study they also tested weighting observations so that the presence sample was balanced with background at different background sample sizes improving the performance of both algorithms while rf and svm suffer when presence prevalence decreases they do so in different ways the sensitivity of svm to the choice of model parameters and kernel is known cherkassky and ma 2004 and seems a likely cause of svms observed behaviour for example the radial basis function kernel has the potential to transform the feature space in which the algorithm is calibrated into infinite dimensions possibly resulting in unrealistic model fit on the other hand each tree within a random forest model is calibrated with different subsets of the input observations as well as subsets of predictor variables at each tree node with each tree averaged to give the final prediction this means one algorithm transforms the feature space while the other explores subsets of it when fitting the model which could be responsible for observed differences in behaviour between svm and rf however it is beyond the scope of this paper to delve into the mathematical differences between algorithms to comprehensively explain what was observed rather this discussion aims to place the results in the context of the mechanics of these algorithms and highlight the need for a better understanding of why certain modelling methods behave the way they do we also emphasise that our results do not necessarily mean svm is a poor choice of algorithm as it has been shown to produce accurate sdms in past studies drake et al 2006 pouteau et al 2012 rather our results emphasise that greater care is needed when selecting kernels model parameters and background selection methods with svm as it is more sensitive to these choices than the other algorithms tested in real world scenarios true absences are seldom available yet commonly used performance metrics e g auc invariably rely on an assumption of known absences our comparison of validation metrics using pa and pb data showed that measures of sensitivity were largely the same for both methods our threshold selection method maximised the sum of sensitivity and specificity which has been shown to be a robust method to use with pa data and produce the same thresholds when using pb data liu et al 2016 liu et al 2013 specificity and measures that incorporate it auc cohen s kappa did show differences between values calculated using pa and pb data the magnitude of these differences remained largely consistent across sampling strategies for individual algorithms and species supp fig 5 6 however the magnitude of these differences decreased as the true geographic prevalence of virtual species decreased due to smaller modelled distribution extents resulting in lower specificity because background observations are more likely to represent true absences in narrowly distributed species supp fig 2 this has implications for the interpretation of performance metrics applied to real species data and for studies that compare the performance of models using background data for validation estimates of sensitivity can be considered accurate while specificity is more reflective of the predicted geographic prevalence of the species as such species of low geographic prevalence are more likely to have a greater proportion of background observations correspond to true absences by chance lobo et al 2008 which is likely why the difference between pa and pb validation decreased with increased presence prevalence in our models in the context of our study the fact that pa and pb metrics gave different absolute values was not an issue as both pa and pb values demonstrated the same trends in performance under different sampling scenarios however it is important that users recognise that these metrics assessing discriminatory power of a model do not necessarily reflect a model s ability to capture the true distribution of a species predicted distribution patterns uncorrelated with the true probability of occurrence can produce high metric values warren et al 2019 and give misleading assessments of model performance mainali et al 2015 therefore it is important that if users report auc and kappa or similar metrics that they are interpreted alongside sensitivity specificity and evaluations of the spatial predictions 4 2 assessments of spatial predictions our assessments of spatial predictions involved assessing the consistency of predictions between algorithms and the stability of predictions across replicate models the consistency assessment highlighted that with certain presence size presence prevalence combinations algorithms can give quite different results datasets with high presence prevalence tend to give similar results regardless of algorithm or species but as shown in fig 3 higher presence prevalence leads to models with slightly lower accuracy metrics for both maxent and glm the analysis on agreement between replicates with changing sample characteristics figs 6 7 demonstrated that spatial predictions can be sensitive to changing sample characteristics as well as random selection of samples for replicates even in cases where performance metrics were not however a poor model that consistently overpredicts can still have a high fleiss kappa as seen for example in the glm and svm models in fig 7 high fleiss kappa along with high sensitivity but low specificity is a good indicator that models consistently overpredict and are not informative the value of the assessments of spatial predictions is that they can be used as single metrics describing the uncertainty of spatial predictions alternative methods could be used when modelling a single species such as visual assessments e g fig 7 the standard deviation or coefficient of variation of each pixel from a suite of candidate predictions e g stralberg et al 2015 or the use of indices that compare the spatial structure surrounding each cell such as the spatial similarity index robertson et al 2014 however when performing comparative assessments of models under many different scenarios metric based approaches may be preferred as adequately describing visual assessments of large numbers of candidate models becomes infeasible while the assessment of spatial predictions does not guarantee good model predictions it does inform the user on the spatial uncertainty caused by steps in the model building process this could be particularly useful when developing ensembles of models ensembles consist of a suite of models from different algorithms that are typically combined by taking average predictions weighted by accuracy metrics like auc or tss hao et al 2019 thuiller et al 2009 given the questionable reliability of these accuracy metrics assessments of spatial predictions presented here could inform model selection for inclusion in an ensemble identifying candidate models obtained using model parameters with low replicate variability could reduce model uncertainty in the ensemble 4 3 use of virtual species in sdm assessment there are obvious issues with using real species in a study such as this one due to inevitable sampling bias in the presence data and lack of true absence data this study emphasises the benefits of using virtual species to assess model predictions with complete knowledge of the true distribution of the species and the ability to select unbiased presence and absence samples this has allowed us to show the additional uncertainty present in performance metrics when these are calculated using background observations instead of true absences 5 conclusions all four of the algorithms tested performed well in some scenarios with maxent performing consistently well across all scenarios rf and svm were particularly sensitive to large background sample sizes relative to presence sample size i e small presence prevalence as such we recommend using equal numbers of presence and background samples for these algorithms as well as testing of equal weighting of background samples in line with liu et al 2019 for maxent and glm in contrast large background samples should be used we refrain from recommending a single algorithm for all modelling as different sdms may outperform others in certain situations qiao et al 2015 ensembles of algorithms are typically recommended to mitigate and quantify uncertainty introduced by different algorithms and appropriate selection of algorithms for this purpose is important maxent was the most consistently performing algorithm and given that it is explicitly designed to work with presence background data it certainly warrants selection amongst other candidate algorithms however the rationale behind selecting other algorithms for presence background modelling is less clear in most cases glm performed similarly to maxent but with slightly lower performance metrics and more variability between replicates in most scenarios when true absence samples are available rf may also be a good candidate algorithm but its use is cautioned against with low presence prevalence svm may be appropriate in some scenarios but parameters should be carefully selected due to the relative instability of the algorithm when evaluating model performance it is important to assess more than just a single performance metric elith and graham 2009 zurell et al 2012 indeed as we have shown relying on auc alone may masque instability in spatial predictions stability of replicate spatial predictions for single algorithms as measured by fleiss kappa along with agreement between predictions of different algorithms using pearson s correlation coefficient is an important consideration when describing the variability of model performance under different scenarios studies comparing a range of sdm algorithms under different scenarios are common e g elith et al 2006 graham and hijmans 2006 li and wang 2013 liu et al 2019 oppel et al 2012 but typically rely on performance metrics such as auc and cohen s kappa alone to describe model performance comparison and assessment of spatial predictions to assess stability should be standard for these types of studies to provide a more rounded evaluation of model performance finally model comparison studies should use virtual species where possible to calculate more accurate performance metrics future work to increase understanding of sdms and performance assessment should repeat aspects of our research with a greater range of characteristics defining the virtual species to better determine the influence of species geographic prevalence and other characteristics on sdm predictions the comparison between pa validated and pb validated metrics shows that these and other findings are likely to be valid in real world scenarios where only pb validation is possible in the majority of cases provided users consider the limitations of these metrics credit authorship contribution statement liam grimmett conceptualization methodology formal

24814,suppression of the whitefly bemisia tabaci gennadius and the thrips frankliniella occidentalis pergande by the predatory mite amblyseius swirskii athias henriot on greenhouse cucumbers can be considerably affected by cooler conditions in winter in this study this well known mite was tested simultaneously with a more recent predatory mite transeius montdorensis schicha to find out which of them was better at controlling pests on cucumbers in winter in mediterranean greenhouses we developed a mathematical predator prey model which involved releasing both predators with populations of the two naturally occurring pests in a greenhouse cucumber trial t montdorensis provided pest control that was similar to and as effective as that by a swirskii t montdorensis exhibited higher populations than a swirskii specifically when climatic conditions were colder however as the weather became warmer the a swirskii population increased quickly therefore releasing t montdorensis in winter followed with releases of a swirskii in spring may be a good pest control strategy for greenhouse cucumbers keywords augmentative biological control cucumis sativus lotka volterra model natural enemies western flower thrips 1 introduction protected cultivations have rapidly expanded in many regions all over the world particularly in those with mild winter conditions fernández et al 2018 in this respect the province of almería 36 50 n 02 23 o is a region of southern spain with the biggest concentration of greenhouses in the mediterranean basin 31 000 ha cucumber cultivation cucumis sativus l which is the third most abundant greenhouse vegetable in the region after tomato and sweet pepper cap 2018 occupies around 5000 ha the western flower thrips frankliniella occidentalis pergande thysanoptera thripidae and the whitefly bemisia tabaci genn hemiptera aleyrodidade are the two most damaging pests in greenhouse production both not only cause direct damage to plants by feeding but also inflict damage indirectly by transmitting viruses glass and gonzález 2012 implementing integrated pest management ipm techniques promotes the rational use of pesticides in greenhouses and uses a range of strategies among which the use of augmentative biological control has successfully increased in almería since 2007 ehler 2006 pilkinton et al 2012 use of commercially available predatory mites acari phytoseiidae has gained in popularity within the context of ipm programmes as being one of the most environmentally safe and economically viable pest management methods in greenhouse crops calvo et al 2014 vila and cabello 2014 van lenteren et al 2018 among predatory mites the phytoseiid amblyseius swirskii athias henriot is the primarily agent used in the biocontrol of whiteflies and thrips in a wide range of greenhouse crops including cucumber this predator attacks instars thrips larvae as well as whitefly eggs and crawlers but not adults bolckmans et al 2005 van maanen and janssen 2008 calvo et al 2012 moreover amblyseius swirskii can also develop and reproduce on a variety of other food sources including pollen nguyen et al 2013 in spring biological pest control in greenhouses is a successful pest management strategy however during winter using their natural enemies can be less effective since they may be affected by colder temperatures shorter photoperiods and lower relative humidity shipp et al 1996 2009 this is especially true in cucumbers for thrips nomikou et al 2002 van houten et al 2010 calvo et al 2011 téllez 2015 firstly in almería thrips populations start to increase in greenhouse crops during winter rodríguez et al 2018 secondly the inability of a swirskii to build up high populations during cooler conditions restricts their establishment shipp et al 2009 lee and gillespie 2011 finally for a swirskii messelink et al 2006 the lack of pollen in cucumber greenhouse varieties which produce only female flowers implies a shortage of non prey food therefore additional commercially available natural enemies need to be found that perform better in winter on greenhouse cucumbers recently the new predatory mite transeius montdorensis schicha mesostigmata phytoseiidae was identified as a suitable predator of thrips and whitefly in greenhouse crops steiner et al 2003 this phytoseiid is native to the neotropical region schicha 1979 and has recently come onto the biocontrol market in particular it has been commercially available in europe since 2004 and in spain since 2017 van lenteren et al 2018 t montdorensis can consume more thrips per day than a swirskii and high oviposition has been achieved under low temperature and low light conditions steiner et al 2003 hatherly et al 2004 recent evidence of its efficacy in suppressing thrips in cucumber greenhouse at northern latitudes has been provided labbé et al 2019 however no comparative studies have been published yet on how both predatory mites a swirskii vs t montdorensis control pests under mediterranean greenhouse conditions therefore there has been growing interest in the performance of new biological control agents like t montdorensis under such conditions mathematical models can be a useful tool for evaluating the effectiveness of multiple factors in biological control in an ipm strategy tang and cheke 2008 tian et al 2019 several studies have been carried out in greenhouses which focused on modeling dynamic population of pests and their natural enemies lloret climent et al 2014 or involved tri trophic interactions sánchez et al 2018 here we use the simple three species lotka volterra model which seemed to be a good option in the simplified environmental conditions of a greenhouse varga et al 2010 molnár et al 2016 new applications of these models have also been used in a biological control context in a variety of different situations for instance instead of a simple proportional conversion of prey predator numerical responses could be calculated from appropriate functional responses however in our case the interaction coefficients in the classical lotka volterra model we use could be considered as being the average slopes of the functional and numerical responses respectively however to develop a more accurate model which includes functional and numerical responses further trials will be needed so that we can design better fits for these responses furthermore in one predator two prey models the optimal foraging approach may also provide a more precise model see e g stephens and krebs 1986 therefore the objective of this study was to make comparisons by modeling the populations of two pests whitefly and thrips and two predators t montdorensis and a swirskii in order to determine which predator was more efficient in winter for cucumbers in mediterranean greenhouses 2 material and methods 2 1 experiment design the trial was conducted from mid november 2016 to end march 2017 in an experimental greenhouse with a surface area of 960 m2 at the ifapa research institute la mojonera almería spain latitude 36 45 n longitude 2 42 w cucumber seedlings cucumis sativus l from the variety cosaco fitó spain were planted on 17th november 2016 in perlite bags with a density of 2 plants m 2 in a type of semi closed hydroponic system the predatory mites were released 6 weeks after planting on 27th december 2016 the mites a swirskii and t montdorensis were supplied by bioline agrosciences ltd as a commercial product consisting in sachet based controlled release systems containing 250 mites all stages one sachet per 2 plants doses 125 ind m2 were hung at an average height and protected from direct sunlight the experiment had a randomized block design with two replications and one factor predator species as treatment with 2 levels a swirskii and t montdorensis the replicate plots were four 15 m rows spaced 150 cm apart this distance was reported to be enough to limit a swirskii dispersal when plants were not in contact buitenhuis et al 2009 lópez et al 2017 naturally occurring pest populations could migrate between plots during this experiment in which no chemicals treatments against pests were used 2 2 sampling sampling of pests and predatory mites was initiated 7 days after the predators were released six fully grown leaves were sampled from six interspersed plants per treatment at 7 day intervals for 13 consecutive weeks until 30th march the predators and pests were assessed in the laboratory using a stereo microscope zeiss stemi 2000 c carlzeiss germany all stages of predatory mites including eggs juveniles or adults were counted in each treatment as for the pests only the eggs and larvae of the whiteflies and those of the thrips were included in the analysis because they were the susceptible stages to predation by the predatory mites in addition the natural occurrence of adult stages of whitefly and thrips was monitored throughout the trial eight weekly samples by counting captures on fourteen 25 10 cm yellow sticky traps average 15 traps ha agrobio s l la mojonera almería spain distributed uniformly and placed at the same height as the crop and these were raised in tandem with the crop growth 2 3 data analysis the numbers of pests and predatory mites were expressed as insect day accumulated values ida this index proposed by ruppel 1983 was applied to evaluate the total pest impact over a given time period it was also used to evaluate the effect of biological pest control e g sánchez and lacasa 2008 cabello et al 2012 due to the non random design ida and mean number of eggs per leaf laid by both predatory mites were subject to statistical analysis with generalized linear models e g see millar and anderson 2004 semenov et al 2013 for the statistical analyses the models were fitted using maximum quasi likelihood estimation ibm 2017 with the genlin procedure with gamma errors and the log link function for ida and poisson errors and the log link function for the egg number per leaf using the ibm spss version 25 0 statistical software package the significance of the model was assessed by an omnibus test to test whether the explained variance in a dataset is significantly greater than the unexplained variance overall 2 4 mathematical model among the non stage structured multispecies models in the first study we decided to apply the simplest classical lotka volterra one in which each single species dynamics is malthusian meaning an increase in prey populations and decrease in predators a more precise model would be obtained with logistic rather than malthusian dynamics see e g scudo and ziegler 2013 however here predator prey interaction was just proportional to the product of densities as in the original lotka volterra model previous results based on thrip surveys carried out in almería greenhouses show that f occidentalis is particularly active in greenhouse crops throughout the winter season from october to april rodríguez et al 2018 moreover whitefly populations remain low in winter rodríguez et al 2018 therefore the number of f occidentalis captured by the yellow sticky traps was included in the model fig 1

the absence of the prey γ1 γ2 and γ3 are the slopes of the predator s functional response on killing the pest species respectively and γ 1 γ 2 and γ 3 are the slopes of the predator s numerical response on killing and eating the pest species respectively using the statistical software simfit version 2017 bardsley 2017 the system of equations 1 was fitted to the data corresponding to the number of leaves 3 results 3 1 effects of predators on populations of whitefly and thrips the temporal dynamics of whitefly and thrips were very similar in both mite treatments as indicated by the ida values monitored on the leaves throughout the trial fig 2 a b moreover the increase in mite population corresponded to reductions in those of the whiteflies and thrips thereby showing that both predators t montdorensis and a swirskii were good pest controllers fig 2a b in fact the predator species factor observed to neither effect the mite s ida chi square likelihood ratio 3 176 df 1 p 0 750 nor the whitefly s chi square likelihood ratio 0 469 df 1 p 0 494 nor the thrip s chi square likelihood ratio 3 082 df 1 p 0 790 in the mlgz analysis we found the mite species factor chi square likelihood ratio 15 041 df 1 p 0 0001 and the sampling factor chi square likelihood ratio 2104 335 df 12 p 0 0001 had significant effects thus for the sampling period the values of the number of eggs per leaf are shown in fig 3 for both predatory mite species the mean values estimated by statistical analysis were 4 04 0 29 egg leaf for t montdorensis which were significantly higher than the 2 54 0 20 found for a swirskii 3 2 predator response to prey abundance the dynamic populations of both mites t mondorensis and a swirskii was well simulated by the models with the predicted number of both predatory mites very close to those observed r 2 prediction 0 919 and 0 926 for t mondorensis and a swirskii respectively fig 4 a b table 1 the models also provided a highly accurate simulation of the dynamics of the two pest species whitefly and thrips both over time and in terms of numbers in both treatments fig 4a b table 1 the migrant adult thrips in the greenhouses captured by the yellow sticky traps was also well simulated fig 4a b table 1 the model results showed that both predators controlled increases in whitefly and thrip populations and eventually suppressed both pests in the middle of the crop cycle particularly in the period between 40 and 60 days when the weather was colder t montdorensis showed higher populations than a swirskii fig 4a and the former actually had a lower death rate in the absence of prey table 1 however as the weather became warmer a swirskii populations increased quickly fig 4b overall with the treatment with a swirskii there was a lower growth rate in whitefly populations table 1 similarly the growth rate in thrips was slightly lower with the treatment with a swirskii than that with t montdorensis table 1 4 discussion in this research we investigated whether the use of the predatory mite transeius montdorensis in the biological control of two greenhouse pests whitefly and thrips resulted in better control than that carried out by the mite amblyseius swirskii our results showed that both of them were equally effective predators on cucumbers in winter in mediterranean greenhouse conditions there were no significant differences between the ida value in the t montdorensis and a swirskii treatments this was also true with the ida values for whitefly and thrips between the two mite treatments moreover the presence of these mites reduced whitefly and thrip abundance overall these results indicate that each mite successfully controlled whitefly and thrip populations few studies on the density and predation of t montdorensis on b tabaci and f occidentalis have been reported for instance our results confirmed previous findings by labbé et al 2019 in greenhouse cucumbers by demonstrating that this mite is a good predator of thrips in winter similar to other phytoseiid mites such as a swirskii and amblydromalus limonicus and even better than neoseiulus cucumeris there have been similar findings in ornamental crops in which it was one of the natural enemies analysed for controlling thrips and seen to be one of the best pest controllers manners et al 2013 as for controlling the whiteflies species b tabaci and trialurodes vaporarium westwood in poinsettia plants it showed it was similarly effective as the parasitic wasp encarsia formosa and more so than a limonicus richter 2017 moreover the model outcomes showed that it coped with winter environmental conditions the best in fact we recorded significant differences in the number of eggs laid by both predators which depending on the sampling period and these differences were higher between 40 60 days into the trial which directly corresponded to the dates 7 27 february this period of time was characterised by low relative humidity rh to be specific we recorded over ten hours per day with a rh below 70 data not shown furthermore in the warmer conditions at the end of the trial a swirskii performed much better in fact their population did not grow in colder crop conditions but showed high and fast growth in warmer weather these results closely matched those reported by clymans et al 2017 in which seven predatory mite species were evaluated under different climatic conditions in strawberries they showed that the warmest regime was that most adequate for populations of a swirskii to grow in addition and as reported in other studies on greenhouse pests in almería rodríguez et al 2018 the outcomes of the models showed that whitefly abundance tended to be low in winter whereas thrips gradually increased in abundance in this period with a more marked population increase in spring the model results table 1 showed that whiteflies exhibited lower population growth when a swirskii was present suggesting that in general it was the optimum predator for reducing the whitefly population albeit it had a stagnant population in colder conditions in conclusion in winter t montdorensis was the only mite whose population grew significantly but in warmer weather a swirskii was the most adequate predatory mite these findings led to significant practical considerations since it is likely that seasonal and consecutive releases of the two predatory mite species first t montdorensis in autumn winter and then a swirskii in spring will suppress both pests on cucumbers therefore studies need to be made to determine whether seasonal alternation of the two predatory mites within the mediterranean winter crop season could lead to enhanced pest control in cucumbers overall 5 conclusion the two predatory phytoseiid mites amblyseius swirskii and transeius montdorensis were generally speaking good biological agents for whitefly and thrip control under mediterranean greenhouse conditions nevertheless t montdorensis showed better growth capacity in the winter than did a swirskii however as spring approached a swirskii was seen to be the best predator therefore greenhouse pest control in the winter crop season may be greatly enhanced by combining seasonal and consecutive releases of t montdorensis in the autumn winter and a swirskii afterwards in spring rather than releasing them individually

24814,suppression of the whitefly bemisia tabaci gennadius and the thrips frankliniella occidentalis pergande by the predatory mite amblyseius swirskii athias henriot on greenhouse cucumbers can be considerably affected by cooler conditions in winter in this study this well known mite was tested simultaneously with a more recent predatory mite transeius montdorensis schicha to find out which of them was better at controlling pests on cucumbers in winter in mediterranean greenhouses we developed a mathematical predator prey model which involved releasing both predators with populations of the two naturally occurring pests in a greenhouse cucumber trial t montdorensis provided pest control that was similar to and as effective as that by a swirskii t montdorensis exhibited higher populations than a swirskii specifically when climatic conditions were colder however as the weather became warmer the a swirskii population increased quickly therefore releasing t montdorensis in winter followed with releases of a swirskii in spring may be a good pest control strategy for greenhouse cucumbers keywords augmentative biological control cucumis sativus lotka volterra model natural enemies western flower thrips 1 introduction protected cultivations have rapidly expanded in many regions all over the world particularly in those with mild winter conditions fernández et al 2018 in this respect the province of almería 36 50 n 02 23 o is a region of southern spain with the biggest concentration of greenhouses in the mediterranean basin 31 000 ha cucumber cultivation cucumis sativus l which is the third most abundant greenhouse vegetable in the region after tomato and sweet pepper cap 2018 occupies around 5000 ha the western flower thrips frankliniella occidentalis pergande thysanoptera thripidae and the whitefly bemisia tabaci genn hemiptera aleyrodidade are the two most damaging pests in greenhouse production both not only cause direct damage to plants by feeding but also inflict damage indirectly by transmitting viruses glass and gonzález 2012 implementing integrated pest management ipm techniques promotes the rational use of pesticides in greenhouses and uses a range of strategies among which the use of augmentative biological control has successfully increased in almería since 2007 ehler 2006 pilkinton et al 2012 use of commercially available predatory mites acari phytoseiidae has gained in popularity within the context of ipm programmes as being one of the most environmentally safe and economically viable pest management methods in greenhouse crops calvo et al 2014 vila and cabello 2014 van lenteren et al 2018 among predatory mites the phytoseiid amblyseius swirskii athias henriot is the primarily agent used in the biocontrol of whiteflies and thrips in a wide range of greenhouse crops including cucumber this predator attacks instars thrips larvae as well as whitefly eggs and crawlers but not adults bolckmans et al 2005 van maanen and janssen 2008 calvo et al 2012 moreover amblyseius swirskii can also develop and reproduce on a variety of other food sources including pollen nguyen et al 2013 in spring biological pest control in greenhouses is a successful pest management strategy however during winter using their natural enemies can be less effective since they may be affected by colder temperatures shorter photoperiods and lower relative humidity shipp et al 1996 2009 this is especially true in cucumbers for thrips nomikou et al 2002 van houten et al 2010 calvo et al 2011 téllez 2015 firstly in almería thrips populations start to increase in greenhouse crops during winter rodríguez et al 2018 secondly the inability of a swirskii to build up high populations during cooler conditions restricts their establishment shipp et al 2009 lee and gillespie 2011 finally for a swirskii messelink et al 2006 the lack of pollen in cucumber greenhouse varieties which produce only female flowers implies a shortage of non prey food therefore additional commercially available natural enemies need to be found that perform better in winter on greenhouse cucumbers recently the new predatory mite transeius montdorensis schicha mesostigmata phytoseiidae was identified as a suitable predator of thrips and whitefly in greenhouse crops steiner et al 2003 this phytoseiid is native to the neotropical region schicha 1979 and has recently come onto the biocontrol market in particular it has been commercially available in europe since 2004 and in spain since 2017 van lenteren et al 2018 t montdorensis can consume more thrips per day than a swirskii and high oviposition has been achieved under low temperature and low light conditions steiner et al 2003 hatherly et al 2004 recent evidence of its efficacy in suppressing thrips in cucumber greenhouse at northern latitudes has been provided labbé et al 2019 however no comparative studies have been published yet on how both predatory mites a swirskii vs t montdorensis control pests under mediterranean greenhouse conditions therefore there has been growing interest in the performance of new biological control agents like t montdorensis under such conditions mathematical models can be a useful tool for evaluating the effectiveness of multiple factors in biological control in an ipm strategy tang and cheke 2008 tian et al 2019 several studies have been carried out in greenhouses which focused on modeling dynamic population of pests and their natural enemies lloret climent et al 2014 or involved tri trophic interactions sánchez et al 2018 here we use the simple three species lotka volterra model which seemed to be a good option in the simplified environmental conditions of a greenhouse varga et al 2010 molnár et al 2016 new applications of these models have also been used in a biological control context in a variety of different situations for instance instead of a simple proportional conversion of prey predator numerical responses could be calculated from appropriate functional responses however in our case the interaction coefficients in the classical lotka volterra model we use could be considered as being the average slopes of the functional and numerical responses respectively however to develop a more accurate model which includes functional and numerical responses further trials will be needed so that we can design better fits for these responses furthermore in one predator two prey models the optimal foraging approach may also provide a more precise model see e g stephens and krebs 1986 therefore the objective of this study was to make comparisons by modeling the populations of two pests whitefly and thrips and two predators t montdorensis and a swirskii in order to determine which predator was more efficient in winter for cucumbers in mediterranean greenhouses 2 material and methods 2 1 experiment design the trial was conducted from mid november 2016 to end march 2017 in an experimental greenhouse with a surface area of 960 m2 at the ifapa research institute la mojonera almería spain latitude 36 45 n longitude 2 42 w cucumber seedlings cucumis sativus l from the variety cosaco fitó spain were planted on 17th november 2016 in perlite bags with a density of 2 plants m 2 in a type of semi closed hydroponic system the predatory mites were released 6 weeks after planting on 27th december 2016 the mites a swirskii and t montdorensis were supplied by bioline agrosciences ltd as a commercial product consisting in sachet based controlled release systems containing 250 mites all stages one sachet per 2 plants doses 125 ind m2 were hung at an average height and protected from direct sunlight the experiment had a randomized block design with two replications and one factor predator species as treatment with 2 levels a swirskii and t montdorensis the replicate plots were four 15 m rows spaced 150 cm apart this distance was reported to be enough to limit a swirskii dispersal when plants were not in contact buitenhuis et al 2009 lópez et al 2017 naturally occurring pest populations could migrate between plots during this experiment in which no chemicals treatments against pests were used 2 2 sampling sampling of pests and predatory mites was initiated 7 days after the predators were released six fully grown leaves were sampled from six interspersed plants per treatment at 7 day intervals for 13 consecutive weeks until 30th march the predators and pests were assessed in the laboratory using a stereo microscope zeiss stemi 2000 c carlzeiss germany all stages of predatory mites including eggs juveniles or adults were counted in each treatment as for the pests only the eggs and larvae of the whiteflies and those of the thrips were included in the analysis because they were the susceptible stages to predation by the predatory mites in addition the natural occurrence of adult stages of whitefly and thrips was monitored throughout the trial eight weekly samples by counting captures on fourteen 25 10 cm yellow sticky traps average 15 traps ha agrobio s l la mojonera almería spain distributed uniformly and placed at the same height as the crop and these were raised in tandem with the crop growth 2 3 data analysis the numbers of pests and predatory mites were expressed as insect day accumulated values ida this index proposed by ruppel 1983 was applied to evaluate the total pest impact over a given time period it was also used to evaluate the effect of biological pest control e g sánchez and lacasa 2008 cabello et al 2012 due to the non random design ida and mean number of eggs per leaf laid by both predatory mites were subject to statistical analysis with generalized linear models e g see millar and anderson 2004 semenov et al 2013 for the statistical analyses the models were fitted using maximum quasi likelihood estimation ibm 2017 with the genlin procedure with gamma errors and the log link function for ida and poisson errors and the log link function for the egg number per leaf using the ibm spss version 25 0 statistical software package the significance of the model was assessed by an omnibus test to test whether the explained variance in a dataset is significantly greater than the unexplained variance overall 2 4 mathematical model among the non stage structured multispecies models in the first study we decided to apply the simplest classical lotka volterra one in which each single species dynamics is malthusian meaning an increase in prey populations and decrease in predators a more precise model would be obtained with logistic rather than malthusian dynamics see e g scudo and ziegler 2013 however here predator prey interaction was just proportional to the product of densities as in the original lotka volterra model previous results based on thrip surveys carried out in almería greenhouses show that f occidentalis is particularly active in greenhouse crops throughout the winter season from october to april rodríguez et al 2018 moreover whitefly populations remain low in winter rodríguez et al 2018 therefore the number of f occidentalis captured by the yellow sticky traps was included in the model fig 1 shows the network interactions used in our model according to the nomenclature used by mills 2006 whose equations are shown below 1 pest 1 b t a b a c i x 1 x 1 m 1 γ 1 x 4 pest 2 f o c c i d e n t a

number leaf of pests and predator species respectively according to the terminology of abrams 2012 m 1 m 2 and m 3 are the intrinsic growth rate of the pests m 4 is the death rate of the predator in the absence of the prey γ1 γ2 and γ3 are the slopes of the predator s functional response on killing the pest species respectively and γ 1 γ 2 and γ 3 are the slopes of the predator s numerical response on killing and eating the pest species respectively using the statistical software simfit version 2017 bardsley 2017 the system of equations 1 was fitted to the data corresponding to the number of leaves 3 results 3 1 effects of predators on populations of whitefly and thrips the temporal dynamics of whitefly and thrips were very similar in both mite treatments as indicated by the ida values monitored on the leaves throughout the trial fig 2 a b moreover the increase in mite population corresponded to reductions in those of the whiteflies and thrips thereby showing that both predators t montdorensis and a swirskii were good pest controllers fig 2a b in fact the predator species factor observed to neither effect the mite s ida chi square likelihood ratio 3 176 df 1 p 0 750 nor the whitefly s chi square likelihood ratio 0 469 df 1 p 0 494 nor the thrip s chi square likelihood ratio 3 082 df 1 p 0 790 in the mlgz analysis we found the mite species factor chi square likelihood ratio 15 041 df 1 p 0 0001 and the sampling factor chi square likelihood ratio 2104 335 df 12 p 0 0001 had significant effects thus for the sampling period the values of the number of eggs per leaf are shown in fig 3 for both predatory mite species the mean values estimated by statistical analysis were 4 04 0 29 egg leaf for t montdorensis which were significantly higher than the 2 54 0 20 found for a swirskii 3 2 predator response to prey abundance the dynamic populations of both mites t mondorensis and a swirskii was well simulated by the models with the predicted number of both predatory mites very close to those observed r 2 prediction 0 919 and 0 926 for t mondorensis and a swirskii respectively fig 4 a b table 1 the models also provided a highly accurate simulation of the dynamics of the two pest species whitefly and thrips both over time and in terms of numbers in both treatments fig 4a b table 1 the migrant adult thrips in the greenhouses captured by the yellow sticky traps was also well simulated fig 4a b table 1 the model results showed that both predators controlled increases in whitefly and thrip populations and eventually suppressed both pests in the middle of the crop cycle particularly in the period between 40 and 60 days when the weather was colder t montdorensis showed higher populations than a swirskii fig 4a and the former actually had a lower death rate in the absence of prey table 1 however as the weather became warmer a swirskii populations increased quickly fig 4b overall with the treatment with a swirskii there was a lower growth rate in whitefly populations table 1 similarly the growth rate in thrips was slightly lower with the treatment with a swirskii than that with t montdorensis table 1 4 discussion in this research we investigated whether the use of the predatory mite transeius montdorensis in the biological control of two greenhouse pests whitefly and thrips resulted in better control than that carried out by the mite amblyseius swirskii our results showed that both of them were equally effective predators on cucumbers in winter in mediterranean greenhouse conditions there were no significant differences between the ida value in the t montdorensis and a swirskii treatments this was also true with the ida values for whitefly and thrips between the two mite treatments moreover the presence of these mites reduced whitefly and thrip abundance overall these results indicate that each mite successfully controlled whitefly and thrip populations few studies on the density and predation of t montdorensis on b tabaci and f occidentalis have been reported for instance our results confirmed previous findings by labbé et al 2019 in greenhouse cucumbers by demonstrating that this mite is a good predator of thrips in winter similar to other phytoseiid mites such as a swirskii and amblydromalus limonicus and even better than neoseiulus cucumeris there have been similar findings in ornamental crops in which it was one of the natural enemies analysed for controlling thrips and seen to be one of the best pest controllers manners et al 2013 as for controlling the whiteflies species b tabaci and trialurodes vaporarium westwood in poinsettia plants it showed it was similarly effective as the parasitic wasp encarsia formosa and more so than a limonicus richter 2017 moreover the model outcomes showed that it coped with winter environmental conditions the best in fact we recorded significant differences in the number of eggs laid by both predators which depending on the sampling period and these differences were higher between 40 60 days into the trial which directly corresponded to the dates 7 27 february this period of time was characterised by low relative humidity rh to be specific we recorded over ten hours per day with a rh below 70 data not shown furthermore in the warmer conditions at the end of the trial a swirskii performed much better in fact their population did not grow in colder crop conditions but showed high and fast growth in warmer weather these results closely matched those reported by clymans et al 2017 in which seven predatory mite species were evaluated under different climatic conditions in strawberries they showed that the warmest regime was that most adequate for populations of a swirskii to grow in addition and as reported in other studies on greenhouse pests in almería rodríguez et al 2018 the outcomes of the models showed that whitefly abundance tended to be low in winter whereas thrips gradually increased in abundance in this period with a more marked population increase in spring the model results table 1 showed that whiteflies exhibited lower population growth when a swirskii was present suggesting that in general it was the optimum predator for reducing the whitefly population albeit it had a stagnant population in colder conditions in conclusion in winter t montdorensis was the only mite whose population grew significantly but in warmer weather a swirskii was the most adequate predatory mite these findings led to significant practical considerations since it is likely that seasonal and consecutive releases of the two predatory mite species first t montdorensis in autumn winter and then a swirskii in spring will suppress both pests on cucumbers therefore studies need to be made to determine whether seasonal alternation of the two predatory mites within the mediterranean winter crop season could lead to enhanced pest control in cucumbers overall 5 conclusion the two predatory phytoseiid mites amblyseius swirskii and transeius montdorensis were generally speaking good biological agents for whitefly and thrip control under mediterranean greenhouse conditions nevertheless t montdorensis showed better growth capacity in the winter than did a swirskii however as spring approached a swirskii was seen to be the best predator therefore greenhouse pest control in the winter crop season may be greatly enhanced by combining seasonal and consecutive releases of t montdorensis in the autumn winter and a swirskii afterwards in spring rather than releasing them individually
