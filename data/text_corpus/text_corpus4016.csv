chemical and biological characteristics as well as the composition of litter this study investigated the variation of litter breakdown rates with different water qualities and microbial activities influenced by dam operation litter bags were installed along nakatsugawa river which is regulated by takizawa dam and arakawa river in saitama prefecture central japan during autumn and winter three dominant leaf species were studied namely quercus serrata carpinus cordata and acer mono the factors possibly affecting the litter breakdown process were 1 a 4 c higher water temperature downstream

in streams has been widely assessed hisabae et al 2011 nakajima et al 2006 kobayashi and kagaya 2005 yanai and kochi 2005 uchida et al 2005 konishi et al 2001 however research on the impact of dams is still lacking in addition a comparison between the nakatsugawa and the arakawa was performed to answer research question 3 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted between

experimental location at the arakawa was located 100 m from site ds3 2 2 water quality the water quality was measured during collection of the litter bags which is described in section 2 3 streamflow was determined by an electromagnetic flow meter sf 5511 keisoku japan onsite parameters including water temperature ph and conductivity were recorded by a water quality sensor 556mps ysi nanotec japan meanwhile water samples were collected and kept in a cool box prior to delivery to the laboratory they were then filtered through a gf f filter paper whatman u s the filtrate was used for determination of doc by an organic carbon analyser toc 5000a shimadzu japan and for determination of nutrients including na mg2 ca2 no3 and po4 3 by an ion analyser ia 100 toa dkk japan 2 3 litter breakdown rate selected leaf species were dominant riparian species in the study area namely quercus serrata carpinus cordata and acer mono leaves were cut from senescent riparian trees the collected litters were dried at room temperature until the weight was constant the dried litters were sieved by a 1 cm mesh to remove attached sediments and invertebrates then the sieved litters of each species were weighed and inserted in a 1 mm nylon mesh bag with a size of 20 40 cm a pore size of 1 mm was selected to minimize interference by invertebrates in the litter breakdown process webster and benfield 1986 the prepared litter bags were gently immersed at the study sites and were collected on days 3 11 25 42 and 61 the collected litter bags were kept in a cool box during transportation in the laboratory they were stored in a chiller for further analysis for the assessment of the breakdown rate the chilled litter samples were gently rinsed with distilled water to remove the invertebrates inorganic matter and algae attached on the surfaces the rinsed litters were dried at 65 c in a convection oven ndo 700 evela japan until the samples were completely dry the dried samples from each bag were then weighed in addition 200 mg of dried litter was taken from each bag and incinerated at 550 c in an electrical furnace tmf 2200 eyela japan for 2 h to determine the ash free dry mass afdm for weight correction the corrected mass over time was plotted in order to calculate the exponential decay coefficient k following the method reported by webster and benfield 1986 the equation used is shown below w t w i e kt where w t is the dry mass at time t gram w i is the initial dry mass gram t is the time day and k is the exponential decay coefficient day 1 initial handling losses of litter were unavoidable during transportation and immersion of the litter bag in the streams however it was assumed that such losses were negligible as the values did not change the result of the exponential decay coefficient 2 4 litter composition the contents of total carbon and nitrogen in the collected litter samples were measured using a chn corder mt 5 yanaco japan in addition soluble organic hemicellulose cellulose and lignin contents were determined by an ankom fibre analyser ankon technology u s following the method of van soest and wine 1967 neutral detergent solubles e g cell contents and pectin in the litter samples were digested with alpha amylase for 75 min consequently hemicellulose was extracted by soaking the previously digested litters with acid detergent fibre adf reagent for 60 min then the remaining cellulose and lignin were investigated by hydrolysis using 72 sulfuric acid for 3 h 2 5 microbial activity 2 5 1 hydrolytic enzyme activity the concentration of fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity fda can represent the total hydrolytic enzyme produced by microorganisms for decomposition of organic matter rotman and papermaster 1966 in this study the method of gillian and duncan 2001 was adopted to estimate the fda concentration first 0 5 g of the collected litter was added to a prepared 5 0 ml mixture with 1 mg ml 1 of fda and 6 mm of potassium phosphate buffer ph 7 6 the mixed solution was incubated at 30 c for 20 min in a water bath incubator bt47 yamato japan next 5 ml of acetone 50 v v was added to the incubated solution which was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min then 5 ml of supernatant was filtered through a whatman grand no 2 whatman u s the fluorescent coloration intensity of the filtrate was measured using a spectrophotometer uv mini 1240 shimadzu japan at 490 nm 2 5 2 fungal biomass determination of fungal biomass referred to the standard method of ergosterol extraction gulis and suberkropp 2006 five discs 5 cm in diameter of the collected litters were placed in a flask with 25 ml of methanol and 5 ml of alcoholic koh the flasks were installed with reflux condensers in a water bath incubator bt47 yamato japan at 70 c for 30 min the extract was then transferred to a screw top tube with 10 ml of distilled water and 10 ml of pentane the upper phase of pentane was gently retrieved using a pasteur pipette and transferred into a conical centrifuge tube to be evaporated at 30 c under a stream of n2 when the pentane was entirely evaporated the residue was dissolved in 2 ml of methanol and sonicated until the residue on the tube wall was not visible the extract was then filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter into a vial the ergosterol concentration was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc i series plus shimadzu japan with uv detection of 282 nm and methanol as a mobile phase 2 5 3 bacterial productivity the leucine incorporation method developed by kirchman 2001 was applied for estimation of bacterial productivity discs of the collected litters 5 cm in diameter were stored in a tube with 10 nm of h3 leucine solution the solution was sonicated for 5 min with the addition of 3 25 ml of 15 trichloroacetic acid the sonicated solution was heated at 95 c in a water bath incubator bt47 yamato japan for 30 min and then cooled down to room temperature the solution was then filtered and the filter paper was rinsed with distilled water and placed in a labelled scintillation vial with 10 ml of a scintillation cocktail and the vial was radioassayed by a liquid scintillation counter tri carb 4910tr 110 v perkinelmer japan to determine the disintegrations per minute dpm for each vial 2 5 4 statistical analysis mean differences in water quality remaining litter weight and fda concentration among the study sites and selected litter species were statistically tested using anova followed by post hoc least significant difference lsd tests it was assumed that a significant difference in k could be met under the condition when the anova test leads to rejection of the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the mean of the remaining litter weight among the compared sites or species with 95 confidence interval in order to respond to the research questions a comparative criterion was set as follows 1 does the dam increase the breakdown rate due to higher temperature was answered by a comparison of the water quality the remaining litter weight and k among up and downstream sites 2 does the breakdown rate in the distant downstream area recover to the upstream condition was investigated by comparing locations along the river downstream of takizawa dam and 3 does the water quality such as doc and nutrients play a significant role in the breakdown rate was proved by the differences between ds3 and the arakawa in which other external factors were attempted to be minimized by selecting a location with similar meteorological and geographical conditions where the litter bags in the arakawa was set 100 m from site ds3 in this case the paired t test analysis was applied for the comparison between two sites in the case of litter composition pearson correlation r was applied to evaluate the strength of the relation between the remaining litter weight and the respective compositions 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality a summary of water quality at the study sites during the experimental period is shown in fig 2 in the nakatsugawa the water temperature at up was the lowest compared with the downstream sites ds1 p 0 011 ds2 p 0 016 and ds3 p 0 019 with an average difference of 4 08 c 0 18 sd this was consistent with previous studies webb and walling 1996 olden and naiman 2010 maheu et al 2016 olden and naiman 2010 assessed annual thermographs from regulated rivers across the world and showed the impact of river regulation on summer cooling and winter warming caused by the dam maheu et al 2016 conducted a study along three rivers in eastern canada and found that the temperature of water regulated by a dam was a maximum of 3 6 c higher than the water temperature of neighbouring unregulated rivers during winter likewise no3 was lower at up than at downstream sites ds1 p 0 000 ds2 p 0 000 and ds3 p 0 000 however there were no significant differences in streamflow ph conductivity doc mg2 ca2 and po4 3 between up and downstream sites p 0 05 furthermore recovery of downstream water quality to upstream conditions was not found as there were no differences among ds1 ds2 and ds3 p 0 05 this may be due to the short distance from the dam to ds3 3 0 km in which to return to equilibrium o keeffe et al 1990 indicated that the recovery can be detected at a distance of up to 30 km for a large dam in the case of the arakawa no difference in water temperature compared with downstream sites was detected p 0 189 however other water quality parameters including conductivity doc na mg2 ca2 and no3 were lower p 0 05 this was due to the differences in geographical characteristics and land use between the two rivers 3 2 litter breakdown rates and compositions initial litter compositions weight remaining over time and exponential decay coefficient k are shown in table 1 fig 3 and fig 4 respectively during the study the litter bags set up at up were lost therefore the sample bags containing q serrata c cordata and a mono were left in place until day 42 day 42 and day 25 respectively therefore the comparison on day 25 was performed to compare the initial breakdown rate among up and downstream sites while the comparison on day 42 aimed to assess the impact of the dam on the breakdown rate of q serrata and c cordata in order to respond to research question 1 likewise day 61 was evaluated among downstream sites for research question 2 to investigate the recovery of the decomposition rate a comparison between the arakawa and ds3 was performed on day 61 to answer research question 3 regarding the influence of water quality on breakdown rate according to the anova analysis there was no difference in the remaining litter weights between upstream and downstream of the dam throughout the study period p 0 05 therefore in response to research question 1 referring to insignificant difference in the remaining weight aforementioned it indicates that the dam did not increase the litter breakdown rate in the downstream area the positive correlation of litter breakdown rate with temperature martínez et al 2014 shah et al 2017 and nitrogen availability meyer and johnson 1983 ferreira et al 2006 has been widely demonstrated as up had lower water temperature and lower content of no3 than those in the downstream sites nevertheless their contribution to increase in the litter breakdown rate was not found during the study period more study sites in upstream and downstream of the dam are required for clarification in addition in research question 2 recovery of the breakdown rate to upstream conditions did not occur at the distance of 3 km downstream from the dam in correspondence with the findings on water quality it was expected that a distance of 3 km was not sufficient to detect the recovery comparing the arakawa with ds3 on day 61 it is apparent that the breakdown rate at the arakawa was lower in the case of q serrata difference from ds3 p 0 004 was found while for c cordata difference from ds3 p 0 022 was also detected the reason was that a high content of silt deposition on litters appeared at the arakawa as shown in fig 5 the silt content in the arakawa originates from the surrounding sandstone of the neogene it was consistent with the afdm results on day 61 the average afdm values of q serrata c cordata and a mono at the downstream site of the nakatsugawa were 88 54 0 01 sd 90 40 0 91 sd and 89 58 1 06 sd respectively while at the arakawa the results were 83 03 1 98 sd 86 11 0 01 sd and 82 48 0 02 sd respectively these findings indicated the potential decelerating impact of inorganic matter deposition on the litter breakdown rate in line with the leaching process microbes perform colonization on litter and a polysaccharide matrix is produced to trap suspended matter allan 1995 including silt then the colony binds the silt on the litter consequently the silt acts as a barrier reducing the area exposed to the stream and microbial colonization moreover according to the results of water quality compared with downstream sites the arakawa had lower conductivity doc na mg2 ca2 and no3 p 0 05 toetz and payton 2009 found that doc containing humic substance reduced the intensity of harmful uv b radiation in the water and provided habitats for microbial growth furthermore tipping and cooke 1982 concluded that the availability of divalent cations reduced the inhibition rate of humic acid which retarded enzyme activity based on their laboratory experiment one possible reason could be that mg2 and ca2 were able to bridge the humic acid molecules and hence limited the mobility of those substances in the stream in addition meyer and johnson 1983 indicated that the nitrate enriched stream accelerated the litter breakdown process through enhancement of microbial processing the k value of q serrata at the arakawa was 0 0033 which was lower than the value at ds3 0 0058 likewise the k value of c cordata at the arakawa was 0 0032 which was lower than ds3 0 0047 in response to research question 3 all these results indicate that water quality especially inorganic content water temperature doc and nutrients plays a significant role in the litter breakdown rate in addition differences in remaining weight were found between q serrata and c cordata p 0 005 and between c cordata and a mono p 0 000 the difference between c cordata and other species referred to the initial litter compositions c cordata contained the largest portion of lignin 19 07 0 01 sd followed by a mono 15 36 0 01 sd and q serrata 12 14 0 01 sd lignin is regarded as the most persistent organic component contained in leaves due to their complex structure of aromatic polymer compounds such compounds form through the esterification of phenylpropanoid structures and polymer carbohydrates therefore leaf litter rich in lignin tends to be highly refractory leading to a slow breakdown rate berg and mcclaugherty 2003 across all litter species a strong correlation between litter composition and remaining weight was detected in the case of soluble carbohydrate r 0 92 to 0 98 and lignin r 0 83 to 0 99 as summarized in table 2 suberkropp et al 1976 suggested that the negative trend of lignin against remaining weight could be attributed to the increase of complexed nitrogen containing compounds in the lignin fraction furthermore the weak relationship of hemicellulose and cellulose was caused by their constancy throughout the study period this constancy was due to the slow exposure of these constituents to microbial metabolism through the removal of other components 3 3 microbial activities the trends of fda concentration fluctuated across all litter species as illustrated in fig 6 on day 42 it was apparent that the difference in fda in the particular litter specie across the study sites was not found p 0 05 on day 61 there were differences between ds3 and the arakawa p 0 016 for q serrata fda at ds3 was 3 19 0 02 sd higher than at the arakawa 2 51 0 12 sd the result was in consistence with the conclusion in research question 3 demonstrating the suitable condition of water quality for microbial activity nevertheless the results were in contrast with geisseler et al 2009 who indicated that a ratio of carbon to nitrogen lower than 30 provided adequate nitrogen availability for microbial uptake in this study a mono had a c n ratio lower than 30 throughout the study period as shown in fig 7 however there was no difference in the fda activity on a mono compared with other species for the estimation of bacterial productivity the samples of q serrata on day 61 collected from ds1 and the arakawa were used fig 8 a the productivity on q serrata on day 61 was 6 80 10 11 gc cm 2 h 1 at ds1 and 1 34 10 11 gc cm 2 h 1 at the arakawa we then immersed q serrata collected from ds1 on day 61 in the arakawa water the productivity was decreased by 3 40 10 11 gc cm 2 h 1 two fold reduction in contrast when q serrata collected on day 61 from the arakawa was immersed in ds1 water the productivity was increased to 2 39 10 11 gc cm 2 h 1 a 1 8 fold increase this experiment confirmed that the bacterial productivity was higher at ds1 than at the arakawa driven by water quality differences this may be because of the high nutrient contents and divalent cation ion concentration in water at ds1 clifton et al 2015 it is noteworthy that the temperature of the water representing ds1 and the arakawa used in the experiment was set to room temperature for future study it is recommended that a water temperature comparable to that employed in the field survey be used in order to give a more accurate result reflecting the real conditions in the study area in this study a limited number of paired samples were used and replication is therefore required it is believed that the experimental design developed in this study could be applied in other areas to assess the response of bacterial productivity or other microbial activity to altered water quality in addition the fungal biomass for q serrata on day 61 from ds1 and the arakawa was measured and the results are shown in fig 8 b the fungal biomass was higher on the litters from the arakawa than on those from ds1 nevertheless it was expected that fungal biomass on the litters from the arakawa would be equal to or lower than those from ds1 referring to the previous findings the results are contrary to that of baldy et al 1995 who indicated that fungi play an eminently important role in biological decomposition in the litter breakdown process in this study it is still unexplainable and an in depth study is required for clarification 4 conclusions this study concluded that a dam alters the water quality downstream especially the water temperature however in this study no increase in the litter breakdown rate was observed as a consequence of the dam regulation since there was no statistical difference between the upstream and downstream rates likewise recovery of the breakdown rate to upstream conditions was not found at a distant downstream site bacterial productivity was a major player in litter breakdown and its vitality was dependent upon the water temperature and contents of doc and nutrients also a high content of suspended inorganic matter e g silk decreased the area of exposure to microbial colonization resulting in a lower litter breakdown rate moreover a high lignin content made the litter more resistant to the microbial decomposition process due to the complex interaction among various factors a larger number of sites upstream and downstream of the dam are necessary for future study in order to clarify the impact of the dam conflict of interest

invertebrates inorganic matter and algae attached on the surfaces the rinsed litters were dried at 65 c in a convection oven ndo 700 evela japan until the samples were completely dry the dried samples from each bag were then weighed in addition 200 mg of dried litter was taken from each bag and incinerated at 550 c in an electrical furnace tmf 2200 eyela japan for 2 h to determine the ash free dry mass afdm for weight correction the corrected mass over time was plotted in order to calculate the exponential decay coefficient k following the method reported by webster and benfield 1986 the equation used is shown below w t w i e kt where w t is the dry mass at time t gram w i is the initial dry mass gram t is the time day and k is the exponential decay coefficient day 1 initial handling losses of litter were unavoidable during transportation and immersion of the litter bag in the streams however it was assumed that such losses were negligible as the values did not change the result of the exponential decay coefficient 2 4 litter composition the contents of total carbon and nitrogen in the collected litter samples were measured using a chn corder mt 5 yanaco japan in addition soluble organic hemicellulose cellulose and lignin contents were determined by an ankom fibre analyser ankon technology u s following the method of van soest and wine 1967 neutral detergent solubles e g cell contents and pectin in the litter samples were digested with alpha amylase for 75 min consequently hemicellulose was extracted by soaking the previously digested litters with acid detergent fibre adf reagent for 60 min then the remaining cellulose and lignin were investigated by hydrolysis using 72 sulfuric acid for 3 h 2 5 microbial activity 2 5 1 hydrolytic enzyme activity the concentration of fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity fda can represent the total hydrolytic enzyme produced by microorganisms for decomposition of organic matter rotman and papermaster 1966 in this study the method of gillian and duncan 2001 was adopted to estimate the fda concentration first 0 5 g of the collected litter was added to a prepared 5 0 ml mixture with 1 mg ml 1 of fda and 6 mm of potassium phosphate buffer ph 7 6 the mixed solution was incubated at 30 c for 20 min in a water bath incubator bt47 yamato japan next 5 ml of acetone 50 v v was added to the incubated solution which was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min then 5 ml of supernatant was filtered through a whatman grand no 2 whatman u s the fluorescent coloration intensity of the filtrate was measured using a spectrophotometer uv mini 1240 shimadzu japan at 490 nm 2 5 2 fungal biomass determination of fungal biomass referred to the standard method of ergosterol extraction gulis and suberkropp 2006 five discs 5 cm in diameter of the collected litters were placed in a flask with 25 ml of methanol and 5 ml of alcoholic koh the flasks were installed with reflux condensers in a water bath incubator bt47 yamato japan at 70 c for 30 min the extract was then transferred to a screw top tube with 10 ml of distilled water and 10 ml of pentane the upper phase of pentane was gently retrieved using a pasteur pipette and transferred into a conical centrifuge tube to be evaporated at 30 c under a stream of n2 when the pentane was entirely evaporated the residue was dissolved in 2 ml of methanol and sonicated until the residue on the tube wall was not visible the extract was then filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter into a vial the ergosterol concentration was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc i series plus shimadzu japan with uv detection of 282 nm and methanol as a mobile phase 2 5 3 bacterial productivity the leucine incorporation method developed by kirchman 2001 was applied for estimation of bacterial productivity discs of the collected litters 5 cm in diameter were stored in a tube with 10 nm of h3 leucine solution the solution was sonicated for 5 min with the addition of 3 25 ml of 15 trichloroacetic acid the sonicated solution was heated at 95 c in a water bath incubator bt47 yamato japan for 30 min and then cooled down to room temperature the solution was then filtered and the filter paper was rinsed with distilled water and placed in a labelled scintillation vial with 10 ml of a scintillation cocktail and the vial was radioassayed by a liquid scintillation counter tri carb 4910tr 110 v perkinelmer japan to determine the disintegrations per minute dpm for each vial 2 5 4 statistical analysis mean differences in water quality remaining litter weight and fda concentration among the study sites and selected litter species were statistically tested using anova followed by post hoc least significant difference lsd tests it was assumed that a significant difference in k could be met under the condition when the anova test leads to rejection of the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the mean of the remaining litter weight among the compared sites or species with 95 confidence interval in order to respond to the research questions a comparative criterion was set as follows 1 does the dam increase the breakdown rate due to higher temperature was answered by a comparison of the water quality the remaining litter weight and k among up and downstream sites 2 does the breakdown rate in the distant downstream area recover to the upstream condition was investigated by comparing locations along the river downstream of takizawa dam and 3 does the water quality such as doc and nutrients play a significant role in the breakdown rate was proved by the differences between ds3 and the arakawa in which other external factors were attempted to be minimized by selecting a location with similar meteorological and geographical conditions where the litter bags in the arakawa was set 100 m from site ds3 in this case the paired t test analysis was applied for the comparison between two sites in the case of litter composition pearson correlation r was applied to evaluate the strength of the relation between the remaining litter weight and the respective compositions 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality a summary of water quality at the study sites during the experimental period is shown in fig 2 in the nakatsugawa the water temperature at up was the lowest compared with the downstream sites ds1 p 0 011 ds2 p 0 016 and ds3 p 0 019 with an average difference of 4 08 c 0 18 sd this was consistent with previous studies webb and walling 1996 olden and naiman 2010 maheu et al 2016 olden and naiman 2010 assessed annual thermographs from regulated rivers across the world and showed the impact of river regulation on summer cooling and winter warming caused by the dam maheu et al 2016 conducted a study along three rivers in eastern canada and found that the temperature of water regulated by a dam was a maximum of 3 6 c higher than the water temperature of neighbouring unregulated rivers during winter likewise no3 was lower at up than at downstream sites ds1 p 0 000 ds2 p 0 000 and ds3 p 0 000 however there were no significant differences in streamflow ph conductivity doc mg2 ca2 and po4 3 between up and downstream sites p 0 05 furthermore recovery of downstream water quality to upstream conditions was not found as there were no differences among ds1 ds2 and ds3 p 0 05 this may be due to the short distance from the dam to ds3 3 0 km in which to return to equilibrium o keeffe et al 1990 indicated that the recovery can be detected at a distance of up to 30 km for a large dam in the case of the arakawa no difference in water temperature compared with downstream sites was detected p 0 189 however other water quality parameters including conductivity doc na mg2 ca2 and no3 were lower p 0 05 this was due to the differences in geographical characteristics and land use between the two rivers 3 2 litter breakdown rates and compositions initial litter compositions weight remaining over time and exponential decay coefficient k are shown in table 1 fig 3 and fig 4 respectively during the study the litter bags set up at up were lost therefore the sample bags containing q serrata c cordata and a mono were left in place until day 42 day 42 and day 25 respectively therefore the comparison on day 25 was performed to compare the initial breakdown rate among up and downstream sites while the comparison on day 42 aimed to assess the impact of the dam on the breakdown rate of q serrata and c cordata in order to respond to research question 1 likewise day 61 was evaluated among downstream sites for research question 2 to investigate the recovery of the decomposition rate a comparison between the arakawa and ds3 was performed on day 61 to answer research question 3 regarding the influence of water quality on breakdown rate according to the anova analysis there was no difference in the remaining litter weights between upstream and downstream of the dam throughout the study period p 0 05 therefore in response to research question 1 referring to insignificant difference in the remaining weight aforementioned it indicates that the dam did not increase the litter breakdown rate in the downstream area the positive correlation of litter breakdown rate with temperature martínez et al 2014 shah et al 2017 and nitrogen availability meyer and johnson 1983 ferreira et al 2006 has been widely demonstrated as up had lower water temperature and lower content of no3 than those in the downstream sites nevertheless their contribution to increase in the litter breakdown rate was not found during the study period more study sites in upstream and downstream of the dam are required for clarification in addition in research question 2 recovery of the breakdown rate to upstream conditions did not occur at the distance of 3 km downstream from the dam in correspondence with the findings on water quality it was expected that a distance of 3 km was not sufficient to detect the recovery comparing the arakawa with ds3 on day 61 it is apparent that the breakdown rate at the arakawa was lower in the case of q serrata difference from ds3 p 0 004 was found while for c cordata difference from ds3 p 0 022 was also detected the reason was that a high content of silt deposition on litters appeared at the arakawa as shown in fig 5 the silt content in the arakawa originates from the surrounding sandstone of the neogene it was consistent with the afdm results on day 61 the average afdm values of q serrata c cordata and a mono at the downstream site of the nakatsugawa were 88 54 0 01 sd 90 40 0 91 sd and 89 58 1 06 sd respectively while at the arakawa the results were 83 03 1 98 sd 86 11 0 01 sd and 82 48 0 02 sd respectively these findings indicated the potential decelerating impact of inorganic matter deposition on the litter breakdown rate in line with the leaching process microbes perform colonization on litter and a polysaccharide matrix is produced to trap suspended matter allan 1995 including silt then the colony binds the silt on the litter consequently the silt acts as a barrier reducing the area exposed to the stream and microbial colonization moreover according to the results of water quality compared with downstream sites the arakawa had lower conductivity doc na mg2 ca2 and no3 p 0 05 toetz and payton 2009 found that doc containing humic substance reduced the intensity of harmful uv b radiation in the water and provided habitats for microbial growth furthermore tipping and cooke 1982 concluded that the availability of divalent cations reduced the inhibition rate of humic acid which retarded enzyme activity based on their laboratory experiment one possible reason could be that mg2 and ca2 were able to bridge the humic acid molecules and hence limited the mobility of those substances in the stream in addition meyer and johnson 1983 indicated that the nitrate enriched stream accelerated the litter breakdown process through enhancement of microbial processing the k value of q serrata at the arakawa was 0 0033 which was lower than the value at ds3 0 0058 likewise the k value of c cordata at the arakawa was 0 0032 which was lower than ds3 0 0047 in response to research question 3 all these results indicate that water quality especially inorganic content water temperature doc and nutrients plays a significant role in the litter breakdown rate in addition differences in remaining weight were found between q serrata and c cordata p 0 005 and between c cordata and a mono p 0 000 the difference between c cordata and other species referred to the initial litter compositions c cordata contained the largest portion of lignin 19 07 0 01 sd followed by a mono 15 36 0 01 sd and q serrata 12 14 0 01 sd lignin is regarded as the most persistent organic component contained in leaves due to their complex structure of aromatic polymer compounds such compounds form through the esterification of phenylpropanoid structures and polymer carbohydrates therefore leaf litter rich in lignin tends to be highly refractory leading to a slow breakdown rate berg and mcclaugherty 2003 across all litter species a strong correlation between litter composition and remaining weight was detected in the case of soluble carbohydrate r 0 92 to 0 98 and lignin r 0 83 to 0 99 as summarized in table 2 suberkropp et al 1976 suggested that the negative trend of lignin against remaining weight could be attributed to the increase of complexed nitrogen containing compounds in the lignin fraction furthermore the weak relationship of hemicellulose and cellulose was caused by their constancy throughout the study period this constancy was due to the slow exposure of these constituents to microbial metabolism through the removal of other components 3 3 microbial activities the trends of fda concentration fluctuated across all litter species as illustrated in fig 6 on day 42 it was apparent that the difference in fda in the particular litter specie across the study sites was not found p 0 05 on day 61 there were differences between ds3 and the arakawa p 0 016 for q serrata fda at ds3 was 3 19 0 02 sd higher than at the arakawa 2 51 0 12 sd the result was in consistence with the conclusion in research question 3 demonstrating the suitable condition of water quality for microbial activity nevertheless the results were in contrast with geisseler et al 2009 who indicated that a ratio of carbon to nitrogen lower than 30 provided adequate nitrogen availability for microbial uptake in this study a mono had a c n ratio lower than 30 throughout the study period as shown in fig 7 however there was no difference in the fda activity on a mono compared with other species for the estimation of bacterial productivity the samples of q serrata on day 61 collected from ds1 and the arakawa were used fig 8 a the productivity on q serrata on day 61 was 6 80 10 11 gc cm 2 h 1 at ds1 and 1 34 10 11 gc cm 2 h 1 at the arakawa we then immersed q serrata collected from ds1 on day 61 in the arakawa water the productivity was decreased by 3 40 10 11 gc cm 2 h 1 two fold reduction in contrast when q serrata collected on day 61 from the arakawa was immersed in ds1 water the productivity was increased to 2 39 10 11 gc cm 2 h 1 a 1 8 fold increase this experiment confirmed that the bacterial productivity was higher at ds1 than at the arakawa driven by water quality differences this may be because of the high nutrient contents and divalent cation ion concentration in water at ds1 clifton et al 2015 it is noteworthy that the temperature of the water representing ds1 and the arakawa used in the experiment was set to room temperature for future study it is recommended that a water temperature comparable to that employed in the field survey be used in order to give a more accurate result reflecting the real conditions in the study area in this study a limited number of paired samples were used and replication is therefore required it is believed that the experimental design developed in this study could be applied in other areas to assess the response of bacterial productivity or other microbial activity to altered water quality in addition the fungal biomass for q serrata on day 61 from ds1 and the arakawa was measured and the results are shown in fig 8 b the fungal biomass was higher on the litters from the arakawa than on those from ds1 nevertheless it was expected that fungal biomass on the litters from the arakawa would be equal to or lower than those from ds1 referring to the previous findings the results are contrary to that of baldy et al 1995 who indicated that fungi play an eminently important role in biological decomposition in the litter breakdown process in this study it is still unexplainable and an in depth study is required for clarification 4 conclusions this study concluded that a dam alters the water quality downstream especially the water temperature however in this study no increase in the litter breakdown rate was observed as a consequence of the dam regulation since there was no statistical difference between the upstream and downstream rates likewise recovery of the breakdown rate to upstream conditions was not found at a distant downstream site bacterial productivity was a major player in litter breakdown and its vitality was dependent upon the water temperature and contents of doc and nutrients also a high content of suspended inorganic matter e g silk decreased the area of exposure to microbial colonization resulting in a lower litter breakdown rate moreover a high lignin content made the litter more resistant to the microbial decomposition process due to the complex interaction among various factors a larger number of sites upstream and downstream of the dam are necessary for future study in order to clarify the impact of the dam conflict of interest

20081,the alternative stable states model describes the two contrasting conditions of shallow lakes that occur in response to external phosphorus p loading 1 a clear water macrophyte dominated state during times of lesser external p loading and 2 a turbid phytoplankton dominated state during periods of greater p loading determination of the p loading rate that distinguishes the two stable states i e the threshold phosphorus loading rate tpl is fundamental to shallow lake science and management we used data from nine shallow subtropical lakes in florida usa to generate a parsimonious model that predicts the tpl from the hydraulic detention time hdt the model reveals that the tpl is more sensitive to changes in hdt in lakes with short 1 year as opposed to long 10 years hdts we compared our results with published data from 54 geographically distributed shallow aquatic systems and found that the florida based hdt tpl model has general applicability given many lakes worldwide are shallow our findings have the potential to improve understanding and management of numerous aquatic ecosystems around the globe 1 introduction many of the world s lakes are shallow downing et al 2006 the alternative stable states model scheffer et al 1993 indicates that shallow lakes can exist under two contrasting conditions i e lower external phosphorus p loading when macrophytes dominate a clear water state and increased external p loading that causes a shift to phytoplankton dominance a turbid water state here a lake is considered shallow if a major part of the water body may be occupied by macrophytes and changes in turbidity have a high impact on vegetation coverage scheffer et al 1993 it is necessary to determine the p loading rate that constrains a shallow lake to one or the other stable state macrophyte dominance clear or phytoplankton dominance turbid to evaluate a lake s stability with respect to potential state shift and maintain its preferred condition the critical p loading rate for a lake can be viewed as a threshold above or below which a state change in the lake is likely to occur because of internal feedback mechanisms that promote ecosystem stability in a given state i e hysteresis there are two different p loading thresholds one for each directional shift scheffer et al 1993 janse et al 2008 modeled environmental variables for shallow european lakes and found that the threshold p loading value required to shift a lake from the macrophyte to the phytoplankton state is greater than the threshold p loading value necessary to return the phytoplankton dominated system to the macrophyte dominated state this threshold difference has important management implications for instance it suggests that modest p load reductions to turbid phytoplankton dominated lakes may prove to be insufficient to return such impaired lakes to a macrophyte dominated state for example despite multiple management strategies of phosphorus reduction wetlands fish removal loading decreases lake apopka fl usa has shown some decrease in water column p levels but has resisted the re establishment of a macrophyte community since a shift in 1947 ce schelske et al 2005 coveney et al 2005 havens and gaohua 2018 here we draw attention to the lower p loading threshold because lake managers are often concerned with nutrient enriched phytoplankton dominated lakes and wish to restore them to the macrophyte dominated clear water state one goal of shallow lake research is to help managers set target nutrient loads that will enable re establishment of the macrophyte dominated state here we define the threshold phosphorus load tpl to be the lower threshold i e the nutrient loading target required to return a turbid phytoplankton dominated shallow lake to the macrophyte dominated clear water state coops et al 2003 discussed the influence of water level fluctuations on the structure and function of shallow lakes and pointed out that we need to improve understanding of the relationship between lake hydrology and ecosystem responses in early studies of cultural eutrophication vollenweider 1975 identified the flushing rate of a lake as a controlling factor for determining the critical nutrient loading rate early research on eutrophication focused on relatively deep lakes nevertheless we suspected that a similar approach might apply to shallow lake systems and could yield a parsimonious model that links hydraulic detention time hdt i e the residence time excluding evaporation to tpl that would improve our understanding of the relationship between lake hydrology and ecosystem response for instance waters et al 2009 showed an inverse relationship between phosphorus retention and hydraulic flushing rate in shallow mean depth 1 m lake mattamuskeet north carolina usa furthermore if we consider extreme differences in hdt a shallow lake with a 10 day hdt would have a much larger tpl than a lake with a 20 year hdt simply because a large portion of the p load to the lake with a 10 day hdt is rapidly exported nixon et al 1996 this prompted the question can the hdt be used to predict the tpl in shallow lakes subtropical florida usa has 7700 lakes and most are shallow zmax 5 m brenner et al 1990 because of rapid population growth in the state during the 20th century many shallow lakes in florida received excessive anthropogenic nutrient loads and shifted from macrophyte dominance to phytoplankton dominance after ca 1950 kenney et al 2002 kenney et al 2010 kenney et al 2016 tpls for the harris chain of lakes central florida were established with a combination of watershed modeling and limnological data magley 2003 fulton et al 2004 fulton and smith 2008 and kenney et al 2014 used a whole basin mass balance approach to determine the tpl for shallow lake lochloosa near gainesville north florida kenney et al 2014 also plotted hdts versus tpls for the harris chain of lakes and lake lochloosa and found the two variables were inversely related i e higher hdts were associated with lower tpls that is the longer the water resided in the lake the lower the p loading had to be to restore a lake to the clear water state in this study we addressed three questions 1 can tpl be predicted reliably from hdt for shallow lakes in subtropical florida usa 2 is the model derived from shallow florida lakes applicable to shallow lakes elsewhere 3 what are the implications of this model for shallow lakes in the future given observed recent climate trends and increased human impacts 2 methods we modeled tpl t km 2 a 1 as a function of hdt a for nine shallow florida lakes the input data used to optimize the model was taken from published literature table 1 tpls for lake apopka and the harris chain of lakes beauclair dora eustis griffin harris yale and weir were established with a combination of watershed modeling and limnological data magley 2003 fulton et al 2004 fulton and smith 2008 kenney et al 2014 used a whole basin mass balance approach to determine the tpl for shallow lake lochloosa for more information about how the tpl was established for each lake please see the cited sources initial screening of models indicated that the most parsimonious model i e the one with both the fewest parameters and realistic parameter units was tpl a hdt 1 b in which a had units of tp km 2 and b had units of tp km 2 a 1 the parameters were optimized my minimizing the sum of the negative log likelihood for the observed and predicted data pairs with the solver add in for microsoft excel the area factor km2 refers to the lake surface area we tested the model s performance at other locations using published data for lakes from several regions around the globe we assembled the database from the literature that included shallow lake systems with known hdt current phosphorus load cpl and present state phytoplankton dominated and turbid or macrophyte dominated and clear we tested the model with each system in the database by comparing the cpl to the tpl that was predicted by the model given the lake s hdt if cpl tpl then the lake should be in a phytoplankton dominated turbid state if the cpl tpl then the lake should be in the macrophyte dominated clear state 3 results limnological data from the nine shallow florida lakes generated a parsimonious model that predicts tpl from hdt fig 1 the optimized parameter a was 0 1317 t km 2 and the optimized parameter b was 0 0587 t km 2 a 1 the predicted data fitted the observed data exceptionally well r2 0 988 n 9 p 0 001 janse et al 2008 presented data for 43 shallow european lakes of which 13 were clear and 30 were turbid our model accurately predicted the observed state for 41 of the 43 lakes fig 2 each of the 13 clear european lakes had a cpl less than the tpl predicted by our model twenty eight of the turbid european lakes had a cpl greater than the tpl predicted by our model two turbid lakes nannewijd netherlands and lading denmark had cpls that were less than their respective tpls predicted by our model which means the florida model incorrectly identified these lakes as being clear our model correctly identified the current state for ten other lakes in africa asia europe north america and south america table 2 overall our model correctly predicted the current state of 96 51 of 53 of the shallow systems tested 4 discussion 4 1 global implications our results show that hydrology exerts strong control on the threshold phosphorus loading rate to shallow water bodies that determines whether they are macrophyte dominated clear water state or phytoplankton dominated turbid water state data from the nine shallow lakes in subtropical florida usa yielded a parsimonious model that predicted tpl from hdt the florida model identified correctly the current state of 96 of shallow lakes n 53 from around the world for which the necessary data hdt and water column status clear or turbid were available in peer reviewed journal articles fig 2 the hdt tpl model provides a simple method to assess the stability of a lake with respect to its current state and potential state shifts and can be used to identify the phosphorus loading target required to return an anthropogenically impacted algal dominated lake to the macrophyte dominated clear water state vollenweider 1975 showed that in deep lakes the flushing rate i e hdt 1 exerts a strong control on critical nutrient loading thresholds and our model shows that this also holds true for shallow lakes our model linking hdt and tpl is also informative about the influence of potential internal loading on phosphorus biogeochemistry in shallow lake ecosystems shallow lakes frequently experience internal phosphorus loading from sediment re suspension on short temporal scales i e days to weeks scheffer 1998 the florida lakes used to develop our model experience internal loading therefore our model accounts for internal loading sediment re suspension events are problematic in shallow lakes because they increase the available phosphorus content in the photic zone and thereby favor the proliferation of rapidly growing phytoplankton over slower growing macrophytes scheffer et al 1993 because shallow systems with short hdts export externally and internally loaded nutrients more rapidly than lakes with longer hdts the tpls for lakes with short hdts are greater than that for shallow systems with longer hdts according to the alternative stable states model scheffer et al 1993 external phosphorus loading exerts the principal control on ecosystem stability in shallow lakes since the introduction of that model however scientists identified other factors that influence ecosystem stability in shallow lakes nitrogen loading jeppesen et al 2007b moss et al 2013 climate change kosten et al 2011 dystrophication waters et al 2012 schelske et al 2010 and lake morphometry scheffer and van nes 2007 can also influence ecosystem stability in shallow lakes our results indicate that hdt is a key variable in determining primary producer community structure in shallow lake systems our model which links hdt to tpl does not imply that the aforementioned factors are unimportant but rather indicates that additional consideration of the influence of hdt on tpl improves our understanding of the relationship between hydrology and ecosystem response in shallow systems as suggested by coops et al 2003 because many of the world s lakes are shallow downing et al 2006 our findings can improve the understanding and management of numerous freshwater systems worldwide our model is not intended to replace comprehensive analysis of an individual lake being considered for restoration rather it serves to identify impaired systems that are more likely to respond positively to restoration efforts and thus are good candidates for additional analysis if the hdt and cpl are determined for an impaired shallow lake then the degree of impairment i e cpl tpl and a target for phosphorus load reduction can be established quickly with this information managers can focus their efforts on lakes that require the smallest phosphorus load reductions to achieve the conversion from the phytoplankton dominated turbid state to the macrophyte dominated clear state 4 2 future challenges for shallow lake management climate change in combination with cultural eutrophication constitutes an allied attack on the freshwater ecosystems moss et al 2011 in north temperate lakes global warming affects phenology of lake processes winder and schindler 2004 and lake ecological state jeppesen et al 2009 after the mid 20th century the allied attack led to the rapid development of cyanobacterial blooms in many north temperate and subarctic lakes taranu et al 2015 in regions where climate change has been associated with increased precipitation nutrient loading from watersheds also increased and contributed to further eutrophication sometimes confounding nutrient based lake restoration projects jeppesen et al 2009 under global warming scenarios nutrient load reductions required for successful lake management will be even larger as they will need to mitigate the positive influence of higher temperatures on primary productivity rolighed et al 2016 given the expected future increase in global temperature jeppesen et al 2009 lake scientists and managers from cooler climates should look to the tropical and sub tropical regions for indications of how lakes may function in the future as a result our model developed using subtropical shallow lakes will become increasing relevant to future shallow lake management throughout the globe kosten et al 2009 showed that shallow lakes in cooler climates maintain macrophyte coverage at higher limnetic phosphorus concentrations than do shallow lakes in warmer climates this pattern was attributed to the large influence of ice cover duration on shallow lake ecology jackson et al 2007 but a global trend in lake warming has been observed o reilly et al 2015 florida lakes do not stratify inversely and experience only a few nights each year of air temperatures below freezing so the florida based hdt tpl model should have even wider applicability as global temperatures increase in some warmer regions like florida lake function may be influenced by future climate change in the form of reduced rainfall in regions where the supply of water from rainfall decreases lake hdt will increase our model predicts that the tpl for a lake will decrease as hdt increases fig 1 the relation between hdt and tpl illustrates that as the hdt for lakes with relatively short values 1 year gets longer these lakes will experience a more profound decrease in tpl than lakes with relatively long hdts this is because tpl asymptotically approaches a theoretical minimum at hdt values 10 years so lakes that currently have shorter hdt will be more prone to respond to the influence of climate drying if a lake with a short hdt is currently phytoplankton dominated because anthropogenic nutrient enrichment triggered a shift from the clear state then as rainfall decreases and hdt increases the tpl will need to be adjusted downward to achieve a shift back to the macrophyte dominated state under a scenario in which decreased rainfall drives longer hdt a shallow lake currently in the macrophyte dominated state may shift to the phytoplankton dominated state without an increase in phosphorus loading when the tpl drops below the cpl 5 conclusions we used data from nine shallow florida lakes to generate a parsimonious model that predicts the threshold phosphorus loading tpl rate from the hydraulic detention time hdt using hdt and tpl data from shallow lakes in asia africa europe north america and south america we showed that the florida based model is applicable to shallow lakes worldwide because most of the world s lakes are shallow our findings will improve the understanding and management of freshwater systems given the expected future increase in global temperatures lake scientists and managers from cooler climates can look to the tropical and sub tropical regions for insights into how their lakes will function in the future conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest generated by the publication of this

stability in a given state i e hysteresis there are two different p loading thresholds one for each directional shift scheffer et al 1993 janse et al 2008 modeled environmental variables for shallow european lakes and found that the threshold p loading value required to shift a lake from the macrophyte to the phytoplankton state is greater than the threshold p loading value necessary to return the phytoplankton dominated system to the macrophyte dominated state this threshold difference has important management implications for instance it suggests that modest p load reductions to turbid phytoplankton dominated lakes may prove to be insufficient to return such impaired lakes to a macrophyte dominated state for example despite multiple management strategies of phosphorus reduction wetlands fish removal loading decreases lake apopka fl usa has shown some decrease in water column p levels but has resisted the re establishment of a macrophyte community since a shift in 1947 ce schelske et al 2005 coveney et al 2005 havens and gaohua 2018 here we draw attention to the lower p loading threshold because lake managers are often concerned with nutrient enriched phytoplankton dominated lakes and wish to restore them to the macrophyte dominated clear water state one goal of shallow lake research is to help managers set target nutrient loads that will enable re establishment of the macrophyte dominated state here we define the threshold phosphorus load tpl to be the lower threshold i e the nutrient loading target required to return a turbid phytoplankton dominated shallow lake to the macrophyte dominated clear water state coops et al 2003 discussed the influence of water level fluctuations on the structure and function of shallow lakes and pointed out that we need to improve understanding of the relationship between lake hydrology and ecosystem responses in early studies of cultural eutrophication vollenweider 1975 identified the flushing rate of a lake as a controlling factor for determining the critical nutrient loading rate early research on eutrophication focused on relatively deep lakes nevertheless we suspected that a similar approach might apply to shallow lake systems and could yield a parsimonious model that links hydraulic detention time hdt i e the residence time excluding evaporation to tpl that would improve our understanding of the relationship between lake hydrology and ecosystem response for instance waters et al 2009 showed an inverse relationship between phosphorus retention and hydraulic flushing rate in shallow mean depth 1 m lake mattamuskeet north carolina usa furthermore if we consider extreme differences in hdt a shallow lake with a 10 day hdt would have a much larger tpl than a lake with a 20 year hdt simply because a large portion of the p load to the lake with a 10 day hdt is rapidly exported nixon et al 1996 this prompted the question can the hdt be used to predict the tpl in shallow lakes subtropical florida usa has 7700 lakes and most are shallow zmax 5 m brenner et al 1990 because of rapid population growth in the state during the 20th century many shallow lakes in florida received excessive anthropogenic nutrient loads and shifted from macrophyte dominance to phytoplankton dominance after ca 1950 kenney et al 2002 kenney et al 2010 kenney et al 2016 tpls for the harris chain of lakes central florida were established with a combination of watershed modeling and limnological data magley 2003 fulton et al 2004 fulton and smith 2008 and kenney et al 2014 used a whole basin mass balance approach to determine the tpl for shallow lake lochloosa near gainesville north florida kenney et al 2014 also plotted hdts versus tpls for the harris chain of lakes and lake lochloosa and found the two variables were inversely related i e higher hdts were associated with lower tpls that is the longer the water resided in the lake the lower the p loading had to be to restore a lake to the clear water state in this study we addressed three questions 1 can tpl be predicted reliably from hdt for shallow lakes in subtropical florida usa 2 is the model derived from shallow florida lakes applicable to shallow lakes elsewhere 3 what are the implications of this model for shallow lakes in the future given observed recent climate trends and increased human impacts 2 methods we modeled tpl t km 2 a 1 as a function of hdt a for nine shallow florida lakes the input data used to optimize the model was taken from published literature table 1 tpls for lake apopka and the harris chain of lakes beauclair dora eustis griffin harris yale and weir were established with a combination of watershed modeling and limnological data magley 2003 fulton et al 2004 fulton and smith 2008 kenney et al 2014 used a whole basin mass balance approach to determine the tpl for shallow lake lochloosa for more information about how the tpl was established for each lake please see the cited sources initial screening of models indicated that the most parsimonious model i e the one with both the fewest parameters and realistic parameter units was tpl a hdt 1 b in which a had units of tp km 2 and b had units of tp km 2 a 1 the parameters were optimized my minimizing the sum of the negative log likelihood for the observed and predicted data pairs with the solver add in for microsoft excel the area factor km2 refers to the lake surface area we tested the model s performance at other locations using published data for lakes from several regions around the globe we assembled the database from the literature that included shallow lake systems with known hdt current phosphorus load cpl and present state phytoplankton dominated and turbid or macrophyte dominated and clear we tested the model with each system in the database by comparing the cpl to the tpl that was predicted by the model given the lake s hdt if cpl tpl then the lake should be in a phytoplankton dominated turbid state if the cpl tpl then the lake should be in the macrophyte dominated clear state 3 results limnological data from the nine shallow florida lakes generated a parsimonious model that predicts tpl from hdt fig 1 the optimized parameter a was 0 1317 t km 2 and the optimized parameter b was 0 0587 t km 2 a 1 the predicted data fitted the observed data exceptionally well r2 0 988 n 9 p 0 001 janse et al 2008 presented data for 43 shallow european lakes of which 13 were clear and 30 were turbid our model accurately predicted the observed state for 41 of the 43 lakes fig 2 each of the 13 clear european lakes had a cpl less than the tpl predicted by our model twenty eight of the turbid european lakes had a cpl greater than the tpl predicted by our model two turbid lakes nannewijd netherlands and lading denmark had cpls that were less than their respective tpls predicted by our model which means the florida model incorrectly identified these lakes as being clear our model correctly identified the current state for ten other lakes in africa asia europe north america and south america table 2 overall our model correctly predicted the current state of 96 51 of 53 of the shallow systems tested 4 discussion 4 1 global implications our results show that hydrology exerts strong control on the threshold phosphorus loading rate to shallow water bodies that determines whether they are macrophyte dominated clear water state or phytoplankton dominated turbid water state data from the nine shallow lakes in subtropical florida usa yielded a parsimonious model that predicted tpl from hdt the florida model identified correctly the current state of 96 of shallow lakes n 53 from around the world for which the necessary data hdt and water column status clear or turbid were available in peer reviewed journal articles fig 2 the hdt tpl model provides a simple method to assess the stability of a lake with respect to its current state and potential state shifts and can be used to identify the phosphorus loading target required to return an anthropogenically impacted algal dominated lake to the macrophyte dominated clear water state vollenweider 1975 showed that in deep lakes the flushing rate i e hdt 1 exerts a strong control on critical nutrient loading thresholds and our model shows that this also holds true for shallow lakes our model linking hdt and tpl is also informative about the influence of potential internal loading on phosphorus biogeochemistry in shallow lake ecosystems shallow lakes frequently experience internal phosphorus loading from sediment re suspension on short temporal scales i e days to weeks scheffer 1998 the florida lakes used to develop our model experience internal loading therefore our model accounts for internal loading sediment re suspension events are problematic in shallow lakes because they increase the available phosphorus content in the photic zone and thereby favor the proliferation of rapidly growing phytoplankton over slower growing macrophytes scheffer et al 1993 because shallow systems with short hdts export externally and internally loaded nutrients more rapidly than lakes with longer hdts the tpls for lakes with short hdts are greater than that for shallow systems with longer hdts according to the alternative stable states model scheffer et al 1993 external phosphorus loading exerts the principal control on ecosystem stability in shallow lakes since the introduction of that model however scientists identified other factors that influence ecosystem stability in shallow lakes nitrogen loading jeppesen et al 2007b moss et al 2013 climate change kosten et al 2011 dystrophication waters et al 2012 schelske et al 2010 and lake morphometry scheffer and van nes 2007 can also influence ecosystem stability in shallow lakes our results indicate that hdt is a key variable in determining primary producer community structure in shallow lake systems our model which links hdt to tpl does not imply that the aforementioned factors are unimportant but rather indicates that additional consideration of the influence of hdt on tpl improves our understanding of the relationship between hydrology and ecosystem response in shallow systems as suggested by coops et al 2003 because many of the world s lakes are shallow downing et al 2006 our findings can improve the understanding and management of numerous freshwater systems worldwide our model is not intended to replace comprehensive analysis of an individual lake being considered for restoration rather it serves to identify impaired systems that are more likely to respond positively to restoration efforts and thus are good candidates for additional analysis if the hdt and cpl are determined for an impaired shallow lake then the degree of impairment i e cpl tpl and a target for phosphorus load reduction can be established quickly with this information managers can focus their efforts on lakes that require the smallest phosphorus load reductions to achieve the conversion from the phytoplankton dominated turbid state to the macrophyte dominated clear state 4 2 future challenges for shallow lake management climate change in combination with cultural eutrophication constitutes an allied attack on the freshwater ecosystems moss et al 2011 in north temperate lakes global warming affects phenology of lake processes winder and schindler 2004 and lake ecological state jeppesen et al 2009 after the mid 20th century the allied attack led to the rapid development of cyanobacterial blooms in many north temperate and subarctic lakes taranu et al 2015 in regions where climate change has been associated with increased precipitation nutrient loading from watersheds also increased and contributed to further eutrophication sometimes confounding nutrient based lake restoration projects jeppesen et al 2009 under global warming scenarios nutrient load reductions required for successful lake management will be even larger as they will need to mitigate the positive influence of higher temperatures on primary productivity rolighed et al 2016 given the expected future increase in global temperature jeppesen et al 2009 lake scientists and managers from cooler climates should look to the tropical and sub tropical regions for indications of how lakes may function in the future as a result our model developed using subtropical shallow lakes will become increasing relevant to future shallow lake management throughout the globe kosten et al 2009 showed that shallow lakes in cooler climates maintain macrophyte coverage at higher limnetic phosphorus concentrations than do shallow lakes in warmer climates this pattern was attributed to the large influence of ice cover duration on shallow lake ecology jackson et al 2007 but a global trend in lake warming has been observed o reilly et al 2015 florida lakes do not stratify inversely and experience only a few nights each year of air temperatures below freezing so the florida based hdt tpl model should have even wider applicability as global temperatures increase in some warmer regions like florida lake function may be influenced by future climate change in the form of reduced rainfall in regions where the supply of water from rainfall decreases lake hdt will increase our model predicts that the tpl for a lake will decrease as hdt increases fig 1 the relation between hdt and tpl illustrates that as the hdt for lakes with relatively short values 1 year gets longer these lakes will experience a more profound decrease in tpl than lakes with relatively long hdts this is because tpl asymptotically approaches a theoretical minimum at hdt values 10 years so lakes that currently have shorter hdt will be more prone to respond to the influence of climate drying if a lake with a short hdt is currently phytoplankton dominated because anthropogenic nutrient enrichment triggered a shift from the clear state then as rainfall decreases and hdt increases the tpl will need to be adjusted downward to achieve a shift back to the macrophyte dominated state under a scenario in which decreased rainfall drives longer hdt a shallow lake currently in the macrophyte dominated state may shift to the phytoplankton dominated state without an increase in phosphorus loading when the tpl drops below the cpl 5 conclusions we used data from nine shallow florida lakes to generate a parsimonious model that predicts the threshold phosphorus loading tpl rate from the hydraulic detention time hdt using hdt and tpl data from shallow lakes in asia africa europe north america and south america we showed that the florida based model is applicable to shallow lakes worldwide because most of the world s lakes are shallow our findings will improve the understanding and management of freshwater systems given the expected future increase in global temperatures lake scientists and managers from cooler climates can look to the tropical and sub tropical regions for insights into how their lakes will function in the future conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest generated by the publication of this

20082,urban runoff from traffic areas is a major source of pollution that degrades the quality of adjacent surface waters green infrastructure provided by the substantial amount of roadside land at urban fringe areas can be used to better manage and infiltrate this urban runoff when establishing urban green areas recycled materials should be preferred in order to achieve economically feasible and environmentally responsible solutions wastewater treatment plants within e g the eu yield substantial amounts of solids containing nutrients and metals that need to be utilised in a sustainable way however soil composted from such sewage sludge is being used widely in constructing green infrastructure such as parks and road verges which may jeopardise their use for stormwater management even though the effects of sewage sludge at road verges on the quality of runoff waters have not been subjected to scientific examination biochar has been suggested to retain pollutants and may also meet the criteria of being recycled material we established artificial biofilter structures mimicking road verges in large scale field lysimeters under cold climatic conditions in southern finland to study the ability of biochar to retain pollutants leaching from composted sewage sludge and from infiltrating artificial stormwater the topmost 15 cm consisted of an organic layer of either natural peat peat or soil composted from sewage sludge either mixed with birch derived biochar 3 by volume or without this biochar comp bc and comp respectively at the end of the 1st growing period grasses growing in the lysimeters had taken up to 32 of phosphorus in the top soil containing compost leaching of phosphorus did not differ between the treatments while nitrogen n leaching was ten time larger from comp than peat leaching of heavy metals such as nickel and copper was also significantly higher from compost soils than peat but biochar significantly reduced metal leaching from compost up to 50 two years after establishment lysimeters were irrigated with artificial stormwater mimicking runoff from roads with heavy traffic comp leached more n compared to peat however biochar significantly reduced n load infiltrated through the compost by 44 mixing sewage sludge originated compost with biochar and adding a 5 cm thick layer of biochar underneath the organic soil layer can substantially reduce leaching of n and heavy metals however given the substantial amount of roadsides in urban fringe areas the extensive use of sewage sludge and other n rich materials in such areas should be considered carefully keywords stormwater biofiltration nutrients metals pollution retention sludge 1 introduction cities are disproportionately located along aquatic ecosystems and have been identified as hotspots for the accumulation of nutrients and metals and the subsequent leakage of these contaminants into adjacent water bodies grimm et al 2008 pouyat et al 2007 urban runoff also known as stromwater is a notable carrier of pollutants in urban areas that can degrade the quality and health of adjacent surface waters fletcher et al 2013 elevated runoff volumes due to the high proportion of impervious surfaces increase pollutant loads carey et al 2013 resulting in a significant relationship between the percentage of impervious surfaces and the loading of nutrients and metals valtanen et al 2014 2015 as conventional urban water management is unlikely to meet challenges brought about by an increasingly urbanising world there is an urgent need to develop innovative solutions to sustainably manage stormwater in cities fitzhugh and richter 2004 larsen et al 2016 for example various biofiltration structures have been developed to diminish and treat urban runoff that would be otherwise conveyed unpurified directly to adjacent water bodies via undeground sewer systems ahiablame et al 2012 carey et al 2013 driscoll et al 2015 hatt et al 2009 biofiltration systems and or other green infrastructure have been shown to reduce nutrient export from cities at the watershed scale pennino et al 2016 while in other cases they have been less effective liu et al 2017 given the limited and inconsistent knowledge of the efficiencies of various green infrastructure solutions empirical studies are needed to better understand the factors such as design including soil materials vegetation type pollutant loads and climate and local conditions that influence the success of stormwater management ahiablame et al 2012 liu et al 2017 this is especially the case in northern latitudes where the functioning of bio based infiltration treatments is supposed to be inefficient during cold months blecken et al 2011 muthanna et al 2007 traffic is a main source of pollutants in cities with traffic volume correlating strongly with pollutant loads in roadside environments carey et al 2013 kuoppamäki et al 2014 westerlund and viklander 2006 consequently contaminants at road edges can pose important but still poorly known risk to both surface and ground waters kuoppamäki et al 2014 valtanen et al 2014 westerlund and viklander 2006 a common practice to mitigate the adverse effects of road derived runoff is grass swales that replace or supplement traditional curbs and gutters adsorption absorption processes by such low cost bioretention features can efficiently control phosphorus and metals bound in suspended solids but not pollutants that are in dissolved form reviewed by ahiablame et al 2012 the composition of bioretention media is typically mostly sand and vegetation is planted on a variety of mixtures containing soil sand mulch and organic matter ahiablame et al 2012 in finland peat is usually mixed in soil products but the use of peat is not sustainable due to its extremely slow regeneration rate biofilter structures should be environmentally sustainable with a low environmental footprint minimal economic cost hatt et al 2009 readily available and materials preferably recycled rather than virgin to promote circular economy mohanty et al 2018 for instance the over 50 000 wastewater treatment plants within the european union yield over 10 million tons of dry solids per year eurostat 2018 this sewage sludge contains high amount of nutrients and organic matter to be used as fertilizer or a soil improving agent within eu countries 37 of the total annual production of sewage sludge is used in agriculture while the rest is used for other land applications olofsson et al 2012 in cities worldwide 10 30 of the city area is covered with roads and streets with an equal proportion being road verges due to the substantial amount of roadside land at urban fringe areas the use of sewage sludge to support vegetation growth has become a common practice there however as sewage sludge can exceed the threshold values for metal concentrations the sewage sludge directive 86 278 eec and also contain organic pollutants zennegg et al 2013 microplastics lusher et al 2017 and unwanted pathogens bagge et al 2005 its use in green infrastructure has been questioned di bonito 2008 furthermore the effects of sewage sludge at road verges on the quality of runoff waters have not been subjected to scientific examination to improve their capacity to retain stormwater and contaminants therein various types of materials have been added in biofilter systems for example when added to the soil biochar has been shown to reduce the leaching of nutrients and metals wei et al 2018 in agriculture konczak and oleszczuk 2018 and when applied to green roofs kuoppamäki et al 2016 furthermore biochar appears to be a promising material for stormwater treatment and meets the criteria for having a low environmental footprint and being recycled material mohanty et al 2018 the manufacturing process of biochar does not allow co2 to be released from the feed material making biochar a carbon sink lehmann 2007 however results from large scale field applications of biochar to treat stormwater are lacking we established large scale biofilter structures in field lysimeters 2 m3 to mimic road verges under cold climatic zone in southern finland the lysimeters were composed of three soil types and the efficacy of these soils to retain or the risk of these soils to leach nutrients and metals were monitored for two years after this the lysimeters were added with artificial stormwater and they were monitored for one month to study the retention of nutrients and metals we hypothesized that 1 the leaching of nutrients and metals from soil composted from sewage sludge is higher than that from nutrient poor peat but 2 this leaching is reduced by amending sludge based compost with biochar 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment setup to simulate road verges we established an experiment in nine large scale field lysimeters depth 2 m diameter ca 1 m stainless steel situated in the city of lahti southern finland 60 59 00 n 25 39 20 e in june 2014 as illustrated in fig 1 on the bottom of each lysimeter a 0 5 m thick layer of coarse gravel 8 16 mm was placed as a drainage layer above this layer separated with a filter fabric another 0 5 m of filter sand 0 02 31 5 mm was added above the sand layer a 0 4 m thick layer of coarsely crushed stones 0 90 mm and then 0 3 m finely crushed stones 0 32 mm were placed finally a top layer 0 15 m thick of growing substrate was added consisting either of i soil with composted sewage sludge 50 v v mixed with fine sand 50 v v hereafter referred to as comp ii the same compost soil amended 5 by volume with slow pyrolysis 380 420 c for 2 h see kuoppamäki et al 2016 biochar made of birch hereafter comp bc or iii commercial peat 75 v v mixed with sand 25 v v soil for gardening purposes hereafter peat in the comp bc treatment a 0 05 m layer of biochar was also added below the growing substrate thus the uppermost 0 2 m layer contained 30 biochar and the total lysimeter 3 v v each treatment had three replicates the structure and layers of soil in the lysimeters followed what is commonly used in road structures in southern finland all lysimeters were planted with seeds of a grass mixture festuca ovina f rubra phleum pratense typical to road verges in finland the soils were derived from commercial producers sewage sludge from the helsinki region environmental services authority hsy and peat belinda enriched with nkp fertilizer from europeat ltd properties of the compost biochar and peat used are listed in table 1 2 2 measurements outflow rate of the infiltrated water was measured at 10 min resolution using pressure sensors set in outflow water tanks of 20 l the mass of each lysimeter was continuously measured with scales and was used to calculate outflow rate when water tanks overflowed however in february and march 2016 technical problems caused by accumulating snow on top of the lysimeters prevented us from calculating runoff volumes soil temperature and moisture were measured continuously throughout the study with sensors placed at 0 2 m and 1 6 m depths from the surface of each lysimeter fig 1 a local vaisala wxt520 micro weather station collected data on rainfall air moisture and wind velocity at 10 min intervals grass growing in the lysimeters were cut at the base of the shoots at the end of the growing season in 2014 aboveground biomass of the vegetation was room dried for 6 weeks and dry mass g calculated 2 3 sampling during the stabilising period before irrigating the lysimeters with artificial stormwater see below they were left to stabilise under ambient precipitation for 23 months during this period potential leaching of nutrients and metals from the lysimeter soil was monitored by taking samples from infiltrating water at 2 4 month intervals when enough i e 10 l hereafter litres are abbreviated as l had infiltrated through each lysimeter the first such runoff event was 5 months after establishing the experiment on the 26th november 2014 when the first set of runoff samples for nutrient and metal analyses was taken thereafter in 2015 samples were taken on 22nd january 27th may 17th and 10th december while in 2016 samples were taken on 17th february and 22nd march thus during the stabilisation period sampling was carried out following a total of 7 runoff events 2 4 sampling during the irrigations in mid may 2016 mean monthly temperature 8 c when the growing season had already started and spring snowmelt had passed the lysimeters were irrigated with artificial stormwater simulating runoff from an urban core area with 89 impervious surface see valtanen et al 2014 the content of the artificial stormwater was as follows soluble phosphorus k2hpo4 1 mg l nitrate nano3 10 mg l zinc znso4 7h2o 0 5 mg l copper cuso4 5h2o 0 3 mg l lead pbno3 0 1 mg l aluminium al2 so4 3 18h2o 5 mg l and chromium crcl 0 1 mg l irrigation occurred during two consecutive days the first irrigation on 11th may represented a 5 mm precipitation event of 1 h duration and the second on 15th may represented a 10 mm event of 2 h duration so that the volume of stormwater per lysimeter was 40 l and 80 l respectively it was assumed that the area of the lysimeter biofilters represents 10 of their catchment area with a 0 9 runoff coefficient 30 of precipitation events at the locality during a 4 year measuring campaign are between 5 mm and 10 mm k kuoppamäki unpublished data such rain events were considered representative and importantly large enough to generate runoff from the lysimeters samples from infiltrating water were taken on two consecutive days following the irrigation event as well as once a month later assuming a delayed outflow of stormwater before terminating the experiment final discharge samples were taken on the 17th june 2016 2 5 laboratory analyses water samples that infiltrated through the lysimeters as well as a composite sample of the stormwater used for irrigation were first measured for ph by using a wtw inolab ph 720 and electric conductivity by using a wtw cond 330i meter all water samples were stored at 20 c until the analysis of nutrients and metals samples for total nutrient analyses were first oxidised in an autoclave at 120 c for 30 min total phosphorus tp was measured spectrophotometrically after the addition of a molybdate reagent sfs 3026 a high performance liquid chromatography shimadzu prominence hplc instrument was used to determine total nitrogen tn with 0 04 m sodium chloride nacl as the eluent and using an ion exchange column waters ic pak anion hc the chromatogram was recorded at 225 nm for the analysis of total dissolved metal content in the artificial stormwater and in the water leachates concentrated hno3 50 μl and 50 μl of 1 mg l indium solution was added as an internal standard and the sample was mixed well with vortex for total dissolved metals samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter whatman one ml of the sample was then diluted with 4 ml of water and 50 μl of indium internal standard 1 mg l was added to the diluted sample five ml of the filtered sample was transferred into a test tube finally metal concentrations were determined using a perkin elmer elan 6000 icp ms according to sfs en iso 17294 2 2005 biochar and grass samples above ground biomass only were analysed for total metals cd cr cu ni zn and pb and tp concentration using elan 6000 icp ms as a pre treatment the samples were digested with a mars 6 microwave digester in addition total carbon tc and tn concentrations of the samples were measured using a leco csn analyser leco incorporation inc 2 6 data analyses the effects of treatment comp comp bc or peat on the event mean concentrations total load divided by total runoff volume see supplementary material and loads of nutrients tp tn and metals cd cr cu ni pb zn in leachate water during the stabilisation period were tested using repeated measures anova where treatment was a fixed factor and the repeated measures were comprised of either nutrients or metals with time of sampling the loads of nutrients and dissolved metals were calculated by multiplying concentrations by runoff volumes total loads after artificial stormwater irrigation were obtained by summing loads measured during the three sampling days these results as well as average loads measured before irrigation were tested using multivariate anova once statistically significant treatment effects appeared in the anova models the statistical significance of differences between treatments were interpreted using tukey post hoc test if a significant interaction between treatment and time was observed the effect of treatment was analysed separately on each sampling event anova for multivariate measures was used to analyse the effects of treatment on the biomass and nutrient contents of grasses the homogeneity of variances and normal distribution of the data were tested using levene s test and shapiro wilk test respectively data were log transformed if the assumptions of normality were violated if assumptions were not fulfilled even after log transformation data were tested using non parametric kruskal wallis and mann whitney tests all statistical analyses were carried out using the spss statistical package ibm corp 2016 3 results 3 1 nutrients when comparing loads averaged across the stabilising period tn load was higher from the two compost treatments than from peat while for tp loads it was vice versa fig 2 nitrogen leaching was also statistically significantly higher from compost comp than from peat table 2 however the difference in tn loads between compost amended with biochar comp bc and peat was insignificant table 2 indicating that biochar reduced the leaching of tn the difference in tp loads between all treatments was also insignificant in detail tn leaching from peat was 1 10 x lower than that from comp or comp bc mann whitney p 0 05 peat vs comp and comp bc in each sampling event in the comp treatments tn loads declined from ca 3000 5000 mg m2 at the beginning of the experiment to 500 2000 mg m2 in december 2015 and in the peat treatment from 500 to 10 mg m2 and thus the impact of time on tn load was notable table 2 tp loads varied between 0 15 and 0 7 mg m2 in all treatments without temporal trends background loads of tn and tp in wet and dry deposition at the experimental area during the study were 4 19 and 0 3 1 9 mg m2 respectively following irrigation with artificial stormwater biochar reduced the leaching of tn just like during the stabilisation period comp leached more tn than comp bc and peat table 2 while tn load from comp bc was only marginally higher than that from peat tukey p 0 056 however negative tn retention of 186 and 64 were observed in comp and comp bc respectively indicating high leaching from the compost mixture itself peat also had low yet positive tn retention 15 following stormwater irrigation elevated load of tp was observed in peat ca 50 higher than from comp and comp bc but differences between treatments were insignificant table 2 due to high variation fig 3 tp leaching from all treatments was extremely low compared to the load in stormwater and thus all treatments retained tp by 99 the event mean concentrations of nutrients and metals are given in supplemental material 3 2 metals during the stabilisation period the effect of treatment on the loads of all metals except chromium cr and aluminium al depended on time table 2 in december 2015 an increase was detected in the loads of cadmium cd nickel ni lead pb and zinc zn especially in both compost treatments when calculating average dissolved metal loads during the stabilisation period significantly higher leaching of zn al and ni from comp than from the other two treatments was evident table 2 fig 4 showing that biochar can increase the retention of these metals on the other hand peat leached more cu than the two compost treatments cr load remained at ca 0 01 mg m2 during this period al loads in turn could not be determined due to low concentrations below the detection limit of 92 μg l until december 2015 when concentrations suddenly increased in comp up to 400 700 μg l and in the other treatments well above 100 μg l following irrigation with stormwater loads of dissolved zn and al were highest in comp and lowest in peat the significant difference being between comp and peat table 3 fig 5 a similar pattern was evident in cu loads but the effects of treatments were marginally significant as well as in those of ni and cd which were however not added to the stormwater the retention of cr al and pb which were added to the artifical stormwater was 99 100 in all treatments also cu and zn were 91 and 87 retained respectively by peat containing lysimeters comp leached remarkably more zn on average 124 mg m2 compared to the 76 mg m2 that was added to the artifical stormwater resulting in negative retention 63 however the addition of biochar improved the retention of cu in compost close to levels leached from peat 3 3 runoff ph and electric conductivity rainwater ph and irrigation water ph decreased from 6 7 to an average 4 7 when infiltrating through comp while significantly higher ph average 6 1 was measured in water infiltrated through peat anova f 10 03 p 0 012 tukey p 0 01 fig 6 however ph declined less in water infiltrating through comp bc than in comp though the impact of biochar was not statistically significant opposite patterns were seen in electric conductivity that was 3 times higher in comp compared to that in rain and irrigation water while peat did not change conductivity of the infiltrating water fig 6 biochar amendment attenuated the increase of conductivity the effects of treatments on runoff ph and electric conductivity were significant the difference being between comp and peat table 3 3 4 retention of stormwater the total retention of all water including artificial stormwater and natural rainfall was 21 26 without significant differences between treatments more precisely after the first stormwater irrigation 40 l the two compost treatments retained 75 of water while the retention in peat was 64 the corresponding values following the second stormwater irrigation 80 l were 45 and 55 respectively top soil moisture content increased from 10 to 20 to 50 60 in comp and comp bc and 40 50 in peat following irrigations with stormwater discharge velocity was on average 1500 ml h from the 2nd irrigation event until the last water sampling event a month later total precipitation was 58 mm resulting in an additional 45 l of water in each lysimeter this volume was used in calculating the emc values of the last sampling event 3 5 vegetation during the first growth period grasses germinated well in all lysimeters irrespective of treatment however at the end of the first growing period the biomass of grasses growing in peat was stunted

anova f 28 92 p 0 001 and tp anova f 30 17 p 0 001 of grasses growing in comp and comp bc soils were 7 6 and 7 3 x higher respectively compared to grasses growing in peat fig 7 3 6 climatic parameters the growing season in 2014 was slightly warmer on average 16 c and rainier 205 mm than in 2015 14 4 c and 175 mm respectively though the latter year was characterised by several days with higher precipitation amounts compared to the previous year fig 8 in 2014 air temperature dropped below 0 c earlier than in 2015 but was warmer than winter 2015 2016 the second winter was very cold with temperature below minus 10 c during all january 2016 consequently in the first winter only top soil of lysimeters got frozen and only for short periods of time while in the second winter the top soil was frozen for 7 weeks with the bottom soil also frozen for one week in mid january fig 8 precipitation before sampling during preceding month was much higher in december 2015 compared to precipitation preceding the other sampling campaigns table 4 samples taken in march 2016 included water that was melting from soils in the lysimeters and this water obviously represented several previous rain events spanning for time longer than just the preceding month sampling events in january 2015 and in february and march 2016 can be considered as representing winter conditions given the average air temperatures below 0 c during the preceding month table 4 total amount of precipitation from the beginning of the experiment until the irrigation with artificial stormwater was 1200 mm 4 discussion it is well established that the input of materials such as nutrients and metals from watersheds to adjacent surface and ground water bodies are in decisive role determining the quality of invaluable water resources our results suggest that the application of sewage sludge derived compost soil to road verges can substantially increase the leaching of tn al ni and zn and thus potentially affect the ecology of the entire watershed our results further suggest that application of biochar can substantially reduce the leaching of tn and metals from compost soils thus enabling its use at road verge areas in urbanised watersheds however biochar was not able to reduce the leaching of all contaminants we predicted that the leaching of nutrients and metals from compost mixture is higher than from peat this prediction was partly confirmed as lysimeters with compost leached considerably more nitrogen tn and metals al ni zn and cd than peat both during the 23 month stabilisation period and after stormwater irrigation in contrast there were no statistically significant differences in phosphorus tp cr and pb leaching between the treatments further we hypothesized that leaching of nutrients and metals from compost is reduced by biochar amendment biochar reduced tn leaching by 44 from compost soil during irrigation with stormwater when the soils had been stabilising for two years during the stabilisation period biochar decreased the loads of al cu ni and zn significantly while after stormwater addition the difference was apparent but statistically insignificant we will next discuss in more detail the potential of the three soil types to retain nutrients and metals 4 1 nutrient retention as algal productivity in freshwaters is usually phosphorus limited reducing the loading of this nutrient from surrounding watershed is especially critical during the almost 2 year stabilisation period leaching of tp from the lysimeters was extremely low without consistent differences between treatments furthermore after the two artificial stormwater irrigations 99 of the added phosphorus was retained by all three treatments as tp concentration of the top layer materials was quite similar in both comp and peat this result was expected indeed dissolved p carried by water is retained well by different soils types barrett et al 2013 coffmann and clar 2003 pitt et al 1999 valtanen et al 2017 the tp content of biochar was quite high but comp bc did not leach more tp than the other treatments suggesting that it was in insoluble form in biochar on the other hand although biochar increased leachate ph this did not result in improved retention of tp it is noteworthy that a considerable amount of tp was retained in grass biomass in the two compost systems the grass biomass being 5 x higher in the compost soils compared to peat soils contained 1 5 times more tp 0 47 mg m2 and 0 46 mg m2 in comp and comp bc respectively compared to grasses growing in peat 0 03 mg m2 at the start of the study the content of dissolved p in the top soil layers of comp comp bc and peat was 5 9 4 1 and 4 6 g m2 respectively consequently on average 24 32 and 3 of p in the top soil was bound to aboveground vegetation at the end of the 1st growing period implying a remarkably large impact of vegetation on nutrient retention in the biofilter systems this impact was much lower in peat where grasses had stunted growth compared to comp and comp bc when these values are compared to the amounts of tp leached through the lysimeter soils during the 1st growing period comp comp bc and peat 0 6 0 8 0 4 g m2 respectively the importance of tp immobilized by plant biomass as well as the soil layers becomes evident the stunted growth of grasses in peat probably partly explains the higher p leaching compared to the two compost treatments in general the high potential of biofilter structures to absorb p is in line with valtanen et al 2017 in northern conditions and by coffmann and clar 2003 glaister et al 2014 barrett et al 2013 and pitt et al 1999 under warmer climatic conditions in all the almost 100 ability of our bioretention systems to retain tp irrespective of the top soil material indicates that the biofiltration type used here is efficient to treat traffic derived stormwater and thus mitigate eutrophication potential of adjacent water bodies importantly decreasing the loading of p rather than n is a prerequisite to mitigate the eutrophication of lakes schindler et al 2008 in contrast to tp tn was poorly retained by the biofiltration systems at the beginning of the study the stabilisation phase the retention of tn by each treatment was negative as indicated by the ca 250 750 x higher tn loads measured in the water leachates compared to the amount detected in rainwater via wet and dry deposition as n content in the mineral soils used in our study was negligible h setälä unpublished tn in the water leachates were likely derived from the top layer materials moreover n leaching from disturbed soil is common for example at construction sites sillanpää 2003 wakida and lerner 2002 as such studies that span over several years to allow for soil stabilising phases are required to determine the actual pollutant retention capability of the soil thus although our experiment lasted for two years it may still be too short to demonstrate tn dynamics in biofilter systems the leaching of tn from both compost soils was several times higher than from peat despite the added fertilizer in the latter loads of tn in the runoff decreased at the end of the stabilisation period but the n content was still ca 100 times higher compared to tn load in wet and dry deposition after stormwater irrigation tn loads increased again which supports earlier findings about the inefficient retention of tn by biofiltration systems bratieres et al 2008 hatt et al 2009 pitt et al 1994 valtanen et al 2014 but shows that sandy peat can well retain tn however extending the experiment longer and making more stormwater irrigations may reduce the capacity of also sandy peat to retain nitrogen somewhat unexpectedly the pattern of tn in the leachate water was not affected by the cold period per se but more likely by the length of the time since the start of the experiment and irrigating the systems with stormwater this suggests that biofiltration structures do not necessarily function badly during winter as long as the soil is not completely frozen during the first winter only the top soil got frozen for periods of few days and therefore the impact of cold season on the functioning of lysimeters was probably negligible during the second colder winter freezing reached the bottom of lysimeters though only for one week while top of soil was frozen for over 7 weeks nevertheless no elevated leaching of tn was observed in the leachates taken after this period suggesting that tn dynamics was not much affected by freezing or thawing despite substantial leaching of tn from the compost treatments a remarkable proportion of tn was retained in the aboveground grass biomass 9 8 and 9 4 g m2 in comp and comp bc respectively corresponding to 19 and 20 of tn detected in the top 0 15 m layer soils grasses grown in peat contained only 0 6 g n m2 which is 2 of tn in top layer soils it is likely that the stunted growth of grasses was mostly responsible for the reduced their capacity to store tn corresponding tn leaching from the lysimeters between june to november 2015 was 11 6 comp 6 3 comp bc and 1 2 g m2 peat indicating similar amounts of tn in the leachates and in the green grass biomass under n deficient conditions the ability of biochar to adsorb nitrogen can hamper the uptake of plant available nutrients and thus have adverse effects on plant growth however in our study grass biomass and its n concentration was unresponsive to biochar addition indicating sufficient nutritional conditions for plants also in the comp bc treatment 4 2 retention of metals cr cd pb cu ni and zn are metals frequently detected in runoff from urbanised watersheds kuoppamäki et al 2014 valtanen et al 2014 westerlund and viklander 2006 and they have been listed as elements that often cause failures of ecological status in water bodies eaa 2018 loads of the most environmentally hazardous metals cr cd and pb in leachate waters discharging from our lysimeters were irresponsive to the type of soil in the current study interestingly the retention of cr and pb derived from artifical stormwater was nearly 100 these results show that cr and pb as well as cu are fairly well retained by the biofilter structure and support many other studies reporting 72 99 retention of cu and pb in biofilters blecken et al 2009 bäckström et al 2003 feng et al 2012 muthanna et al 2007 reddy et al 2014 valtanen et al 2017 however the negative retention of zn 180 after stormwater irrigation indicates leaching from composted sewage sludge with low ph in discharge the mobility of zn is promoted by low ph aastrup et al 1995 after stormwater addition only peat soil with higher runoff ph retained considerable amounts ca 75 of the added amount of zn leaf compost has been shown to remove al in stormwater biofilters feng et al 2012 while in our study sewage compost had the lowest retention of al which may result from the very different origin of the compost material metal concentrations measured in the composted sewage sludge soil used in our study were far below threshold values 300 1500 and 100 mg kg dw for cr zn and pb respectively provided by finnish environmental authorities in spite of this when comparing the metal concentrations of leachates to the classification of stockholm vatten 2001 the event mean concentrations see supplemental material of ni 634 μg l before stormwater irrigation 1010 μg l after irrigation zn 330 580 μg l cu 25 206 μg l and cd 2 4 3 4 μg l from compost treatments exceeded limit values of 225 300 45 and 1 5 μg l respectively even though cd and ni were not present in our artifical stormwater mixture these elements were measured in high concentrations in water filtrates especially from the compost treatments after stormwater addition these metals likely started to mobilise in the soil materials later on when the lysimeter soils became saturated with rain and stormwater especially lysimeters containing compost reached moisture up to 60 of volumetric content from these systems the leaching of cd and ni were 3 5 and 5 x higher than from the peat systems since cd is very mobile at low ph conditions in soil and soilwater aastrup et al 1995 the low ph in comp probably contributed to the leaching of cd as the discharge velocity was low on average 1 5 l h there was enough time for various interactions between the soil and leaching water to take place which in turn may have lowered the leachate ph after two years concentrations of ni and cd in the leachates from the compost containing treatments were still higher than those from the peat containing system these results emphasise the long term leaching of these metals even two years after the establishment of biofilters thus our study highlights a notable time lag in the leaching of metals especially as the loads suddenly increased 18 months after the start of the experiment following a very rainy preceding month in contrast the leaching of nutrients started immediatelly after the first rain event suggesting that metals are more strongly bound to soil particles than nutrients and thus release more slowly as elevated loads of metals were observed already well before air and soil temperatures dropped below 0 c freezing or thawing could not explain the sudden leaching of metals rather the accumulated rainfall 1000 mm until mid december 2015 and consequently the increased amount of infiltrating water totalling ca 55 60 and 82 mm in comp comp bc and peat respectively may had gradually transported metals down through the lysimeters 4 3 effects of biochar on nutrient and metal leaching we have shown previously that biochar of the same type as used in this study reduces the leaching of tp kuoppamäki et al 2016 this effect was not evident in the current study possibly due to extremely low tp concentrations in discharge instead biochar reduced tn leaching which is likely due to i sorption of n onto biochar ahmadvand et al 2018 gai et al 2014 or ii biochar induced effects on soil abiotic and biotic properties deluca et al 2015 biochar application modifies several soil physical properties such as cation exchange capacity ph redox conditions and water holding capacity which in turn affect soil microbiological processes and thus impacts on the bio availability and uptake of nutrients to pants deluca et al 2015 the mass export and retention of tn and tp in biofilter systems have been suggested to be primarily influenced by hydrological rather than biogeochemical mechanisms reviewed in jefferson et al 2017 since the water retention capacity did not differ between the three treatments at the end of the current study the effect of biochar was apparently more related to biogeochemistry than hydrology both increased saarnio et al 2018 and decreased knowles et al 2011 runoff of n from soils after biochar addition have been reported biochar itself may also contain nitrogen in labile forms that are prone to leaching iqbal et al 2015 ulrich et al 2015 however according to iqbal et al 2015 douglas fir originated biochar 650 c had no influence on the leaching of tn and tp from bioretention systems with compost material it is well established that depending on feedstock material and processing conditions biochar characteristics may vary considerably which should be taken into consideration when utilising biochar in environmental management deluca et al 2015 clough et al 2013 the short and long term implications of biochar on n dynamics within and outside biofilter systems are specific to soil biochar combinations which call for further systematic studies to evaluate feedstock types and processing conditions for the successful management of water in urbanised watersheds recent laboratory studies have shown the potential of biochar to remove contaminants from wastewater ahmad et al 2014 tan et al 2015 but so far there have been no field studies to show the potential of biochar to purify stormwater we showed that biochar reduced the leaching of sewage sludge originated cd ni and zn by ca 50 compared to compost soil without biochar addition although after stormwater addition this effect was not statistically significant activated carbon is considered an effective adsorbent of various pollutants and biochar can be used as a cheaper option in many applications thompson et al 2016 the lack of consistency in published data makes comparisons between biochar types difficult in addition to soil type in the biofilter structures the properties of biochar also affects the fate of heavy metals see beesley et al 2011 egene et al 2018 wu et al 2017 our results suggest that the type of soil substrate used in biofiltration systems is important however mixing sewage sludge originated compost with biochar of birch origin and adding a few cm thick layer of biochar underneath the organic soil layer can substantially reduce the leaching of n and heavy metals 4 4 concluding remarks given the substantial cover of roadside land at the urban fringe and thus the potential loading originating from such areas the use of sewage sludge and other materials rich in nutrients and metals at the road verges should be considered carefully the leaching of nutrients and metals from potential materials should be tested before using them in green infrastructure in urban watersheds as with soils in other urban greenspaces pouyat et al 2007 urban green swales are generally n saturated and thus the addition of extra n should be avoided to protect watersheds next to aquatic ecosystems the retention of n and metals in biofiltration systems can be improved as shown in our study by biochar addition but the capacity of biochar to retain both n and p can be context dependent warranting careful verification before using synergistic or antagonistic effects of co existing constituents under dynamic field conditions have been identified as an issue that needs further examination especially when studying the impacts of biochar mohanty et al 2018 we agree with this argument and call for more long term controlled field studies on the performance of various biochars in affecting the retention of pollutants in stormwater biofilter systems long term studies are needed also to understand the overall long term performance of various biofilters in our study the impacts of vegetation on the retention of both p and n was remarkable in both treatments containing compost while in lysimeters with peat the stunted growth of grasses contributed to their negligible impact on nutrient dynamics thus our results highlight also the need to understand the role of vegetation in the performance of biofilter

20082,urban runoff from traffic areas is a major source of pollution that degrades the quality of adjacent surface waters green infrastructure provided by the substantial amount of roadside land at urban fringe areas can be used to better manage and infiltrate this urban runoff when establishing urban green areas recycled materials should be preferred in order to achieve economically feasible and environmentally responsible solutions wastewater treatment plants within e g the eu yield substantial amounts of solids containing nutrients and metals that need to be utilised in a sustainable way however soil composted from such sewage sludge is being used widely in constructing green infrastructure such as parks and road verges which may jeopardise their use for stormwater management even though the effects of sewage sludge at road verges on the quality of runoff waters have not been subjected to scientific examination biochar has been suggested to retain pollutants and may also meet the criteria of being recycled material we established artificial biofilter structures mimicking road verges in large scale field lysimeters under cold climatic conditions in southern finland to study the ability of biochar to retain pollutants leaching from composted sewage sludge and from infiltrating artificial stormwater the topmost 15 cm consisted of an organic layer of either natural peat peat or soil composted from sewage sludge either mixed with birch derived biochar 3 by volume or without this biochar comp bc and comp respectively at the end of the 1st growing period grasses growing in the lysimeters had taken up to 32 of phosphorus in the top soil containing compost leaching of phosphorus did not differ between the treatments while nitrogen n leaching was ten time larger from comp than peat leaching of heavy metals such as nickel and copper was also significantly higher from compost soils than peat but biochar significantly reduced metal leaching from compost up to 50 two years after establishment lysimeters were irrigated with artificial stormwater mimicking runoff from roads with heavy traffic comp leached more n compared to peat however biochar significantly reduced n load infiltrated through the compost by 44 mixing sewage sludge originated compost with biochar and adding a 5 cm thick layer of biochar underneath the organic soil layer can substantially reduce leaching of n and heavy metals however given the substantial amount of roadsides in urban fringe areas the extensive use of sewage sludge and other n rich materials in such areas should be considered carefully keywords stormwater biofiltration nutrients metals pollution retention sludge 1 introduction cities are disproportionately located along aquatic ecosystems and have been identified as hotspots for the accumulation of nutrients and metals and the subsequent leakage of these contaminants into adjacent water bodies grimm et al 2008 pouyat et al 2007 urban runoff also known as stromwater is a notable carrier of pollutants in urban areas that can degrade the quality and health of adjacent surface waters fletcher et al 2013 elevated runoff volumes due to the high proportion of impervious surfaces increase pollutant loads carey et al 2013 resulting in a significant relationship between the percentage of impervious surfaces and the loading of nutrients and metals valtanen et al 2014 2015 as conventional urban water management is unlikely to meet challenges brought about by an increasingly urbanising world there is an urgent need to develop innovative solutions to sustainably manage stormwater in cities fitzhugh and richter 2004 larsen et al 2016 for example various biofiltration structures have been developed to diminish and treat urban runoff that would be otherwise conveyed unpurified directly to adjacent water bodies via undeground sewer systems ahiablame et al 2012 carey et al 2013 driscoll et al 2015 hatt et al 2009 biofiltration systems and or other green infrastructure have been shown to reduce nutrient export from cities at the watershed scale pennino et al 2016 while in other cases they have been less effective liu et al 2017 given the limited and inconsistent knowledge of the efficiencies of various green infrastructure solutions empirical studies are needed to better understand the factors such as design including soil materials vegetation type pollutant loads and climate and local conditions that influence the success of stormwater management ahiablame et al 2012 liu et al 2017 this is especially the case in northern latitudes where the functioning of bio based infiltration treatments is supposed to be inefficient during cold months blecken et al 2011 muthanna et al 2007 traffic is a main source of pollutants in cities with traffic volume correlating strongly with pollutant loads in roadside environments carey et al 2013 kuoppamäki et al 2014 westerlund and viklander 2006 consequently contaminants at road edges can pose important but still poorly known risk to both surface and ground waters kuoppamäki et al 2014 valtanen et al 2014 westerlund and viklander 2006 a common practice to mitigate the adverse effects of road derived runoff is grass swales that replace or supplement traditional curbs and gutters adsorption absorption processes by such low cost bioretention features can efficiently control phosphorus and metals bound in suspended solids but not pollutants that are in dissolved form reviewed by ahiablame et al 2012 the composition of bioretention media is typically mostly sand and vegetation is planted on a variety of mixtures containing soil sand mulch and organic matter ahiablame et al 2012 in finland peat is usually mixed in soil products but the use of peat is not sustainable due to its extremely slow regeneration rate biofilter structures should be environmentally sustainable with a low environmental footprint minimal economic cost hatt et al 2009 readily available and materials preferably recycled rather than virgin to promote circular economy mohanty et al 2018 for instance the over 50 000 wastewater treatment plants within the european union yield over 10 million tons of dry solids per year eurostat 2018 this sewage sludge contains high amount of nutrients and organic matter to be used as fertilizer or a soil improving agent within eu countries 37 of the total annual production of sewage sludge is used in agriculture while the rest is used for other land applications olofsson et al 2012 in cities worldwide 10 30 of the city area is covered with roads and streets with an equal proportion being road verges due to the substantial amount of roadside land at urban fringe areas the use of sewage sludge to support vegetation growth has become a common practice there however as sewage sludge can exceed the threshold values for metal concentrations the sewage sludge directive 86 278 eec and also contain organic pollutants zennegg et al 2013 microplastics lusher et al 2017 and unwanted pathogens bagge et al 2005 its use in green infrastructure has been questioned di bonito 2008 furthermore the effects of sewage sludge at road verges on the quality of runoff waters have not been subjected to scientific examination to improve their capacity to retain stormwater and contaminants therein various types of materials have been added in biofilter systems for example when added to the soil biochar has been shown to reduce the leaching of nutrients and metals wei et al 2018 in agriculture konczak and oleszczuk 2018 and when applied to green roofs kuoppamäki et al 2016 furthermore biochar appears to be a promising material for stormwater treatment and meets the criteria for having a low environmental footprint and being recycled material mohanty et al 2018 the manufacturing process of biochar does not allow co2 to be released from the feed material making biochar a carbon sink lehmann 2007 however results from large scale field applications of biochar to treat stormwater are lacking we established large scale biofilter structures in field lysimeters 2 m3 to mimic road verges under cold climatic zone in southern finland the lysimeters were composed of three soil types and the efficacy of these soils to retain or the risk of these soils to leach nutrients and metals were monitored for two years after this the lysimeters were added with artificial stormwater and they were monitored for one month to study the retention of nutrients and metals we hypothesized that 1 the leaching of nutrients and metals from soil composted from sewage sludge is higher than that from nutrient poor peat but 2 this leaching is reduced by amending sludge based compost with biochar 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment setup to simulate road verges we established an experiment in nine large scale field lysimeters depth 2 m diameter ca 1 m stainless steel situated in the city of lahti southern finland 60 59 00 n 25 39 20 e in june 2014 as illustrated in fig 1 on the bottom of each lysimeter a 0 5 m thick layer of coarse gravel 8 16 mm was placed as a drainage layer above this layer separated with a filter fabric another 0 5 m of filter sand 0 02 31 5 mm was added above the sand layer a 0 4 m thick layer of coarsely crushed stones 0 90 mm and then 0 3 m finely crushed stones 0 32 mm were placed finally a top layer 0 15 m thick of growing substrate was added consisting either of i soil with composted sewage sludge 50 v v mixed with fine sand 50 v v hereafter referred to as comp ii the same compost soil amended 5

hereafter peat in the comp bc treatment a 0 05 m layer of biochar was also added below the growing substrate thus the uppermost 0 2 m layer contained 30 biochar and the total lysimeter 3 v v each treatment had three replicates the structure and layers of soil in the lysimeters followed what is commonly used in road structures in southern finland all lysimeters were planted with seeds of a grass mixture festuca ovina f rubra phleum pratense typical to road verges in finland the soils were derived from commercial producers sewage sludge from the helsinki region environmental services authority hsy and peat belinda enriched with nkp fertilizer from europeat ltd properties of the compost biochar and peat used are listed in table 1 2 2 measurements outflow rate of the infiltrated water was measured at 10 min resolution using pressure sensors set in outflow water tanks of 20 l the mass of each lysimeter was continuously measured with scales and was used to calculate outflow rate when water tanks overflowed however in february and march 2016 technical problems caused by accumulating snow on top of the lysimeters prevented us from calculating runoff volumes soil temperature and moisture were measured continuously throughout the study with sensors placed at 0 2 m and 1 6 m depths from the surface of each lysimeter fig 1 a local vaisala wxt520 micro weather station collected data on rainfall air moisture and wind velocity at 10 min intervals grass growing in the lysimeters were cut at the base of the shoots at the end of the growing season in 2014 aboveground biomass of the vegetation was room dried for 6 weeks and dry mass g calculated 2 3 sampling during the stabilising period before irrigating the lysimeters with artificial stormwater see below they were left to stabilise under ambient precipitation for 23 months during this period potential leaching of nutrients and metals from the lysimeter soil was monitored by taking samples from infiltrating water at 2 4 month intervals when enough i e 10 l hereafter litres are abbreviated as l had infiltrated through each lysimeter the first such runoff event was 5 months after establishing the experiment on the 26th november 2014 when the first set of runoff samples for nutrient and metal analyses was taken thereafter in 2015 samples were taken on 22nd january 27th may 17th and 10th december while in 2016 samples were taken on 17th february and 22nd march thus during the stabilisation period sampling was carried out following a total of 7 runoff events 2 4 sampling during the irrigations in mid may 2016 mean monthly temperature 8 c when the growing season had already started and spring snowmelt had passed the lysimeters were irrigated with artificial stormwater simulating runoff from an urban core area with 89 impervious surface see valtanen et al 2014 the content of the artificial stormwater was as follows soluble phosphorus k2hpo4 1 mg l nitrate nano3 10 mg l zinc znso4 7h2o 0 5 mg l copper cuso4 5h2o 0 3 mg l lead pbno3 0 1 mg l aluminium al2 so4 3 18h2o 5 mg l and chromium crcl 0 1 mg l irrigation occurred during two consecutive days the first irrigation on 11th may represented a 5 mm precipitation event of 1 h duration and the second on 15th may represented a 10 mm event of 2 h duration so that the volume of stormwater per lysimeter was 40 l and 80 l respectively it was assumed that the area of the lysimeter biofilters represents 10 of their catchment area with a 0 9 runoff coefficient 30 of precipitation events at the locality during a 4 year measuring campaign are between 5 mm and 10 mm k kuoppamäki unpublished data such rain events were considered representative and importantly large enough to generate runoff from the lysimeters samples from infiltrating water were taken on two consecutive days following the irrigation event as well as once a month later assuming a delayed outflow of stormwater before terminating the experiment final discharge samples were taken on the 17th june 2016 2 5 laboratory analyses water samples that infiltrated through the lysimeters as well as a composite sample of the stormwater used for irrigation were first measured for ph by using a wtw inolab ph 720 and electric conductivity by using a wtw cond 330i meter all water samples were stored at 20 c until the analysis of nutrients and metals samples for total nutrient analyses were first oxidised in an autoclave at 120 c for 30 min total phosphorus tp was measured spectrophotometrically after the addition of a molybdate reagent sfs 3026 a high performance liquid chromatography shimadzu prominence hplc instrument was used to determine total nitrogen tn with 0 04 m sodium chloride nacl as the eluent and using an ion exchange column waters ic pak anion hc the chromatogram was recorded at 225 nm for the analysis of total dissolved metal content in the artificial stormwater and in the water leachates concentrated hno3 50 μl and 50 μl of 1 mg l indium solution was added as an internal standard and the sample was mixed well with vortex for total dissolved metals samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter whatman one ml of the sample was then diluted with 4 ml of water and 50 μl of indium internal standard 1 mg l was added to the diluted sample five ml of the filtered sample was transferred into a test tube finally metal concentrations were determined using a perkin elmer elan 6000 icp ms according to sfs en iso 17294 2 2005 biochar and grass samples above ground biomass only were analysed for total metals cd cr cu ni zn and pb and tp concentration using elan 6000 icp ms as a pre treatment the samples were digested with a mars 6 microwave digester in addition total carbon tc and tn concentrations

total runoff volume see supplementary material and loads of nutrients tp tn and metals cd cr cu ni pb zn in leachate water during the stabilisation period were tested using repeated measures anova where treatment was a fixed factor and the repeated measures were comprised of either nutrients or metals with time of sampling the loads of nutrients and dissolved metals were calculated by multiplying concentrations by runoff volumes total loads after artificial stormwater irrigation were obtained by summing loads measured during the three sampling days these results as well as average loads measured before irrigation were tested using multivariate anova once statistically significant treatment effects appeared in the anova models the statistical significance of differences between treatments were interpreted using tukey post hoc test if a significant interaction between treatment and time was observed the effect of treatment was analysed separately on each sampling event anova for multivariate measures was used to analyse the effects of treatment on the biomass and nutrient contents of grasses the homogeneity of variances and normal distribution of the data were tested using levene s test and shapiro wilk test respectively data were log transformed if the assumptions of normality were violated if assumptions were not fulfilled even after log transformation data were tested using non parametric kruskal wallis and mann whitney tests all statistical analyses were carried out using the spss statistical package ibm corp 2016 3 results 3 1 nutrients when comparing loads averaged across the stabilising period tn load was higher from the two compost treatments than from peat while for tp loads it was vice versa fig 2 nitrogen leaching was also statistically significantly higher from compost comp than from peat table 2 however the difference in tn loads between compost amended with biochar comp bc and peat was insignificant table 2 indicating that biochar reduced the leaching of tn the difference in tp loads between all treatments was also insignificant in detail tn leaching from peat was 1 10 x lower than that from comp or comp bc mann whitney p 0 05 peat vs comp and comp bc in each sampling event in the comp treatments tn loads declined from ca 3000 5000 mg m2 at the beginning of the experiment to 500 2000 mg m2 in december 2015 and in the peat treatment from 500 to 10 mg m2 and thus the impact of time on tn load was notable table 2 tp loads varied between 0 15 and 0 7 mg m2 in all treatments without temporal trends background loads of tn and tp in wet and dry deposition at the experimental area during the study were 4 19 and 0 3 1 9 mg m2 respectively following irrigation with artificial stormwater biochar reduced the leaching of tn just like during the stabilisation period comp leached more tn than comp bc and peat table 2 while tn load from comp bc was only marginally higher than that from peat tukey p 0 056 however negative tn retention of 186 and 64 were observed in comp and comp bc respectively indicating high leaching from the compost mixture itself peat also had low yet positive tn retention 15 following stormwater irrigation elevated load of tp was observed in peat ca 50 higher than from comp and comp bc but differences between treatments were insignificant table 2 due to high variation fig 3 tp leaching from all treatments was extremely low compared to the load in stormwater and thus all treatments retained tp by 99 the event mean concentrations of nutrients and metals are given in supplemental material 3 2 metals during the stabilisation period the effect of treatment on the loads of all metals except chromium cr and aluminium al depended on time table 2 in december 2015 an increase was detected in the loads of cadmium cd nickel ni lead pb and zinc zn especially in both compost treatments when calculating average dissolved metal loads during the stabilisation period significantly higher leaching of zn al and ni from comp than from the other two treatments was evident table 2 fig 4 showing that biochar can increase the retention of these metals on the other hand peat leached more cu than the two compost treatments cr load remained at ca 0 01 mg m2 during this period al loads in turn could not be determined due to low concentrations below the detection limit of 92 μg l until december 2015 when concentrations suddenly increased in comp up to 400 700 μg l and in the other treatments well above 100 μg l following irrigation with stormwater loads of dissolved zn and al were highest in comp and lowest in peat the significant difference being between comp and peat table 3 fig 5 a similar pattern was evident in cu loads but the effects of treatments were marginally significant as well as in those of ni and cd which were however not added to the stormwater the retention of cr al and pb which were added to the artifical stormwater was 99 100 in all treatments also cu and zn were 91 and 87 retained respectively by peat containing lysimeters comp leached remarkably more zn on average 124 mg m2 compared to the 76 mg m2 that was added to the artifical stormwater resulting in negative retention 63 however the addition of biochar improved the retention of cu in compost close to levels leached from peat 3 3 runoff ph and electric conductivity rainwater ph and irrigation water ph decreased from 6 7 to an average 4 7 when infiltrating through comp while significantly higher ph average 6 1 was measured in water infiltrated through peat anova f 10 03 p 0 012 tukey p 0 01 fig 6 however ph declined less in water infiltrating through comp bc than in comp though the impact of biochar was not statistically significant opposite patterns were seen in electric conductivity that was 3 times higher in comp compared to that in rain and irrigation water while peat did not change conductivity of the infiltrating water fig 6 biochar amendment attenuated the increase of conductivity the effects of treatments on runoff ph and electric conductivity were significant the difference being between comp and peat table 3 3 4 retention of stormwater the total retention of all water including artificial stormwater and natural rainfall was 21 26 without significant differences between treatments more precisely after the first stormwater irrigation 40 l the two compost treatments retained 75 of water while the retention in peat was 64 the corresponding values following the second stormwater irrigation 80 l were 45 and 55 respectively top soil moisture content increased from 10 to 20 to 50 60 in comp and comp bc and 40 50 in peat following irrigations with stormwater discharge velocity was on average 1500 ml h from the 2nd irrigation event until the last water sampling event a month later total precipitation was 58 mm resulting in an additional 45 l of water in each lysimeter this volume was used in calculating the emc values of the last sampling event 3 5 vegetation during the first growth period grasses germinated well in all lysimeters irrespective of treatment however at the end of the first growing period the biomass of grasses growing in peat was stunted being on average 7 times lower compared to the two treatments with compost soil anova f 29 29 p 0 001 fig 7 percentage c in grasses was 44 in all treatments this corresponds to ca 137 124 and 18 g c

the growing season in 2014 was slightly warmer on average 16 c and rainier 205 mm than in 2015 14 4 c and 175 mm respectively though the latter year was characterised by several days with higher precipitation amounts compared to the previous year fig 8 in 2014 air temperature dropped below 0 c earlier than in 2015 but was warmer than winter 2015 2016 the second winter was very cold with temperature below minus 10 c during all january 2016 consequently in the first winter only top soil of lysimeters got frozen and only for short periods of time while in the second winter the top soil was frozen for 7 weeks with the bottom soil also frozen for one week in mid january fig 8 precipitation before sampling during preceding month was much higher in december 2015 compared to precipitation preceding the other sampling campaigns table 4 samples taken in march 2016 included water that was melting from soils in the lysimeters and this water obviously represented several previous rain events spanning for time longer than just the preceding month sampling events in january 2015 and in february and march 2016 can be considered as representing winter conditions given the average air temperatures below 0 c during the preceding month table 4 total amount of precipitation from the beginning of the experiment until the irrigation with artificial stormwater was 1200 mm 4 discussion it is well established that the input of materials such as nutrients and metals from watersheds to adjacent surface and ground water bodies are in decisive role determining the quality of invaluable water resources our results suggest that the application of sewage sludge derived compost soil to road verges can substantially increase the leaching of tn al ni and zn and thus potentially affect the ecology of the entire watershed our results further suggest that application of biochar can substantially reduce the leaching of tn and metals from compost soils thus enabling its use at road verge areas in urbanised watersheds however biochar was not able to reduce the leaching of all contaminants we predicted that the leaching of nutrients and metals from compost mixture is higher than from peat this prediction was partly confirmed as lysimeters with compost leached considerably more nitrogen tn and metals al ni zn and cd than peat both during the 23 month stabilisation period and after stormwater irrigation in contrast there were no statistically significant differences in phosphorus tp cr and pb leaching between the treatments further we hypothesized that leaching of nutrients and metals from compost is reduced by biochar amendment biochar reduced tn leaching by 44 from compost soil during irrigation with stormwater when the soils had been stabilising for two years during the stabilisation period biochar decreased the loads of al cu ni and zn significantly while after stormwater addition the difference was apparent but statistically insignificant we will next discuss in more detail the potential of the three soil types to retain nutrients and metals 4 1 nutrient retention as algal productivity in freshwaters is usually phosphorus limited reducing the loading of this nutrient from surrounding watershed is especially critical during the almost 2 year stabilisation period leaching of tp from the lysimeters was extremely low without consistent differences between treatments furthermore after the two artificial stormwater irrigations 99 of the added phosphorus was retained by all three treatments as tp concentration of the top layer materials was quite similar in both comp and peat this result was expected indeed dissolved p carried by water is retained well by different soils types barrett et al 2013 coffmann and clar 2003 pitt et al 1999 valtanen et al 2017 the tp content of biochar was quite high but comp bc did not leach more tp than the other treatments suggesting that it was in insoluble form in biochar on the other hand although biochar increased leachate ph this did not result in improved retention of tp it is noteworthy that a considerable amount of tp was retained in grass biomass in the two compost systems the grass biomass being 5 x higher in the compost soils compared to peat soils contained 1 5 times more tp 0 47 mg m2 and 0 46 mg m2 in comp and comp bc respectively compared to grasses growing in peat 0 03 mg m2 at the start of the study the content of dissolved p in the top soil layers of comp comp bc and peat was 5 9 4 1 and 4 6 g m2 respectively consequently on average 24 32 and 3 of p in the top soil was bound to aboveground vegetation at the end of the 1st growing period implying a remarkably large impact of vegetation on nutrient retention in the biofilter systems this impact was much lower in peat where grasses had stunted growth compared to comp and comp bc when these values are compared to the amounts of tp leached through the lysimeter soils during the 1st growing period comp comp bc and peat 0 6 0 8 0 4 g m2 respectively the importance of tp immobilized by plant biomass as well as the soil layers becomes evident the stunted growth of grasses in peat probably partly explains the higher p leaching compared to the two compost treatments in general the high potential of biofilter structures to absorb p is in line with valtanen et al 2017 in northern conditions and by coffmann and clar 2003 glaister et al 2014 barrett et al 2013 and pitt et al 1999 under warmer climatic conditions in all the almost 100 ability of our bioretention systems to retain tp irrespective of the top soil material indicates that the biofiltration type used here is efficient to treat traffic derived stormwater and thus mitigate eutrophication potential of adjacent water bodies importantly decreasing the loading of p rather than n is a prerequisite to mitigate the eutrophication of lakes schindler et al 2008 in contrast to tp tn was poorly retained by the biofiltration systems at the beginning of the study the stabilisation phase the retention of tn by each treatment was negative as indicated by the ca 250 750 x higher tn loads measured in the water leachates compared to the amount detected in rainwater via wet and dry deposition as n content in the mineral soils used in our study was negligible h setälä unpublished tn in the water leachates were likely derived from the top layer materials moreover n leaching from disturbed soil is common for example at construction sites sillanpää 2003 wakida and lerner 2002 as such studies that span over several years to allow for soil stabilising phases are required to determine the actual pollutant retention capability of the soil thus although our experiment lasted for two years it may still be too short to demonstrate tn dynamics in biofilter systems the leaching of tn from both compost soils was several times higher than from peat despite the added fertilizer in the latter loads of tn in the runoff decreased at the end of the stabilisation period but the n content was still ca 100 times higher compared to tn load in wet and dry deposition after stormwater irrigation tn loads increased again which supports earlier findings about the inefficient retention of tn by biofiltration systems bratieres et al 2008 hatt et al 2009 pitt et al 1994 valtanen et al 2014 but shows that sandy peat can well retain tn however extending the experiment longer and making more stormwater irrigations may reduce the capacity of also sandy peat to retain nitrogen somewhat unexpectedly the pattern of tn in the leachate water was not affected by the cold period per se but more likely by the length of the time since the start of the experiment and irrigating the systems with stormwater this suggests that biofiltration structures do not necessarily function badly during winter as long as the soil is not completely frozen during the first winter only the top soil got frozen for periods of few days and therefore the impact of cold season on the functioning of lysimeters was probably negligible during the second colder winter freezing reached the bottom of lysimeters though only for one week while top of soil was frozen for over 7 weeks nevertheless no elevated leaching of tn was observed in the leachates taken after this period suggesting that tn dynamics was not much affected by freezing or thawing despite substantial leaching of tn from the compost treatments a remarkable proportion of tn was retained in the aboveground grass biomass 9 8 and 9 4 g m2 in comp and comp bc respectively corresponding to 19 and 20 of tn detected in the top 0 15 m layer soils grasses grown in peat contained only 0 6 g n m2 which is 2 of tn in top layer soils it is likely that the stunted growth of grasses was mostly responsible for the reduced their capacity to store tn corresponding tn leaching from the lysimeters between june to november 2015 was 11 6 comp 6 3 comp bc and 1 2 g m2 peat indicating similar amounts of tn in the leachates and in the green grass biomass under n deficient conditions the ability of biochar to adsorb nitrogen can hamper the uptake of plant available nutrients and thus have adverse effects on plant growth however in our study grass biomass and its n concentration was unresponsive to biochar addition indicating sufficient nutritional conditions for plants also in the comp bc treatment 4 2 retention of metals cr cd pb cu ni and zn are metals frequently detected in runoff from urbanised watersheds kuoppamäki et al 2014 valtanen et al 2014 westerlund and viklander 2006 and they have been listed as elements that often cause failures of ecological status in water bodies eaa 2018 loads of the most environmentally hazardous metals cr cd and pb in leachate waters discharging from our lysimeters were irresponsive to the type of soil in the current study interestingly the retention of cr and pb derived from artifical stormwater was nearly 100 these results show that cr and pb as well as cu are fairly well retained by the biofilter structure and support many other studies reporting 72 99 retention of cu and pb in biofilters blecken et al 2009 bäckström et al 2003 feng et al 2012 muthanna et al 2007 reddy et al 2014 valtanen et al 2017 however the negative retention of zn 180 after stormwater irrigation indicates leaching from composted sewage sludge with low ph in discharge the mobility of zn is promoted by low ph aastrup et al 1995 after stormwater addition only peat soil with higher runoff ph retained considerable amounts ca 75 of the added amount of zn leaf compost has been shown to remove al in stormwater biofilters feng et al 2012 while in our study sewage compost had the lowest retention of al which may result from the very different origin of the compost material metal concentrations measured in the composted sewage sludge soil used in our study were far below threshold values 300 1500 and 100 mg kg dw for cr zn and pb respectively provided by finnish environmental authorities in spite of this when comparing the metal concentrations of leachates to the classification of stockholm vatten 2001 the event mean concentrations see supplemental material of ni 634 μg l before stormwater irrigation 1010 μg l after irrigation zn 330 580 μg l cu 25 206 μg l and cd 2 4 3 4 μg l from compost treatments exceeded limit values of 225 300 45 and 1 5 μg l respectively even though cd and ni were not present in our artifical stormwater mixture these elements were measured in high concentrations in water filtrates especially from the compost treatments after stormwater addition these metals likely started to mobilise in the soil materials later on when the lysimeter soils became saturated with rain and stormwater especially lysimeters containing compost reached moisture up to 60 of volumetric content from these systems the leaching of cd and ni were 3 5 and 5 x higher than from the peat systems since cd is very mobile at low ph conditions in soil and soilwater aastrup et al 1995 the low ph in comp probably contributed to the leaching of cd as the discharge velocity was low on average 1 5 l h there was enough time for various interactions between the soil and leaching water to take place which in turn may have lowered the leachate ph after two years concentrations of ni and cd in the leachates from the compost containing treatments were still higher than those from the peat containing system these results emphasise the long term leaching of these metals even two years after the establishment of biofilters thus our study highlights a notable time lag in the leaching of metals especially as the loads suddenly increased 18 months after the start of the experiment following a very rainy preceding month in contrast the leaching of nutrients started immediatelly after the first rain event suggesting that metals are more strongly bound to soil particles than nutrients and thus release more slowly as elevated loads of metals were observed already well before air and soil temperatures dropped below 0 c freezing or thawing could not explain the sudden leaching of metals rather the accumulated rainfall 1000 mm until mid december 2015 and consequently the increased amount of infiltrating water totalling ca 55 60 and 82 mm in comp comp bc and peat respectively may had gradually transported metals down through the lysimeters 4 3 effects of biochar on nutrient and metal leaching we have shown previously that biochar of the same type as used in this study reduces the leaching of tp kuoppamäki et al 2016 this effect was not evident in the current study possibly due to extremely low tp concentrations in discharge instead biochar reduced tn leaching which is likely due to i sorption of n onto biochar ahmadvand et al 2018 gai et al 2014 or ii biochar induced effects on soil abiotic and biotic properties deluca et al 2015 biochar application modifies several soil physical properties such as cation exchange capacity ph redox conditions and water holding capacity which in turn affect soil microbiological processes and thus impacts on the bio availability and uptake of nutrients to pants deluca et al 2015 the mass export and retention of tn and tp in biofilter systems have been suggested to be primarily influenced by hydrological rather than biogeochemical mechanisms reviewed in jefferson et al 2017 since the water retention capacity did not differ between the three treatments at the end of the current study the effect of biochar was apparently more related to biogeochemistry than hydrology both increased saarnio et al 2018 and decreased knowles et al 2011 runoff of n from soils after biochar addition have been reported biochar itself may also contain nitrogen in labile forms that are prone to leaching iqbal et al 2015 ulrich et al 2015 however according to iqbal et al 2015 douglas fir originated biochar 650 c had no influence on the leaching of tn and tp from bioretention systems with compost material it is well established that depending on feedstock material and processing conditions biochar characteristics may vary considerably which should be taken into consideration when utilising biochar in environmental management deluca et al 2015 clough et al 2013 the short and long term implications of biochar on n dynamics within and outside biofilter systems are specific to soil biochar combinations which call for further systematic studies to evaluate feedstock types and processing conditions for the successful management of water in urbanised watersheds recent laboratory studies have shown the potential of biochar to remove contaminants from wastewater ahmad et al 2014 tan et al 2015 but so far there have been no field studies to show the potential of biochar to purify stormwater we showed that biochar reduced the leaching of sewage sludge originated cd ni and zn by ca 50 compared to compost soil without biochar addition although after stormwater addition this effect was not statistically significant activated carbon is considered an effective adsorbent of various pollutants and biochar can be used as a cheaper option in many applications thompson et al 2016 the lack of consistency in published data makes comparisons between biochar types difficult in addition to soil type in the biofilter structures the properties of biochar also affects the fate of heavy metals see beesley et al 2011 egene et al 2018 wu et al 2017 our results suggest that the type of soil substrate used in biofiltration systems is important however mixing sewage sludge originated compost with biochar of birch origin and adding a few cm thick layer of biochar underneath the organic soil layer can substantially reduce the leaching of n and heavy metals 4 4 concluding remarks given the substantial cover of roadside land at the urban fringe and thus the potential loading originating from such areas the use of sewage sludge and other materials rich in nutrients and metals at the road verges should be considered carefully the leaching of nutrients and metals from potential materials should be tested before using them in green infrastructure in urban watersheds as with soils in other urban greenspaces pouyat et al 2007 urban green swales are generally n saturated and thus the addition of extra n should be avoided to protect watersheds next to aquatic ecosystems the retention of n and metals in biofiltration systems can be improved as shown in our study by biochar addition but the capacity of biochar to retain both n and p can be context dependent warranting careful verification before using synergistic or antagonistic effects of co existing constituents under dynamic field conditions have been identified as an issue that needs further examination especially when studying the impacts of biochar mohanty et al 2018 we agree with this argument and call for more long term controlled field studies on the performance of various biochars in affecting the retention of pollutants in stormwater biofilter systems long term studies are needed also to understand the overall long term performance of various biofilters in our study the impacts of vegetation on the retention of both p and n was remarkable in both treatments containing compost while in lysimeters with peat the stunted growth of grasses contributed to their negligible impact on nutrient dynamics thus our results highlight also the need to understand the role of vegetation in the performance of biofilter

20083,mangrove wetlands are under increasing pollution pressure from human activities due to rapid industrialization and urbanization of coastal regions many pollutants such as heavy metals may be accumulated via food chains to hazardous levels which will thus bring potential health issues to humans in the present study three species of crabs sesarma dehaani sesarma plicata macrophthalmus japonicus and associated sediments from three mangrove habitats with different vegetation were collected from the mangrove wetlands in qi ao island south china to investigate the levels bioaccumulation and dietary exposure of heavy metals including copper cu zinc zn manganese mn cadmium cd and chromium cr metal concentrations in sediment samples were 65 91 212 247 506 1256 0 6 1 3

cr cd at each site species specific and tissue specific accumulation of metals was also found in mangrove crabs both in the degree of accumulation of particulate metals and the tissues in which they were most abundant all biota sediment accumulation factors bsaf values 1 for cd in each crab species suggested that the native mangrove crabs tended to be good tools for the monitoring of cd pollution in mangrove forests results of the estimated daily intake edi and target hazard quotient thq suggested that consumption of the mangrove crabs in qi ao island might subject local residents to potential health risks as far as the metals are concerned keywords heavy metal sediment crab mangrove wetland qi ao island 1 introduction heavy metals are typical environmental pollutants known for their toxicity bioaccumulation wide range of sources and persistence liu et al 2014 in these years with the development of urbanization and industrialization great amounts of heavy metals have been released into the environment by intensive anthropogenic activities such as mining electroplating industrial discharge pesticide application and so on wei et al 2006 the widespread heavy metal contamination has received great attention due to health issues zheng et al 2007 they can be accumulated by marine organisms through many pathways such as respiration and ingestion liu et al 2017 the benthic crustaceans such as crabs may be sensitive to metal pollution because of their living in the bottom sediments where chemical contaminants are mainly stored to some extent crabs can fulfill the main requirements of bio indicators such as being relatively sedentary easy to identify abundant long lived available for sampling all year round and getting a wide distribution rainbow 1995 which makes crabs suitable as biological indicators for monitoring the pollution status of heavy metals sanders et al 1998 turoczy et al 2001 van oosterom et al 2010 beltrame et al 2011 pinheiro et al 2012 mangrove wetland is a special ecosystem on the coastal areas of the tropical and subtropical regions it is productive with great biodiversity and has varieties of ecological functions such as flood protection salinity buffering carbon nutrients exportation to the coastal zones oceans and so on lewis et al 2011 bayen 2012 on the other hand mangrove is known as a sink to accumulate various kinds of pollutants such as heavy metals petroleum pesticides and so forth zhang et al 2014 so far a certain amount of studies have been carried out focusing on the occurrence transport and fate of heavy metals in mangrove ecosystems around the world zheng and lin 1996 tang et al 2008 liu et al 2014 those data on the sediment and organisms were usually used to indicate the environmental qualities saher and siddiqui 2019 pollution levels of heavy metals in mangrove sediments in different areas have been reviewed zhang et al 2014 the levels and biogeochemical cycles of heavy metals in mangrove plants have previously been reported zheng et al 1995 zheng et al 1996 zheng and lin 1996 however information on bioaccumulation of metals in mangrove fauna seemed to be inadequate and many previous studies mainly focused on the semi native species liu et al 2014 2017 furthermore some studied mangrove biota species might be unsuitable as bio indicators due to their low abundance in the local habitats as mentioned above crabs were good candidates of bio indicators for metal pollution but few of studies using crabs to monitor the metal pollution status of mangrove wetland have been reported silva et al 2018 saher and siddiqui 2019 occurrence bioaccumulation and dietary exposure of heavy metals in mangrove crabs should therefore be comprehensively investigated there are mangrove wetlands distributing in qi ao island zhuhai city which is located in the southwest of pearl river estuary historically there were over 200 ha of mangrove existing in the island but only 32 0 ha natural mangrove remained at dawei bay until 1999 because of the reclamation then efforts on mangrove conservation and restoration have been made and rapid grow type mangrove species i e sonneratia apetala and s caseolaris were introduced the area of mangrove wetland was up to 533 33 ha at dawei bay in 2004 peng et al 2009 the introduction of exotic mangrove plant species may change the macrofauna communities and the native citizens may vary at different swamps tang et al 2012 in addition the pearl river estuary which has been exploited since 1980s is considered to be the second largest polluted estuary area in china and a great deal of toxic metals such as pb cd and cr has been discharged into the pearl river annually fang 2004 various persistent organic pollutants have also been found in the pearl river estuary fung et al 2005 fang 2006 wei et al 2006 in this paper we focus on the bioaccumulation of heavy metals by representative crab species which were the native species and occupied a great mass in associated mangrove swamps two species sesarma dehaani and sesarma plicata are common components of intertidal crab assemblages in the mangroves of the indo pacific region zhang et al 2008 chen et al 2014 these crabs mainly feed on fallen leaves and seeds and their burrowing can affect drainage and soil chemistry of mangrove forests kneib et al 1999 macrophthalmus japonicus one of the most dominant macrobenthic animals in most of the intertidal mud areas usually lives in isolated burrows which are dug in muddy regions of estuaries and feeds on organic matter separated from the surface mud henmi 1992 our objective was to measure the concentrations of heavy metals in the crabs s dehaani s plicata and m japonicus and associated sediments from qi ao island the level of heavy metal contamination will be evaluated and spatial and species differences in heavy metal accumulation will be investigated furthermore health risks of trace metals in edible tissues

the crab samples were transferred to the laboratory and frozen at 20 c the three native crab species were small in size and the collected samples were mature three to four individuals were randomly mixed to obtain a composite sample the length and width of the carapace as well as the wet weight of each species were measured and recorded table 1 2 2 sample analysis the sediment samples were

coastal sediments of the pearl river estuary gan et al 2010 at each site the levels of heavy metals demonstrated a same order as mn zn cu cr cd this result was similar to that reported in some other studies tam and wong 2000 defew et al 2005 in a mangrove forest sediment could be considered as the main reservoir of heavy metals compared with concentration of metals in the mangrove sediments of other studies qi ao island held relatively higher levels of cu zn cd and mn table 3 the higher levels of these metals could be ascribed to the pollution of pearl river caused by intense industrial and agricultural activities for many decades the pearl river estuary is well known for the manufacture of paint enamel stained glass tv photo conductor printed circuit board and electroplating fung et al 2005 fang 2006 metal mine operations and industries related to metallurgy distributed along the upper reaches of the pearl river is also an important source of metal contamination fang 2006 among the three mangrove swamps significantly higher concentrations of cu zn mn and cd were found in the artificial swamp of s apetala in dawei bay sd the natural k candel swamp in dawei bay kd was detected with the lowest concentrations of cu zn and mn in general the natural mangrove swamp kd in the inner bay seemed to be slightly polluted by heavy metals compared with the other two artificial mangrove forests different levels of heavy metals in sd and kd might be attributed to the location of the swamps in fact the natural k candel swamp was well protected and barely affected by human activities those man made swamps tended to be interfered by relatively intense human activities such as mangrove planting fishing and shipping 3 2 metals in the crabs cu zn mn and cd were detected in all the crab samples and the levels were shown in fig 2 concentrations of cu zn mn and cd in the crab tissues ranged from 36 to 528 44 to 280 59 to 781 and 2 0 to 24 mg kg dw cr was only detected in hepatopancreas 7 8 1 7 mg kg dw and carapace 13 2 3 7 mg kg dw of s dehaani suggesting the low cr bioavailability compared with levels of metals in crabs from other locations concentrations of metals in the present study could be observed at moderate to high levels table 4 it was reported that the levels of cu and zn in s dehaani 69 128 mg kg for cu and 44 102 mg kg for zn from the changjiang river estuary sun and wang 2003 which were slightly lower than our results 88 164 and 253 280 mg kg for cu and zn respectively it might be ascribed to the metal pollution in the pearl river estuary region and the sediment dwelling habits of the three mangrove crab species generally sediment dwelling crabs are apt to accumulate more heavy metals additionally various factors such as age sex size tissue type feeding habits and growth rate could also affect the accumulation of heavy metal in crabs jennings and rainbow 1979 turoczy et al 2001 mohapatra et al 2009 differences were found in terms of species and tissues both in the degree of accumulation of particulate metals and the tissues in which they were the most abundant zn was most accumulated in s dehaani followed by s plicata and m japonicus while for cu cd and mn the species specific accumulation might vary within different tissues for example cu concentrations in the hepatopancreas were s plicata m japonicus s dehaani while in the muscle were s dehaani s plicata m japonicus the metal concentrations in muscle tissues showed a trend of zn mn cu cd cr in all the species while in the hepatopancreas the trend might vary with species and the orders of metals were zn cu mn cd cr for s dehaani cu zn mn cd cr for s plicata and cu mn zn cd cr for m japonicus in the carapace the sequence became mn cu zn cr cd for s dehaani and mn zn cu cd cr for s plicata and m japonicus in our study the crabs were collected from three different habitats levels of metals in sediments were different and the vegetation varied at each sampling site sediment is a major sink of heavy metals and also supply food source for many benthic organisms zhang et al 2014 vegetation was also found to influence the metal accumulation in crabs liu et al 2014 thus feeding habits might be an important factor affecting the accumulation of heavy metals in different species liu et al 2017 furthermore the influences of size sex and some other physiological parameters should not be ignored as well as the functions of different elements it is believed that the crabs are capable of regulating concentrations of essential metals in the body but are unable to regulate the levels of nonessential metals rainbow 1985 mohapatra et al 2009 in each crab species levels of cu zn and mn were higher than those of cd and cr cu and zn are essential elements which are necessary for organism to ensure normal health because of their significant roles in enzymatic and respiratory process manganese is also an indispensable constitute of many enzymes and plays a role as an activator of enzyme systems in animals martin 1974 it is not believed that cd plays any required role in metabolism and may become toxic even at relatively low concentrations cr was least accumulated by the crabs and the results were similar to some studies table 4 it was reported that higher levels of cr in crab charybdis longicollis 60 mg kg in muscle and 531 mg kg in hepatopancreas and the reason was due to sinking of a ship whose load contained high concentrations of cr firat et al 2008 significant differences between tissue types were observed in the present study in all the three crab species concentrations of cu and cd were significantly higher in the hepatopancreas than in the muscles and carapaces the highest levels of mn were found in the carapaces and zn tended to be accumulated by muscles for each species different tissue probably exhibits specific metal bioconcentration pathway and mechanism in this study cu and cd are found to be most accumulated in the hepatopancreas which were similar to the results from other studies canli and furness 1995 mortimer 2000 turoczy et al 2001 mohapatra et al 2009 generally speaking the hepatopancreas is considered to be the primary vessel for storage and detoxification of heavy metals there are plentiful metallothioneins to help sequester heavy metals this kind of protein could be readily bonded by cu zn and cd klaassen et al 1999 nakayama et al 2010 levels of zn in muscles and hepatopancreas might vary due to species differences or spatial differences table 4 mn was most accumulated in the carapace which could be explained by the ability of mn to substitute calcium in calcium carbonate the carapace was considered to act as a sink in which manganese can be deposited and to play an important role in the detoxification of manganese steenkamp et al 1994 cr seemed to be unavailable for mangrove crabs because of its low detection rate and low levels in our study 3 3 biota sediment accumulation factors the crab species were captured from different stations with different vegetation biota sediment accumulation factors bsafs were used in this study to evaluate the metal bioaccumulation in the three crab species table 5 bsafs are defined as the ratios between the metal concentration in the organism and that in the sediment abdallah and abdallah 2008 nakayama et al 2010 the formula is bsaf cx cs where cx is the concentration of some heavy metal in the crab and cs is the concentration of the heavy metal in the sediment bsafs of cu zn mn and cd were presented in table 5 results suggested the bioaccumulation of cu zn and cd in s dehaani with bsafs 1 cu was also observed to be bioaccumulated in m japonicus bioaccumulation of cu was also observed in crab ucides cordatus from mangrove coast region of the brazilian amazon silva et al 2018 the bsaf values for cd were all above 1 0 with greatest value 10 found in m japonicus bsafs 1 were also reported for mud crab scylla serrata in sundarbans mangrove forest ahmed et al 2011 all these results indicated that cd is apt to be accumulated by mangrove crabs and crabs tended to be good tools to monitor cd pollution in mangrove forest mangrove crabs sesarma mederi in the upper gulf of thailand were observed to accumulate heavy metals in the order of cd cu zn and this result was similar to ours chaiyara et al 2013 bsaf values for mn were all below 0 2 indicating its lesser bioavailability than the other metals as mentioned above carapaces accumulated more mn than the other tissues and the calculated bsafs based on the concentrations of mn in carapace ranged from 0 34 to 1 20 suggesting carapaces of crabs might be better bio indicator of mn pollution in the mangrove ecosystem 3 4 public health risks although the studied three crab species are small in size living on the mangrove sediments they might be consumed as seafood by humans thus it is necessary to discuss some health risk issues potential human health risk assessment was conducted by calculating the estimated daily intake edi and target hazard quotient thq edi for each metal was calculated in the following way edi c f ir w ab where edi is the

0 1 with higher ones observed for m japonicus table 7 while great thq values for cd especially by consumption of m japonicus should not be ignored both the edi and thq values suggested that the consumption of m japonicus might pose health risks to adults total thq tthq calculated by summing thq value of individual metal could be used to investigate the cumulative health risk results of tthq revealed that adults might have significant potential health risk by consuming the three mangrove crab species considering the whole body of the crabs might be ingested by humans the edi and thq for heavy metals might be elevated on the other hand those native crabs should also be well protected as well as the mangrove forest thus the mangrove crabs in qi ao island were not recommended for consumption 4 conclusions in this paper copper zinc manganese cadmium and chromium were determined in the crabs and their associated sediments spatial differences of the concentrations of the heavy metals were found in the sediments the concentrations of cu zn and mn were found to be at relatively high levels comparing with those reported in mangrove sediments from other locations for the crabs differences were found in terms of tissues and species both in the degree of accumulation of particulate metals and the tissues in which they were most abundant all the three crab species had higher biota sediment accumulation factors for cd mangrove crabs could be considered as good tools for the monitoring of the heavy metal pollution in their habitats results of edi and thq suggested the

20083,mangrove wetlands are under increasing pollution pressure from human activities due to rapid industrialization and urbanization of coastal regions many pollutants such as heavy metals may be accumulated via food chains to hazardous levels which will thus bring potential health issues to humans in the present study three species of crabs sesarma dehaani sesarma plicata macrophthalmus japonicus and associated sediments from three mangrove habitats with different vegetation were collected from the mangrove wetlands in qi ao island south china to investigate the levels bioaccumulation and dietary exposure of heavy metals including copper cu zinc zn manganese mn cadmium cd and chromium cr metal concentrations in sediment samples were 65 91 212 247 506 1256 0 6 1 3 and 8 8 14 mg kg dry weight for cu zn mn cd and cr respectively the spatial heterogeneity of these metals in mangrove sediments was observed with a descendant order of metal concentrations as mn zn cu cr cd at each site species specific and tissue specific accumulation of metals was also found in mangrove crabs both in the degree of accumulation of particulate metals and the tissues in which they were most abundant all biota sediment accumulation factors bsaf values 1 for cd in each crab species suggested that the native mangrove crabs tended to be good tools for the monitoring of cd pollution in mangrove forests results of the estimated daily intake edi and target hazard quotient thq suggested that consumption of the mangrove crabs in qi ao island might subject local residents to potential health risks as far as the metals are concerned keywords heavy metal sediment crab mangrove wetland qi ao island 1 introduction heavy metals are typical environmental pollutants known for their toxicity bioaccumulation wide range of sources and persistence liu et al 2014 in these years with the development of urbanization and industrialization great amounts of heavy metals have been released into the environment by intensive anthropogenic activities such as mining electroplating industrial discharge pesticide application and so on wei et al 2006 the widespread heavy metal contamination has received great attention due to health issues zheng et al 2007 they can be accumulated by marine organisms through many pathways such as respiration and ingestion liu et al 2017 the benthic crustaceans such as crabs may be sensitive to metal pollution because of their living in the bottom sediments where chemical contaminants are mainly stored to some extent crabs can fulfill the main requirements of bio indicators such as being relatively sedentary easy to identify abundant long lived available for sampling all year round and getting a wide distribution rainbow 1995 which makes crabs suitable as biological indicators for monitoring the pollution status of heavy metals sanders et al 1998 turoczy et al 2001 van oosterom et al 2010 beltrame et al 2011 pinheiro et al 2012 mangrove wetland is a special ecosystem on the coastal areas of the tropical and subtropical regions it is productive with great biodiversity and has varieties of ecological functions such as flood protection salinity buffering carbon nutrients exportation to the coastal zones oceans and so on lewis et al 2011 bayen 2012 on the other hand mangrove is known as a sink to accumulate various kinds of pollutants such as heavy metals petroleum pesticides and so forth zhang et al 2014 so far a certain amount of studies have been carried out focusing on the occurrence transport and fate of heavy metals in mangrove ecosystems around the world zheng and lin 1996 tang et al 2008 liu et al 2014 those data on the sediment and organisms were usually used to indicate the environmental qualities saher and siddiqui 2019 pollution levels of heavy metals in mangrove sediments in different areas have been reviewed zhang et al 2014 the levels and biogeochemical cycles of heavy metals in mangrove plants have previously been reported zheng et al 1995 zheng et al 1996 zheng and lin 1996 however information on bioaccumulation of metals in mangrove fauna seemed to be inadequate and many previous studies mainly focused on the semi native species liu et al 2014 2017 furthermore some studied mangrove biota species might be unsuitable as bio indicators due to their low abundance in the local habitats as mentioned above crabs were good candidates of bio indicators for metal pollution but few of studies using crabs to monitor the metal pollution status of mangrove wetland have been reported silva et al 2018 saher and siddiqui 2019 occurrence bioaccumulation and dietary exposure of heavy metals in mangrove crabs should therefore be comprehensively investigated there are mangrove wetlands distributing in qi ao island zhuhai city which is located in the southwest of pearl river estuary historically there were over 200 ha of mangrove existing in the island but only 32 0 ha natural mangrove remained at dawei bay until 1999 because of the reclamation then efforts on mangrove conservation and restoration have been made and rapid grow type mangrove species i e sonneratia apetala and s caseolaris were introduced the area of mangrove wetland was up to 533 33 ha at dawei bay in 2004 peng et al 2009 the introduction of exotic mangrove plant species may change the macrofauna communities and the native citizens may vary at different swamps tang et al 2012 in addition the pearl river estuary which has been exploited since 1980s is considered to be the second largest polluted estuary area in china and a great deal of toxic metals such as pb cd and cr has been discharged into the pearl river annually fang 2004 various persistent organic pollutants have also been found in the pearl river estuary fung et al 2005 fang 2006 wei et al 2006 in this paper we focus on the bioaccumulation of heavy metals by representative crab species which were the native species and occupied a great mass in associated mangrove swamps two species sesarma dehaani and sesarma plicata are common components of intertidal crab assemblages in the mangroves of the indo pacific region zhang et al 2008 chen et al 2014 these crabs mainly feed on fallen leaves and seeds and their burrowing can affect drainage and soil chemistry of mangrove forests kneib et al 1999 macrophthalmus japonicus one of the most dominant macrobenthic animals in most of the intertidal mud areas usually lives in isolated burrows which are dug in muddy regions of estuaries and feeds on organic matter separated from the surface mud henmi 1992 our objective was to measure the concentrations of heavy metals in the crabs s dehaani s plicata and m japonicus and associated sediments from qi ao island the level of heavy metal contamination will be evaluated and spatial and species differences in heavy metal accumulation will be investigated furthermore health risks of trace metals in edible tissues of these crabs by local persons would be evaluated each crab species captured in the mangrove forest were representative for their holding a great abundance and being widely distributed in their special living environment a mangrove of specific vegetation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas and sampling sampling was conducted in qi ao island mangrove nature reserve of zhuhai guangdong

the crab samples were transferred to the laboratory and frozen at 20 c the three native crab species were small in size and the collected samples were mature three to four individuals were randomly mixed to obtain a composite sample the length and width of the carapace as well as the wet weight of each species were measured and recorded table 1 2 2 sample analysis the sediment samples were frozen dried ground and passed through a 0 5 mm sieve approximate 0 3 g sediment samples were transferred into the digestion vessel then a mixture of 6 ml nitric acid 70 2 ml hydrofluoric 35 and 1 ml

20084,the assessment of resilience for people places and systems to climate change hazards is essential for understanding how to reduce disaster risks globally a number of resilience assessment methodologies have been developed and implemented by a variety of entities including national and local organizations donor agencies and academic researchers in bangladesh although a number of resilience studies have been conducted it has never been determined whether these assessments rightfully addressed conceptual understanding methodological approaches and disciplinary underpinnings and maintained compliance with on going research communications standards to unpack this gap we systematically reviewed 38 articles to characterize how the resilience to climate change of coastal communities in bangladesh is being assessed to operationalize the study we have presented a brief overview of the assessment tools and then applied an analytical framework containing six criteria comprehensiveness of dimensions scalar relationships temporal dynamism addressing uncertainties of climate change by modeling and scenario making participatory approaches and action plans the overview analysis shows diverse traditions of methodological underpinnings and reveals authors often incomplete conceptual understandings of resilience results of the review analysis reveal extensive inadequacy regarding multiple dimensionality scalar and temporal scales and more importantly addressing the uncertainty of climate change in relation to comprehensiveness current literature has failed to consistently comply with global research communication in regard to the criteria of institutional and infrastructural dimensions more attention needs to be placed on temporal and scalar dynamics most importantly the uncertainty issue is virtually overlooked in the literature and iterative processes and the development of alternate states of planning through scenario analysis are also critical for risk reduction and adaptation to climate change impacts substantial emphasis should be given to include all possible stakeholders in the planning and implementation of any climate change adaptation or mitigation program keywords bangladesh climate change resilience assessments measurement criteria systematic literature review 1 introduction resilience assessments ras have emerged as an important way of understanding human responses to disasters in order to reduce the subsequent negative effects through better preparation thereby enabling a population to withstand and adapt to a wide range of future disasters both natural and man made burton 2014 development and implementation of resilience assessment tools helps obtain benchmark information on the resilience status of a community compared to peer communities and best practice standards furthermore these tools can initiate interpersonal communication and afford a platform for acquiring and sharing resilience knowledge among communities arbon et al 2012 barkham et al 2014 as awareness has grown about the significance of resilience assessments scholars from diverse fields including socio economists engineers geographers and most recently urban and regional planners have joined together to work on these assessments consequently since the first conceptualization of this new approach to hazards management a consensus has been built among hazards scholars in understanding how resilience can be measured and operationalized as a preliminary step toward disaster response in order to address the existing and awaiting challenges that nations states cities communities and individuals confronted due to climate change scientists are increasingly being interested in using the resilience ideas in environmental risk and impact assessment summers et al 2017 angeler et al 2018 kakenmaster 2018 over the last four decades the notion of resilience has become a commonplace as a frontier concept in health engineering social ecological and spatial sciences cutter 2016 as a result numerous definitions of resilience has been suggested and argued in each science for example in the field of climate change and disaster resilience is defined as the ability of a system community or society exposed to hazards to resist absorb accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner unisdr 2009 similarly the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc defines resilience as the ability of human communities to anticipate absorb accommodate and recover from the effects of disturbances ipcc 2012 to date however the integration across the disciplines has lagged which is noticeable in the case of the community resilience thinking mainly when a community is considered as an interconnected system cutter 2016 resilience assessment studies generally adopt one of five different methods or some combination of several of these methods for determining the extent of compliance with resilience criteria these five methods are assessment against baseline assessment against threshold assessment against principles of good resilience assessment against peers benchmarking and assessment based on recovery speed pringle 2011 fox lent et al 2015 based on the overall format of the methods being used in the resilience assessment process four major approaches can be distinguished scorecard index model and toolkit as described by cutter 2016 for a comprehensive assessment of resilience a combination of all four formats would actually be most effective sharifi 2016 with the unprecedented rate of climate change resilience building has been getting widespread emphasis including in the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 a consensus has been developed among global research scholars that a robust tool in the process of resilience assessment should cover multiple dimensions of community resilience environmental social economic infrastructural and institutional cimellaro et al 2016 resilience is a multi scalar phenomenon and variations at one scale may affect other scales hence it is not realistic to assess resilience without addressing the upper and lower scales in the hierarchy moreover since a community is an open system and built within a hierarchy of spatial scales its resilience might prejudiced by dynamic interactions between different scales frankenberger et al 2013 constas et al 2014 quinlan et al 2015 chelleri et al 2015 addressing temporal changes and uncertainty of climate change by taking into account the past trajectories of climate disaster and anticipating of future changes along with system dynamics are important understanding in resilience assessment walker and salt 2012 in the literature emphasis has been given to consider evolutionary strategies folke et al 2010 collier et al 2013 levine 2014 watson et al 2014 schipper and langston 2015 such as an iterative process that involves monitoring performance and updating the baseline conditions and future targets for effectively addressing the uncertainty issues of climate change pringle 2011 moreover the development of future scenarios for ensuring better adaptation to more stressful conditions would be an effective strategy in resilience assessment frankenberger et al 2013 mcleod et al 2015 being a normative concept resilience research should involve participatory approaches to gather knowledge from a diverse range of stakeholder sharifi and yamagata 2016 indeed there has been an increasing global shift in the literature toward using plural methodologies i e participatory approaches for enhancing community resilience norris et al 2008 using participatory approaches that involve a wide range of possible stakeholders throughout the assessment process both development and implementation improves local understanding of risk and resilience provides capacity building benefits and creates a platform for knowledge and experience sharing frankenberger et al 2013 pfefferbaum et al 2014 tyler et al 2014 furthermore it can be of help in making decisions about trade offs and enhancing local ownership and legitimacy which in turn could better implement the decisions gibson 2006 pasteur 2011 furthermore the success of any assessment may depend on proper dissemination of its result to the targeted community of interest likewise potential interventions should be identified and prioritized on the basis of need and there should be a definite action plan illustrating the road map pfefferbaum et al 2012 schwind 2009 to transform a community into one more resilient than ever before bangladesh is becoming one of the most vulnerable countries in the world facing a wide range of disaster events as a result of global climate change the coastal region of bangladesh is the home of about 40 million people where natural resource based livelihoods such as agriculture are predominant lázár et al 2015 therefore the coastal regions of the country are more affected than any other area these experience various natural and human made disaster events sea level rise cyclones storm surges floods drought salinity intrusion river bank erosion and landslides chowdhury et al 2012 lázár et al 2015 nasim et al 2019 in almost every year during the past decades this region witnessed multiple disaster events that cause enormous loss and damages to human lives livelihoods well being and create uncertainty of food insecurity bbs 2016 lázár et al 2015 nasim et al 2019 resilience assessment has been carried out in bangladesh at various scales by various actors with various goals against various hazards however there has been limited interrogation on whether the methodology used in these resilience assessments has evolved along with evolving definitions of resilience in this study we begin with a short review of how the concept of resilience has evolved in global research and within bangladesh then we try to identify the span of methodologies used to assess climate resilience in the coastal regions of bangladesh the specific goals of this study were i to explore the conceptual understanding of resilience in the selected literature and ii to discover gaps in current methodologies in order to maintain compliance with global research communication standards and to address the threats of future climate change 2 methodology 2 1 conceptualization and operationalization of resilience resilience is a normative concept as the origin of its application is contested and often argued to be rooted in different disciplines sharifi and yamagata 2016 moser 2008 bodin and wiman 2004 the term resilience has emerged as ancient thinking and initially developed in physics and psychology discipline sharifi and yamagata 2016 bodin and wiman 2004 it was then introduced in the field of ecology through a series of studies conducted by authors like holling 1961 rosenzweig 1971 moser 2008 and norris et al 2008 over the last four decades the resilience approach has been used by a myriad of ways in different fields and disciplines adopted for their needs and priorities leading to multiple definitions of the concepts regardless of its origin a list of resilience definitions has presented in table s1 that demonstrates the evolution of the notion and diversity with which the concept has been defined in the field of psychology resilience refers to the process outcome or capacity of individual or community to resist recover and return to its equilibrium state after being affected by external stressors norris et al 2008 pfefferbaum et al 2005 the engineering ecological and socio ecological adaptive resilience are the three significant resilience approaches extensively being found in the ongoing scholarships sharifi and yamagata 2016 the engineering approach of resilience reveals the system s physical resistance against a shock and also its ability to rapidly return to an equilibrium state whenever it exceeds the threshold level norris et al 2008 bodin and wiman 2004 the ecological approach to resilience admits the uncertainty of climatic shocks it advocates enhancing the tolerance capacity of the system and prioritizes the needs of a system s flexibility to shift to a new equilibrium state s for retaining its pre disaster functionality even after an extreme shock event sharifi and yamagata 2016 holling 1973 however the adaptive approach to resilience recognizes systems as the dynamic socio ecological entity that regularly transforms gunderson and folke 2005 adger et al 2005 therefore the system may sometimes fail to return in its equilibrium state and follows vulnerability pathways after exposure to a disruptive event in contrary the integrity of the system its self organizational capacity and learning from the past experience are some of the drivers that enhance the system s adaptive capacity and enables not only to bounce back from the shocks but also push forward to a more desired state it was ever before sharifi and yamagata 2016 resilience alliance 2012 gunderson and folke 2005 adger et al 2005 during the past decade the concept of resilience has got widespread attention in the field of disaster risk management drm as a result of the initiation of hyogo framework for action 2005 2015 building resilience of nations and communities to disasters by united nations international strategy for disaster reduction unisdr 2007 in the field of drm resilience is most commonly expressed as the capacity of a society to bounce back cope withstand resist and recover rapidly from the impacts of hazard events ostadtaghizadeh et al 2015 turnbull et al 2013 ipcc 2012 ra studies table s2 in the coastal region of bangladesh was started in 2010 with the health sector and it was then gradually introduced to engineering ecology and socio ecological discipline for example agricultural scientists have conducted farming based resilience assessments in the face of climatic hazards rahman 2012 kais and islam 2017 social scientists have focused on social capital islam and walkerden 2014 hassan et al 2013 scholars with engineering background have focused on infrastructural resilience sameen 2018 ali et al 2018 moles et al 2014 mallick 2013 and some others have focused on policy and institutional resilience islam et al 2017 however almost one decade of resilience studies revealed that social aspects i e social capital had received more priority by the authors who assessed resilience however the higher level of exposure to climate change induced disasters and comparatively low adaptive capacity by the coastal communities of bangladesh lázár et al 2015 necessitates a comprehensive assessment of disaster resilience as proposed by ipcc and unsidr hence authors take the disaster resilience concept for coastal bangladesh as the ability of individuals households and communities in a complex socio ecological system to anticipate resist absorb accommodate and recover from the effect of climate change erratic rainfall inundation flood cyclone drought erosion etc through suitable adaptive and transformative practices without disturbing ecological and environmental systems the linkages between disaster resilience and environmental systems fig 1 entail a comprehensive depiction of the extent of hazards vulnerability adaptive capacity and resilience that reflects the exposure of an environmental system to natural hazards cutter et al 2008 the degree of impacts after a hazardous event depends on the existing coping responses of the system place or community being exposed if the exposed system can minimize the sensitivity and absorb the shocks it can recover to its initial stage very quickly and follow resilience pathways by contrast if a system shows higher sensitivity and can t absorb the shocks then it requires adaptation intervention to recover to its equilibrium stage however in some cases the system never can bounce back to its equilibrium stage even after interventions are taken and it follows vulnerability pathways hence it can be generalized that resilient systems or communities are less vulnerable to natural disasters than non resilient systems furthermore resilience and vulnerability are inversely proportionate i e higher the vulnerability of a system or community the lower will be the resilience and vice versa 2 2 systematic literature reviews systematic literature review slr is a rigorous transparent and replicable form of literature review process ford et al 2011 delaney et al 2014 that involves identifying synthesizing assessing and interpreting available evidence kitchenham 2004 dixon woods et al 2006 ford and pearce 2010 ford et al 2011 in order to generate a robust and empirically derived answer to an exhaustive research inquiry okoli and schabram 2010 a clearly formulated research question and well defined inclusion and exclusion criteria in an slr process can minimize opaqueness and enable replication having these strengths slr is considered a more robust process than a traditional literature review ford et al 2011 yet even though slr is stronger than a standard literature review it encounters some practical problems throughout its entire process especially in the searching screening and synthesis stages okoli and schabram 2010 slr requires to access in a wide range of databases peer review journals and institutional reports for inclusive review results however access to a wide range of databases and peer review journals may be problematic for non academic researchers and those from low income countries moreover access to selected institutions undermines the objectivity of the review process mallett et al 2012 the slr process adopts inclusion and exclusion criteria for achieving objectivity in screening potential literature which inevitably involves subjectivity especially when more number of researcher engaged in the screening process and their differential interpretation of inclusion and exclusion criteria mallett et al 2012 synthesis of information from the relevant literature also involves a certain degree of biases because of depending on the authors self proclaimed research methods and findings this limitation could be overcome by involving respective authors in the review process which in reality not feasible for resource constraints mallett et al 2012 slr is increasingly being used in climate change research especially in vulnerability and risk analysis to make sense of resilience research that originates from multiple disciplines each with its own set of conceptualization and methodological approaches we chose slr because it is well suited to help clarify and stabilize different conceptualizations of resilience and to identify methodological differences that are not otherwise apparent delaney et al 2014 in this study we had access to a wide range of databases and peer review journals supported by the chinese academy of sciences china to overcome the constraints of institutional information collection the authors communicated with different organizations and ministries of the bangladesh government and relevant ngos working in the same discipline cross checking of the screened literature and extracted information was done by multiple authors to attain objectivity in screening the potential studies and data synthesis process repetition of the assessment was done wherever any dissimilarity was found 2 3 data selection and review process a systematic literature review was conducted to analyze the current ra studies on climate disasters context the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analyses prisma method was used to select ra studies for detailed review as shown in fig 2 prisma approach consists of four steps such as identification screening eligibility and inclusion saja et al 2019 which has explained below step1 identification stage the key search terms resilience and climate change and bangladesh in title abstract and keywords were used to identify potential publications on ra the peer review publications were selected through isi web of science and google scholar whereas the grey literature was selected through the google search engine and direct access to institutional websites ra studies with no start date and a cut off publication date of june 2018 initially resulted in 169 publications step 2 screening stage in this stage initially selected publications were screened by removing duplication and narrowing search terms following inclusion and exclusion criteria presented in table 1 consequently 72 relevant publications were selected step 3 eligibility check in this step the selected screened publications were further checked for eligibility to be included in the review analysis following inclusion and exclusion criteria explained in table 1 subsequently 44 publications were found eligible for review analysis step 4 inclusion in this step the eligible publications with full text accessibility were included for critical review finally 38 full text literature table s2 consisting of peer review article 24 book chapter 2 conference proceedings 4 thesis 5 and working paper 3 were included for data extraction 2 4 assessment framework while several frameworks ostadtaghizadeh et al 2015 cutter 2016 sharifi 2016 asadzadeh et al 2017 are available in the literature for investigating resilience assessment tools those of sharifi 2016 and cutter 2016 have received more attention in the global research community in this study we followed the frameworks fig 3 of sharifi 2016 who suggests that a resilience assessment tool should comprehensively address multiple dimensions of community resilience take into account the connections between different spatial scales be able to measure changes across temporal scales develop suitable measures for capturing uncertainties be developed and implemented in collaboration with stakeholders and lead to development of action plans for enhancing resilience to investigate the level of compliance with these typical characteristics an extensive literature review was conducted to extract important criteria related to community resilience as was done by sharifi and murayama 2015 an initial list of criteria was developed and grouped into five categories viz environmental social economic infrastructural and institutional as was done by sharifi 2016 the list was then compared with the criteria used in the selected ra studies and any inadequacies determined in the indicators for the dimensions then selected literature were checked to find out whether they had accounted for interrelationships between upper and lower hierarchies within the community or systems and whether they considered the continuum of past current and future both iterative processes and scenario analyses were considered to ensure that uncertainty issues had been well addressed in the literature the methodology section of the literature was carefully checked to ensure that the tool had been developed and implemented through participatory approaches like fgd focus group discussion kii key informant s interview or other methods since formulating policy recommendations has become a common tradition in scientific publishing the abstract discussion policy recommendation and conclusion sections were carefully checked to ensure that action plans had been incorporated a detailed data coding plan table s3 has been developed and used to extract and input the information in a spss database 3 results of the review assessment 3 1 conceptualization of resilience to explore the breadth of conceptual frameworks used ras studies were coded in to six categories such as i ability to absorb recover and retain from a disturbance ii food security and livelihood iii adaptation capacity to hazard iv reduction or erosion of vulnerability to climate disaster v others or combination of the above and vi unclear table s3 this categorization was done based on the construct that defines how resilience was defined or explained by the authors the analysis was conducted because several ra studies didn t explicitly report constructs of resilience wherever there was no precise definition or conceptualization of resilience this was coded as unclear or not explicit which in itself is a significant finding such ras may not help in replicating research because it is quite impossible to conclude the validity or utility of literature that had shallow reporting delaney et al 2014 although resilience has been defined in diverse ways by scholars from a wide range of disciplines ipcc s 2012 definition is being widely accepted in the global community yet of the ras only a single study akter and mallick 2013 used the ipcc s latest definition of resilience however some studies used an earlier definition from ipcc s fourth assessment report ipcc 2007 one possible reason behind the lower number of studies being focused on the latest ipcc definition might be the distinctive lag time between conceptual developments and publication in peer reviewed literature in almost 45 of the articles fig 4 resilience is not clearly defined which is a matter of concern how could assessments be possible without a clear definition of what resilience is in 26 of the studies resilience was conceptualized as the ability to absorb recover from and retain stability after a disturbance mainly those disturbances caused by natural disasters and climatic stresses whereas 13 of the studies focused on adaptation capacity similarly resilience as reduction of vulnerability was reported in 8 of the studies on the other hand resilience as food security and livelihood improvement was reported in only 5 of the articles one possible reason for these inconsistencies might be that we explicitly looked for resilience studies not poverty or development related research 3 2 methods and approaches used in the selected ra studies in addition to the selected six criteria in assessment framework a general investigation has been done to see the type of risk hazard disaster addressed methods and tools being used in ras to reveal the assessment strategy overall format and style of presentation of findings tables 2 s4 whether or not we focus on resilience to climate change the question of how we characterize the specific shocks and stresses that could threaten the community population at multiple spatial or temporal scales across systems is an important issue to be considered of the ras more than 90 of the studies focused on climatic shocks and stresses and of these 76 3 focused on cyclones whereas 26 3 23 7 and 21 1 of the studies focused on salinity storm surges and floods respectively table 2 and fig s1 the predominance of studies focused on cyclones might be because the coastal area of bangladesh is a hotspot of cyclone activity where each year one or more cyclonic events have occurred causing enormous loss and damage to the targeted community the household was the most commonly used unit for assessing resilience in the selected studies table 2 and fig s2 very few studies were conducted at the community state or city level showing that the geographic dynamics of resilience were undermined in the previous studies however being an intermediate unit of assessment district or city level resilience assessments could reflect dynamics at both wider and smaller scales o brien et al 2004 the reason behind the limited number of resilience studies at the district or city level might be limited access to the required data in the context of bangladesh before 2011 or even early 2012 the availability of biophysical and socio economic data at the community level was practically nil or at least not satisfactory as can be seen from table 2 and fig s3 assessments against baseline conditions assessments against principles of good resilience and benchmarking were the most common methods adopted by the selected ra studies as shown in table 2 the selected ras relied on both secondary and primary data collections to conduct resilience assessments secondary data has been collected from different sources like census data historical records and statistics provided by national local departments and non profit organizations on the other hand household surveys fgds and key informant s interviews were the most frequently used techniques of primary data collection both qualitative and quantitative methods were adopted by a majority of the selected ra studies table 2 where quantitative methods used numerical data and qualitative methods included accounts of local peoples perception and experts opinions qualitative methods are important where there is limited data whereas quantitative methods can better address the concerns of subjectivity sharifi 2016 since resilience is a value laden concept and influenced by perceptions preferences and attitudes within the community qualitative assessment is needed for better understanding of the needs vulnerabilities coping capacities and opinions of local people to ensure better resilience capacity jones and tanner 2015 olazabal and pascual 2016 as shown in table 2 and fig s4 among the ra studies scorecards 63 2 were found most frequently followed by toolkit 15 8 index 13 2 and model 7 9 methods results table 4 and fig s5 show that selected resilience assessment studies followed distinct styles to present their results illustration techniques have been addressed well in most of the studies but comparatively fewer studies have addressed strengths and weaknesses however much less attention has been paid to addressing ongoing communications and changing patterns of the resilience status over different time horizons 3 3 evaluation against the framework 3 3 1 comprehensiveness of the resilience criteria incorporating multiple dimensions and aspects in a unifying framework has been emphasized in earlier investigations of the resilience assessment process hence following a thorough review process criteria used in the selected resilience studies were identified and grouped into five common dimensions environmental social economic built environment and infrastructure and institutional as has been done by other scholars alshehri et al 2014 cutter 2016 sharifi 2016 information presented in table 3 and fig 5 shows that a majority of the resilience assessment studies were broad and incorporated multiple dimensions but that only a few of them covered all five dimensions a considerable number of studies relied on a single dimension of resilience a major drawback of the assessments on average the social dimension got maximum attention followed by economic infrastructural institutional and environmental dimensions however it is evident that the environmental dimension has received much less attention in the current resilience studies fig 6 despite its significant role in building resilience earlier evidence has indicated that efficient management of natural resources protection of ecosystems and availability of natural assets can enhance shock absorption capacity and ensure quick recovery from losses cutter et al 2008 hughes et al 2013 burton 2014 hence the minimal inclusion of environmental dimensions in the resilience assessment studies especially in a country like bangladesh which is recognized as among the countries most vulnerable to experiencing negative consequences of natural hazards can significantly undermine the resilience of the coastal people further the impressive achievement in reducing disaster risks by holistic efforts from government organizations ngos other multilateral supporting agencies has not been properly reflected in the selected resilience assessment studies in order to see the level of compliance with the globally used resilience dimensions the findings of this study on resilience criteria were compared with the findings of sharifi 2016 which included 36 community resilience assessment tools developed and implemented globally the spider diagram fig 6 shows that a similar level of attention has been given between resilience studies of bangladesh bd and those of the rest of the world global in terms of economic infrastructural and environmental dimensions but wide variations were evident in institutional and social dimensions of the ra studies in the coastal region of bangladesh institutional criteria got comparatively less attention than globally conducted assessment processes that argued that despite many ngos donor agencies and multilateral organizations being involved in coastal rehabilitation and livelihood projects their role was not properly investigated however integrating multiple agents and forces can better influence any efforts toward boosting community resilience sharifi 2016 3 3 2 cross scale relationships resilience is a multi scalar concept and changes at one scale may affect the other scales hence it is unrealistic to assess resilience of a community in isolation from the upper and lower scales in the hierarchy each community is an open system nested within a hierarchy of spatial scales and its resilience is influenced by dynamic relationships and dependencies that may exist between different scales frankenberger et al 2013 constas et al 2014 chelleri et al 2015 quinlan et al 2015 as shown in table 4 and fig s5 the notion of cross scalar relationships and panarchy of scales was mostly overlooked in the selected studies only eight studies considered dynamic hierarchical systems of scale however emphasis should have been given to understanding how resilience intervention affects or is affected by actions processes dynamics and interventions compared to other scales of measurement alliance 2007 davis et al 2013 frankenberger et al 2013 the landscape focus of most of the ra studies 57 9 spanned rural areas 34 2 of the articles spanned multiple landscapes and only 7 9 of the studies spanned urban landscapes fig s6 in the context of bangladesh it is perceived that rural peoples are more disadvantaged as they live on the periphery and are more exposed to natural hazards and more vulnerable than any other group perceptions that have led researchers from diverse disciplines to conduct their studies in rural areas moreover evidence has shown that multilateral agencies and ngos are more focused on rural areas sdc 2009 practical action 2009 giz 2014 however none of the studies focused on peri urban areas possibly because the term peri urban is difficult to conceptualize especially from the perspective of bangladesh among the 38 resilience assessment studies examined a majority were spread across exposed coastal regions fig 7 with the highest number in the southwestern region the interior coastal region and the central region had the lowest representations that most of the ras were conducted in the exposed coastal regions with significantly fewer in interior regions indicates a skewed focus on areas that are vulnerable to multiple hazards cyclones slr salinity intrusions 3 3 3 temporal dynamism the significance of a temporal continuum in resilience assessment is well recognized norris et al 2008 and usually every stage of resilience measurement should intractably link to what precedes and what succeeds it sharifi 2016 yet our findings revealed that only 8 of the studies took all phases of the temporal continuum into consideration although 42 accounted for past and present conditions table 4 fig s7 the majority 47 of the studies focused on only the present conditions and usually overlooked the evolutionary and emergent nature of resilience hence their output simply reflects a snapshot in time view of resilience schipper and langston 2015 and almost no studies accounted for the present and future portions of the continuum only ahmed et al 2016 included this perspective 3 3 4 uncertainties setting long term goals for resilience becomes a very challenging task due to uncertainties in climate models which are constantly shifting their adaptation thresholds to address this problem an evolutionary process is required to predict climate scenarios keeping in mind that resilience is an emergent feature of multifaceted adaptive socio ecological systems folke et al 2010 collier et al 2013 watson et al 2014 schipper and langston 2015 levine 2014 the compliance of addressing uncertainty in the selected resilience studies was evaluated by the presence or absence of an iterative approach and scenario development uncertainty in the decision making process can be minimized through a continuous and iterative process sharifi 2016 whereas future challenges can be addressed through planning severity scenarios unisdr 2014 moreover scenario making along with perfect elaboration of alternate states can enhance the performance of the communities in the event of disaster and enable them to understand their strengths and weaknesses monaghan et al 2014 findings revealed that almost 90 of the ra studies paid attention to conducting assessments at regular intervals table 4 and fig s8 they did this through measures such as regular monitoring and continuous update of baselines and threshold values sharifuzzaman et al 2018 islam and walkerden 2014 ayeb karlsson et al 2016 islam and walkerden 2015 ray bennett et al 2016 of the ra studies only one paid attention to scenario making and modeling alternate states to determine how the bcr benefit cost ratio of v2r vulnerability to resilience programs can shift when critical thresholds are crossed ahmed et al 2016 3 3 5 participatory approaches the adoption of participatory approaches in the development and implementation of resilience assessment is important to emphasize because of its multiple benefits as shown in table 4 and fig s9 only about 8 of the selected resilience studies followed participatory methods in the development of assessment tools whereas 55 of the studies followed different participatory methods to ensure multiple stakeholder participation in the assessment process however emphasis should have been given for adopting participatory approaches in all stages of measurement from the development of tools to using the tools identifying priorities and also developing action plans based on the assessment results sharifi 2016 participatory approaches like focus group discussion fgd was more frequently used in the selected resilience studies however few studies adopted multiple participatory approaches like fgd social mapping resource mapping venn diagrams institutional relations through mapping or climate hazards mapping in their assessment process akter 2015 local peoples experience and know how has sometimes been incorporated though through the active participation of community people in developing resilient housing and critical infrastructure ali et al 2018 sameen 2018 mallick 2013 moles et al 2014 3 3 6 action plan one of the most important purposes of resilience assessment is to enable communities to identify gaps and to prioritize concerns also in order to ascertain leverage points for intervention and remedial action sharifi 2016 findings revealed that in about 87 of the resilience studies attention was paid to developing action plans for enhancing resilience table 4 and fig s10 although policy formulation in scientific articles is common in this research a number of the ra studies explicitly stated that their findings were intended to enhance the effectiveness of resilience building capacity and adaptation planning e g sameen 2018 akter and mallick 2013 islam and walkerden 2015 hassan et al 2013 rahman 2012 yu et al 2017 ahsan and takeuchi 2015 al maruf 2017 adopted the technique of identifying the influencing factors of community resilience and suggested including them as a basis for an action plan on the other hand limitations in the local governments and ngos services were identified and specific strategies were suggested to overcome these constraints islam et al 2017 islam and walkerden 2015 furthermore local peoples experiences and lessons were considered ali et al 2018 sameen 2018 mallick 2013 moles et al 2014 in developing adaptive housing and critical infrastructures that can be included in the action plan for strengthening the resilience capacity of coastal communities 3 4 implications of assessment tools on findings and research gaps through qualitative investigation of the findings discussion and conclusion sections efforts were made to examine whether the resilience assessment exercise expected to further the conceptual understanding of resilience the methodological features of assessing resilience policy formulation or practice after carefully analyzing all the articles we arrived at several categories of resilience assessment studies first a considerable number of ra studies focused on identifying the drivers of resilience e g rahman and li 2018 islam et al 2017 ahsan and takeuchi 2015 some studies contributed to further methodological development for assessing resilience for example ayeb karlsson et al 2016 developed a resilience building approach called people centered approach whereas mallick 2013 used a participatory planning approach for increasing the capacity of community for building resilient houses studies using models such as yu et al 2017 successfully incorporated institutions and collective actions with a socio hydrological model for flood resilience assessment furthermore some of the ra studies focused on categorizing who is more resilient by comparing different social structures e g gendered resilience by sameen 2018 and caste driven resilience by ali et al 2018 other studies focused on specific places community groups or ecological systems like kais and islam 2017 who conducted a study on a fisheries community finally some ra studies discussed the implications of their findings on further resilience conceptualization and used other framings to understand resilience for example everyday health security practices as disaster resilience an approach taken by ray bennett et al 2016 and matin and taylor 2015 integrated socio ecological and behavioral theories to address community resilience efforts have also been made to identify the gaps in current resilience research in bangladesh first environmental and institutional dimensions of resilience assessment received less attention than other dimensions in the selected ra studies in this connection global research communication incorporated criteria like erosion protection protection of wetlands and watersheds availability and access to natural resources reduction of pollution quality of resources and resource recycling sharifi 2016 which has not yet reflected in the current literature besides information on the policies plans projects and programs of multilateral governmental bodies along with those of ngos donor agencies and multi national companies should be incorporated to strengthen the institutional dimension secondly most of the ra studies measured resilience at one specific time after a disaster event with no attention to temporal resilience or past trajectories of change thirdly most of the ras were conducted at the household scale and seldom was emphasis given toward any higher order scale moreover multi scalar assessments of resilience were not well emphasized in any of the current ra studies furthermore a considerable number of ra studies did not involve participation of all categories of stakeholders in the development and assessment process finally uncertainty issues of resilience assessment were totally overlooked in the selected ra studies 4 discussion with advancing global climate change the increasing needs for resilience assessment tools has resulted in widespread popularity for these assessments by the global research community over the past few decades and a growing number of tools have been developed and implemented worldwide further there is a growing recognition of the need for content analysis of resilience assessment tools in order to improve resilience capacity but no such content analysis study has yet been carried out on the resilience assessment studies being conducted in the coastal regions of bangladesh in response to this need 38 selected ra studies were critically examined in this evaluation this review highlights the importance of conceptual understanding of resilience by the authors addressing of multiple dimensions of resilience taking account of cross scale relationships capturing temporal dynamism addressing uncertainties employing participatory approaches and developing action plans this paper affords the first comprehensive review of ra tools for the coastal regions of bangladesh having examined the conceptual and methodological extensiveness of these studies 4 1 conceptualization of resilience the findings demonstrate that in the coastal region of bangladesh resilience is conceptualized in multiple ways where a number of ras constructed in the field of food security poverty reduction and livelihoods as their core theoretical lineages we strongly argue that accepted conceptualizations of resilience are predisposed to certain methodological approaches an assumption that has implications for identifying who is resilient and how they become resilient however surprisingly the majority of the selected studies failed to include any definition of resilience in their assessment process such vagueness in the field of resilience assessment could hinder the effectiveness of resource allocation and the efficiency of mitigation and adaption practices at the local level a neglect that can reduce the resilience capacity of the communities berke and godschalk 2009 frazier et al 2013 4 2 addressing resilience to what although resilience assessment has been conducted against many different hazards cyclones are the entity that has received the most emphasis however resilience against one type of hazard does not guarantee resilience against other types of hazards frankenberger et al 2013 especially for the coastal region of bangladesh which are highly exposed to different types of climate disasters and environmental problems such sea level rise salinity intrusion flood erosion and arsenic contamination therefore communities should have plans for responding to multiple types of hazards further research should be conducted using a unified framework to see whether there are any trade offs among multiple hazard types moreover more attention should be given to selecting specific indicators instead of an overly generalized approach that might fail to reflect any hazard specific issues sharifi 2016 4 3 addressing comprehensive dimensions in ras in terms of dimensionality of the resilience criteria the selected ra studies were most inclined to address social capital i e society and wellbeing in measuring resilience capacity environmental and institutional dimensions also need to be addressed however and more attention should be focused on these criteria hence erosion protection protection of wetlands and watersheds availability and access to natural resources reduction of pollution quality of resources and resource recycling are some of the environmental criteria currently being recognized in the global scholarships to reflect environmental dimensions of resilience moreover information on the policies plans projects and programs of multilateral governmental bodies along with those of ngos donor agencies and multi national companies should be incorporated to strengthen the institutional dimension 4 4 scalar issues spatiality and temporality in ras an important finding of the study is that ras in the coastal parts of bangladesh have failed to conclusively reveal the dynamic nature of resilience by focusing on the interface of forces act over various geographic and temporal scales in most of the ras resilience was assessed as a snapshot thus rendering an inherently dynamic concept static such a static view of resilience tends to ignore the highly dynamic nature of the system in which people are situated in a country like bangladesh where government service terms usually five years have a strong influence on planning and resource allocation there are direct repercussions on peoples coping and adaptation behaviors moreover rapid urbanization is on the verge of dissolving traditional rural urban binaries thereby changing the very context within which current ras are conducted the failure of ras to address and assess resilience as something changing over time is a major limitation of the ras that have been conducted in the coastal areas of bangladesh because comparing baseline conditions with those recorded before a disruptive event provides information on the context in which past intervention measures have been effective in absorbing the shocks as well as on the extent of recovery following the event furthermore changing climatic conditions make it difficult to create resilience communities by referring only to past and existing conditions it is also necessary to understand system dynamics and develop strategies for anticipating future changes walker and salt 2012 4 5 addressing uncertainty of climate change in ras whenever thinking about any climate model or framework the first and foremost question comes forward in a discussion is how uncertainty issues being considered in this connection the climate researchers suggested adopting an iterative process through the assessing of alternative states and extreme scenario analysis for addressing future uncertainty in resilience research however selected ra literature have failed in effectively applying these strategies to address the uncertainty issue in particular there has been negligible assimilation of scenario making in the ras process hence a meaningful strategy for enhancing adaptive capacity and improving ras would be to adopt an iterative assessment and recognize that communities need to be adequately aware and flexible to accommodate the impacts of different severe future scenarios sharifi and yamagata 2016 4 6 employing participatory approaches in ras participation of all possible stakeholders needs to be emphasized by global research scholars in order to enhance community resilience capacity norris et al 2008 a participatory approach which is open and engages a wide range of stakeholders in the decision making process can provide multiple benefits sharifi 2016 moreover if participatory approaches can be effectively used in the development and implementation process it will improve local peoples understanding of risk and resilience provide capacity building aids and afford a platform for sharing knowledge and experiences frankenberger et al 2013 pfefferbaum et al 2014 tyler et al 2014 pfefferbaum et al 2011 suggested bottom up approaches where assessment surveys should be conducted before and after an intervention to determine the impact points a similar approach was conducted by ahmed et al 2016 to gather information on non monetary benefits from project interventions using the fgd method cutter 2016 claims that a bottom up approach is better for reflecting community needs and priorities whereas the top down method is suitable for standardizing and making comparisons across different scales due to its data variability and contextual differences hence the decision to select appropriate methods largely depends on the purpose of the assessment and no doubt in some cases a combination of both methods can be recommended realizing the needs of an iterative process and the limitations of dependence on bottom up strategies for community inputs a substantial amount of time and resources is required to reach a consensus on the best method for any particular study usiotwsp 2007 tyler et al 2014 sharifi 2016 it has also been suggested glandon 2015 that long term project initiatives and sufficient resource allocation by the investors and funding agencies can ensure more participation of multiple stakeholders 5 conclusion resilience assessment studies in bangladesh have been inadequate in number considering the challenges of coping with the threats of global climate change in this small deltaic and highly populous country furthermore the authors incomplete conceptual understanding of resilience is a matter of great concern casting doubt upon the usefulness of their conclusions for improving resilience building capacity hence developing countries like bangladesh need to conduct more resilience studies keeping pace with the developed economies although the majority of the ra studies have been broad in scope and have addressed multiple dimensions they have failed to incorporate adequate criteria for complying with global trends especially in regard to the infrastructural and institutional dimensions like the ongoing research trend resilience assessment in bangladesh has also failed to incorporate an adequate number of criteria to reflect the environmental dimension further attention is therefore required to ensure optimal integration of criteria under these three dimensions current ra studies have also failed to adequately reflect the dynamic nature of resilience by addressing the interaction of forces operating over various geographic and temporal scales hence developing methodologies to address dynamic conditions through modeling and projection is another area requiring further work furthermore uncertainty issues of resilience assessment have been totally overlooked in the selected ra studies which indicate the necessity of further studies based on a projection of climate change hazards by modeling and scenario analysis to address the future climate change to this end assessment should be conducted through an iterative process and should acknowledge that communities need to be flexible enough to accommodate the impacts of different types of severe scenarios long term project initiatives and sufficient resource allocation by the government along with other investors and funding agencies can ensure more participation of multiple stakeholders and minimize data limitations besides the criticism of being resource intensiveness a flexible and coding iterative analytical template that we used in slr may seem to be an area of further drawback however the scanning and filtering strategy we used following prisma facilitated the work and reduced the time invested further searching for literature using search engines e g google scholar potentially directed us toward peer reviewed articles hence we supplemented the search upon consultation with experts and looked at organizational websites of donors and ngos to identify resilience related project reports finally we used specific search terms that may have excluded some disciplines or resilience assessments addressing these limitations we conclude that the slr in this study provides a clear understanding about the strengths and weaknesses of current ra studies in bangladesh which can be useful to the policy makers and scientists working in the resilience assessment discipline declaration of competing interest we wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome acknowledgement this

20084,the assessment of resilience for people places and systems to climate change hazards is essential for understanding how to reduce disaster risks globally a number of resilience assessment methodologies have been developed and implemented by a variety of entities including national and local organizations donor agencies and academic researchers in bangladesh although a number of resilience studies have been conducted it has never been determined whether these assessments rightfully addressed conceptual understanding methodological approaches and disciplinary underpinnings and maintained compliance with on going research communications standards to unpack this gap we systematically reviewed 38 articles to characterize how the resilience to climate change of coastal communities in bangladesh is being assessed to operationalize the study we have presented a brief overview of the assessment tools and then applied an analytical framework containing six criteria comprehensiveness of dimensions scalar relationships temporal dynamism addressing uncertainties of climate change by modeling and scenario making participatory approaches and action plans the overview analysis shows diverse traditions of methodological underpinnings and reveals authors often incomplete conceptual understandings of resilience results of the review analysis reveal extensive inadequacy regarding multiple dimensionality scalar and temporal scales and more importantly addressing the uncertainty of climate change in relation to comprehensiveness current literature has failed to consistently comply with global research communication in regard to the criteria of institutional and infrastructural dimensions more attention needs to be placed on temporal and scalar dynamics most importantly the uncertainty issue is virtually overlooked in the literature and iterative processes and the development of alternate states of planning through scenario analysis are also critical for risk reduction and adaptation to climate change impacts substantial emphasis should be given to include all possible stakeholders in the planning and implementation of any climate change adaptation or mitigation program keywords bangladesh climate change resilience assessments measurement criteria systematic literature review 1 introduction resilience assessments ras have emerged as an important way of understanding human responses to disasters in order to reduce the subsequent negative effects through better preparation thereby enabling a population to withstand and adapt to a wide range of future disasters both natural and man made burton 2014 development and implementation of resilience assessment tools helps obtain benchmark information on the resilience status of a community compared to peer communities and best practice standards furthermore these tools can initiate interpersonal communication and afford a platform for acquiring and sharing resilience knowledge among communities arbon et al 2012 barkham et al 2014 as awareness has grown about the significance of resilience assessments scholars from diverse fields including socio economists engineers geographers and most recently urban and regional planners have joined together to work on these assessments consequently since the first conceptualization of this new approach to hazards management a consensus has been built among hazards scholars in understanding how resilience can be measured and operationalized as a preliminary step toward disaster response in order to address the existing and awaiting challenges that nations states cities communities and individuals confronted due to climate change scientists are increasingly being interested in using the resilience ideas in environmental risk and impact assessment summers et al 2017 angeler et al 2018 kakenmaster 2018 over the last four decades the notion of resilience has become a commonplace as a frontier concept in health engineering social ecological and spatial sciences cutter 2016 as a result numerous definitions of resilience has been suggested and argued in each science for example in the field of climate change and disaster resilience is defined as the ability of a system community or society exposed to hazards to resist absorb accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner unisdr 2009 similarly the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc defines resilience as the ability of human communities to anticipate absorb accommodate and recover from the effects of disturbances ipcc 2012 to date however the integration across the disciplines has lagged which is noticeable in the case of the community resilience thinking mainly when a community is considered as an interconnected system cutter 2016 resilience assessment studies generally adopt one of five different methods or some combination of several of these methods for determining the extent of compliance with resilience criteria these five methods are assessment against baseline assessment against threshold assessment against principles of good resilience assessment against peers benchmarking and assessment based on recovery speed pringle 2011 fox lent et al 2015 based on the overall format of the methods being used in the resilience assessment process four major approaches can be distinguished scorecard index model and toolkit as described by cutter 2016 for a comprehensive assessment of resilience a combination of all four formats would actually be most effective sharifi 2016 with the unprecedented rate of climate change resilience building has been getting widespread emphasis including in the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 a consensus has been developed among global research scholars that a robust tool in the process of resilience assessment should cover multiple dimensions of community resilience environmental social economic infrastructural and institutional cimellaro et al 2016 resilience is a multi scalar phenomenon and variations at one scale may affect other scales hence it is not realistic to assess resilience without addressing the upper and lower scales in the hierarchy moreover since a community is an open system and built within a hierarchy of spatial scales its resilience might prejudiced by dynamic interactions between different scales frankenberger et al 2013 constas et al 2014 quinlan et al 2015 chelleri et al 2015 addressing temporal changes and uncertainty of climate change by taking into account the past trajectories of climate disaster and anticipating of future changes along with system dynamics are important understanding in resilience assessment walker and salt 2012 in the literature emphasis has been given to consider evolutionary strategies folke et al 2010 collier et al 2013 levine 2014 watson et al 2014 schipper and langston 2015 such as an iterative process that involves monitoring performance and updating the baseline conditions and future targets for effectively addressing the uncertainty issues of climate change pringle 2011 moreover the development of future scenarios for ensuring better adaptation to more stressful conditions would be an effective strategy in resilience assessment frankenberger et al 2013 mcleod et al 2015 being a normative concept resilience research should involve participatory approaches to gather knowledge from a diverse range of stakeholder sharifi and yamagata 2016 indeed there has been an increasing global shift in the literature toward using plural methodologies i e participatory approaches for enhancing community resilience norris et al 2008 using participatory approaches that involve a wide range of possible stakeholders throughout the assessment process both development and implementation improves local understanding of risk and resilience provides capacity building benefits and creates a platform for knowledge and experience sharing frankenberger et al 2013 pfefferbaum et al 2014 tyler et al 2014 furthermore it can be of help in making decisions about trade offs and enhancing local ownership and legitimacy which in turn could better implement the decisions gibson 2006 pasteur 2011 furthermore the success of any assessment may depend on proper dissemination of its result to the targeted community of interest likewise potential interventions should be identified and prioritized on the basis of need and there should be a definite action plan illustrating the road map pfefferbaum et al 2012 schwind 2009 to transform a community into one more resilient than ever before bangladesh is becoming one of the most vulnerable countries in the world facing a wide range of disaster events as a result of global climate change the coastal region of bangladesh is the home of about 40 million people where natural resource based livelihoods such as agriculture are predominant lázár et al 2015 therefore the coastal regions of the country are more affected than any other area these experience various natural and human made disaster events sea level rise cyclones storm surges floods drought salinity intrusion river bank erosion and landslides chowdhury et al 2012 lázár et al 2015 nasim et al 2019 in almost every year during the past decades this region witnessed multiple disaster events that cause enormous loss and damages to human lives livelihoods well being and create uncertainty of food insecurity bbs 2016 lázár et al 2015 nasim et al 2019 resilience assessment has been carried out in bangladesh at various scales by various actors with various goals against various hazards however there has been limited interrogation on whether the methodology used in these resilience assessments has evolved along with evolving definitions of resilience in this study we begin with a short review of how the concept of resilience has evolved in global research and within bangladesh then we try to identify the span of methodologies used to assess climate resilience in the coastal regions of bangladesh the specific goals of this study were i to explore the conceptual understanding of resilience in the selected literature and ii to discover gaps in current methodologies in order to maintain compliance with global research communication standards and to address the threats of future climate change 2 methodology 2 1 conceptualization and operationalization of resilience resilience is a normative concept as the origin of its application is contested and often argued to be rooted in different disciplines sharifi and yamagata 2016 moser 2008 bodin and wiman 2004 the term resilience has emerged as ancient thinking and initially developed in physics and psychology discipline sharifi and yamagata 2016 bodin and wiman 2004 it was then introduced in the field of ecology through a series of studies conducted by authors like holling 1961 rosenzweig 1971 moser 2008 and norris et al 2008 over the last four decades the resilience approach has been used by a myriad of ways in different fields and disciplines adopted for their needs and priorities leading to multiple definitions of the concepts regardless of its origin a list of resilience definitions has presented in table s1 that demonstrates the evolution of the notion and diversity with which the concept has been defined in the field of psychology resilience refers to the process outcome or capacity of individual or community to resist recover and return to its equilibrium state after being affected by external stressors norris et al 2008 pfefferbaum et al 2005 the engineering ecological and socio ecological adaptive resilience are the three significant resilience approaches extensively being found in the ongoing scholarships sharifi and yamagata 2016 the engineering approach of resilience reveals the system s physical resistance against a shock and also its ability to rapidly return to an equilibrium state whenever it exceeds the threshold level norris et al 2008 bodin and wiman 2004 the ecological approach to resilience admits the uncertainty of climatic shocks it advocates enhancing the tolerance capacity of the system and prioritizes the needs of a system s flexibility to shift to a new equilibrium state s for retaining its pre disaster functionality even after an extreme shock event sharifi and yamagata 2016 holling 1973 however the adaptive approach to resilience recognizes systems as the dynamic socio ecological entity that regularly transforms gunderson and folke 2005 adger et al 2005 therefore the system may sometimes fail to return in its equilibrium state and follows vulnerability pathways after exposure to a disruptive event in contrary the integrity of the system its self organizational capacity and learning from the past experience are some of the drivers that enhance the system s adaptive capacity and enables not only to bounce back from the shocks but also push forward to a more desired state it was ever before sharifi and yamagata 2016 resilience alliance 2012 gunderson and folke 2005 adger et al 2005 during the past decade the concept of resilience has got widespread attention in the field of disaster risk management drm as a result of the initiation of hyogo framework for action 2005 2015 building resilience of nations and communities to disasters by united nations international strategy for disaster reduction unisdr 2007 in the field of drm resilience is most commonly expressed as the capacity of a society to bounce back cope withstand resist and recover rapidly from the impacts of hazard events ostadtaghizadeh et al 2015 turnbull et al 2013 ipcc 2012 ra studies table s2 in the coastal region of bangladesh was started in 2010 with the health sector and it was then gradually introduced to engineering ecology and socio ecological discipline for example agricultural scientists have conducted farming based resilience assessments in the face of climatic hazards rahman 2012 kais and islam 2017 social scientists have focused on social capital islam and walkerden 2014 hassan et al 2013 scholars with engineering background have focused on infrastructural resilience sameen 2018 ali et al 2018 moles et al 2014 mallick 2013 and some others have focused on policy and institutional resilience islam et al 2017 however almost one decade of resilience studies revealed that social aspects i e social capital had received more priority by the authors who assessed resilience however the higher level of exposure to climate change induced disasters and comparatively low adaptive capacity by the coastal communities of bangladesh lázár et al 2015 necessitates a comprehensive assessment of disaster resilience as proposed by ipcc and unsidr hence authors take the disaster resilience concept for coastal bangladesh as the ability of individuals households and communities in a complex socio ecological system to anticipate resist absorb accommodate and recover from the effect of climate change erratic rainfall inundation flood cyclone drought erosion etc through suitable adaptive and transformative practices without disturbing ecological and environmental systems the linkages between disaster resilience and environmental systems fig 1 entail a comprehensive depiction of the extent of hazards vulnerability adaptive capacity and resilience that reflects the exposure of an environmental system to natural hazards cutter et al 2008 the degree of impacts after a hazardous event depends on the existing coping responses of the system place or community being exposed if the exposed system can minimize the sensitivity and absorb the shocks it can recover to its initial stage very quickly and follow resilience pathways by contrast if a system shows higher sensitivity and can t absorb the shocks then it requires adaptation intervention to recover to its equilibrium stage however in some cases the system never can bounce back to its equilibrium stage even after interventions are taken and it follows vulnerability pathways hence it can be generalized that resilient systems or communities are less vulnerable to natural disasters than non resilient systems furthermore resilience and vulnerability are inversely proportionate i e higher the vulnerability of a system or community the lower will be the resilience and vice versa 2 2 systematic literature reviews systematic literature review slr is a rigorous transparent and replicable form of literature review process ford et al 2011 delaney et al 2014 that involves identifying synthesizing assessing and interpreting available evidence kitchenham 2004 dixon woods et al 2006 ford and pearce 2010 ford et al 2011 in order to generate a robust and empirically derived answer to an exhaustive research inquiry okoli and schabram 2010 a clearly formulated research question and well defined inclusion and exclusion criteria in an slr process can minimize opaqueness and enable replication having these strengths slr is considered a more robust process than a traditional literature review ford et al 2011 yet even though slr is stronger than a standard literature review it encounters some practical problems throughout its entire process especially in the searching screening and synthesis stages okoli and schabram 2010 slr requires to access in a wide range of databases peer review journals and institutional reports for inclusive review results however access to a wide range of databases and peer review journals may be problematic for non academic researchers and those from low income countries moreover access to selected institutions undermines the objectivity of the review process mallett et al 2012 the slr process adopts inclusion and exclusion criteria for achieving objectivity in screening potential literature which inevitably involves subjectivity especially when more number of researcher engaged in the screening process and their differential interpretation of inclusion and exclusion criteria mallett et al 2012 synthesis of information from the relevant literature also involves a certain degree of biases because of depending on the authors self proclaimed research methods and findings this limitation could be overcome by involving respective authors in the review process which in reality not feasible for resource constraints mallett et al 2012 slr is increasingly being used in climate change research especially in vulnerability and risk analysis to make sense of resilience research that originates from multiple disciplines each with its own set of conceptualization and methodological approaches we chose slr because it is well suited to help clarify and stabilize different conceptualizations of resilience and to identify methodological differences that are not otherwise apparent delaney et al 2014 in this study we had access to a wide range of databases and peer review journals supported by the chinese academy of sciences china to overcome the constraints of institutional information collection the authors communicated with different organizations and ministries of the bangladesh government and relevant ngos working in the same discipline cross checking of the screened literature and extracted information was done by multiple authors to attain objectivity in screening the potential studies and data synthesis process repetition of the assessment was done wherever any dissimilarity was found 2 3 data selection and review process a systematic literature review was conducted to analyze the current ra studies on climate disasters context the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analyses prisma method was used to select ra studies for detailed review as shown in fig 2 prisma approach consists of four steps such as identification screening eligibility and inclusion saja et al 2019 which has explained below step1 identification stage the key search terms resilience and climate change and bangladesh in title abstract and keywords were used to identify potential publications on ra the peer review publications were selected through isi web of science and google scholar whereas the grey literature was selected through the google search engine and direct access to institutional websites ra studies with no start date and a cut off publication date of june 2018 initially resulted in 169 publications step 2 screening stage in this stage initially selected publications were screened by removing duplication and narrowing search terms following inclusion and exclusion criteria presented in table 1 consequently 72 relevant publications were selected step 3 eligibility check in this step the selected screened publications were further checked for eligibility to be included in the review analysis following inclusion and exclusion criteria explained in table 1 subsequently 44 publications were found eligible for review analysis step 4 inclusion in this step the eligible publications with full text accessibility were included for critical review finally 38 full text literature table s2 consisting of peer review article 24 book chapter 2 conference proceedings 4 thesis 5 and working paper 3 were included for data extraction 2 4 assessment framework while several frameworks ostadtaghizadeh et al 2015 cutter 2016 sharifi 2016 asadzadeh et al 2017 are available in the literature for investigating resilience assessment tools those of sharifi 2016 and cutter 2016 have received more attention in the global research community in this study we followed the frameworks fig 3 of sharifi 2016 who suggests that a resilience assessment tool should comprehensively address multiple dimensions of community resilience take into account the connections between different spatial scales be able to measure changes across temporal scales develop suitable measures for capturing uncertainties be developed and implemented in collaboration with stakeholders and lead to development of action plans for enhancing resilience to investigate the level of compliance with these typical characteristics an extensive literature review was conducted to extract important criteria related to community resilience as was done by sharifi and murayama 2015 an initial list of criteria was developed and grouped into five categories viz environmental social economic infrastructural and institutional as was done by sharifi 2016 the list was then compared with the criteria used in the selected ra studies and any inadequacies determined in the indicators for the dimensions then selected literature were checked to find out whether they had accounted for interrelationships between upper and lower hierarchies within the community or systems and whether they considered the continuum of past current and future both iterative processes and scenario analyses were considered to ensure that uncertainty issues had been well addressed in the literature the methodology section of the literature was carefully checked to ensure that the tool had been developed and implemented through participatory approaches like fgd focus group discussion kii key informant s interview or other methods since formulating policy recommendations has become a common tradition in scientific publishing the abstract discussion policy recommendation and conclusion sections were carefully checked to ensure that action plans had been incorporated a detailed data coding plan table s3 has been developed and used to extract and input the information in a spss database 3 results of the review assessment 3 1 conceptualization of resilience to explore the breadth of conceptual frameworks used ras studies were coded in to six categories such as i ability to absorb recover and retain from a disturbance ii food security and livelihood iii adaptation capacity to hazard iv reduction or erosion of vulnerability to climate disaster v others or combination of the above and vi unclear table s3 this categorization was done based on the construct that defines how resilience was defined or explained by the authors the analysis was conducted because several ra studies didn t explicitly report constructs of resilience wherever there was no precise definition or conceptualization of resilience this was coded as unclear or not explicit which in itself is a significant finding such ras may not help in replicating research because it is quite impossible to conclude the validity or utility of literature that had shallow reporting delaney et al 2014 although resilience has been defined in diverse ways by scholars from a wide range of disciplines ipcc s 2012 definition is being widely accepted in the global community yet of the ras only a single study akter and mallick 2013 used the ipcc s latest definition of resilience however some studies used an earlier definition from ipcc s fourth assessment report ipcc 2007 one possible reason behind the lower number of studies being focused on the latest ipcc definition might be the distinctive lag time between conceptual developments and publication in peer reviewed literature in almost 45 of the articles fig 4 resilience is not clearly defined which is a matter of concern how could assessments be possible without a clear definition of what resilience is in 26 of the studies resilience was conceptualized as the ability to absorb recover from and retain stability after a disturbance mainly those disturbances caused by natural disasters and climatic stresses whereas 13 of the studies focused on adaptation capacity similarly resilience as reduction of vulnerability was reported in 8 of the studies on the other hand resilience as food security and livelihood improvement was reported in only 5 of the articles one possible reason for these inconsistencies might be that we explicitly looked for resilience studies not poverty or development related research 3 2 methods and approaches used in the selected ra studies in addition to the selected six criteria in assessment framework a general investigation has been done to see the type of risk hazard disaster addressed methods and tools being used in ras to reveal the assessment strategy overall format and style of presentation of findings tables 2 s4 whether or not we focus on resilience to climate change the question of how we characterize the specific shocks and stresses that could threaten the community population at multiple spatial or temporal scales across systems is an important issue to be considered of the ras more than 90 of the studies focused on climatic shocks and stresses and of these 76 3 focused on cyclones whereas 26 3 23 7 and 21 1 of the studies focused on salinity storm surges and floods respectively table 2 and fig s1 the predominance of studies focused on cyclones might be because the coastal area of bangladesh is a hotspot of cyclone activity where each year one or more cyclonic events have occurred causing enormous loss and damage to the targeted community the household was the most commonly used unit for assessing resilience in the selected studies table 2 and fig s2 very few studies were conducted at the community state or city level showing that the geographic dynamics of resilience were undermined in the previous studies however being an intermediate unit of assessment district or city level resilience assessments could reflect dynamics at both wider and smaller scales o brien et al 2004 the reason behind the limited number of resilience studies at the district or city level might be limited access to the required data in the context of bangladesh before 2011 or even early 2012 the availability of biophysical and socio economic data at the community level was practically nil or at least not satisfactory as can be seen from table 2 and fig s3 assessments against baseline conditions assessments against principles of good resilience and benchmarking were the most common methods adopted by the selected ra studies as shown in table 2 the selected ras relied on both secondary and primary data collections to conduct resilience assessments secondary data has been collected from different sources like census data historical records and statistics provided by national local departments and non profit organizations on the other hand household surveys fgds and key informant s interviews were the most frequently used techniques of primary data collection both qualitative and quantitative methods were adopted by a majority of the selected ra studies table 2 where quantitative methods used numerical data and qualitative methods included accounts of local peoples perception and experts opinions qualitative methods are important where there is limited data whereas quantitative methods can better address the concerns of subjectivity sharifi 2016 since resilience is a value laden concept and influenced by perceptions preferences and attitudes within the community qualitative assessment is needed for better understanding of the needs vulnerabilities coping capacities and opinions of local people to ensure better resilience capacity jones and tanner 2015 olazabal and pascual 2016 as shown in table 2 and fig s4 among the ra studies scorecards 63 2 were found most frequently followed by toolkit 15 8 index 13 2 and model 7 9 methods results table 4 and fig s5 show that selected resilience assessment studies followed distinct styles to present their results illustration techniques have been addressed well in most of the studies but comparatively fewer studies have addressed strengths and weaknesses however much less attention has been paid to addressing ongoing communications and changing patterns of the resilience status over different time horizons 3 3 evaluation against the framework 3 3 1 comprehensiveness of the resilience criteria incorporating multiple dimensions and aspects in a unifying framework has been emphasized in earlier investigations of the resilience assessment process hence following a thorough review process criteria used in the selected resilience studies were identified and grouped into five common dimensions environmental social economic built environment and infrastructure and institutional as has been done by other scholars alshehri et al 2014 cutter 2016 sharifi 2016 information presented in table 3 and fig 5 shows that a majority of the resilience assessment studies were broad and incorporated multiple dimensions but that only a few of them covered all five dimensions a considerable number of studies relied on a single dimension of resilience a major drawback of the assessments on average the social dimension got maximum attention followed by economic infrastructural institutional and environmental dimensions however it is evident that the environmental dimension has received much less attention in the current resilience studies fig 6 despite its significant role in building resilience earlier evidence has indicated that efficient management of natural resources protection of ecosystems and availability of natural assets can enhance shock absorption capacity and ensure quick recovery from losses cutter et al 2008 hughes et al 2013 burton 2014 hence the minimal inclusion of environmental dimensions in the resilience assessment studies especially in a country like bangladesh which is recognized as among the countries most vulnerable to experiencing negative consequences of natural hazards can significantly undermine the resilience of the coastal people further the impressive achievement in reducing disaster risks by holistic efforts from government organizations ngos other multilateral supporting agencies has not been properly reflected in the selected resilience assessment studies in order to see the level of compliance with the globally used resilience dimensions the findings of this study on resilience criteria were compared with the findings of sharifi 2016 which included 36 community resilience assessment tools developed and implemented globally the spider diagram fig 6 shows that a similar level of attention has been given between resilience studies of bangladesh bd and those of the rest of the world global in terms of economic infrastructural and environmental dimensions but wide variations were evident in institutional and social dimensions of the ra studies in the coastal region of bangladesh institutional criteria got comparatively less attention than globally conducted assessment processes that argued that despite many ngos donor agencies and multilateral organizations being involved in coastal rehabilitation and livelihood projects their role was not properly investigated however integrating multiple agents and forces can better influence any efforts toward boosting community resilience sharifi 2016 3 3 2 cross scale relationships resilience is a multi scalar concept and changes at one scale may affect the other scales hence it is unrealistic to assess resilience of a community in isolation from the upper and lower scales in the hierarchy each community is an open system nested within a hierarchy of spatial scales and its resilience is influenced by dynamic relationships and dependencies that may exist between different scales frankenberger et al 2013 constas et al 2014 chelleri et al 2015 quinlan et al 2015 as shown in table 4 and fig s5 the notion of cross scalar relationships and panarchy of scales was mostly overlooked in the selected studies only eight studies considered dynamic hierarchical systems of scale however emphasis should have been given to understanding how resilience intervention affects or is affected by actions processes dynamics and interventions compared to other scales of measurement alliance 2007 davis et al 2013 frankenberger et al 2013 the landscape focus of most of the ra studies 57 9 spanned rural areas 34 2 of the articles spanned multiple landscapes and only 7 9 of the studies spanned urban landscapes fig s6 in the context of bangladesh it is perceived that rural peoples are more disadvantaged as they live on the periphery and are more exposed to natural hazards and more vulnerable than any other group perceptions that have led researchers from diverse disciplines to conduct their studies in rural areas moreover evidence has shown that multilateral agencies and ngos are more focused on rural areas sdc 2009 practical action 2009 giz 2014 however none of the studies focused on peri urban areas possibly because the term peri urban is difficult to conceptualize especially from the perspective of bangladesh among the 38 resilience assessment studies examined a majority were spread across exposed coastal regions fig 7 with the highest number in the southwestern region the interior coastal region and the central region had the lowest representations that most of the ras were conducted in the exposed coastal regions with significantly fewer in interior regions indicates a skewed focus on areas that are vulnerable to multiple hazards cyclones slr salinity intrusions 3 3 3 temporal dynamism the significance of a temporal continuum in resilience assessment is well recognized norris et al 2008 and usually every stage of resilience measurement should intractably link to what precedes and what succeeds it sharifi 2016 yet our findings revealed that only 8 of the studies took all phases of the temporal continuum into consideration although 42 accounted for past and present conditions table 4 fig s7 the majority 47 of the studies focused on only the present conditions and usually overlooked the evolutionary and emergent nature of resilience hence their output simply reflects a snapshot in time view of resilience schipper and langston 2015 and almost no studies accounted for the present and future portions of the continuum only ahmed et al 2016 included this perspective 3 3 4 uncertainties setting long term goals for resilience becomes a very challenging task due to uncertainties in climate models which are constantly shifting their adaptation thresholds to address this problem an evolutionary process is required to predict climate scenarios keeping in mind that resilience is an emergent feature of multifaceted adaptive socio ecological systems folke et al 2010 collier et al 2013 watson et al 2014 schipper and langston 2015 levine 2014 the compliance of addressing uncertainty in the selected resilience studies was evaluated by the presence or absence of an iterative approach and scenario development uncertainty in the decision making process can be minimized through a continuous and iterative process sharifi 2016 whereas future challenges can be addressed through planning severity scenarios unisdr 2014 moreover scenario making along with perfect elaboration of alternate states can enhance the performance of the communities in the event of disaster and enable them to understand their strengths and weaknesses monaghan et al 2014 findings revealed that almost 90 of the ra studies paid attention to conducting assessments at regular intervals table 4 and fig s8 they did this through measures such as regular monitoring and continuous update of baselines and threshold values sharifuzzaman et al 2018 islam and walkerden 2014 ayeb karlsson et al 2016 islam and walkerden 2015 ray bennett et al 2016 of the ra studies only one paid attention to scenario making and modeling alternate states to determine how the bcr benefit cost ratio of v2r vulnerability to resilience programs can shift when critical thresholds are crossed ahmed et al 2016 3 3 5 participatory approaches the adoption of participatory approaches in the development and implementation of resilience assessment is important to emphasize because of its multiple benefits as shown in table 4 and fig s9 only about 8 of the selected resilience studies followed participatory methods in the development of assessment tools whereas 55 of the studies followed different participatory methods to ensure multiple stakeholder participation in the assessment process however emphasis should have been given for adopting participatory approaches in all stages of measurement from the development of tools to using the tools identifying priorities and also developing action plans based on the assessment results sharifi 2016 participatory approaches like focus group discussion fgd was more frequently used in the selected resilience studies however few studies adopted multiple participatory approaches like fgd social mapping resource mapping venn diagrams institutional relations through mapping or climate hazards mapping in their assessment process akter 2015 local peoples experience and know how has sometimes been incorporated though through the active participation of community people in developing resilient housing and critical infrastructure ali et al 2018 sameen 2018 mallick 2013 moles et al 2014 3 3 6 action plan one of the most important purposes of resilience assessment is to enable communities to identify gaps and to prioritize concerns also in order to ascertain leverage points for intervention and remedial action sharifi 2016 findings revealed that in about 87 of the resilience studies attention was paid to developing action plans for enhancing resilience table 4 and fig s10 although policy formulation in scientific articles is common in this research a number of the ra studies explicitly stated that their findings were intended to enhance the effectiveness of resilience building capacity and adaptation planning e g sameen 2018 akter and mallick 2013 islam and walkerden 2015 hassan et al 2013 rahman 2012 yu et al 2017 ahsan and takeuchi 2015 al maruf 2017 adopted the technique of identifying the influencing factors of community resilience and suggested including them as a basis for an action plan on the other hand limitations in the local governments and ngos services were identified and specific strategies were suggested to overcome these constraints islam et al 2017 islam and walkerden 2015 furthermore local peoples experiences and lessons were considered ali et al 2018 sameen 2018 mallick 2013 moles et al 2014 in developing adaptive housing and critical infrastructures that can be included in the action plan for strengthening the resilience capacity of coastal communities 3 4 implications of assessment tools on findings and research gaps through qualitative investigation of the findings discussion and conclusion sections efforts were made to examine whether the resilience assessment exercise expected to further the conceptual understanding of resilience the methodological features of assessing resilience policy formulation or practice after carefully analyzing all the articles we arrived at several categories of resilience assessment studies first a considerable number of ra studies focused on identifying the drivers of resilience e g rahman and li 2018 islam et al 2017 ahsan and takeuchi 2015 some studies contributed to further methodological development for assessing resilience for example ayeb karlsson et al 2016 developed a resilience building approach called people centered approach whereas mallick 2013 used a participatory planning approach for increasing the capacity of community for building resilient houses studies using models such as yu et al 2017 successfully incorporated institutions and collective actions with a socio hydrological model for flood resilience assessment furthermore some of the ra studies focused on categorizing who is more resilient by comparing different social structures e g gendered resilience by sameen 2018 and caste driven resilience by ali et al 2018 other studies focused on specific places community groups or ecological systems like kais and islam 2017 who conducted a study on a fisheries community finally some ra studies discussed the implications of their findings on further resilience conceptualization and used other framings to understand resilience for example everyday health security practices as disaster resilience an approach taken by ray bennett et al 2016 and matin and taylor 2015 integrated socio ecological and behavioral theories to address community resilience efforts have also been made to identify the gaps in current resilience research in bangladesh first environmental and institutional dimensions of resilience assessment received less attention than other dimensions in the selected ra studies in this connection global research communication incorporated criteria like erosion protection protection of wetlands and watersheds availability and access to natural resources reduction of pollution quality of resources and resource recycling sharifi 2016 which has not yet reflected in the current literature besides information on the policies plans projects and programs of multilateral governmental bodies along with those of ngos donor agencies and multi national companies should be incorporated to strengthen the institutional dimension secondly most of the ra studies measured resilience at one specific time after a disaster event with no attention to temporal resilience or past trajectories of change thirdly most of the ras were conducted at the household scale and seldom was emphasis given toward any higher order scale moreover multi scalar assessments of resilience were not well emphasized in any of the current ra studies furthermore a considerable number of ra studies did not involve participation of all categories of stakeholders in the development and assessment process finally uncertainty issues of resilience assessment were totally overlooked in the selected ra studies 4 discussion with advancing global climate change the increasing needs for resilience assessment tools has resulted in widespread popularity for these assessments by the global research community over the past few decades and a growing number of tools have been developed and implemented worldwide further there is a growing recognition of the need for content analysis of resilience assessment tools in order to improve resilience capacity but no such content analysis study has yet been carried out on the resilience assessment studies being conducted in the coastal regions of bangladesh in response to this need 38 selected ra studies were critically examined in this evaluation this review highlights the importance of conceptual understanding of resilience by the authors addressing of multiple dimensions of resilience taking account of cross scale relationships capturing temporal dynamism addressing uncertainties employing participatory approaches and developing action plans this paper affords the first comprehensive review of ra tools for the coastal regions of bangladesh having examined the conceptual and methodological extensiveness of these studies 4 1 conceptualization of resilience the findings demonstrate that in the coastal region of bangladesh resilience is conceptualized in multiple ways where a number of ras constructed in the field of food security poverty reduction and livelihoods as their core theoretical lineages we strongly argue that accepted conceptualizations of resilience are predisposed to certain methodological approaches an assumption that has implications for identifying who is resilient and how they become resilient however surprisingly the majority of the selected studies failed to include any definition of resilience in their assessment process such vagueness in the field of resilience assessment could hinder the effectiveness of resource allocation and the efficiency of mitigation and adaption practices at the local level a neglect that can reduce the resilience capacity of the communities berke and godschalk 2009 frazier et al 2013 4 2 addressing resilience to what although resilience assessment has been conducted against many different hazards cyclones are the entity that has received the most emphasis however resilience against one type of hazard does not guarantee resilience against other types of hazards frankenberger et al 2013 especially for the coastal region of bangladesh which are highly exposed to different types of climate disasters and environmental problems such sea level rise salinity intrusion flood erosion and arsenic contamination therefore communities should have plans for responding to multiple types of hazards further research should be conducted using a unified framework to see whether there are any trade offs among multiple hazard types moreover more attention should be given to selecting specific indicators instead of an overly generalized approach that might fail to reflect any hazard specific issues sharifi 2016 4 3 addressing comprehensive dimensions in ras in terms of dimensionality of the resilience criteria the selected ra studies were most inclined to address social capital i e society and wellbeing in measuring resilience capacity environmental and institutional dimensions also need to be addressed however and more attention should be focused on these criteria hence erosion protection protection of wetlands and watersheds availability and access to natural resources reduction of pollution quality of resources and resource recycling are some of the environmental criteria currently being recognized in the global scholarships to reflect environmental dimensions of resilience moreover information on the policies plans projects and programs of multilateral governmental bodies along with those of ngos donor agencies and multi national companies should be incorporated to strengthen the institutional dimension 4 4 scalar issues spatiality and temporality in ras an important finding of the study is that ras in the coastal parts of bangladesh have failed to conclusively reveal the dynamic nature of resilience by focusing on the interface of forces act over various geographic and temporal scales in most of the ras resilience was assessed as a snapshot thus rendering an inherently dynamic concept static such a static view of resilience tends to ignore the highly dynamic nature of the system in which people are situated in a country like bangladesh where government service terms usually five years have a strong influence on planning and resource allocation there are direct repercussions on peoples coping and adaptation behaviors moreover rapid urbanization is on the verge of dissolving traditional rural urban binaries thereby changing the very context within which current ras are conducted the failure of ras to address and assess resilience as something changing over time is a major limitation of the ras that have been conducted in the coastal areas of bangladesh because comparing baseline conditions with those recorded before a disruptive event provides information on the context in which past intervention measures have been effective in absorbing the shocks as well as on the extent of recovery following the event furthermore changing climatic conditions make it difficult to create resilience communities by referring only to past and existing conditions it is also necessary to understand system dynamics and develop strategies for anticipating future changes walker and salt 2012 4 5 addressing uncertainty of climate change in ras whenever thinking about any climate model or framework the first and foremost question comes forward in a discussion is how uncertainty issues being considered in this connection the climate researchers suggested adopting an iterative process through the assessing of alternative states and extreme scenario analysis for addressing future uncertainty in resilience research however selected ra literature have failed in effectively applying these strategies to address the uncertainty issue in particular there has been negligible assimilation of scenario making in the ras process hence a meaningful strategy for enhancing adaptive capacity and improving ras would be to adopt an iterative assessment and recognize that communities need to be adequately aware and flexible to accommodate the impacts of different severe future scenarios sharifi and yamagata 2016 4 6 employing participatory approaches in ras participation of all possible stakeholders needs to be emphasized by global research scholars in order to enhance community resilience capacity norris et al 2008 a participatory approach which is open and engages a wide range of stakeholders in the decision making process can provide multiple benefits sharifi 2016 moreover if participatory approaches can be effectively used in the development and implementation process it will improve local peoples understanding of risk and resilience provide capacity building aids and afford a platform for sharing knowledge and experiences frankenberger et al 2013 pfefferbaum et al 2014 tyler et al 2014 pfefferbaum et al 2011 suggested bottom up approaches where assessment surveys should be conducted before and after an intervention to determine the impact points a similar approach was conducted by ahmed et al 2016 to gather information on non monetary benefits from project interventions using the fgd method cutter 2016 claims that a bottom up approach is better for reflecting community needs and priorities whereas the top down method is suitable for standardizing and making comparisons across different scales due to its data variability and contextual differences hence the decision to select appropriate methods largely depends on the purpose of the assessment and no doubt in some cases a combination of both methods can be recommended realizing the needs of an iterative process and the limitations of dependence on bottom up strategies for community inputs a substantial amount of time and resources is required to reach a consensus on the best method for any particular study usiotwsp 2007 tyler et al 2014 sharifi 2016 it has also been suggested glandon 2015 that long term project initiatives and sufficient resource allocation by the investors and funding agencies can ensure more participation of multiple stakeholders 5 conclusion resilience assessment studies in bangladesh have been inadequate in number considering the challenges of coping with the threats of global climate change in this small deltaic and highly populous country furthermore the authors incomplete conceptual understanding of resilience is a matter of great concern casting doubt upon the usefulness of their conclusions for improving resilience building capacity hence developing countries like bangladesh need to conduct more resilience studies keeping pace with the developed economies although the majority of the ra studies have been broad in scope and have addressed multiple dimensions they have failed to incorporate adequate criteria for complying with global trends especially in regard to the infrastructural and institutional dimensions like the ongoing research trend resilience assessment in bangladesh has also failed to incorporate an adequate number of criteria to reflect the environmental dimension further attention is therefore required to ensure optimal integration of criteria under these three dimensions current ra studies have also failed to adequately reflect the dynamic nature of resilience by addressing the interaction of forces operating over various geographic and temporal scales hence developing methodologies to address dynamic conditions through modeling and projection is another area requiring further work furthermore uncertainty issues of resilience assessment have been totally overlooked in the selected ra studies which indicate the necessity of further studies based on a projection of climate change hazards by modeling and scenario analysis to address the future climate change to this end assessment should be conducted through an iterative process and should acknowledge that communities need to be flexible enough to accommodate the impacts of different types of severe scenarios long term project initiatives and sufficient resource allocation by the government along with other investors and funding agencies can ensure more participation of multiple stakeholders and minimize data limitations besides the criticism of being resource intensiveness a flexible and coding iterative analytical template that we used in slr may seem to be an area of further drawback however the scanning and filtering strategy we used following prisma facilitated the work and reduced the time invested further searching for literature using search engines e g google scholar potentially directed us toward peer reviewed articles hence we supplemented the search upon consultation with experts and looked at organizational websites of donors and ngos to identify resilience related project reports finally we used specific search terms that may have excluded some disciplines or resilience assessments addressing these limitations we conclude that the slr in this study provides a clear understanding about the strengths and weaknesses of current ra studies in bangladesh which can be useful to the policy makers and scientists working in the resilience assessment discipline declaration of competing interest we wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome acknowledgement this
