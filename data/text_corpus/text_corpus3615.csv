18075,while microplastics 1 μm 5 mm contamination is creating public concern nanoplastics 1000 nm might create even more serious environmental contamination issues this is likely due to the smaller size higher specific surface area of nanoplastics which works more efficiently as a vector for other contaminants transportation and fate to release the formulation additives and to be accumulated in the human body the research on nanoplastics is currently hampered by the absence of an effective characterisation method although x ray photoelectron spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy xps sem is reportedly dominating the nanoplastics characterisation approaches recently imaging technology which provides direct visualisation of the targets is attracting increased attention in this study we demonstrate that raman imaging can be employed to visualise and identify microplastics and nanoplastics down to 100 nm by distinguishing the laser spot the pixel size image resolution the nanoplastics size position within a laser spot the raman signal intensity and via the sample preparation etc we also validate this technique for the analysis of paint polishing dust samples that have been collected from a driveway when a vehicle s clear coating of poly acrylic was polished by hand we estimate that billions trillions of microplastics nanoplastics ranging from 7 μm down to 200 nm have been generated by hand polishing an engine hood graphical abstract image 1096 keywords microplastic nanoplastic environmental contamination raman mapping image paint polishing dust 1 introduction introduction of plastics into the environment is creating considerable public concern eerkes medrano et al 2015 small sized plastics 5 mm have been detected in air water foods and terrestrial systems cox et al 2019 jiang 2018 koelmans et al 2019 kosuth et al 2018 liebezeit and liebezeit 2014 ng et al 2018 and have been found to accumulate in aquatic organisms either from primary or secondary sources the primary source refers to the plastics that are released into the environment directly from domestic and industrial sources andrady 2017 while the secondary source is from the fragmentation of plastic debris through mechanical or biological stressors andrady 2017 arthur et al 2009 browne 2015 gigault et al 2018 generally small plastic pieces can be categorised as microplastics 1 μm 5 mm hartmann et al 2016 and nanoplastics 1000 nm gigault et al 2018 hartmann et al 2019 although there is still some debates about the size boundary 1000 nm vs 100 nm between the two categories alimi et al 2018 gigault et al 2018 picó and barceló 2019 currently microplastics dominate the research schymanski et al 2018 tagg et al 2015 because of their potential environmental impact for example winkler et al 2019 showed a considerable increase of microplastics in water bottles as the result of bottle openings closings and mechanical stress unfortunately nanoplastics might create more adverse environmental issues given the nano size and the corresponding chemico physical properties affecting their sorption transportation fate and bioavailability etc domingos et al 2009 lead et al 2018 although various studies have been carried out for the characterisation of microplastics cabernard et al 2018 enders et al 2015 lenz 1993 sobhani et al 2019 there is a lack of suitable analytical methods for nanoplastics nanoparticles can enter living organisms either through the food chain or inhalation moore 2006 oberdörster 2004 recent research reported that billions of microplastics nanoplastics from tea bags might enter our body daily when we drink tea hernandez et al 2019 another report showed that nanoplastics could accumulate in organs lee et al 2019 considering their nano size and hydrophobic nature nanoplastics can affect activity and feeding behaviour mattsson et al 2017 and potentially metabolism mattsson et al 2015 of living organisms another concern is that nanoplastics can be the source of contamination by releasing chemicals including monomers and the formulation ingredients of polymers or by concentrating toxic chemicals from the environment wright and kelly 2017 this is a serious concern since nanoplastics have much higher specific surface area than microplastics therefore there is an urgent need to effectively characterise nanoplastics along with microplastics as the fate of plastic fragmentation under natural conditions is unknown moreover better understanding of the potential exposure and human health risk assessments require a standard identification method koelmans et al 2019 optical spectral techniques have been used for chemical identification of surface texture and structural information of microplastics song et al 2015 such as x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps hernandez et al 2019 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir tagg et al 2015 and raman spectroscopy schymanski et al 2018 the first study on nanoplastics characterisation has been conducted by hernandez et al 2017 they confirmed the presence of polyethylene nanoparticles in commercial facial scrubs ranging in size from 24 to 52 nm using xps and ftir the problem with this technique is that xps provides the element information that neither directly corresponds with the polymer of the plastic nor with the image while ftir can yield the direct spectrum information of a polymer towards imaging the lateral resolution is usually low 20 μm due to the wavelength of ir 2 5 50 μm löder and gerdts 2015 another challenge for the analysis of an individual nanoplastic from an environmental sample is that the small size of nanoplastic usually generates a weak signal for analysis which might result in large numbers of false positives or false negatives even for microplastics song et al 2015 consequently more research needs to be done to improve the characterisation of nanoplastics andrady 2017 as molecular vibration spectra ftir and raman are known as reference methods for identification and characterisation of microplastics cabernard et al 2018 both techniques are non destructive and characterise microplastics via a vibrational spectra as different microplastics exhibit different spectra which is unique and akin to a fingerprint araujo et al 2018 by collecting the unique spectra with position information such as at each pixel an image can be generated to directly visualise and image the microplastics sobhani et al 2019 for example micro ftir is known as a successful method for visualisation of different microplastics in wastewater down to 20 μm erni cassola et al 2017 raman spectroscopy as another method for the characterisation of microplastics can identify and image microplastics down to 1 μm sobhani et al 2019 compared with ftir aside from raman s better lateral resolution 1 μm vs 20 μm raman provides a higher spectral coverage with a highly specific fingerprint spectrum and lower interference from water ivleva et al 2017 vašková 2011 however whether raman can be employed to image nanoplastics is unknown this study aims to image visualise and identify nanoplastics down to 100 nm using raman mapping sem is employed to confirm the analysis of nanoplastics along with microplastics to validate this technique we tested the real samples of paint polishing dust which were collected from our driveway when we polished our vehicle s clear coating of poly acrylic by hand and do it yourself diy kit 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and microplastics nanoplastics all nanoplastics and chemicals including polystyrene ps nanoparticles 2 aqueous suspension with diameters of 600 nm 300 nm and 100 nm respectively sulphuric acid h2so4 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were purchased from sigma aldrich australia and used as received unless further indicated 2 2 sample preparation as the sample supporting matrix carbon tab proscitech glass slide and gold coating silicon wafer both from sigma aldrich australia were used glass slide and gold silicon wafer were cleaned by dipping into piranha solution 2 1 h2so4 h2o2 v v overnight to remove any possible organic contaminants sherman 1990 be careful this solution reacts vigorously with organic compounds the carbon tab was peeled off to remove the capping paper at the point of sample preparation for the analysis of ps nanoplastics distribution ps nanoplastics were diluted 10 times v v with milli q water with sonication for 5 min subsequently a droplet 2 μl was spread and distributed on the surface of the carbon tab glass slide or gold wafer after gently blow drying with nitrogen the sample was stored in air for the test our first test suggested that the bumpy surface of the carbon tab led to a focusing challenge on confocal raman therefore we then deposited our ps nanoplastics onto the glass surface for raman and the gold wafer surface for raman and sem as discussed below real samples were collected on the driveway when a car was polished by hand following do it yourself diy instructions a clear coating paint spray can of top coat clear 150 g ds117 was purchased from a local store super cheap auto australia due to commercial reasons the exact ingredients of the poly acrylic paint are unknown we sprayed the paint on a glass slide surface as a reference to collect standard raman spectrum for verification of microplastics nanoplastics generated by the polishing following the product s instructions the paint was sprayed on the surface of a car s engine hood 0 6 m2 outdoors 18 c with breeze of 23 km h a sunny day at around 11 a m in the morning with a humidity of 65 after being exposed in air for a week mostly sunny days the paint surface was washed with tap water and then polished with sandpaper 2000 grit flexovit by hand afterwards a washing process with tap water 10 l was followed and the liquid phase 100 ml containing the polishing dust milky appearance was collected using two centrifuge tubes for the test the sample was stable without obvious change in the appearance when stored at room temperature for at least a month before the raman test the sample of 2 μl was dropped onto the gold wafer surface and dried as before after the dropping drying process the sample was washed with milli q water to remove the precipitated salt as indicated below 2 3 raman and sem raman spectra were recorded in the air using a witec confocal raman microscope alpha 300rs germany equipped with a 532 nm laser diode 30 mw a ccd detector cooled to 60 c was used to collect stokes raman signals under a 100 objective lens nikon at room temperature 24 c over the wavenumber range of 0 4000 cm 1 with an integration time of 5 10 s for measurements of single spectrum or 1 2 s per pixel for image mapping in the latter case the stage stepping resolution distance controlled by a piezo driven scanning stage for each raman signal collection at each pixel was usually 200 nm 200 nm pixel which is defined as the image resolution in this study to study the effect of the pixel size it was also changed to 333 nm 333 nm or 100 nm 100 nm as indicated below for raman image mapping the sample was scanned over an area of 10 μm 10 μm using a 100 objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0 9 after generating the mapping image the exact position of the small area was scanned again with a different pixel size as mentioned above the different plastics exhibit different raman activity and emit different intensity of raman spectra as suggested before sobhani et al 2019 in this study the raman signal at 1000 cm 1 assigned to the aromatic ring s breathing vibration was picked up to image the ps nanoplastics the raman signal intensity also depends on the surface morphology of the plastic sample as well as the position of the focal plane on the sample therefore the raman signal s intensity was optimised either by moving the focal plane and adjusting the laser power the signal was analysed using witec project software by just picking up their unique characteristic peaks net intensity for image mapping the interference which might originate from the background noise such as fluorescence or organic matter can be effectively avoided by offsetting the baseline of the collected raman spectra to get the net intensity via software automatically at the selected peaks an exceptional situation occurred when noise akin to a spiked sharp peak such as cosmic rays most likely originating from the ccd detector itself appeared at the selected peak position for the image such as at 1000 cm 1 for ps which is infrequent usually 1 likelihood a laser of 532 nm has been selected in this study because it can emit stronger raman signal than the laser of 633 nm and 785 nm once we make the balance between the laser intensity too strong to burn the plastic sample and the raman intensity too weak to be collected a crucial aspect of collecting raman signal on plastics is to optimise the laser power level to ensure it does not damage via burn the sample of interest in order to accomplish this a plastic particle is located and used to determine the optimum power level an integration time of 5 10 s should be used to ensure when raman peaks are observed the laser power will be at very low levels the power should be turned up slowly until the characteristic peaks for the plastic are observed the power should then be increased slowly until the damage is detected which is indicated by the raman spectra changing from the plastic s characteristic spectrum to amorphous carbon which has two broad peaks at approximately 1580 cm 1 and approximately 1350 cm 1 when this process occurs the laser power level is at the damage threshold and should be reduced by approximately 50 this will be the measurement power level used for the acquisition of all subsequent raman data if possible this power level should also be recorded with a digital power meter to assist further analysis in the future tallant et al 1997 this optimum power level is also dependent on the sample supporting matrix such as carbon tab glass slide and a gold coating silicon wafer as well when a mapping image is generated by the raman intensity at the selected characteristic peaks to visualise the plastic the area of interest from this image can be further identified by extracting the full raman spectrum at the mapping pixel that is at any specific position pixel of the mapping image we can extract the full raman spectrum containing all the peaks not just the selected characteristic peak and compare it with the standard spectrum fingerprint of the reference plastic to verify and confirm if the mapping signal originates either from the specific plastic or from noise the individual mapping images were merged using imagej software an sem zeiss sigma vp equipped with a backscattered electron detector bsd was used to characterise the microplastics nanoplastics morphology without coating an energy dispersive x ray edx signal was also collected at specific positions 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoplastics with a diameter of 600 nm we first tested ps nanoplastics with a diameter of 600 nm the results are shown in fig 1 fig 1 a is an overview picture under the microscope with an objective lens of 100 after zooming in fig 1 b presents the scanning area for raman imaging using the colour scale bar in fig 1 c to extract the raman signal via intensity at a unique peak 1000 cm 1 e the nanoplastics are mapped and presented in fig 1 d sobhani et al 2019 the individual nanoplastics can be identified particularly in the highlighted rectangle areas in fig 1 b d where their position is well matched with a little shifting the possible reason for the position shift from b to d is due to i the physical position shifting of the sample during the mapping process or ii the instrument parameter s variation such as camera detector position illumination excitation wavelength etc between the photo image and the mapping image this shift leads us to firstly map an image in a big area such as 10 μm 10 μm to identify the exact position of the small area of interest such as 1 μm 1 μm for further scanning as discussed below however individual ps nanoplastics are visualised in fig 1 b d and are identified from the raman spectra in fig 1 e where the peak for mapping is arrowed the tiny spot circled at the right bottom in fig 1 d is a noise when compared with the standard raman spectra sobhani et al 2019 and is likely due to a cosmic ray and therefore it should be ignored according to our testing experience the likelihood of mapping noise at the selected unique peak usually also the fingerprint of the plastic 1000 cm 1 for ps as the spot in the image is infrequent usually 1 the rough surface of the carbon tab causes difficulty in focusing for the confocal raman instrument as evidenced in fig 1 b d that is the nanoplastics are not localised in the same horizontal plane for the instrument to pick up the confocal signal when an objective lens of 100 has been employed the spatial resolution along the vertical direction the acceptable variation is 1 3 μm 2λ na 2 where λ is wavelength of the laser 532 nm in this study na is the numerical aperture 0 9 for a 100 objective lens lewandowska 2010 zhang et al 2017 above and below the focal plane zhang et al 2017 the background spectrum in fig 1 e mainly originated from the carbon tab amorphous carbon which is supported by the appearance of two broad peaks at 1350 cm 1 and 1580 cm 1 dychalska et al 2015 to get a clean background and simultaneously a flat surface for distribution of the nanoplastics to simplify the focus issue we prepared our samples on a glass surface or gold coated silicon wafer surface for the following tests in fig 1 f and g the individual and independent nanoplastics can be visualised on the glass surface their positions are well matched between the photo image in fig 1 f and the mapping image in fig 1 g the blue circles in fig 1 f mark the aggregated nanoplastics not the individual independent nanoplastic in the mapping image in fig 1 g it is not easy to distinguish the aggregates from the individual nano plastics although the signal from the aggregate looks stronger than that from the individual nano plastic the different intensity can also be observed in fig 1 h a 3 d mapping image as discussed before sobhani et al 2019 in the 3 d image the height corresponds to the intensity of the raman signal at the mapping peak 1000 cm 1 for ps not the physical height z axis of the nanoplastics that is the mapping image is generated from the raman intensities as pseudo z axis for the 3 d image that are collected along the focal plane by the confocal raman however some similarities can be expected between them ideally the strongest raman signal is collected from the focal plane and the weaker intensity comes from above and below the focal plane however the relationship between the pseudo z axis from raman intensity and the physical z axis spatial position is not expected to be linear or proportional for this reason we will not show the colour scale bar for each mapping image again the raman spectra in fig 1 i confirm that the nanoplastic is made of ps the background is also cleaner than that in fig 1 e suggesting the glass surface is better than the carbon tab for our test the tiny spot in fig 1 g is zoomed in and shown in fig 2 a to generate the mapping image the software witec project 4 1 conducts a colour interpolation by default to smooth and decrease the roughness of the image without this kind of interpolation the mapping image is shown in fig 2 b each pixel has its raman spectrum as shown in c the signal at position 1 actually yields a characteristic raman spectrum of ps confirming and identifying that there is a ps nanoplastic in fig 2 b each pixel such as 1 2 is of a square of 200 nm 200 nm in the meantime the laser spot is a disk airy or fresnel disk its size is constrained by the diffraction limit with a resolution of 300 nm λ 2na or 0 61λ na lewandowska 2010 zhang et al 2017 in the meantime a shorter wavelength of laser can have a better resolution in principle they are different and their relationship is shown in fig 2 d different sizes of plastics nanoplastics i iii and a microplastic are also shown the dashed circle ii means the next step of laser scanning from i with a stage step of δx towards the signal collection for raman mapping for laser spot ii there is no raman signal but only background to be mapped as pixel 2 from pixel 1 with a size of δx δy where δy means the stage step for the next line of laser scanning that is the resolution of a raman image is determined by the pixel size which is adjustable and controlled by the stage step motor of the raman instrument a piezo driven scanning stage not by the laser spot in fig 2 b there is a ps signal at pixel 1 as evidenced by the raman spectrum shown in fig 2 c however there is no ps around from the neighbouring 8 pixels as presented in pixel 2 the other pixel results are not shown therefore the ps nanoplastic at position 1 should be smaller than 200 nm 200 nm as shown in fig 1 g and demonstrated in 2 d this encouraged us to test smaller nanoplastics in the following sections actually in fig 2 d even more than one nanoplastic as presented as i and ii might be located within one laser spot i to be simultaneously excited to yield a raman signal and be mapped as pixel 1 a mapping pixel collects a sum signal from one laser spot i however within the laser spot the laser intensity is strongest at the centre and declines gradually and radially along the direction away from the centre liu et al 2007 zhang and liu 2008 ideally following a gaussian distribution enderlein 2005 nollmann and georgieva 2015 in this case the raman signal from the nanoplastic i is expected to be much stronger because of the more powerful laser or higher power density to excite zhang et al 2017 than that nanoplastic ii weaker or lower power density of laser for raman excitation in the meantime in fig 2 d the laser scanning might meet a blind point such as nanoplastic iii that nanoplastic is not scanned either by the laser i or ii so that it has not been mapped at any pixel in the mapping image in general for the raman mapping image the raman signal varies and depends on zhang et al 2017 i the laser power density ii the illuminated area of the nanoplastic or multiple nanoplastics within a laser spot iii the raman scattering direction or the collection efficiency iv the focal plane on the sample and v the integration time to collect the raman signal more discussion is provided in the following 3 2 nanoplastics with a diameter of 300 nm we decreased the diameter of nanoplastics from 600 nm to 300 nm and the nanoplastic size is now similar to the resolution size of the laser spot fig 3 shows the results collected from a glass slide surface in fig 3 a c their positions are well matched due to the small size of nanoplastic it is difficult to identify the individual nanoplastic from the photo image in fig 3 a although the monolayer pattern can be distinguished marked the monolayer pattern can also be recognised from the raman images in fig 3 b and c the large peak in c right central part circled is due to the overlapping of noise with the signal which should be ignored again for the bright spot marked in the raman image in fig 3 b and c the zoomed in images are shown in fig 3 d f when the colour interpolation is removed the actual collected signal is mapped as an image in fig 3 f which is generated from the peak intensity of ps s unique peak as square marked in fig 3 h in fig 3 h due to the small size of nanoplastic 300 nm vs 600 nm the raman signal is not strong as in fig 1 i however in fig 3 h the characteristic peak of ps is robust enough to generate the mapping image and implies the existence of ps according to the intensity of the raman signal at each pixel in fig 3 f the possible distribution of nanoplastics is proposed in fig 3 g to validate the above hypothesis on the distribution of nanoplastics we have employed sem to determine the morphology information to this end we prepared our sample on a gold wafer surface coated silicon wafer with a thickness of 100 nm to increase the conductivity consequently the background colour of the photo image in fig 4 a is different from that in fig 1 a b f and 3 a moreover after the ps nanoplastics deposition on the surface there is no more coating on the top of the ps nanoplastics and a backscattered electron detector has been used to collect the secondary electrons for the sem image the results are shown in fig 4 in fig 4 a c the nanoplastic positions are well matched among the photo sem and raman images suggesting that an individual nanoplastic with diameter of 300 nm can be imaged and visualised by raman mapping however the raman background from the gold surface is high fig 4 d and the nanoplastics can be easily burnt by the laser the morphology change can be observed by comparing the photo images before and after the laser scanning the laser intensity needs to be balanced too strong might burn target with the raman intensity too weak to be picked up for the test in fig 4 b the background square in the sem image is due to the electron beam scanning and possible carbon contamination griffiths and walther 2010 consequently the individual nanoplastic from this area also yields a higher intensity of raman signal as observed in c the reason is unclear so far we closely examined an individual nanoplastic which is circled in fig 4 b and c under the different pixel size or resolution the images are shown in fig 4 e h when the pixel colour interpolation is removed the image in h is much better than in f in terms of lateral resolution that is to achieve a high resolution mapping image we can directly decrease the size of each pixel in a hope to image the individual nanoplastics as presented in fig 2 d the detailed discussion will be reported in another study fang et al to be submitted in fig 4 h the possible nanoplastic position and size is also indicated and circled 3 3 nanoplastics with a diameter of 100 nm further we tested nanoplastics with a diameter of 100 nm smaller than the size of pixel 200 nm 200 nm and laser spot 300 nm the results are shown in fig 5 the sem images in fig 5 a and b show the typical distribution of nanoplastics on the gold surface note on the bottom but on the top of wafer the gold coating layer with aggregated nanoparticles should be distinguished from the nanoplastics deposited on the top of the gold coating due to the small nanoplastic size 100 nm vs 300 600 nm the raman signal is weak as suggested in fig 5 c however the signal is still meaningful to generate mapping images in fig 5 d g given the software can pick up the raman signal via integrating the peak area after removing the background for these small ps nanoplastics the match and alignment between the photo image not shown here sem and raman image is difficult mainly due to the different wavelength approach for imaging that is the sem image in fig 5 b is not well matched with the mapping image of d but shows the typical morphology of the nanoplastics distribution nearby however when the image in fig 5 d is generated we can select the exact position for zoomed in scanning as shown in fig 5 e and f the increased pixel resolution from 333 nm 333 nm e to 100 nm 100 nm f led to an increased mapping image resolution again supporting the above hypothesis in the meantime the 3 d image of the mapping of an individual nanoplastic of 100 nm is presented in fig 5 g due to the diffraction limit of the laser spot the mapping size looks like the laser spot 300 nm rather than the nanoplastic itself 100 nm which will be discussed in another paper again fang et al to be submitted in general all the spots in fig 5 d depending on the intensity can be assigned to either the aggregated nanoplastics or individual ones with diameter of 100 nm if not due to noise chance is low and less than 1 in our test in other words nanoplastics down to 100 nm can be mapped and visualised even though the signal is weak fig 5 c d and the mapping size might be bigger than its physical size fig 5 f g 3 4 polishing dust of car paint the test described above can map and image individual nanoplastics down to 100 nm to validate this technique we tested real samples that were collected from the paint polishing dust during the process to polish our vehicle s paint the clear coating of poly acrylic the results are shown in figs 6 and 7 according to their different morphology in the photo image in fig 6 a we can see three particles a large particle of 7 μm at the centre and two smaller particles of 1 2 μm on the left their detailed morphology can be seen from the sem image in fig 6 e two types of morphology might originate from the different formation process of the paint when sprayed in air i the flower like structure with a size of 7 μm is likely from the nucleation of aerogel in air lang et al 2019 xue and ma 2013 which is usually regarded as failed painted ii the irregular particles with size of 1 2 μm perhaps originate from the polishing dust after being successfully painted on the engine hood the exact deposition and formation of paint including nucleation and growth and subsequent polishing are complicated and beyond the scope of this study keddie et al 1996 seubert et al 2016 in the meantime the possible morphology change of the paint polishing dusts during and after the sample preparation should not be ignored such as during the dropping drying and the curing storing processes of the dusts in air when and after distributed on the gold wafer surface during the sem process due to the electron beam charging or the vacuum of the sem chamber etc however no matter those changes happen or not when the polishing dusts are washed away from the driveway and into the drain system if not appropriately treated potentially and eventually they will be released into the environment when we map them using raman the images are shown in fig 6 b d actually the paint of poly acrylic clean coating is a mixture gelder et al 2005 as supported by the spectrum shown in fig 6 f from the raman spectrum of standard sprayed on glass slide with a thickness of 1 mm the fluorescence background is observed with a broad peak centre at 1600 cm 1 and extended from 500 cm 1 to 2200 cm 1 the typical peak of poly acrylic is at 1000 cm 1 gelder et al 2005 and the common peak of plastic c h is at 2850 cm 1 sobhani et al 2019 which are selected to generate mapping images respectively these selected peaks along with the fluorescence background can confirm the existence of plastic dust rather than the sandpaper dust which is generally either alumina peaked at 800 cm 1 zappa et al 2015 or silicon carbide peaked at 789 cm 1 and 965 cm 1 lin et al 2012 while the microplastics can be mapped in fig 6 b small nanoplastics are also mapped as shown in c in fig 6 c the tiny spots 200 nm 200 nm of the pixel size of nanoplastic can be verified from the spectra shown in fig 6 g where the signal at 2850 cm 1 is typical for plastic sobhani et al 2019 by justifying their raman spectra more than 50 of the mapped dots in fig 6 c can be assigned to nanoplastics when we merge them b c together and present as d we can see that two types of plastic or two formulations gelder et al 2005 are mapped identified and visualised with size ranging from microplastics of 7 μm down to nanoplastics of 200 nm the above results are typical for microplastics nanoplastics near the centre of the dropping drying pattern with a low density the boundary of the pattern was also tested where the particle density is much higher due to the coffee ring effect wong et al 2011 the morphology is different as presented in fig 7 after sample preparation by the dropping drying process some tree like patterns in fig 7 a are assigned to the salt precipitates that is when the liquid sample was dropped and dried the salt from the tap water precipitated and generated the tree like patterns to remove the salt pattern the sample was subsequently washed with milli q water after the dropping drying but before the sem and raman tests consequently the typical sem looks like the images in fig 7 b d at different positons and under the different magnifications small dusts of nanoplastics down to 200 nm can be seen from the sem image in fig 7 b again the mixture of paint gelder et al 2005 means we can map two types of nanoplastic as presented in fig 7 e f from microplastics 1000 nm to nanoplastics down to 200 nm we can see their distribution when they are merged together as shown in fig 7 g note all the microplastics nanoplastics cannot be identified under the sem images in fig 7 a d and photo image h which suggests the advantages of raman imaging in the meantime edx spectra in fig 7 i have been recorded at the marked positions in fig 7 d while the peaks of silicon si and gold au are assigned to the gold wafer as background and should be ignored the dust at position 1 is from the residue salt nacl mainly because the peaks of c and o are weak however the dusts 2 3 yield much stronger peaks of c and o ribeiro et al 2013 further evidence of the existence of plastic to support the raman mapping image the different peak intensity of c and o also support the hypothesis on the two types of plastics for microplastics nanoplastics gelder et al 2005 as mapped with different colours red and green in the raman mapping images the average density in number of the microplastics nanoplastics in figs 6 e and 7 a c is estimated at 0 01 0 1 μm2 for the pattern in fig 7 a inset with a diameter of 2 mm or an area of 3 14 mm2 a droplet of 2 μl has been dropped and dried it is thus estimated that the droplet might contain 3 104 3 105 microplastics nanoplastics considering the washing process after the paint polishing has employed 10 l water we estimated that 1 5 1011 1 5 1012 microplastics nanoplastics were generated by hand polishing an engine hood 0 6 m2 surface area this value billions trillions of microplastics nanoplastics might be under estimated when considering the distribution of tiny nanoplastics in figs 6 d and 7 g it is not clear whether or not a machine polishing can generate more or less microplastics nanoplastics or different morphology of microplastics nanoplastics however it is recommended that the personal protective equipment ppe such as mask and gloves should be put on at least if we are concerned about microplastics nanoplastics at this level of analysis of nanoplastics we can achieve qualitative information however it is difficult to obtain quantitative results due to i reference intensity of the raman signal should be developed because of the variation in raman signal itself ii different magnification of the microscope means the mapping image at nano scale might be neither representative nor typical for that at micro and milli scale iii the environmental sample of plastics might assume different shapes including fibre film pellet etc koelmans et al 2019 rather than a sphere that is tested here this variation on the shape might lead to the focusing difficulty for a confocal raman and iv sample preparation is also difficult including how to extract and collect microplastics nanoplastics from the environment how to distribute them on a flat surface for raman mapping and how to distinguish the raman signal from the environment background etc perhaps the sample preparation can be improved through fractionation of microplastic using sequential filtration this will help the categorisation of microplastics nanoplastics into different size hernandez et al 2017 another issue is when the pixel size is decreased for imaging the scanning duration is increased from 9 s with a pixel size of 333 nm 333 nm to 100 s with a pixel size of 100 nm 100 nm to scan an area of 1 μm 1 μm or from 36 s to 400 s to scan an area of 2 μm 2 μm if each pixel takes 1 s to collect the raman signal further research is needed to address these issues 4 conclusions in this study we successfully visualised and mapped microplastics nanoplastics from 1000 nm down to 100 nm we also tested this raman imaging technique to analyse real life samples these results are encouraging and further research is ongoing for example when the nanoplastic size is smaller than that of the laser spot from the raman image the size of the imaged nanoplastic is actually determined and limited by the collected raman signal the stage stepping resolution pixel size and the laser spot size rather than by the nanoplastic size itself how to overcome these limits particularly the diffraction limit of the laser spot to increase the image resolution towards the visualisation of the individual nanoplastics is a challenge and will be discussed in another study fang et al to be submitted declaration of competing

18075,while microplastics 1 μm 5 mm contamination is creating public concern nanoplastics 1000 nm might create even more serious environmental contamination issues this is likely due to the smaller size higher specific surface area of nanoplastics which works more efficiently as a vector for other contaminants transportation and fate to release the formulation additives and to be accumulated in the human body the research on nanoplastics is currently hampered by the absence of an effective characterisation method although x ray photoelectron spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy xps sem is reportedly dominating the nanoplastics characterisation approaches recently imaging technology which provides direct visualisation of the targets is attracting increased attention in this study we demonstrate that raman imaging can be employed to visualise and identify microplastics and nanoplastics down to 100 nm by distinguishing the laser spot the pixel size image resolution the nanoplastics size position within a laser spot the raman signal intensity and via the sample preparation etc we also validate this technique for the analysis of paint polishing dust samples that have been collected from a driveway when a vehicle s clear coating of poly acrylic was polished by hand we estimate that billions trillions of microplastics nanoplastics ranging from 7 μm down to 200 nm have been generated by hand polishing an engine hood graphical abstract image 1096 keywords microplastic nanoplastic environmental contamination raman mapping image paint polishing dust 1 introduction introduction of plastics into the environment is creating considerable public concern eerkes medrano et al 2015 small sized plastics 5 mm have been detected in air water foods and terrestrial systems cox et al 2019 jiang 2018 koelmans et al 2019 kosuth et al 2018 liebezeit and liebezeit 2014 ng et al 2018 and have been found to accumulate in aquatic organisms either from primary or secondary sources the primary source refers to the plastics that are released into the environment directly from domestic and industrial sources andrady 2017 while the secondary source is from the fragmentation of plastic debris through mechanical or biological stressors andrady 2017 arthur et al 2009 browne 2015 gigault et al 2018 generally small plastic pieces can be categorised as microplastics 1 μm 5 mm hartmann et al 2016 and nanoplastics 1000 nm gigault et al 2018 hartmann et al 2019 although there is still some debates about the size boundary 1000 nm vs 100 nm between the two categories alimi et al 2018 gigault et al 2018 picó and barceló 2019 currently microplastics dominate the research schymanski et al 2018 tagg et al 2015 because of their potential environmental impact for example winkler et al 2019 showed a considerable increase of microplastics in water bottles as the result of bottle openings closings and mechanical stress unfortunately nanoplastics might create more adverse environmental issues given the nano size and the corresponding chemico physical properties affecting their sorption transportation fate and bioavailability etc domingos et al 2009 lead et al 2018 although various studies have been carried out for the characterisation of microplastics cabernard et al 2018 enders et al 2015 lenz 1993 sobhani et al 2019 there is a lack of suitable analytical methods for nanoplastics nanoparticles can enter living organisms either through the food chain or inhalation moore 2006 oberdörster 2004 recent research reported that billions of microplastics nanoplastics from tea bags might enter our body daily when we drink tea hernandez et al 2019 another report showed that nanoplastics could accumulate in organs lee et al 2019 considering their nano size and hydrophobic nature nanoplastics can affect activity and feeding behaviour mattsson et al 2017 and potentially metabolism mattsson et al 2015 of living organisms another concern is that nanoplastics can be the source of contamination by releasing chemicals including monomers and the formulation ingredients of polymers or by concentrating toxic chemicals from the environment wright and kelly 2017 this is a serious concern since nanoplastics have much higher specific surface area than microplastics therefore there is an urgent need to effectively characterise nanoplastics along with microplastics as the fate of plastic fragmentation under natural conditions is unknown moreover better understanding of the potential exposure and human health risk assessments require a standard identification method koelmans et al 2019 optical spectral techniques have been used for chemical identification of surface texture and structural information of microplastics song et al 2015 such as x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps hernandez et al 2019 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir tagg et al 2015 and raman spectroscopy schymanski et al 2018 the first study on nanoplastics characterisation has been conducted by hernandez et al 2017 they confirmed the presence of polyethylene nanoparticles in commercial facial scrubs ranging in size from 24 to 52 nm using xps and ftir the problem with this technique is that xps provides the element information that neither directly corresponds with the polymer of the plastic nor with the image while ftir can yield the direct spectrum information of a polymer towards imaging the lateral resolution is usually low 20 μm due to the wavelength of ir 2 5 50 μm löder and gerdts 2015 another challenge for the analysis of an individual nanoplastic from an environmental sample is that the small size of nanoplastic usually generates a weak signal for analysis which might result in large numbers of false positives or false negatives even for microplastics song et al 2015 consequently more research needs to be done to improve the characterisation of nanoplastics andrady 2017 as molecular vibration spectra ftir and raman are known as reference methods for identification and characterisation of microplastics cabernard et al 2018 both techniques are non destructive and characterise microplastics via a vibrational spectra as different microplastics exhibit different spectra which is unique and akin to a fingerprint araujo et al 2018 by collecting the unique spectra with position information such as at each pixel an image can be generated to directly visualise and image the microplastics sobhani et al 2019 for example micro ftir is known as a successful method for visualisation of different microplastics in wastewater down to 20 μm erni cassola et al 2017 raman spectroscopy as another method for the characterisation of microplastics can identify and image microplastics down to 1 μm sobhani et al 2019 compared with ftir aside from raman s better lateral resolution 1 μm vs 20 μm raman provides a higher spectral coverage with a highly specific fingerprint spectrum and lower interference from water ivleva et al 2017 vašková 2011 however whether raman can be employed to image nanoplastics is unknown this study aims to image visualise and identify nanoplastics down to 100 nm using raman mapping sem is employed to confirm the analysis of nanoplastics along with microplastics to validate this technique we tested the real samples of paint polishing dust which were collected from our driveway when we polished our vehicle s clear coating of poly acrylic by hand and do it yourself diy kit 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and microplastics nanoplastics all nanoplastics and chemicals including polystyrene ps nanoparticles 2 aqueous suspension with diameters of 600 nm 300 nm and 100 nm respectively sulphuric acid h2so4 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were purchased from sigma aldrich australia and used as received unless further indicated 2 2 sample preparation as the sample supporting matrix carbon tab proscitech glass slide and gold coating silicon wafer both from sigma aldrich australia were used glass slide and gold silicon wafer were cleaned by dipping into piranha solution 2 1 h2so4 h2o2 v v overnight to remove any possible organic contaminants sherman 1990 be careful this solution reacts vigorously with organic compounds the carbon tab was peeled off to remove the capping paper at the point of sample preparation for the analysis of ps nanoplastics distribution ps nanoplastics were diluted 10 times v v with milli q water with sonication for 5 min subsequently a droplet 2 μl was spread and distributed on the surface of the carbon tab glass slide or gold wafer after gently blow drying with nitrogen the sample was stored in air for the test our first test suggested that the bumpy surface of the carbon tab led to a focusing challenge on confocal raman therefore we then deposited our ps nanoplastics onto the glass surface for raman and the gold wafer surface for raman and sem as discussed below real samples were collected on the driveway when a car was polished by hand following do it yourself diy instructions a clear coating paint spray can of top coat clear 150 g ds117 was purchased from a local store super cheap auto australia due to commercial reasons the exact ingredients of the poly acrylic paint are unknown we sprayed the paint on a glass slide surface as a reference to collect standard raman spectrum for verification of microplastics nanoplastics generated by the polishing following the product s instructions the paint was sprayed on the surface of a car s engine hood 0 6 m2 outdoors 18 c with breeze of 23 km h a sunny day at around 11 a m in the morning with a humidity of 65 after being exposed in air for a week mostly sunny days the paint surface was washed with tap water and then polished with sandpaper 2000 grit flexovit by hand afterwards a washing process with tap water 10 l was followed and the liquid phase 100 ml containing the polishing dust milky appearance was collected using two centrifuge tubes for the test the sample was stable without obvious change in the appearance when stored at room temperature for at least a month before the raman test the sample of 2 μl was dropped onto the gold wafer surface and dried as before after the dropping drying process the sample was washed with milli q water to remove the precipitated salt as indicated below 2 3 raman and sem raman spectra were recorded in the air using a witec confocal raman microscope alpha 300rs germany equipped with a 532 nm laser diode 30 mw a ccd detector cooled to 60 c was used to collect stokes raman signals under a 100 objective lens nikon at room temperature 24 c over the wavenumber range of 0 4000 cm 1 with an integration time of 5 10 s for measurements of single spectrum or 1 2 s per pixel for image mapping in the latter case the stage stepping resolution distance controlled by a piezo driven scanning stage for each raman signal collection at each pixel was usually 200 nm 200 nm pixel which is defined as the image resolution in this study to study the effect of the pixel size it was also changed to 333 nm 333 nm or 100 nm 100 nm as indicated below for raman image mapping the sample was scanned over an area of 10 μm 10 μm using a 100 objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0 9 after generating the mapping image the exact position of the small area was scanned again with a different pixel size as mentioned above the different plastics exhibit different raman activity and emit different intensity of raman spectra as suggested before sobhani et al 2019 in this study the raman signal at 1000 cm 1 assigned to the aromatic ring s breathing vibration was picked up to image the ps nanoplastics the raman signal intensity also depends on the surface morphology of the plastic sample as well as the position of the focal plane on the sample therefore the raman signal s intensity was optimised either by moving the focal plane and adjusting the laser power the signal was analysed using witec project software by just picking up their unique characteristic peaks net intensity for image mapping the interference which might originate from the background noise such as fluorescence or organic matter can be effectively avoided by offsetting the baseline of the collected raman spectra to get the net intensity via software automatically at the selected peaks an exceptional situation occurred when noise akin to a spiked sharp peak such as cosmic rays most likely originating from the ccd detector itself appeared at the selected peak position for the image such as at 1000 cm 1 for ps which is infrequent usually 1 likelihood a laser of 532 nm has been selected in this study because it can emit stronger raman signal than the laser of 633 nm and 785 nm once we make the balance between the laser intensity too strong to burn the plastic sample and the raman intensity too weak to be collected a crucial aspect of collecting raman signal on plastics is to optimise the laser power level to ensure it does not damage via burn the sample of interest in order to accomplish this a plastic particle is located and used to determine the optimum power level an integration time of 5 10 s should be used to ensure when raman peaks are observed the laser power will be at very low levels the power should be turned up slowly until the characteristic peaks for the plastic are observed the power should then be increased slowly until the damage is detected which is indicated by the raman spectra changing from the plastic s characteristic spectrum to amorphous carbon which has two broad peaks at approximately 1580 cm 1 and approximately 1350 cm 1 when this process occurs the laser power level is at the damage threshold and should be reduced by approximately 50 this will be the measurement power level used for the acquisition of all subsequent raman data if possible this power level should also be recorded with a digital power meter to assist further analysis in the future tallant et al 1997 this optimum power level is also dependent on the sample supporting matrix such as carbon tab glass slide and a gold coating silicon wafer as well when a mapping image is generated by the raman intensity at the selected characteristic peaks to visualise the plastic the area of interest from this image can be further identified by extracting the full raman spectrum at the mapping pixel that is at any specific position pixel of the mapping image we can extract the full raman spectrum containing all the peaks not just the selected characteristic peak and compare it with the standard spectrum fingerprint of the reference plastic to verify and confirm if the mapping signal originates either from the specific plastic or from noise the individual mapping images were merged using imagej software an sem zeiss sigma vp equipped with a backscattered electron detector bsd was used to characterise the microplastics nanoplastics morphology without coating an energy dispersive x ray edx signal was also collected at specific positions 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoplastics with a diameter of 600 nm we first tested ps nanoplastics with a diameter of 600 nm the results are shown in fig 1 fig 1 a is an overview picture under the microscope with an objective lens of 100 after zooming in fig 1 b presents the scanning area for raman imaging using the colour scale bar in fig 1 c to extract the raman signal via intensity at a unique peak 1000 cm 1 e the nanoplastics are mapped and presented in fig 1 d sobhani et al 2019 the individual nanoplastics can be identified particularly in the highlighted rectangle areas in fig 1 b d where their position is well matched with a little shifting the possible reason for the position shift from b to d is due to i the physical position shifting of the sample during the mapping process or ii the instrument parameter s variation such as camera detector position illumination excitation wavelength etc between the photo image and the mapping image this shift leads us to firstly map an image in a big area such as 10 μm 10 μm to identify the exact position of the small area of interest such as 1 μm 1 μm for further scanning as discussed below however individual ps nanoplastics are visualised in fig 1 b d and are identified from the raman spectra in fig 1 e where the peak for mapping is arrowed the tiny spot circled at the right bottom in fig 1 d is a noise when compared with the standard raman spectra sobhani et al 2019 and is likely due to a cosmic ray and therefore it should be ignored according to our testing experience the likelihood of mapping noise at the selected unique peak usually also the fingerprint of the plastic 1000 cm 1 for ps as the spot in the image is infrequent usually 1 the rough surface of the carbon tab causes difficulty in focusing for the confocal raman instrument as evidenced in fig 1 b d that is the nanoplastics are not localised in the same horizontal plane for the instrument to pick up the confocal signal when an objective lens of 100 has been employed the spatial resolution along the vertical direction the acceptable variation is 1 3 μm 2λ na 2 where λ is wavelength of the laser 532 nm in this study na is the numerical aperture 0 9 for a 100 objective lens lewandowska 2010 zhang et al 2017 above and below the focal plane zhang et al 2017 the background spectrum in fig 1 e mainly originated from the carbon tab amorphous carbon which is supported by the appearance of two broad peaks at 1350 cm 1 and 1580 cm 1 dychalska et al 2015 to get a clean background and simultaneously a flat surface for distribution of the nanoplastics to simplify the focus issue we prepared our samples on a glass surface or gold coated silicon wafer surface for the following tests in fig 1 f and g the individual and independent nanoplastics can be visualised on the glass surface their positions are well matched between the photo image in fig 1 f and the mapping image in fig 1 g the blue circles in fig 1 f mark the aggregated nanoplastics not the individual independent nanoplastic in the mapping image in fig 1 g it is not easy to distinguish the aggregates from the individual nano plastics although the signal from the aggregate looks stronger than that from the individual nano plastic the different intensity can also be observed in fig 1 h a 3 d mapping image as discussed before sobhani et al 2019 in the 3 d image the height corresponds to the intensity of the raman signal at the mapping peak 1000 cm 1 for ps not the physical height z axis of the nanoplastics that is the mapping image is generated from the raman intensities as pseudo z axis for the 3 d image that are collected along the focal plane by the confocal raman however some similarities can be expected between them ideally the strongest raman signal is collected from the focal plane and the weaker intensity comes from above and below the focal plane however the relationship between the pseudo z axis from raman intensity and the physical z axis spatial position is not expected to be linear or proportional for this reason we will not show the colour scale bar for each mapping image again the raman spectra in fig 1 i confirm that the nanoplastic is made of ps the background is also cleaner than that in fig 1 e suggesting the glass surface is better than the carbon tab for our test the tiny spot in fig 1 g is zoomed in and shown in fig 2 a to generate the mapping image the software witec project 4 1 conducts a colour interpolation by default to smooth and decrease the roughness of the image without this kind of interpolation the mapping image is shown in fig 2 b each pixel has its raman spectrum as shown in c the signal at position 1 actually yields a characteristic raman spectrum of ps confirming and identifying that there is a ps nanoplastic in fig 2 b each pixel such as 1 2 is of a square of 200 nm 200 nm in the meantime the laser spot is a disk airy or fresnel disk its size is constrained by the diffraction limit with a resolution of 300 nm λ 2na or 0 61λ na lewandowska 2010 zhang et al 2017 in the meantime a shorter wavelength of laser can have a better resolution in principle they are different and their relationship is shown in fig 2 d different sizes of plastics nanoplastics i iii and a microplastic are also shown the dashed circle ii means the next step of laser scanning from i with a stage step of δx towards the signal collection for raman mapping for laser spot ii there is no raman signal but only background to be mapped as pixel 2 from pixel 1 with a size of δx δy where δy means the stage step for the next line of laser scanning that is the resolution of a raman image is determined by the pixel size which is adjustable and controlled by the stage step motor of the raman instrument a piezo driven scanning stage not by the laser spot in fig 2 b there is a ps signal at pixel 1 as evidenced by the raman spectrum shown in fig 2 c however there is no ps around from the neighbouring 8 pixels as presented in pixel 2 the other pixel results are not shown therefore the ps nanoplastic at position 1 should be smaller than 200 nm 200 nm as shown in fig 1 g and demonstrated in 2 d this encouraged us to test smaller nanoplastics in the following sections actually in fig 2 d even more than one nanoplastic as presented as i and ii might be located within one laser spot i to be simultaneously excited to yield a raman signal and be mapped as pixel 1 a mapping pixel collects a sum signal from one laser spot i however within the laser spot the laser intensity is strongest at the centre and declines gradually and radially along the direction away from the centre liu et al 2007 zhang and liu 2008 ideally following a gaussian distribution enderlein 2005 nollmann and georgieva 2015 in this case the raman signal from the nanoplastic i is expected to be much stronger because of the more powerful laser or higher power density to excite zhang et al 2017 than that nanoplastic ii weaker or lower power density of laser for raman excitation in the meantime in fig 2 d the laser scanning might meet a blind point such as nanoplastic iii that nanoplastic is not scanned either by the laser i or ii so that it has not been mapped at any pixel in the mapping image in general for the raman mapping image the raman signal varies and depends on zhang et al 2017 i the laser power density ii the illuminated area of the nanoplastic or multiple nanoplastics within a laser spot iii the raman scattering direction or the collection efficiency iv the focal plane on the sample and v the integration time to collect the raman signal more discussion is provided in the following 3 2 nanoplastics with a diameter of 300 nm we decreased the diameter of nanoplastics from 600 nm to 300 nm and the nanoplastic size is now similar to the resolution size of the laser spot fig 3 shows the results collected from a glass slide surface in fig 3 a c their positions are well matched due to the small size of nanoplastic it is difficult to identify the individual nanoplastic from the photo image in fig 3 a although the monolayer pattern can be distinguished marked the monolayer pattern can also be recognised from the raman images in fig 3 b and c the large peak in c right central part circled is due to the overlapping of noise with the signal which should be ignored again for the bright spot marked in the raman image in fig 3 b and c the zoomed in images are shown in fig 3 d f when the colour interpolation is removed the actual collected signal is mapped as an image in fig 3 f which is generated from the peak intensity of ps s unique peak as square marked in fig 3 h in fig 3 h due to the small size of nanoplastic 300 nm vs 600 nm the raman signal is not strong as in fig 1 i however in fig 3 h the characteristic peak of ps is robust enough to generate the mapping image and implies the existence of ps according to the intensity of the raman signal at each pixel in fig 3 f the possible distribution of nanoplastics is proposed in fig 3 g to validate the above hypothesis on the distribution of nanoplastics we have employed sem to determine the morphology information to this end we prepared our sample on a gold wafer surface coated silicon wafer with a thickness of 100 nm to increase the conductivity consequently the background colour of the photo image in fig 4 a is different from that in fig 1 a b f and 3 a moreover after the ps nanoplastics deposition on the surface there is no more coating on the top of the ps nanoplastics and a backscattered electron detector has been used to collect the secondary electrons for the sem image the results are shown in fig 4 in fig 4 a c the nanoplastic positions are well matched among the photo sem and raman images suggesting that an individual nanoplastic with diameter of 300 nm can be imaged and visualised by raman mapping however the raman background from the gold surface is high fig 4 d and the nanoplastics can be easily burnt by the laser the morphology change can be observed by comparing the photo images before and after the laser scanning the laser intensity needs to be balanced too strong might burn target with the raman intensity too weak to be picked up for the test in fig 4 b the background square in the sem image is due to the electron beam scanning and possible carbon contamination griffiths and walther 2010 consequently the individual nanoplastic from this area also yields a higher intensity of raman signal as observed in c the reason is unclear so far we closely examined an individual nanoplastic which is circled in fig 4 b and c under the different pixel size or resolution the images are shown in fig 4 e h when the pixel colour interpolation is removed the image in h is much better than in f in terms of lateral resolution that is to achieve a high resolution mapping image we can directly decrease the size of each pixel in a hope to image the individual nanoplastics as presented in fig 2 d the detailed discussion will be reported in another study fang et al to be submitted in fig 4 h the possible nanoplastic position and size is also indicated and circled 3 3 nanoplastics with a diameter of 100 nm further we tested nanoplastics with a diameter of 100 nm smaller than the size of pixel 200 nm 200 nm and laser spot 300 nm the results are shown in fig 5 the sem images in fig 5 a and b show the typical distribution of nanoplastics on the gold surface note on the bottom but on the top of wafer the gold coating layer with aggregated nanoparticles should be distinguished from the nanoplastics deposited on the top of the gold coating due to the small nanoplastic size 100 nm vs 300 600 nm the raman signal is weak as suggested in fig 5 c however the signal is still meaningful to generate mapping images in fig 5 d g given the software can pick up the raman signal via integrating the peak area after removing the background for these small ps nanoplastics the match and alignment between the photo image not shown here sem and raman image is difficult mainly due to the different wavelength approach for imaging that is the sem image in fig 5 b is not well matched with the mapping image of d but shows the typical morphology of the nanoplastics distribution nearby however when the image in fig 5 d is generated we can select the exact position for zoomed in scanning as shown in fig 5 e and f the increased pixel resolution from 333 nm 333 nm e to 100 nm 100 nm f led to an increased mapping image resolution again supporting the above hypothesis in the meantime the 3 d image of the mapping of an individual nanoplastic of 100 nm is presented in fig 5 g due to the diffraction limit of the laser spot the mapping size looks like the laser spot 300 nm rather than the nanoplastic itself 100 nm which will be discussed in another paper again fang et al to be submitted in general all the spots in fig 5 d depending on the intensity can be assigned to either the aggregated nanoplastics or individual ones with diameter of 100 nm if not due to noise chance is low and less than 1 in our test in other words nanoplastics down to 100 nm can be mapped and visualised even though the signal is weak fig 5 c d and the mapping size might be bigger than its physical size fig 5 f g 3 4 polishing dust of car paint the test described above can map and image individual nanoplastics down to 100 nm to validate this technique we tested real samples that were collected from the paint polishing dust during the process to polish our vehicle s paint the clear coating of poly acrylic the results are shown in figs 6 and 7 according to their different morphology in the photo image in fig 6 a we can see three particles a large particle of 7 μm at the centre and two smaller particles of 1 2 μm on the left their detailed morphology can be seen from the sem image in fig 6 e two types of morphology might originate from the different formation process of the paint when sprayed in air i the flower like structure with a size of 7 μm is likely from the nucleation of aerogel in air lang et al 2019 xue and ma 2013 which is usually regarded as failed painted ii the irregular particles with size of 1 2 μm perhaps originate from the polishing dust after being successfully painted on the engine hood the exact deposition and formation of paint including nucleation and growth and subsequent polishing are complicated and beyond the scope of this study keddie et al 1996 seubert et al 2016 in the meantime the possible morphology change of the paint polishing dusts during and after the sample preparation should not be ignored such as during the dropping drying and the curing storing processes of the dusts in air when and after distributed on the gold wafer surface during the sem process due to the electron beam charging or the vacuum of the sem chamber etc however no matter those changes happen or not when the polishing dusts are washed away from the driveway and into the drain system if not appropriately treated potentially and eventually they will be released into the environment when we map them using raman the images are shown in fig 6 b d actually the paint of poly acrylic clean coating is a mixture gelder et al 2005 as supported by the spectrum shown in fig 6 f from the raman spectrum of standard sprayed on glass slide with a thickness of 1 mm the fluorescence background is observed with a broad peak centre at 1600 cm 1 and extended from 500 cm 1 to 2200 cm 1 the typical peak of poly acrylic is at 1000 cm 1 gelder et al 2005 and the common peak of plastic c h is at 2850 cm 1 sobhani et al 2019 which are selected to generate mapping images respectively these selected peaks along with the fluorescence background can confirm the existence of plastic dust rather than the sandpaper dust which is generally either alumina peaked at 800 cm 1 zappa et al 2015 or silicon carbide peaked at 789 cm 1 and 965 cm 1 lin et al 2012 while the microplastics can be mapped in fig 6 b small nanoplastics are also mapped as shown in c in fig 6 c the tiny spots 200 nm 200 nm of the pixel size of nanoplastic can be verified from the spectra shown in fig 6 g where the signal at 2850 cm 1 is typical for plastic sobhani et al 2019 by justifying their raman spectra more than 50 of the mapped dots in fig 6 c can be assigned to nanoplastics when we merge them b c together and present as d we can see that two types of plastic or two formulations gelder et al 2005 are mapped identified and visualised with size ranging from microplastics of 7 μm down to nanoplastics of 200 nm the above results are typical for microplastics nanoplastics near the centre of the dropping drying pattern with a low density the boundary of the pattern was also tested where the particle density is much higher due to the coffee ring effect wong et al 2011 the morphology is different as presented in fig 7 after sample preparation by the dropping drying process some tree like patterns in fig 7 a are assigned to the salt precipitates that is when the liquid sample was dropped and dried the salt from the tap water precipitated and generated the tree like patterns to remove the salt pattern the sample was subsequently washed with milli q water after the dropping drying but before the sem and raman tests consequently the typical sem looks like the images in fig 7 b d at different positons and under the different magnifications small dusts of nanoplastics down to 200 nm can be seen from the sem image in fig 7 b again the mixture of paint gelder et al 2005 means we can map two types of nanoplastic as presented in fig 7 e f from microplastics 1000 nm to nanoplastics down to 200 nm we can see their distribution when they are merged together as shown in fig 7 g note all the microplastics nanoplastics cannot be identified under the sem images in fig 7 a d and photo image h which suggests the advantages of raman imaging in the meantime edx spectra in fig 7 i have been recorded at the marked positions in fig 7 d while the peaks of silicon si and gold au are assigned to the gold wafer as background and should be ignored the dust at position 1 is from the residue salt nacl mainly because the peaks of c and o are weak however the dusts 2 3 yield much stronger peaks of c and o ribeiro et al 2013 further evidence of the existence of plastic to support the raman mapping image the different peak intensity of c and o also support the hypothesis on the two types of plastics for microplastics nanoplastics gelder et al 2005 as mapped with different colours red and green in the raman mapping images the average density in number of the microplastics nanoplastics in figs 6 e and 7 a c is estimated at 0 01 0 1 μm2 for the pattern in fig 7 a inset with a diameter of 2 mm or an area of 3 14 mm2 a droplet of 2 μl has been dropped and dried it is thus estimated that the droplet might contain 3 104 3 105 microplastics nanoplastics considering the washing process after the paint polishing has employed 10 l water we estimated that 1 5 1011 1 5 1012 microplastics nanoplastics were generated by hand polishing an engine hood 0 6 m2 surface area this value billions trillions of microplastics nanoplastics might be under estimated when considering the distribution of tiny nanoplastics in figs 6 d and 7 g it is not clear whether or not a machine polishing can generate more or less microplastics nanoplastics or different morphology of microplastics nanoplastics however it is recommended that the personal protective equipment ppe such as mask and gloves should be put on at least if we are concerned about microplastics nanoplastics at this level of analysis of nanoplastics we can achieve qualitative information however it is difficult to obtain quantitative results due to i reference intensity of the raman signal should be developed because of the variation in raman signal itself ii different magnification of the microscope means the mapping image at nano scale might be neither representative nor typical for that at micro and milli scale iii the environmental sample of plastics might assume different shapes including fibre film pellet etc koelmans et al 2019 rather than a sphere that is tested here this variation on the shape might lead to the focusing difficulty for a confocal raman and iv sample preparation is also difficult including how to extract and collect microplastics nanoplastics from the environment how to distribute them on a flat surface for raman mapping and how to distinguish the raman signal from the environment background etc perhaps the sample preparation can be improved through fractionation of microplastic using sequential filtration this will help the categorisation of microplastics nanoplastics into different size hernandez et al 2017 another issue is when the pixel size is decreased for imaging the scanning duration is increased from 9 s with a pixel size of 333 nm 333 nm to 100 s with a pixel size of 100 nm 100 nm to scan an area of 1 μm 1 μm or from 36 s to 400 s to scan an area of 2 μm 2 μm if each pixel takes 1 s to collect the raman signal further research is needed to address these issues 4 conclusions in this study we successfully visualised and mapped microplastics nanoplastics from 1000 nm down to 100 nm we also tested this raman imaging technique to analyse real life samples these results are encouraging and further research is ongoing for example when the nanoplastic size is smaller than that of the laser spot from the raman image the size of the imaged nanoplastic is actually determined and limited by the collected raman signal the stage stepping resolution pixel size and the laser spot size rather than by the nanoplastic size itself how to overcome these limits particularly the diffraction limit of the laser spot to increase the image resolution towards the visualisation of the individual nanoplastics is a challenge and will be discussed in another study fang et al to be submitted declaration of competing

from wastewater to agriculture harder et al 2019 mehta et al 2015 the challenge of transitioning to resource efficient urban water systems is often not the availability of technology for resource recovery but the lack of planning and design methodology to identify and deploy the most sustainable solution in a given context guest et al 2009 life cycle assessment lca provides a method to assess wastewater based resource recovery alternatives from environmental sustainability perspectives and it can be combined with other context specific assessment techniques such as life cycle costing and risk assessments to evaluate alternatives guest et al 2009 lca is a framework to quantify environmental impact potentials benefits or burdens of processes and products throughout their life cycle in some cases it provides insights of potential trade offs between different environmental impacts hellweg and canals 2014 and or economic performance when integrating with life cycle costing zijp et al 2017 in the field of urban water management lca has become a popular approach to assess environmental performance of operating and upgrading water supply systems and wastewater treatment systems in particular some of these lca studies aim to evaluate different nutrient recovery strategies sena and hicks 2018 and sludge management approaches pradel et al 2016 in the future nutrient recovery processes have to be sustainable by minimising process inputs such as water energy and chemicals mehta et al 2015 avoiding side waste and maximising recovery efficiency lca provides a framework to consider both direct process inputs emissions and indirect life cycle inputs emissions to guide process development toward the goal of minimising resource inputs and wastes a number of recent reviews has examined lca studies of wastewater based nutrient recycling from various perspectives sena and hicks 2018 focused on lca of struvite precipitation from wastewater treatment and analysed literature based on major lca steps heimersson et al 2016 reviewed life cycle inventory practices for major nutrient flows in wastewater and sludge management systems pradel et al 2016 explored the methodological implications for a shift of considering wastewater sludge from waste to valued products in addition to these reviews on nutrient recycling lca a number of other reviews corominas et al 2013 gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 yoshida et al 2013 has provided comprehensive syntheses for a rapidly growing body of lca literature on wastewater treatment and sewage sludge management with wastewater treatment facilities transitioning into water resource recovery facilities lca has to increasingly account for the functionality of resource recovery the objective of this study is therefore to evaluate how well the lca methodology has been adapted and applied for assessing opportunities of wastewater based nutrient recycling this study reviewed lca studies that considered nutrient recycling from wastewater for agricultural land application we synthesise and analyse their general insights section 4 and methodological practices section 5 and provide a future outlook of using lca to assess wastewater based nutrient recycling section 6 these aspects can complement with existing reviews on wastewater based nutrient recycling lca pradel et al 2016 sena and hicks 2018 and on technical aspects of nutrient recycling harder et al 2019 mehta et al 2015 collectively this could help guide the use of lca to provide quality environmental information for decision making on the planning and implementation of wastewater based nutrient recycling 2 methods 2 1 definition in this study nutrient recycling is referred to as the overall process of reusing nutrients e g nitrogen phosphorus from waste material i e urine faeces wastewater sewage sludge for agriculture through different nutrient recycling pathways fig 1 shows a simplified illustration of the nutrient recycling pathways assessed by the reviewed studies see harder et al 2019 for a comprehensive overview of pathways nutrient recovery is the process of extracting and or concentrating nutrients from waste material the recycled nutrient products are categorised as recycled water urine nutrient rich stream biomass undigested sludge composted sludge anaerobically digested sludge biochar ash struvite phosphorus product e g calcium phosphate diammonium phosphate and nitrogen product e g ammonium sulphate 2 2 lca methods process based lca and economic input output analysis based lca are two primary approaches to lca this work only reviewed process based lca studies the iso standards for lca iso 14040 and iso 14044 are primarily concerned with the process based approach following the iso standards the lca framework has four phases goal and scope definition inventory analysis impact assessment and interpretation in the goal and scope definition phase the goal of the study functional unit system and system boundary are defined in the inventory analysis phase the physical flows of materials and energy into and out of the defined system are quantified in the impact assessment phase the physical flows quantified are translated into environmental impact indicators e g global warming potential eutrophication potential acidification potential ecotoxicity human toxicity photochemical ozone formation based on chosen impact assessment models e g cml recipe traci hischier et al 2010 in the interpretation phase the results from the inventory analysis phase and the impact assessment phase are interpreted based on the goal defined 2 3 review questions the analysis and discussion of this review is revolved around the following questions with the primary objective of evaluating how well the lca methodology has been adapted and applied for assessing opportunities of wastewater based nutrient recycling what are the general results from i assessing agricultural land application of sewage sludge section 4 1 ii assessing agricultural land application of other recycled nutrient products section 4 2 iii comparing different recycled nutrient products section 4 3 and iv assessing the impacts of source separation section 4 4 how have process or product perspective section 5 1 and multifunctionality section 5 2 been handled how have fertiliser offsets section 5 3 and carbon sequestration section 5 4 been accounted for how have heavy metals organic pollutants and pathogenic risks been accounted for section 5 5 what are the practices of uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis section 5 6 what are the methodological challenges and future opportunities of using lca for assessing wastewater based nutrient recycling section 6 2 4 selection of the reviewed papers this work targeted lca studies that considered nutrient recycling from wastewater for agricultural land application it includes only studies using process based lca method and excludes studies using purely economic input output analysis lca method a literature search was conducted to find nutrient recycling related studies peer reviewed original papers using the scopus database in the first stage different combinations of keywords including nutrient recycling nutrient recovery resource recovery life cycle assessment lca wastewater and water were used to identify applicable studies see supplementary material for the combination of keywords in the second stage the reference lists of the reviewed studies in the first stage and the citations on these studies were checked to identify additional nutrient recycling related lca studies this process was repeated on the newly found studies the following criteria were imposed in selecting the relevant lca studies to address the review questions set out in section 2 3 i comparing systems with nutrient recycling against systems without nutrient recycling or ii comparing systems with different nutrient recycling pathways or iii assessing or optimising nutrient recovery processes that yield nutrient rich materials including struvite phosphorus compounds and ammonium compounds or iv considering source separation for nutrient recycling or v focusing primarily on agricultural land application of sewage sludge with system boundary including sludge treatment and agricultural land application but not wastewater treatment in total 65 papers published between 2000 and 2019 were identified all these lca studies have considered at least one pathway through which nutrients could be recycled from wastewater to agricultural land fig 1 they also include agricultural land application in their system boundaries and or account for avoiding mineral or synthetic fertilisers this review does not include i wastewater lca studies that do not consider any nutrient recycling pathway or that are not clear if they consider ii studies that focus on developing life cycle inventory iii studies that investigate co management of sewage sludge and food waste other organic wastes and iv urban water lca studies that have a strong focus on water supply 3 overview of reviewed lca studies table 1 provides a summary of all 65 nutrient recycling related lca studies included in this review they have different scopes of nutrient recycling n recycling only 4 p recycling only 5 n and p recycling 39 and n p and k recycling 9 most of these studies 51 out of 65 considered agricultural land application of sewage sludge composted anaerobically digested or undigested this is partly because many of these studies are about sewage sludge management we analysed these lca studies from a nutrient recycling perspective 17 out of 65 studies considered nutrient recovery for specific nutrient products such as struvite calcium phosphate and ammonium sulphate a range of recycled nutrient products were studied through different pathways fig 1 the processes of production of some of the recycled nutrient products are not mutually exclusive but can co exist e g recycled water digested sludge struvite in life cycle assessment a functional unit is used to normalise the results in terms of per unit of service provided by a process or a product in that way alternatives can be compared on the same basis there are three major types of functional unit among these nutrient recovery related lca studies amount of wastewater treated influent effluent 19 amount of sludge disposed 31 and amount of nutrient recycled removed 9 studies with a functional unit of amount of nutrient recycled removed had a clear goal of comparing alternatives based on the primary functionality of nutrient recycling in most of the cases the functional units chosen were either the amount of wastewater treated or the amount of sludge disposed this definition of functional unit reflects that the primary function of these systems is not nutrient recycling instead these systems are multifunctional with the functions of wastewater treatment sludge disposal biogas generation energy recovery nutrient recovery and or other forms of resource recovery with a multifunctional nature the environmental impacts resulting from the implementation of any alternative system configuration with nutrient recycling are not solely contributed by nutrient recycling fig 2 shows 43 of the 65 nutrient recycling related lca studies in terms of system scale number of life cycle impact categories assessed number of nutrient recycling alternatives compared and studied continents 22 studies are not included in the figure because system scales were not specified most of the studies on smaller scale or decentralised systems were conducted in the asian context while those studies on the larger scale systems were predominantly conducted in the european context amann et al 2018 compared 18 phosphorus recovery processes in a single study i e the largest dot in fig 2 bisinella de faria et al 2015 and igos et al 2017 used the full set of impact categories from the recipe method 18 midpoints and 3 endpoints among all the nutrient recycling related lca studies a range of midpoint life cycle environmental impact categories were assessed with the most assessed categories being global warming potential 60 acidification potential 48 eutrophication potential 48 human toxicity 34 ecotoxicity 33 and photochemical ozone formation 32 4 general insights among the nutrient recycling related studies over half of them feature scenarios to compare the life cycle environmental impact potentials of systems with nutrient recycling to that without recycling these systems are mostly conventional centralised biological wastewater treatment systems the absolute results across these studies are often not directly comparable unless the results are adjusted for their differences in system boundary system scale functional unit impact category impact assessment method and reference system or scenario in general the results of lca are unique to the goal and scope of each study depending on its local context yoshida et al 2013 for comparative lca which is the majority type of lca studies reviewed the focus is not on predicting absolute impacts but rather on estimating the relative difference in potential impacts between alternatives rosenbaum et al 2018 in this section we thus focus much of our discussion on the relative results i e contrasting systems with and without sludge based nutrient recycling in section 4 1 contrasting systems with and without non sludge based nutrient recycling in section 4 2 comparing different recycled nutrient products in section 4 3 comparing nutrient recycling from source separated human excreta to that of non source separated recycling in section 4 4 instead of the absolute quantitative results i e environmental impact potentials for given systems 4 1 agricultural land application of sewage sludge more studies show that compared to sewage sludge landfilling without nutrient recycling application of digested undigested sewage sludge to agricultural land with nutrient recycling could have lower abiotic depletion potential acidification potential global warming potential and photochemical ozone formation lombardi et al 2017 murray et al 2008 pasqualino et al 2009 but could potentially lead to greater ecotoxicity peters and rowley 2009 shiu et al 2017 suh and rousseaux 2002 fig 3 a among the 11 studies that have lower global warming potential in the land application scenario nine of them show over 50 reduction in the potential among the five studies that have higher ecotoxicity in the land application scenario four of them show that ecotoxicity increases by more than five times the percentage difference results are included in the supplementary material for the positive environmental impacts of agricultural land application fertiliser substitution contributes to lower abiotic depletion potential lombardi et al 2017 while lower direct on site emissions and carbon sequestration help reduce global warming potential miller robbie et al 2015 the negative environmental impacts of agricultural land application are the result of excess nutrient and heavy metals present in the sludge pasqualino et al 2009 the impacts on eutrophication and human toxicity are more inconsistent among studies for studies that show a higher eutrophication potential in landfilling they considered the emission of ammonia during lime stabilisation on sludge before landfilling cartes et al 2018 and the impact of landfill leachate suh and rousseaux 2002 it is not evident that those studies with the opposite result have considered such factors pasqualino et al 2009 shiu et al 2017 while most studies have included the direct field emissions associated with the spreading of organic matter studies have shown that the results for human toxicity are sensitive to the choice of life cycle impact assessment method heimersson et al 2014 while the results for global warming potential abiotic depletion and acidification potential are more independent of the impact assessment method used in wastewater treatment lca renou et al 2008 for comparing agricultural land application of sewage sludge to incineration and ash landfilling the results are less inclined to one side fig 3 b some studies clearly favoured agricultural land application over incineration chen and chen 2013 niero et al 2014 while some other studies suggested the opposite svanström et al 2005 yoshida et al 2018 only for global warming potential and photochemical ozone formation there are more studies showing lower impacts for land application i e 6 out of the 11 lower impact studies and 4 out of the 5 lower impact studies show over 50 reduction in global warming potential and photochemical ozone formation respectively in general for most of the other impact categories more studies suggested that land application has higher impacts than incineration similar to comparing land application to landfill scenario fig 3 a ecotoxicity and human toxicity are major concerns for land application comparing to incineration scenario for eutrophication potential the different results could be attributed to the variability of water and sludge quality parameters niero et al 2014 and whether ammonia emissions and run off after land applications are being accounted for or not lundie et al 2004 yoshida et al 2018 in many cases studies are often not transparent enough for tracing back the possible causes of discrepancy 4 2 agricultural land application of non sludge recycled nutrient products in addition to the large number of studies with scenarios on agricultural land application of sewage sludge eight studies have non sludge based nutrient recycling scenarios comparing systems with recycling to systems without recycling e g business as usual conventional systems most studies reported an overall positive environmental performance for their assessed systems though these studies had a different coverage of impact categories meneses et al 2010 favoured agricultural applications of recycled water over urban applications ishii and boyer 2015 and landry and boyer 2016 found positive environmental outcomes from nutrient recycling via struvite precipitation compared to conventional nutrient removal maurer et al 2003 showed that field application of source separated urine could lower embodied energy use and global warming potential compared to conventional denitrification in a wastewater treatment plant lin et al 2016 is one of the two studies that have multiple impact categories showing unfavourable outcomes in nutrient recycling scenarios their study assessed the use of zeolite adsorbent on anaerobic digester supernatant for nitrogen recovery the production of zeolite adsorbent contributes to a large fraction of the environmental burdens 4 3 comparison of different recycled nutrient products a number of studies compared different recycled nutrient products in the same study the results of the top four most assessed environmental impacts from these studies global warming potential acidification potential eutrophication potential ecotoxicity are shown in fig 4 only including studies with non sludge recycled nutrient products these studies are divided into three groups based on their functional units fu i the amount of wastewater treated for the function of waste management ii sludge disposed for the function of waste management and iii the amount of nutrient recycled for the function of resource recovery for each study the results were normalised to the maximum absolute value in that study so that there are relative results for comparison across studies e g across multiple studies whether a given recycled product has a lower environmental impact than another recycled product the size of the bubble is proportional to the environmental impact the larger the filled bubble the greater is the environmental burden for example linderholm et al 2012 found that on a per unit of phosphorus basis recycling through struvite precipitation or digested sludge has much lower greenhouse gas emissions global warming potential than recycling through sludge ash an empty bubble represents a negative value i e greater environmental benefit relative to the other recycled nutrient product s in the same study for instance johansson et al 2008 showed that on a per unit of sludge disposal basis recycling as phosphorus product can have a higher eutrophication potential than recycling through digested sludge if there are multiple studies comparing same set of recycled nutrient products it may give an indication of whether a specific product is still environmental favourable over the others under a range of system configuration inventory assumptions methodological choices and geographical constraints although there are limited estimates globally of the proportion of sewage sludge being used for agricultural purpose available data suggested that agricultural application of sewage sludge is substantial e g 45 60 and 55 respectively for western europe australia and the u s mayer et al 2016 while the practice is subject to strict regulations or even prohibited in some countries hudcová et al 2019 given that agricultural land application of sewage sludge is still a major practice of nutrient recycling in many countries it is important to understand what the potential environmental impacts would be for a shift from this practice to other sludge disposal approaches with nutrient recycling such as sludge ash phosphorus products derived from sludge ash a number of studies do provide insights to this question five studies examined agricultural land application of incineration ash of sewage sludge and compared it with application of undigested digested sludge see do amaral et al 2018 lederer and rechberger 2010 svanström et al 2017 ten hoeve et al 2018 and linderholm et al 2012 in fig 4 for the scenarios in lederer and rechberger 2010 linderholm et al 2012 and svanström et al 2017 the sludge ash was treated by a thermal process to remove heavy metals this has significantly reduced the ecotoxicity of the sludge ash lederer and rechberger 2010 svanström et al 2017 but with a cost of higher energy footprint and global warming potential linderholm et al 2012 in addition to the possibility of removing heavy metals ash based recycling approach can also achieve higher recycling rate of phosphorus and removal of organic micropollutants amann et al 2018 but the loss of carbon and nitrogen during incineration could reduce the amount of fertiliser offset section 5 3 and eliminate carbon sequestration section 5 4 two studies compared agricultural land application of sewage sludge to that of phosphorus products derived from sludge streams see johansson et al 2008 and lundin et al 2004 in fig 4 these phosphorus products include phosphoric acid and ferric phosphate both studies used the same type of functional unit of per unit mass of sludge disposed lundin et al 2004 found that for most impact categories i e resource depletion excluding sulphur global warming potential eutrophication potential acidification potential recycling through land application of phosphorus products i e phosphoric acid by the bio con method ferric phosphate by the cambi krepro method outperformed that of digested sludge on the other hand johansson et al 2008 favoured digested sludge over ferric phosphate by the aqua reci method in terms of global warming potential eutrophication potential and acidification potential the different relative results from the two studies can be attributed to different chemical inputs of their processes and different sludge handling approaches prior to agricultural use some phosphorus recovery processes especially recovery from the digester supernatant can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and acidification potential by over 10 in many processes for sewage sludge management amann et al 2018 the benefits are mostly the results of fertiliser offset and reducing chemicals use downstream at the wastewater treatment plants in addition minimising chemical inputs in nutrient recovery processes is an important factor to enhance the environmental performance of recovery processes bradford hartke et al 2015 ishii and boyer 2015 even though chemical additions can enable higher nutrient recovery rate the additional environmental burdens cannot be fully offset 4 4 impact of source separation source separation enables the collection of human excreta as concentrated streams for nutrient recycling among all the reviewed studies 14 studies examined systems with source separation for nutrient recycling see supplementary material for studies with a scope of source separation all of these 14 studies had urine separation scenarios while six of them also considered faeces black water separation the two major nutrient recycling pathways from source separated urine faeces are through the applications of stabilised urine faeces 9 out of 14 or recovered phosphorus ammonium products 5 out of 14 despite the differences in functional unit system size choice of boundary geographical area recycled nutrient product types and configuration of the examined systems nearly all studies showed that introducing source separation concept for nutrient recycling can lead to a lower global warming potential compared to centralised wastewater treatment with without nutrient recycling i e over 50 reduction in half of the studies the ghg emissions reduction benefit is mainly contributed by the lower electricity consumption at the wastewater treatment plants to treat influent with lower nitrogen and phosphorus content spångberg et al 2014 the lower nitrous oxide emissions from reduced amount of nitrogen denitrified bradford hartke et al 2015 igos et al 2017 the reduction in flush water production ishii and boyer 2015 landry and boyer 2016 and the avoided production of fertilisers landry and boyer 2016 these factors can offset the increased ghg emissions from transporting of recycled nutrient products from urban area to agriculture three studies out of five studies suggested that scenarios on source separated urine faeces application have higher acidification potential over 50 and eutrophication potential over 10 than centralised treatment scenarios because of high ammonia emissions during urine storage urine application and composting of faeces maurer et al 2003 remy and jekel 2008 spångberg et al 2014 however acidification potential and eutrophication potential are sensitive and directly related to the spreading strategy of urine and blackwater maurer et al 2003 spångberg et al 2014 the other two studies that show opposite results were not sufficiently transparent for one to identify possible factors contributing to the discrepancy lam et al 2015 shi et al 2018 for ecotoxicity it is mostly determined by the difference in heavy metal and organic contaminants in source separated urine faeces and synthetic fertilisers the contaminant content assumption may have led to the varying results in the three studies that assessed ecotoxicity none of the reviewed studies have directly compared decentralised recovery of phosphorus ammonium products from source separated urine faeces to centralised recovery of the same products at wastewater treatment plants three studies present scenarios to compare decentralised recovery of struvite to centralised wastewater treatment for nutrient removal but not nutrient recovery all of them show that decentralised struvite recovery could potentially lower acidification potential ecotoxicity eutrophication potential human toxicity and photochemical ozone formation igos et al 2017 ishii and boyer 2015 landry and boyer 2016 however the environmental performance depends on the amount of chemical inputs for struvite precipitation ishii and boyer 2015 and is also influenced by other additional process functions such as pharmaceutical removal landry and boyer 2016 maximising nutrient recovery from source separated human excreta with the use of additional chemicals may compromise its environmental benefits for instance if sodium phosphate is used in addition to magnesium oxide alone to maximise struvite precipitation the environmental performance of decentralised struvite precipitation from source separated urine would become highly unfavourable ishii and boyer 2015 5 methodological practices some earlier lca reviews on wastewater treatment sludge management and resource recovery assessed studies based on each of the four lca phases goal and scope definition inventory analysis impact assessment and interpretation corominas et al 2013 gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 sena and hicks 2018 in this review we focus on some of the methodological aspects that are more related to the context of using lca for decision making on nutrient recycling from wastewater to agriculture fig 5 they include scope definition on recycling process or recycled product section 5 1 multifunctionality of studied systems section 5 2 fertiliser offset accounting section 5 3 carbon sequestration accounting section 5 4 heavy metals organic pollutants and pathogen risk accounting for certain recycled nutrient products section 5 5 and uncertainty management and model sensitivity section 5 6 5 1 process perspective and product perspective most nutrient recycling related lca studies took a process perspective in which a single process configuration with nutrient recycling was assessed or different process configurations with nutrient recycling were compared a process perspective was mostly chosen because the primary goal for most of these studies is wastewater and sludge management while nutrient recycling is an additional function of these processes this is reflected by the use of input based functional units such as 1 m3 of wastewater treated and 1 tonne of dry sludge disposed only seven studies out of 65 studies took a product perspective which is getting more common in recent years with the growing interest of nutrient recycling these studies used output based functional units such as 11 kg pure phosphorus to agricultural land linderholm et al 2012 and annual production of 1 kg of phosphorus available for plants in mineral form pradel and aissani 2019 most of these studies compared the recycled nutrient products to mineral or synthetic fertilisers to be substituted or in the case of recycled water compared to conventional water supply 5 2 multifunctionality systems are often multifunctional in nature for instance a sludge disposal process using anaerobic digestion with struvite crystallisation from digester supernatant would have functionalities of sludge management energy recovery and nutrient recovery in lca when there is a secondary function of the assessed system a system expansion approach can be applied to credit the impacts of the secondary function bjørn et al 2017 among the studies reviewed the primary functions of studied systems are mostly either wastewater treatment or sludge disposal in these process perspective studies the secondary function of nutrient recycling was predominantly considered through system expansion with substitution 52 out of 58 this accounts for the environmental impacts of avoiding the production of mineral or synthetic fertilisers section 5 3 considering that the recycled nutrient products are applied to agricultural land the same substitution approach can be applied to credit biogas production for avoiding electricity generation the seven product perspective studies approached multifunctionality in a few different ways though all of them used system expansion approach with substitution to credit fertiliser offset linderholm et al 2012 and kalmykova et al 2015 only included the unit processes directly related to nutrient recycling e g sludge transportation incineration for phosphorus recovery struvite precipitation and excluded wastewater treatment and sludge treatment processes bradford hartke et al 2015 excluded the existing infrastructure that remains unchanged after implementing phosphorus recovery amann et al 2018 applied a similar approach to only account for the impacts from introducing new technologies and processes relative to the reference system spångberg et al 2014 used an integrated functional unit that considers both nutrient removal i e removal of certain amount of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater and nutrient recycling i e production of fertiliser with certain amount of nitrogen and phosphorus unlike all the other studies pradel and aissani 2019 allocated part of the environmental impacts of wastewater treatment to the production of sludge a recycled nutrient product considered in the study and included the sludge treatment in the system boundary most of these product perspective studies were aiming for relative results for comparison across scenarios instead of estimating absolute environmental impact potential of the recycled nutrient products this essentially means that allocation could be avoided because functionalities other than nutrient recycling can be excluded from the system boundary if the unit processes for delivering the other functionalities remain unchanged after introducing nutrient recycling function even if the non nutrient recycling unit processes do change all the impacts from the change could be allocated to the recycled nutrient products because it is a consequence of introducing nutrient recycling the use of different approaches for handling multifunctionality shows that multifunctionality can be a challenge for conducting product perspective lca especially when multiple recycled nutrient products are produced to be further discussed in section 6 1 5 3 fertiliser offset accounting most of the reviewed studies 59 out of 65 accounted for the benefit of avoiding mineral or synthetic fertilisers among these 59 studies that had fertiliser offset accounting nearly all of them considered nitrogen and phosphorus content in the recycled nutrient products for the offset credit however different levels of detail on their accounting method were documented from giving no details 7 out of 59 to being transparent about what fertilisers being substituted 44 out of 59 in addition these studies assumed a range of different avoided fertilisers ammonium nitrate monoammonium phosphate diammonium phosphate triple super phosphate and urea for the bioavailability of the recycled nutrient products struvite and urine were predominantly assumed to be 100 available compared to mineral or synthetic fertilisers while digested sludge was mostly assumed to have 30 50 and 60 70 bioavailability for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively avoided fertilisers can benefit a number of environmental impact categories global warming potential niero et al 2014 yoshida et al 2018 freshwater eutrophication niero et al 2014 yoshida et al 2018 and water use peters and rowley 2009 in most studies there is a clear spatial disconnection between the recycled nutrient products and local factors e g soil related factors type of avoided fertiliser fertiliser use practice the choices of avoided fertiliser seem to be arbitrary most likely depending on the types of fertiliser available in the life cycle inventory database used in the case of phosphorus recovery from wastewater the types of recovered material can vary highly e g calcium phosphate struvite phosphorus rich slag single superphosphate and it is not clear which types of fertiliser are going to be replaced by them amann et al 2018 5 4 carbon sequestration accounting carbon sequestration refers to the carbon capture benefit when a fraction of the carbon content in land applied sludge remains in the soil for a long period of time it thus has a mitigation potential for the global warming potential impact category while carbon sequestration is not directly related to nutrient recycling it is relevant for sludge based nutrient recycling pathways in the context of shifting away from the direct land application of stabilised sewage sludge digested undigested it would be of interest to understand the fate of the carbon especially the non biogenic fraction and its global warming potential impact an earlier review on sewage sludge management found that only 3 out of 35 reviewed studies considered carbon sequestration for agricultural land application of sludge yoshida et al 2013 our review shows that the practice of considering carbon sequestration for agricultural land application of sludge remains limited 7 out of 33 studies since year 2013 among these seven studies the carbon sequestration accounting methods differ considerably yoshida et al 2018 suggested that for their scenario of sandy loam soil and average danish precipitation 4 9 7 1 of the input carbon could be sequestered in the soil depending on the sludge type based on a calibrated model from bruun et al 2016 alanya et al 2015 also used a modelling approach hermann et al 2011 to quantify carbon sequestration literature values were used in two studies 24 of the applied carbon bradford hartke et al 2015 and 7 of the total amount of added carbon willén et al 2017 the remaining studies do not have a clear documentation on their accounting methods some of these studies showed significant benefit of reducing global warming potential through carbon sequestration alanya et al 2015 liu et al 2013 miller robbie et al 2015 willén et al 2017 while the other studies did not emphasise the contribution of carbon sequestration on global warming potential 5 5 heavy metals organic pollutants and pathogenic risk accounting heavy metals organic pollutants and pathogenic risk are of particular concern for sludge and phototrophic biomass while they are less of concern for monomineral precipitates e g struvite urea calcium phosphate harder et al 2019 agricultural land application of contaminated recycled nutrient product i e containing heavy metals organic pollutants contributes to human toxicity and ecotoxicity midpoint life cycle impact indicators and ultimately human health impact and natural environment impact endpoint life cycle impact indicators among the 29 studies that assessed ecotoxicity and or human toxicity of sludge based nutrient recycling all but four accounted for heavy metal contamination to different extents e g as cd cr cu hg ni zn pb in most cases heavy metal contents in sludge were assumed based on either literature values alanya et al 2015 bradford hartke et al 2015 suh and rousseaux 2002 or site specific measurement do amaral et al 2018 hospido et al 2005 shiu et al 2017 different metals behave entirely differently in a certain soil after land application alanya et al 2015 hospido et al 2005 so studies then further assumed the fate of heavy metals after agricultural land application all metals releasing to soil ten hoeve et al 2018 yoshida et al 2018 using heavy metal transfer coefficients from literature to estimate the release of heavy metals to soil lederer and rechberger 2010 lombardi et al 2017 or assuming different bioavailability of metals blanco et al 2016 the toxicity results are further influenced by the choice of impact assessment method in the impact assessment phase organic pollutants refer to substances such as pharmaceutically active compounds hormones personal care products detergents and organic compounds from polymeric pipes harder et al 2019 a few studies only 4 out of 37 studies that assessed ecotoxicity and or human toxicity accounted for the toxicity impacts of organic pollutants bradford hartke et al 2015 hospido et al 2010 landry and boyer 2016 sablayrolles et al 2010 earlier studies might be limited by the information regarding organic pollutants present in sludge or other recycled nutrient products in addition the potential environmental impacts of the target organic pollutants can only be quantified when the chosen impact assessment method has their characterisation factors many organic pollutants are missing in common impact assessment methods while more organic pollutants are being included recently bradford hartke et al 2015 this can be a methodological area that is relevant for wastewater based nutrient recycling lca and requires further development impacts of pathogens are not included in current impact assessment methods there were some recent attempts to include pathogenic risk in life cycle assessment harder et al 2014 2015 heimersson et al 2014 or to conduct integrated assessments of life cycle environmental impacts and pathogenic risk anastasopoulou et al 2018 similar to the case of organic pollutants lca method has to be further adapted to the needs of environmental assessment of wastewater based nutrient recycling opportunities legal barrier for the use of products recovered from wastewater is one of the uncertainties for the wide adoption of resource recovery from wastewater van der hoek et al 2016 robust accounting frameworks on potential environmental impacts would facilitate the discussion on changing legislation that restricts the use of recycled nutrient products 5 6 uncertainty management and model sensitivity uncertainty is present in all phases of an lca and can originate from for example variability measurement errors inventory gaps methodological choices made and model uncertainty mendoza beltran et al 2018 among the reviewed studies earlier studies rarely discussed the potential uncertainty of their results let alone performing analytical or numerical uncertainty analysis recent years have started seeing studies using analytical or numerical approaches to examine uncertainty igos et al 2017 kavvada et al 2017 most of these studies used monte carlo simulations to examine uncertainty propagation in monte carlo simulations each input parameter of an lca model is represented by a probability distribution function instead of a point value the calculation of lca model is repeated for a fixed number of iterations using input parameters that are randomly sampled from those distributions probability distributed results can then be obtained the approach helps provide a measure of confidence to the results and testify whether the conclusion drawn is robust or not niero et al 2014 most recent studies reviewed used major commercial lca software e g simapro gabi which have built in monte carlo analysis functionality and uncertainty estimates in their life cycle inventory databases this may explain the increased popularity of the approach for uncertainty analysis for the research area of nutrient recycling lca the practice of uncertainty analysis remains limited considering that a lot of the reviewed studies are comparative lca that aims to contrast the potential environmental performance of alternatives the lack of consideration of potential uncertainty may limit the robustness of the results for decision making guo and murphy 2012 for seven studies with monte carlo simulations uncertainty analysis was mostly used to establish confidence intervals in their results with most of them specifying the percentile of the confidence interval used only four of them further discussed the results in the context of uncertainties for instance niero et al 2014 found that based on both uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis it is inconclusive as to whether land application of sludge for recycling phosphorus is better than incineration of sludge in terms of eutrophication and toxicity related impacts in another example igos et al 2017 showed that pre treating a portion of urine from the sewage network before centralised treatment with biological phosphorus removal has significant benefits compared to the conventional fully centralised treatment approach even considering input uncertainties there is an ongoing discussion on the methodological aspects of uncertainty analysis in lca for instance on handling the issue of correlations between input parameters in uncertainty propagation groen and heijungs 2017 on the need of statistically supported conclusions by null hypothesis testing in comparative lca henriksson et al 2015 and on exploring a broad range of scenario space gregory et al 2016 in addition to its continuous development uncertainty analysis does not capture all uncertainties e g model uncertainty epistemological uncertainty but the information is still useful for the result interpretation phase rosenbaum et al 2018 sensitivity analysis is an important step for the interpretation of lca results combining uncertainty analysis with sensitivity analysis helps understand the impact of any uncertainty on the results and identify focus points for improved inventory data collection or impact assessment hauschild et al 2017 sensitivity analysis often involves changing selected input parameters one at a time to examine how sensitive the lca results are to each change clavreul et al 2012 half of the reviewed studies have performed some forms of sensitivity analysis to examine model sensitivity it was mainly used for understanding the influence of selected input parameters on lca results or for identifying key influencing input parameters ideally it is conducted with uncertainty analysis because certain input parameters could have higher uncertainty but the results might not be sensitive to these parameters i e lower sensitivity in this case effort would be prioritised to reduce the uncertainty of input parameters that the models are more sensitive to this is particularly important where the technology assessed is still in its early stage of development sensitivity analysis can highlight areas for further research to minimise the uncertainty in more influential input parameters the reviewed studies highlighted some major uncertainties including inventory data gap for non full scale technology amann et al 2018 missing emerging organic contaminants in current impact assessment methods bradford hartke et al 2015 the variability of water and sludge quality parameters niero et al 2014 the variability of spatial characteristics for decentralised recovery kavvada et al 2017 non localised inventory for background data igos et al 2017 temporal representativeness of background data igos et al 2017 emissions from field application of recycled nutrient materials maurer et al 2003 peters and rowley 2009 future lca studies could consider some of these uncertainties to prioritise the effort for inventory data collection 6 future outlook lca can be further developed to address some of the methodological challenges section 6 1 and applied at various scales to support decisions on wastewater based nutrient recycling and more broadly integrated resource recovery from urban water systems future opportunities could be on performing more product perspective lca on recycled nutrient products section 6 2 integrating process perspective lca with other systems approaches for selecting and optimising individual recovery processes section 6 3 assessing emerging nutrient recovery technologies section 6 4 assessing integrated resource recovery systems section 6 5 and going beyond single process product assessment for bigger picture systems analysis at city national and global level section 6 6 6 1 methodological challenges one of the challenges of performing a product perspective lca on recycled nutrient products is to handle the multifunctional nature of most processes section 5 2 the question is what portion of the environment impacts of building and operating the treatment process that provides the functions of waste disposal nutrient recovery and other forms of resource recovery should be allocated to the recycled nutrient product or each of the recycled nutrient products in multi product cases end users may want to know the absolute environmental footprints of recycled nutrient products so as to directly compare them to that of conventional fertilisers in that case relative results from most of the studies are not so useful because of potential inconsistencies among the accounting frameworks used this multifunctionality issue would become even more challenging for integrated resource recovery facilities where different types of recovery products could be yielded zero burden assumption is also related to the multifunctionality issue in lca the zero burden assumption refers to not considering the environmental impacts associated with waste generation i e outside system boundary for instance the environmental impact of digested sludge application for agricultural land does not include that of wastewater treatment process under the zero burden assumption pradel et al 2016 questioned the use of zero burden assumption on assessing the environmental footprints of products recovered from wastes there is still a lack of empirical understanding of the release and plant availability of phosphorus in soil from recovered phosphorus products from wastewater melia et al 2017 section 5 3 an improved modelling of the processes for the application and post application phases of recycled nutrient products is essential research is undergoing to address this challenge but mostly limited to sewage sludge bruun et al 2016 ten hoeve et al 2018 this modelling aspect is especially important for product perspective lca because the use of a nutrient based functional unit may imply that the results are more sensitive to the assumed properties of the recycled nutrient products e g bioavailability nutrient content other methodological challenges are related to limitations of existing impact assessment methods firstly phosphorus resource depletion is not currently included in many impact assessment methods except the cml method and the recent inclusion in the recipe method this means that if an input based functional unit is used the direct benefit of reducing phosphorus resource extraction is not being accounted for instead only the indirect benefits of reducing resource inputs and emissions from for example fertiliser offset are included secondly many organic pollutants are missing in common impact assessment methods as discussed in section 5 5 6 2 product perspective lca for nutrient recycling currently a product perspective lca for nutrient rich materials recycling from wastewater is still rare section 5 1 future research can perform more product perspective lca to assess recycled nutrient products monitoring environmental and consumer concerns is considered to be a challenge for the utilisation of the recycled nutrient products from wastewater hukari et al 2016 a product perspective lca allows the end users of recycled nutrient products to compare the potential environmental impacts of agricultural land application of recycled nutrient products to that of conventional fertilisers as more recycled nutrient products are becoming available on the market end users may consider the environmental impacts of the recycled nutrient products in addition to their quality and application costs this would require a consistent accounting approach to quantify and even certificate the life cycle environmental impact potential of the recycled nutrient products 6 3 process perspective lca with other systems approaches future research for process perspective lca can combine life cycle assessment with other systems approaches e g life cycle cost analysis dynamic process modelling to aid the design and optimisation of nutrient recovery processes centralised or distributed and their integration into existing wastewater infrastructure while a product perspective lca can help end users choose what recycled nutrient products suit them more from an environmental point of view a process perspective lca is useful for wastewater utilities to select and optimise recovery processes increasingly there are studies customising and integrating lca approaches with other modelling approaches for systems analysis of nutrient recovery processes kavvada et al 2017 combined life cycle environmental assessment with economic assessment geospatial modelling and last mile logistics modelling to assess a decentralised nitrogen recovery approach at a city scale igos et al 2017 coupled lca with process simulation and economic assessment to assess a new source separated urine technology for struvite precipitation and ammonia recovery integrated assessment coupling lca with other systems approaches is also gaining popularity for exploring other wastewater based resource recovery for example optimising the integration of wastewater energy recovery to local energy supply kollmann et al 2017 multi metric sustainability assessment of material recovery from wastewater zijp et al 2017 6 4 using lca to assess emerging nutrient recovery technologies traditionally lca was developed for detailed analysis of products or processes that have clear specifications of their resource consumptions and emissions olsen et al 2017 lca has now been increasingly applied with a future perspective to assess emerging technologies that do not necessarily have full scale inventory assessing a technology at its early development stage with lca can provide an opportunity to identify environmental impacts that can be potential barriers for its full scale implementation fang et al 2016 to gain insight on technical factors that require further research and development kavvada et al 2017 to support scale up arvidsson et al 2018 and to ensure that only the more promising development paths are pursued before lock in occurs hermansson et al 2019 a number of future oriented lca studies assessed laboratory stage or pilot stage nutrient recycling approaches ion exchange based nitrogen recovery kavvada et al 2017 lin et al 2016 microalgae based nutrient recovery arashiro et al 2018 fang et al 2016 phosphorus recovery from sludge incineration ash amann et al 2018 lundin et al 2004 phosphorus recovery using biological acidification pradel and aissani 2019 nitrogen recovery using microbial electrolysis cell igos et al 2017 and decentralised facility for nutrient recycling from human excreta shi et al 2018 into the future emerging nutrient recovery techniques such as bioelectrochemical systems and sorption processes could be subjects for life cycle assessment future oriented lca study of emerging technologies is also referred to as prospective lca arvidsson et al 2018 conducting prospective lca is more challenging than conventional lca because of potentially incomparable functional units and system boundaries between new technology and existing technology scaling issues between laboratory pilot scale process and full scale process larger data gaps and higher uncertainty hetherington et al 2014 some of the reviewed future oriented lca studies on emerging technology overcame some of these challenges by using process simulation for scaling up technology igos et al 2017 assessing and reporting uncertainty kavvada et al 2017 and providing transparent and detailed inventories amann et al 2018 6 5 using lca to assess integrated resource recovery as we are having a better understanding on some of the recycling pathways or technologies technical details or certain technologies should not only be assessed in isolation as it can be a barrier to identify broad patterns and opportunities in the field as a whole harder et al 2019 no single technology can effectively recover all the nutrients in waste stream mehta et al 2015 we can only maximise nutrient recycling by combining individual pathways and technologies for example wang et al 2018 assessed the life cycle environmental impacts of a proposed wastewater treatment system with integrated resource recovery of water for irrigation nutrients through irrigated water struvite and biosolids energy from combustion of nitrous oxide methane and sludge and material as polyhydroxyalkanoate pha trade offs and synergies may exist between different resource recovery approaches mo and zhang 2013 lca should be used to assess wastewater systems with integrated resource recovery e g energy recovery water recycling material recovery co management with food waste the multifunctional nature of wastewater systems with integrated resource recovery implies that a single functional unit may not be ideal for comparing different configurations of these systems the use of multiple functional units to assess alternative can provide more opportunities for cross study comparisons sena and hicks 2018 and can also provide insights from various perspectives e g nutrient recovery efficiency wastewater treatment efficiency 6 6 using lca for bigger picture systems analysis going beyond individual recovery technologies and pathways to better integrate end user needs and the bigger picture is valuable harder et al 2019 bigger picture systems analysis involves understanding the performance and impacts of wastewater based nutrient recycling opportunities in the context of the wider systems at city national and global level this could be particularly important for decentralised solutions as geospatial characteristics likely lead to spatial variation in the performance of distributed systems within a given region in addition systems analysis that uses a multi regional approach could enable inter regional comparison benchmarking and learning it also provides a better understanding of the impacts of geospatial characteristics on the system performance a number of recent works have used systems approaches to explore the bigger picture issues of resource recovery from wastewater trimmer and guest 2018 estimated for 56 cities globally the transport distances for nutrient recycled from human excreta to the surrounding agricultural demand wang et al 2015 assessed the environmental impacts of transitioning wastewater treatment plants from resource removal to resource recovery in 50 countries while lca was traditionally developed to assess products or processes in more confined scales it has now also found its roles in bigger picture systems analysis for water related issues at city national and global level kavvada et al 2016 integrated life cycle environmental modelling with spatial modelling to evaluate the impacts of spatial characteristics on the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions of city scale non potable water reuse wang et al 2019 simulated the life cycle environmental impacts of reducing nutrient discharge from domestic wastewater globally with consideration of spatial and temporal variations strategic use of lca helps identify hotspots for action and unveil potentially unintended indirect impacts and ultimately contributes to the planning and implementation of nutrient and resource recovery from urban water systems as discussed in section 4 3 while the use of sewage sludge for agriculture land application is restricted in some countries the practice is still a major sludge disposal method in many countries with increasing concern on potential soil contamination there could be a shift from this practice to other sludge disposal methods with without nutrient recycling lca could provide a framework to understand the potential environmental consequences of this large scale change of practice 7 conclusions this work reviewed lca studies that considered nutrient recycling from wastewater for agricultural land application the implications are as follows more studies suggested positive environmental outcomes from wastewater based nutrient recycling especially when chemical inputs are minimised and source separation of human excreta is achieved while the lca methodology has been generally well adapted and increasingly applied for assessing wastewater based nutrient recycling opportunities there is still a need to further harmonise and develop methodological aspects and guidelines that are more relevant to nutrient recycling e g multifunctionality fertiliser offset accounting contaminant accounting even for the few methodology aspects that we explored methodological inconsistencies are prominent inconsistent method can be a barrier for the robust use of lca for decision making on wastewater based nutrient recycling in comparing similar studies in this review it is evident that some studies lack transparency on their inventory underlying methodological assumptions and system boundary i e what components are being included or excluded the lack of transparency prevents meaningful comparison across some studies and result generalisation integrating up to date cross disciplinary knowledge e g agricultural science soil science environmental toxicology into lca models is needed to better quantify the environmental impacts of applying recycled nutrient products in many studies there is a clear spatial disconnection between the recycled nutrient products and local factors such as soil related factors and type of avoided fertiliser in many of the studies reviewed lca was used in a comparative context to contrast different system configurations with nutrient recycling or to compare nutrient recycling systems against reference systems without nutrient recycling there is a clear lack of consideration of result uncertainty in these comparative lca studies if the results of lca are to be used to support decision result uncertainty has to be explored and communicated the future opportunities could be on performing more product perspective lca on recycled nutrient products integrating process perspective lca with other systems approaches for selecting and optimising individual recovery processes

18076,recovering resources from wastewater systems is increasingly being emphasised many technologies exist or are under development for recycling nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater to agriculture planning and design methodologies are needed to identify and deploy the most sustainable solutions in given contexts for the environmental sustainability dimension life cycle assessment lca can be used to assess environmental impact potentials of wastewater based nutrient recycling alternatives especially nitrogen and phosphorus recycling this review aims to evaluate how well the lca methodology has been adapted and applied for assessing opportunities of wastewater based nutrient recycling in the form of monomineral multimineral nutrient solution and organic solid we reviewed 65 lca studies that considered nutrient recycling from wastewater for agricultural land application we synthesised some of their insights and methodological practices and discussed the future

accounting ensure transparency of inventory and methods consider uncertainty in comparative lca context integrate up to date cross disciplinary knowledge e g agriculture science soil science into lca

from wastewater to agriculture harder et al 2019 mehta et al 2015 the challenge of transitioning to resource efficient urban water systems is often not the availability of technology for resource recovery but the lack of planning and design methodology to identify and deploy the most sustainable solution in a given context guest et al 2009 life cycle assessment lca provides a method to assess wastewater based resource recovery alternatives from environmental sustainability perspectives and it can be combined with other context specific assessment techniques such as life cycle costing and risk assessments to evaluate alternatives guest et al 2009 lca is a framework to quantify environmental impact potentials benefits or burdens of processes and products throughout their life cycle in some cases it provides insights of potential trade offs between different environmental impacts hellweg and canals 2014 and or economic performance when integrating with life cycle costing zijp et al 2017 in the field of urban water management lca has become a popular approach to assess environmental performance of operating and upgrading water supply systems and wastewater treatment systems in particular some of these lca studies aim to evaluate different nutrient recovery strategies sena and hicks 2018 and sludge management approaches pradel et al 2016 in the future nutrient recovery processes have to be sustainable by minimising process inputs such as water energy and chemicals mehta et al 2015 avoiding side waste and maximising recovery efficiency lca provides a framework to consider both direct process inputs emissions and indirect life cycle inputs emissions to guide process development toward the goal of minimising resource inputs and wastes a number of recent reviews has examined lca studies of wastewater based nutrient recycling from various perspectives sena and hicks 2018 focused on lca of struvite precipitation from wastewater treatment and analysed literature based on major lca steps heimersson et al 2016 reviewed life cycle inventory practices for major nutrient flows in wastewater and sludge management systems pradel et al 2016 explored the methodological implications for a shift of considering wastewater sludge from waste to valued products in addition to these reviews on nutrient recycling lca a number of other reviews corominas et al 2013 gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 yoshida et al 2013 has provided comprehensive syntheses for a rapidly growing body of lca literature on wastewater treatment and sewage sludge management with wastewater treatment facilities transitioning into water resource recovery facilities lca has to increasingly account for the functionality of resource recovery the objective of this study is therefore to evaluate how well the lca methodology has been adapted and applied for assessing opportunities of wastewater based nutrient recycling this study reviewed lca studies that considered nutrient recycling from wastewater for agricultural land application we synthesise and analyse their general insights section 4 and methodological practices section 5 and provide a future outlook of using lca to assess wastewater based nutrient recycling section 6 these aspects can complement with existing reviews on wastewater based nutrient recycling lca pradel et al 2016 sena and hicks 2018 and on technical aspects of nutrient recycling harder et al 2019 mehta et al 2015 collectively this could help guide the use of lca to provide quality environmental information for decision making on the planning and implementation of wastewater based nutrient recycling 2 methods 2 1 definition in this study nutrient recycling is referred to as the overall process of reusing nutrients e g nitrogen phosphorus from waste material i e urine faeces wastewater sewage sludge for agriculture through different nutrient recycling pathways fig 1 shows a simplified illustration of the nutrient recycling pathways assessed by the reviewed studies see harder et al 2019 for a comprehensive overview of pathways nutrient recovery is the process of extracting and or concentrating nutrients from waste material the recycled nutrient products are categorised as recycled water urine nutrient rich stream biomass undigested sludge composted sludge anaerobically digested sludge biochar ash struvite phosphorus product e g calcium phosphate diammonium phosphate and nitrogen product e g ammonium sulphate 2 2 lca methods process based lca and economic input output analysis based lca are two primary approaches to lca this work only reviewed process based lca studies the iso standards for lca iso 14040 and iso 14044 are primarily concerned with the process based approach following the iso standards the lca framework has four phases goal and scope definition inventory analysis impact assessment and interpretation in the goal and scope definition phase the goal of the study functional unit system and system boundary are defined in the inventory analysis phase the physical flows of materials and energy into and out of the defined system are quantified in the impact assessment phase the physical flows quantified are translated into environmental impact indicators e g global warming potential eutrophication potential acidification potential ecotoxicity human toxicity photochemical ozone formation based on chosen impact assessment models e g cml recipe traci hischier et al 2010 in the interpretation phase the results from the inventory analysis phase and the impact assessment phase are interpreted based on the goal defined 2 3 review questions the analysis and discussion of this review is revolved around the following questions with the primary objective of evaluating how well the lca methodology has been adapted and applied for assessing opportunities of wastewater based nutrient recycling what are the general results from i assessing agricultural land application of sewage sludge section 4 1 ii assessing agricultural land application of other recycled nutrient products section 4 2 iii comparing different recycled nutrient products section 4 3 and iv assessing the impacts of source separation section 4 4 how have process or product perspective section 5 1 and multifunctionality section 5 2 been handled how have fertiliser offsets section 5 3 and carbon sequestration section 5 4 been accounted for how have heavy metals organic pollutants and pathogenic risks been accounted for section 5 5 what are the practices of uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis section 5 6 what are the methodological challenges and future opportunities of using lca for assessing wastewater based nutrient recycling section 6 2 4 selection of the reviewed papers this work targeted lca studies that considered nutrient recycling from wastewater for agricultural land application it includes only studies using process based lca method and excludes studies using purely economic input output analysis lca method a literature search was conducted to find nutrient recycling related studies peer reviewed original papers using the scopus database in the first stage different combinations of keywords including nutrient recycling nutrient recovery resource recovery life cycle assessment lca wastewater and water were used to identify applicable studies see supplementary material for the combination of keywords in the second stage the reference lists of the reviewed studies in the first stage and the citations on these studies were checked to identify additional nutrient recycling related lca studies this process was repeated on the newly found studies the following criteria were imposed in selecting the relevant lca studies to address the review questions set out in section 2 3 i comparing systems with nutrient recycling against systems without nutrient recycling or ii comparing systems with different nutrient recycling pathways or iii assessing or optimising nutrient recovery processes that yield nutrient rich materials including struvite phosphorus compounds and ammonium compounds or iv considering source separation for nutrient recycling or v focusing primarily on agricultural land application of sewage sludge with system boundary including sludge treatment and agricultural land application but not wastewater treatment in total 65 papers published between 2000 and 2019 were identified all these lca studies have considered at least one pathway through which nutrients could be recycled from wastewater to agricultural land fig 1 they also include agricultural land application in their system boundaries and or account for avoiding mineral or synthetic fertilisers this review does not include i wastewater lca studies that do not consider any nutrient recycling pathway or that are not clear if they consider ii studies that focus on developing life cycle inventory iii studies that investigate co management of sewage sludge and food waste other organic wastes and iv urban water lca studies that have a strong focus on water supply 3 overview of reviewed lca studies table 1 provides a summary of all 65 nutrient recycling related lca studies included in this review they have different scopes of nutrient recycling n recycling only 4 p recycling only 5 n and p recycling 39 and n p and k recycling 9 most of these studies 51 out of 65 considered agricultural land application of sewage sludge composted anaerobically digested or undigested this is partly because many of these studies are about sewage sludge management we analysed these lca studies from a nutrient recycling perspective 17 out of 65 studies considered nutrient recovery for specific nutrient products such as struvite calcium phosphate and ammonium sulphate a range of recycled nutrient products were studied through different pathways fig 1 the processes of production of some of the recycled nutrient products are not mutually exclusive but can co exist e g recycled water digested sludge struvite in life cycle assessment a functional unit is used to normalise the results in terms of per unit of service provided by a process or a product in that way alternatives can be compared on the same basis there are three major types of functional unit among these nutrient recovery related lca studies amount of wastewater treated influent effluent 19 amount of sludge disposed 31 and amount of nutrient recycled removed 9 studies with a functional unit of amount of nutrient recycled removed had a clear goal of comparing alternatives based on the primary functionality of nutrient recycling in most of the cases the functional units chosen were either the amount of wastewater treated or the amount of sludge disposed this definition of functional unit reflects that the primary function of these systems is not nutrient recycling instead these systems are multifunctional with the functions of wastewater treatment sludge disposal biogas generation energy recovery nutrient recovery and or other forms of resource recovery with a multifunctional nature the environmental impacts resulting from the implementation of any alternative system configuration with nutrient recycling are not solely contributed by nutrient recycling fig 2 shows 43 of the 65 nutrient recycling related lca studies in terms of system scale number of life cycle impact categories assessed number of nutrient recycling alternatives compared and studied continents 22 studies are not included in the figure because system scales were not specified most of the studies on smaller scale or decentralised systems were conducted in the asian context while those studies on the larger scale systems were predominantly conducted in the european context amann et al 2018 compared 18 phosphorus recovery processes in a single study i e the largest dot in fig 2 bisinella de faria et al 2015 and igos et al 2017 used the full set of impact categories from the recipe method 18 midpoints and 3 endpoints among all the nutrient recycling related lca studies a range of midpoint life cycle environmental impact categories were assessed with the most assessed categories being global warming potential 60 acidification potential 48 eutrophication potential 48 human toxicity 34 ecotoxicity 33 and photochemical ozone formation 32 4 general insights among the nutrient recycling related studies over half of them feature scenarios to compare the life cycle environmental impact potentials of systems with nutrient recycling to that without recycling these systems are mostly conventional centralised biological wastewater treatment systems the absolute results across these studies are often not directly comparable unless the results are adjusted for their differences in system boundary system scale functional unit impact category impact assessment method and reference system or scenario in general the results of lca are unique to the goal and scope of each study depending on its local context yoshida et al 2013 for comparative lca which is the majority type of lca studies reviewed the focus is not on predicting absolute impacts but rather on estimating the relative difference in potential impacts between alternatives rosenbaum et al 2018 in this section we thus focus much of our discussion on the relative results i e contrasting systems with and without sludge based nutrient recycling in section 4 1 contrasting systems with and without non sludge based nutrient recycling in section 4 2 comparing different recycled nutrient products in section 4 3 comparing nutrient recycling from source separated human excreta to that of non source separated recycling in section 4 4 instead of the absolute quantitative results i e environmental impact potentials for given systems 4 1 agricultural land application of sewage sludge more studies show that compared to sewage sludge landfilling without nutrient recycling application of digested undigested sewage sludge to agricultural land with nutrient recycling could have lower abiotic depletion potential acidification potential global warming potential and photochemical ozone formation lombardi et al 2017 murray et al 2008 pasqualino et al 2009 but could potentially lead to greater ecotoxicity peters and rowley 2009 shiu et al 2017 suh and rousseaux 2002 fig 3 a among the 11 studies that have lower global warming potential in the land application scenario nine of them show over 50 reduction in the potential among the five studies that have higher ecotoxicity in the land application scenario four of them show that ecotoxicity increases by more than five times the percentage difference results are included in the supplementary material for the positive environmental impacts of agricultural land application fertiliser substitution contributes to lower abiotic depletion potential lombardi et al 2017 while lower direct on site emissions and carbon sequestration help reduce global warming potential miller robbie et al 2015 the negative environmental impacts of agricultural land application are the result of excess nutrient and heavy metals present in the sludge pasqualino et al 2009 the impacts on eutrophication and human toxicity are more inconsistent among studies for studies that show a higher eutrophication potential in landfilling they considered the emission of ammonia during lime stabilisation on sludge before landfilling cartes et al 2018 and the impact of landfill leachate suh and rousseaux 2002 it is not evident that those studies with the opposite result have considered such factors pasqualino et al 2009 shiu et al 2017 while most studies have included the direct field emissions associated with the spreading of organic matter studies have shown that the results for human toxicity are sensitive to the choice of life cycle impact assessment method heimersson et al 2014 while the results for global warming potential abiotic depletion and acidification potential are more independent of the impact assessment method used in wastewater treatment lca renou et al 2008 for comparing agricultural land application of sewage sludge to incineration and ash landfilling the results are less inclined to one side fig 3 b some studies clearly favoured agricultural land application over incineration chen and chen 2013 niero et al 2014 while some other studies suggested the opposite svanström et al 2005 yoshida et al 2018 only for global warming potential and photochemical ozone formation there are more studies showing lower impacts for land application i e 6 out of the 11 lower impact studies and 4 out of the 5 lower impact studies show over 50 reduction in global warming potential and photochemical ozone formation respectively in general for most of the other impact categories more studies suggested that land application has higher impacts than incineration similar to comparing land application to landfill scenario fig 3 a ecotoxicity and human toxicity are major concerns for land application comparing to incineration scenario for eutrophication potential the different results could be attributed to the variability of water and sludge quality parameters niero et al 2014 and whether ammonia emissions and run off after land applications are being accounted for or not lundie et al 2004 yoshida et al 2018 in many cases studies are often not transparent enough for tracing back the possible causes of discrepancy 4 2 agricultural land application of non sludge recycled nutrient products in addition to the large number of studies with scenarios on agricultural land application of sewage sludge eight studies have non sludge based nutrient recycling scenarios comparing systems with recycling to systems without recycling e g business as usual conventional systems most studies reported an overall positive environmental performance for their assessed systems though these studies had a different coverage of impact categories meneses et al 2010 favoured agricultural applications of recycled water over urban applications ishii and boyer 2015 and landry and boyer 2016 found positive environmental outcomes from nutrient recycling via struvite precipitation compared to conventional nutrient removal maurer et al 2003 showed that field application of source separated urine could lower embodied energy use and global warming potential compared to conventional denitrification in a wastewater treatment plant lin et al 2016 is one of the two studies that have multiple impact categories showing unfavourable outcomes in nutrient recycling scenarios their study assessed the use of zeolite adsorbent on anaerobic digester supernatant for nitrogen recovery the production of zeolite adsorbent contributes to a large fraction of the environmental burdens 4 3 comparison of different recycled nutrient products a number of studies compared different recycled nutrient products in the same study the results of the top four most assessed environmental impacts from these studies global warming potential acidification potential eutrophication potential ecotoxicity are shown in fig 4 only including studies with non sludge recycled nutrient products these studies are divided into three groups based on their functional units fu i the amount of wastewater treated for the function of waste management ii sludge disposed for the function of waste management and iii the amount of nutrient recycled for the function of resource recovery for each study the results were normalised to the maximum absolute value in that study so that there are relative results for comparison across studies e g across multiple studies whether a given recycled product has a lower environmental impact than another recycled product the size of the bubble is proportional to the environmental impact the larger the filled bubble the greater is the environmental burden for example linderholm et al 2012 found that on a per unit of phosphorus basis recycling through struvite precipitation or digested sludge has much lower greenhouse gas emissions global warming potential than recycling through sludge ash an empty bubble represents a negative value i e greater environmental benefit relative to the other recycled nutrient product s in the same study for instance johansson et al 2008 showed that on a per unit of sludge disposal basis recycling as phosphorus product can have a higher eutrophication potential than recycling through digested sludge if there are multiple studies comparing same set of recycled nutrient products it may give an indication of whether a specific product is still environmental favourable over the others under a range of system configuration inventory assumptions methodological choices and geographical constraints although there are limited estimates globally of the proportion of sewage sludge being used for agricultural purpose available data suggested that agricultural application of sewage sludge is substantial e g 45 60 and 55 respectively for western europe australia and the u s mayer et al 2016 while the practice is subject to strict regulations or even prohibited in some countries hudcová et al 2019 given that agricultural land application of sewage sludge is still a major practice of nutrient recycling in many countries it is important to understand what the potential environmental impacts would be for a shift from this practice to other sludge disposal approaches with nutrient recycling such as sludge ash phosphorus products derived from sludge ash a number of studies do provide insights to this question five studies examined agricultural land application of incineration ash of sewage sludge and compared it with application of undigested digested sludge see do amaral et al 2018 lederer and rechberger 2010 svanström et al 2017 ten hoeve et al 2018 and linderholm et al 2012 in fig 4 for the scenarios in lederer and rechberger 2010 linderholm et al 2012 and svanström et al 2017 the sludge ash was treated by a thermal process to remove heavy metals this has significantly reduced the ecotoxicity of the sludge ash lederer and rechberger 2010 svanström et al 2017 but with a cost of higher energy footprint and global warming potential linderholm et al 2012 in addition to the possibility of removing heavy metals ash based recycling approach can also achieve higher recycling rate of phosphorus and removal of organic micropollutants amann et al 2018 but the loss of carbon and nitrogen during incineration could reduce the amount of fertiliser offset section 5 3 and eliminate carbon sequestration section 5 4 two studies compared agricultural land application of sewage sludge to that of phosphorus products derived from sludge streams see johansson et al 2008 and lundin et al 2004 in fig 4 these phosphorus products include phosphoric acid and ferric phosphate both studies used the same type of functional unit of per unit mass of sludge disposed lundin et al 2004 found that for most impact categories i e resource depletion excluding sulphur global warming potential eutrophication potential acidification potential recycling through land application of phosphorus products i e phosphoric acid by the bio con method ferric phosphate by the cambi krepro method outperformed that of digested sludge on the other hand johansson et al 2008 favoured digested sludge over ferric phosphate by the aqua reci method in terms of global warming potential eutrophication potential and acidification potential the different relative results from the two studies can be attributed to different chemical inputs of their processes and different sludge handling approaches prior to agricultural use some phosphorus recovery processes especially recovery from the digester supernatant can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and acidification potential by over 10 in many processes for sewage sludge management amann et al 2018 the benefits are mostly the results of fertiliser offset and reducing chemicals use downstream at the wastewater treatment plants in addition minimising chemical inputs in nutrient recovery processes is an important factor to enhance the environmental performance of recovery processes bradford hartke et al 2015 ishii and boyer 2015 even though chemical additions can enable higher nutrient recovery rate the additional environmental burdens cannot be fully offset 4 4 impact of source separation source separation enables the collection of human excreta as concentrated streams for nutrient recycling among all the reviewed studies 14 studies examined systems with source separation for nutrient recycling see supplementary material for studies with a scope of source separation all of these 14 studies had urine separation scenarios while six of them also considered faeces black water separation the two major nutrient recycling pathways from source separated urine faeces are through the applications of stabilised urine faeces 9 out of 14 or recovered phosphorus ammonium products 5 out of 14 despite the differences in functional unit system size choice of boundary geographical area recycled nutrient product types and configuration of the examined systems nearly all studies showed that introducing source separation concept for nutrient recycling can lead to a lower global warming potential compared to centralised wastewater treatment with without nutrient recycling i e over 50 reduction in half of the studies the ghg emissions reduction benefit is mainly contributed by the lower electricity consumption at the wastewater treatment plants to treat influent with lower nitrogen and phosphorus content spångberg et al 2014 the lower nitrous oxide emissions from reduced amount of nitrogen denitrified bradford hartke et al 2015 igos et al 2017 the reduction in flush water production ishii and boyer 2015 landry and boyer 2016 and the avoided production of fertilisers landry and boyer 2016 these factors can offset the increased ghg emissions from transporting of recycled nutrient products from urban area to agriculture three studies out of five studies suggested that scenarios on source separated urine faeces application have higher acidification potential over 50 and eutrophication potential over 10 than centralised treatment scenarios because of high ammonia emissions during urine storage urine application and composting of faeces maurer et al 2003 remy and jekel 2008 spångberg et al 2014 however acidification potential and eutrophication potential are sensitive and directly related to the spreading strategy of urine and blackwater maurer et al 2003 spångberg et al 2014 the other two studies that show opposite results were not sufficiently transparent for one to identify possible factors contributing to the discrepancy lam et al 2015 shi et al 2018 for ecotoxicity it is mostly determined by the difference in heavy metal and organic contaminants in source separated urine faeces and synthetic fertilisers the contaminant content assumption may have led to the varying results in the three studies that assessed ecotoxicity none of the reviewed studies have directly compared decentralised recovery of phosphorus ammonium products from source separated urine faeces to centralised recovery of the same products at wastewater treatment plants three studies present scenarios to compare decentralised recovery of struvite to centralised wastewater treatment for nutrient removal but not nutrient recovery all of them show that decentralised struvite recovery could potentially lower acidification potential ecotoxicity eutrophication potential human toxicity and photochemical ozone formation igos et al 2017 ishii and boyer 2015 landry and boyer 2016 however the environmental performance depends on the amount of chemical inputs for struvite precipitation ishii and boyer 2015 and is also influenced by other additional process functions such as pharmaceutical removal landry and boyer 2016 maximising nutrient recovery from source separated human excreta with the use of additional chemicals may compromise its environmental benefits for instance if sodium phosphate is used in addition to magnesium oxide alone to maximise struvite precipitation the environmental performance of decentralised struvite precipitation from source separated urine would become highly unfavourable ishii and boyer 2015 5 methodological practices some earlier lca reviews on wastewater treatment sludge management and resource recovery assessed studies based on each of the four lca phases goal and scope definition inventory analysis impact assessment and interpretation corominas et al 2013 gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 sena and hicks 2018 in this review we focus on some of the methodological aspects that are more related to the context of using lca for decision making on nutrient recycling from wastewater to agriculture fig 5 they include scope definition on recycling process or recycled product section 5 1 multifunctionality of studied systems section 5 2 fertiliser offset accounting section 5 3 carbon sequestration accounting section 5 4 heavy metals organic pollutants and pathogen risk accounting for certain recycled nutrient products section 5 5 and uncertainty management and model sensitivity section 5 6 5 1 process perspective and product perspective most nutrient recycling related lca studies took a process perspective in which a single process configuration with nutrient recycling was assessed or different process configurations with nutrient recycling were compared a process perspective was mostly chosen because the primary goal for most of these studies is wastewater and sludge management while nutrient recycling is an additional function of these processes this is reflected by the use of input based functional units such as 1 m3 of wastewater treated and 1 tonne of dry sludge disposed only seven studies out of 65 studies took a product perspective which is getting more common in recent years with the growing interest of nutrient recycling these studies used output based functional units such as 11 kg pure phosphorus to agricultural land linderholm et al 2012 and annual production of 1 kg of phosphorus available for plants in mineral form pradel and aissani 2019 most of these studies compared the recycled nutrient products to mineral or synthetic fertilisers to be substituted or in the case of recycled water compared to conventional water supply 5 2 multifunctionality systems are often multifunctional in nature for instance a sludge disposal process using anaerobic digestion with struvite crystallisation from digester supernatant would have functionalities of sludge management energy recovery and nutrient recovery in lca when there is a secondary function of the assessed system a system expansion approach can be applied to credit the impacts of the secondary function bjørn et al 2017 among the studies reviewed the primary functions of studied systems are mostly either wastewater treatment or sludge disposal in these process perspective studies the secondary function of nutrient recycling was predominantly considered through system expansion with substitution 52 out of 58 this accounts for the environmental impacts of avoiding the production of mineral or synthetic fertilisers section 5 3 considering that the recycled nutrient products are applied to agricultural land the same substitution approach can be applied to credit biogas production for avoiding electricity generation the seven product perspective studies approached multifunctionality in a few different ways though all of them used system expansion approach with substitution to credit fertiliser offset linderholm et al 2012 and kalmykova et al 2015 only included the unit processes directly related to nutrient recycling e g sludge transportation incineration for phosphorus recovery struvite precipitation and excluded wastewater treatment and sludge treatment processes bradford hartke et al 2015 excluded the existing infrastructure that remains unchanged after implementing phosphorus recovery amann et al 2018 applied a similar approach to only account for the impacts from introducing new technologies and processes relative to the reference system spångberg et al 2014 used an integrated functional unit that considers both nutrient removal i e removal of certain amount of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater and nutrient recycling i e production of fertiliser with certain amount of nitrogen and phosphorus unlike all the other studies pradel and aissani 2019 allocated part of the environmental impacts of wastewater treatment to the production of sludge a recycled nutrient product considered in the study and included the sludge treatment in the system boundary most of these product perspective studies were aiming for relative results for comparison across scenarios instead of estimating absolute environmental impact potential of the recycled nutrient products this essentially means that allocation could be avoided because functionalities other than nutrient recycling can be excluded from the system boundary if the unit processes for delivering the other functionalities remain unchanged after introducing nutrient recycling function even if the non nutrient recycling unit processes do change all the impacts from the change could be allocated to the recycled nutrient products because it is a consequence of introducing nutrient recycling the use of different approaches for handling multifunctionality shows that multifunctionality can be a challenge for conducting product perspective lca especially when multiple recycled nutrient products are produced to be further discussed in section 6 1 5 3 fertiliser offset accounting most of the reviewed studies 59 out of 65 accounted for the benefit of avoiding mineral or synthetic fertilisers among these 59 studies that had fertiliser offset accounting nearly all of them considered nitrogen and phosphorus content in the recycled nutrient products for the offset credit however different levels of detail on their accounting method were documented from giving no details 7 out of 59 to being transparent about what fertilisers being substituted 44 out of 59 in addition these studies assumed a range of different avoided fertilisers ammonium nitrate monoammonium phosphate diammonium phosphate triple super phosphate and urea for the bioavailability of the recycled nutrient products struvite and urine were predominantly assumed to be 100 available compared to mineral or synthetic fertilisers while digested sludge was mostly assumed to have 30 50 and 60 70 bioavailability for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively avoided fertilisers can benefit a number of environmental impact categories global warming potential niero et al 2014 yoshida et al 2018 freshwater eutrophication niero et al 2014 yoshida et al 2018 and water use peters and rowley 2009 in most studies there is a clear spatial disconnection between the recycled nutrient products and local factors e g soil related factors type of avoided fertiliser fertiliser use practice the choices of avoided fertiliser seem to be arbitrary most likely depending on the types of fertiliser available in the life cycle inventory database used in the case of phosphorus recovery from wastewater the types of recovered material can vary highly e g calcium phosphate struvite phosphorus rich slag single superphosphate and it is not clear which types of fertiliser are going to be replaced by them amann et al 2018 5 4 carbon sequestration accounting carbon sequestration refers to the carbon capture benefit when a fraction of the carbon content in land applied sludge remains in the soil for a long period of time it thus has a mitigation potential for the global warming potential impact category while carbon sequestration is not directly related to nutrient recycling it is relevant for sludge based nutrient recycling pathways in the context of shifting away from the direct land application of stabilised sewage sludge digested undigested it would be of interest to understand the fate of the carbon especially the non biogenic fraction and its global warming potential impact an earlier review on sewage sludge management found that only 3 out of 35 reviewed studies considered carbon sequestration for agricultural land application of sludge yoshida et al 2013 our review shows that the practice of considering carbon sequestration for agricultural land application of sludge remains limited 7 out of 33 studies since year 2013 among these seven studies the carbon sequestration accounting methods differ considerably yoshida et al 2018 suggested that for their scenario of sandy loam soil and average danish precipitation 4 9 7 1 of the input carbon could be sequestered in the soil depending on the sludge type based on a calibrated model from bruun et al 2016 alanya et al 2015 also used a modelling approach hermann et al 2011 to quantify carbon sequestration literature values were used in two studies 24 of the applied carbon bradford hartke et al 2015 and 7 of the total amount of added carbon willén et al 2017 the remaining studies do not have a clear documentation on their accounting methods some of these studies showed significant benefit of reducing global warming potential through carbon sequestration alanya et al 2015 liu et al 2013 miller robbie et al 2015 willén et al 2017 while the other studies did not emphasise the contribution of carbon sequestration on global warming potential 5 5 heavy metals organic pollutants and pathogenic risk accounting heavy metals organic pollutants and pathogenic risk are of particular concern for sludge and phototrophic biomass while they are less of concern for monomineral precipitates e g struvite urea calcium phosphate harder et al 2019 agricultural land application of contaminated recycled nutrient product i e containing heavy metals organic pollutants contributes to human toxicity and ecotoxicity midpoint life cycle impact indicators and ultimately human health impact and natural environment impact endpoint life cycle impact indicators among the 29 studies that assessed ecotoxicity and or human toxicity of sludge based nutrient recycling all but four accounted for heavy metal contamination to different extents e g as cd cr cu hg ni zn pb in most cases heavy metal contents in sludge were assumed based on either literature values alanya et al 2015 bradford hartke et al 2015 suh and rousseaux 2002 or site specific measurement do amaral et al 2018 hospido et al 2005 shiu et al 2017 different metals behave entirely differently in a certain soil after land application alanya et al 2015 hospido et al 2005 so studies then further assumed the fate of heavy metals after agricultural land application all metals releasing to soil ten hoeve et al 2018 yoshida et al 2018 using heavy metal transfer coefficients from literature to estimate the release of heavy metals to soil lederer and rechberger 2010 lombardi et al 2017 or assuming different bioavailability of metals blanco et al 2016 the toxicity results are further influenced by the choice of impact assessment method in the impact assessment phase organic pollutants refer to substances such as pharmaceutically active compounds hormones personal care products detergents and organic compounds from polymeric pipes harder et al 2019 a few studies only 4 out of 37 studies that assessed ecotoxicity and or human toxicity accounted for the toxicity impacts of organic pollutants bradford hartke et al 2015 hospido et al 2010 landry and boyer 2016 sablayrolles et al 2010 earlier studies might be limited by the information regarding organic pollutants present in sludge or other recycled nutrient products in addition the potential environmental impacts of the target organic pollutants can only be quantified when the chosen impact assessment method has their characterisation factors many organic pollutants are missing in common impact assessment methods while more organic pollutants are being included recently bradford hartke et al 2015 this can be a methodological area that is relevant for wastewater based nutrient recycling lca and requires further development impacts of pathogens are not included in current impact assessment methods there were some recent attempts to include pathogenic risk in life cycle assessment harder et al 2014 2015 heimersson et al 2014 or to conduct integrated assessments of life cycle environmental impacts and pathogenic risk anastasopoulou et al 2018 similar to the case of organic pollutants lca method has to be further adapted to the needs of environmental assessment of wastewater based nutrient recycling opportunities legal barrier for the use of products recovered from wastewater is one of the uncertainties for the wide adoption of resource recovery from wastewater van der hoek et al 2016 robust accounting frameworks on potential environmental impacts would facilitate the discussion on changing legislation that restricts the use of recycled nutrient products 5 6 uncertainty management and model sensitivity uncertainty is present in all phases of an lca and can originate from for example variability measurement errors inventory gaps methodological choices made and model uncertainty mendoza beltran et al 2018 among the reviewed studies earlier studies rarely discussed the potential uncertainty of their results let alone performing analytical or numerical uncertainty analysis recent years have started seeing studies using analytical or numerical approaches to examine uncertainty igos et al 2017 kavvada et al 2017 most of these studies used monte carlo simulations to examine uncertainty propagation in monte carlo simulations each input parameter of an lca model is represented by a probability distribution function instead of a point value the calculation of lca model is repeated for a fixed number of iterations using input parameters that are randomly sampled from those distributions probability distributed results can then be obtained the approach helps provide a measure of confidence to the results and testify whether the conclusion drawn is robust or not niero et al 2014 most recent studies reviewed used major commercial lca software e g simapro gabi which have built in monte carlo analysis functionality and uncertainty estimates in their life cycle inventory databases this may explain the increased popularity of the approach for uncertainty analysis for the research area of nutrient recycling lca the practice of uncertainty analysis remains limited considering that a lot of the reviewed studies are comparative lca that aims to contrast the potential environmental performance of alternatives the lack of consideration of potential uncertainty may limit the robustness of the results for decision making guo and murphy 2012 for seven studies with monte carlo simulations uncertainty analysis was mostly used to establish confidence intervals in their results with most of them specifying the percentile of the confidence interval used only four of them further discussed the results in the context of uncertainties for instance niero et al 2014 found that based on both uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis it is inconclusive as to whether land application of sludge for recycling phosphorus is better than incineration of sludge in terms of eutrophication and toxicity related impacts in another example igos et al 2017 showed that pre treating a portion of urine from the sewage network before centralised treatment with biological phosphorus removal has significant benefits compared to the conventional fully centralised treatment approach even considering input uncertainties there is an ongoing discussion on the methodological aspects of uncertainty analysis in lca for instance on handling the issue of correlations between input parameters in uncertainty propagation groen and heijungs 2017 on the need of statistically supported conclusions by null hypothesis testing in comparative lca henriksson et al 2015 and on exploring a broad range of scenario space gregory et al 2016 in addition to its continuous development uncertainty analysis does not capture all uncertainties e g model uncertainty epistemological uncertainty but the information is still useful for the result interpretation phase rosenbaum et al 2018 sensitivity analysis is an important step for the interpretation of lca results combining uncertainty analysis with sensitivity analysis helps understand the impact of any uncertainty on the results and identify focus points for improved inventory data collection or impact assessment hauschild et al 2017 sensitivity analysis often involves changing selected input parameters one at a time to examine how sensitive the lca results are to each change clavreul et al 2012 half of the reviewed studies have performed some forms of sensitivity analysis to examine model sensitivity it was mainly used for understanding the influence of selected input parameters on lca results or for identifying key influencing input parameters ideally it is conducted with uncertainty analysis because certain input parameters could have higher uncertainty but the results might not be sensitive to these parameters i e lower sensitivity in this case effort would be prioritised to reduce the uncertainty of input parameters that the models are more sensitive to this is particularly important where the technology assessed is still in its early stage of development sensitivity analysis can highlight areas for further research to minimise the uncertainty in more influential input parameters the reviewed studies highlighted some major uncertainties including inventory data gap for non full scale technology amann et al 2018 missing emerging organic contaminants in current impact assessment methods bradford hartke et al 2015 the variability of water and sludge quality parameters niero et al 2014 the variability of spatial characteristics for decentralised recovery kavvada et al 2017 non localised inventory for background data igos et al 2017 temporal representativeness of background data igos et al 2017 emissions from field application of recycled nutrient materials maurer et al 2003 peters and rowley 2009 future lca studies could consider some of these uncertainties to prioritise the effort for inventory data collection 6 future outlook lca can be further developed to address some of the methodological challenges section 6 1 and applied at various scales to support decisions on wastewater based nutrient recycling and more broadly integrated resource recovery from urban water systems future opportunities could be on performing more product perspective lca on recycled nutrient products section 6 2 integrating process perspective lca with other systems approaches for selecting and optimising individual recovery processes section 6 3 assessing emerging nutrient recovery technologies section 6 4 assessing integrated resource recovery systems section 6 5 and going beyond single process product assessment for bigger picture systems analysis at city national and global level section 6 6 6 1 methodological challenges one of the challenges of performing a product perspective lca on recycled nutrient products is to handle the multifunctional nature of most processes section 5 2 the question is what portion of the environment impacts of building and operating the treatment process that provides the functions of waste disposal nutrient recovery and other forms of resource recovery should be allocated to the recycled nutrient product or each of the recycled nutrient products in multi product cases end users may want to know the absolute environmental footprints of recycled nutrient products so as to directly compare them to that of conventional fertilisers in that case relative results from most of the studies are not so useful because of potential inconsistencies among the accounting frameworks used this multifunctionality issue would become even more challenging for integrated resource recovery facilities where different types of recovery products could be yielded zero burden assumption is also related to the multifunctionality issue in lca the zero burden assumption refers to not considering the environmental impacts associated with waste generation i e outside system boundary for instance the environmental impact of digested sludge application for agricultural land does not include that of wastewater treatment process under the zero burden assumption pradel et al 2016 questioned the use of zero burden assumption on assessing the environmental footprints of products recovered from wastes there is still a lack of empirical understanding of the release and plant availability of phosphorus in soil from recovered phosphorus products from wastewater melia et al 2017 section 5 3 an improved modelling of the processes for the application and post application phases of recycled nutrient products is essential research is undergoing to address this challenge but mostly limited to sewage sludge bruun et al 2016 ten hoeve et al 2018 this modelling aspect is especially important for product perspective lca because the use of a nutrient based functional unit may imply that the results are more sensitive to the assumed properties of the recycled nutrient products e g bioavailability nutrient content other methodological challenges are related to limitations of existing impact assessment methods firstly phosphorus resource depletion is not currently included in many impact assessment methods except the cml method and the recent inclusion in the recipe method this means that if an input based functional unit is used the direct benefit of reducing phosphorus resource extraction is not being accounted for instead only the indirect benefits of reducing resource inputs and emissions from for example fertiliser offset are included secondly many organic pollutants are missing in common impact assessment methods as discussed in section 5 5 6 2 product perspective lca for nutrient recycling currently a product perspective lca for nutrient rich materials recycling from wastewater is still rare section 5 1 future research can perform more product perspective lca to assess recycled nutrient products monitoring environmental and consumer concerns is considered to be a challenge for the utilisation of the recycled nutrient products from wastewater hukari et al 2016 a product perspective lca allows the end users of recycled nutrient products to compare the potential environmental impacts of agricultural land application of recycled nutrient products to that of conventional fertilisers as more recycled nutrient products are becoming available on the market end users may consider the environmental impacts of the recycled nutrient products in addition to their quality and application costs this would require a consistent accounting approach to quantify and even certificate the life cycle environmental impact potential of the recycled nutrient products 6 3 process perspective lca with other systems approaches future research for process perspective lca can combine life cycle assessment with other systems approaches e g life cycle cost analysis dynamic process modelling to aid the design and optimisation of nutrient recovery processes centralised or distributed and their integration into existing wastewater infrastructure while a product perspective lca can help end users choose what recycled nutrient products suit them more from an environmental point of view a process perspective lca is useful for wastewater utilities to select and optimise recovery processes increasingly there are studies customising and integrating lca approaches with other modelling approaches for systems analysis of nutrient recovery processes kavvada et al 2017 combined life cycle environmental assessment with economic assessment geospatial modelling and last mile logistics modelling to assess a decentralised nitrogen recovery approach at a city scale igos et al 2017 coupled lca with process simulation and economic assessment to assess a new source separated urine technology for struvite precipitation and ammonia recovery integrated assessment coupling lca with other systems approaches is also gaining popularity for exploring other wastewater based resource recovery for example optimising the integration of wastewater energy recovery to local energy supply kollmann et al 2017 multi metric sustainability assessment of material recovery from wastewater zijp et al 2017 6 4 using lca to assess emerging nutrient recovery technologies traditionally lca was developed for detailed analysis of products or processes that have clear specifications of their resource consumptions and emissions olsen et al 2017 lca has now been increasingly applied with a future perspective to assess emerging technologies that do not necessarily have full scale inventory assessing a technology at its early development stage with lca can provide an opportunity to identify environmental impacts that can be potential barriers for its full scale implementation fang et al 2016 to gain insight on technical factors that require further research and development kavvada et al 2017 to support scale up arvidsson et al 2018 and to ensure that only the more promising development paths are pursued before lock in occurs hermansson et al 2019 a number of future oriented lca studies assessed laboratory stage or pilot stage nutrient recycling approaches ion exchange based nitrogen recovery kavvada et al 2017 lin et al 2016 microalgae based nutrient recovery arashiro et al 2018 fang et al 2016 phosphorus recovery from sludge incineration ash amann et al 2018 lundin et al 2004 phosphorus recovery using biological acidification pradel and aissani 2019 nitrogen recovery using microbial electrolysis cell igos et al 2017 and decentralised facility for nutrient recycling from human excreta shi et al 2018 into the future emerging nutrient recovery techniques such as bioelectrochemical systems and sorption processes could be subjects for life cycle assessment future oriented lca study of emerging technologies is also referred to as prospective lca arvidsson et al 2018 conducting prospective lca is more challenging than conventional lca because of potentially incomparable functional units and system boundaries between new technology and existing technology scaling issues between laboratory pilot scale process and full scale process larger data gaps and higher uncertainty hetherington et al 2014 some of the reviewed future oriented lca studies on emerging technology overcame some of these challenges by using process simulation for scaling up technology igos et al 2017 assessing and reporting uncertainty kavvada et al 2017 and providing transparent and detailed inventories amann et al 2018 6 5 using lca to assess integrated resource recovery as we are having a better understanding on some of the recycling pathways or technologies technical details or certain technologies should not only be assessed in isolation as it can be a barrier to identify broad patterns and opportunities in the field as a whole harder et al 2019 no single technology can effectively recover all the nutrients in waste stream mehta et al 2015 we can only maximise nutrient recycling by combining individual pathways and technologies for example wang et al 2018 assessed the life cycle environmental impacts of a proposed wastewater treatment system with integrated resource recovery of water for irrigation nutrients through irrigated water struvite and biosolids energy from combustion of nitrous oxide methane and sludge and material as polyhydroxyalkanoate pha trade offs and synergies may exist between different resource recovery approaches mo and zhang 2013 lca should be used to assess wastewater systems with integrated resource recovery e g energy recovery water recycling material recovery co management with food waste the multifunctional nature of wastewater systems with integrated resource recovery implies that a single functional unit may not be ideal for comparing different configurations of these systems the use of multiple functional units to assess alternative can provide more opportunities for cross study comparisons sena and hicks 2018 and can also provide insights from various perspectives e g nutrient recovery efficiency wastewater treatment efficiency 6 6 using lca for bigger picture systems analysis going beyond individual recovery technologies and pathways to better integrate end user needs and the bigger picture is valuable harder et al 2019 bigger picture systems analysis involves understanding the performance and impacts of wastewater based nutrient recycling opportunities in the context of the wider systems at city national and global level this could be particularly important for decentralised solutions as geospatial characteristics likely lead to spatial variation in the performance of distributed systems within a given region in addition systems analysis that uses a multi regional approach could enable inter regional comparison benchmarking and learning it also provides a better understanding of the impacts of geospatial characteristics on the system performance a number of recent works have used systems approaches to explore the bigger picture issues of resource recovery from wastewater trimmer and guest 2018 estimated for 56 cities globally the transport distances for nutrient recycled from human excreta to the surrounding agricultural demand wang et al 2015 assessed the environmental impacts of transitioning wastewater treatment plants from resource removal to resource recovery in 50 countries while lca was traditionally developed to assess products or processes in more confined scales it has now also found its roles in bigger picture systems analysis for water related issues at city national and global level kavvada et al 2016 integrated life cycle environmental modelling with spatial modelling to evaluate the impacts of spatial characteristics on the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions of city scale non potable water reuse wang et al 2019 simulated the life cycle environmental impacts of reducing nutrient discharge from domestic wastewater globally with consideration of spatial and temporal variations strategic use of lca helps identify hotspots for action and unveil potentially unintended indirect impacts and ultimately contributes to the planning and implementation of nutrient and resource recovery from urban water systems as discussed in section 4 3 while the use of sewage sludge for agriculture land application is restricted in some countries the practice is still a major sludge disposal method in many countries with increasing concern on potential soil contamination there could be a shift from this practice to other sludge disposal methods with without nutrient recycling lca could provide a framework to understand the potential environmental consequences of this large scale change of practice 7 conclusions this work reviewed lca studies that considered nutrient recycling from wastewater for agricultural land application the implications are as follows more studies suggested positive environmental outcomes from wastewater based nutrient recycling especially when chemical inputs are minimised and source separation of human excreta is achieved while the lca methodology has been generally well adapted and increasingly applied for assessing wastewater based nutrient recycling opportunities there is still a need to further harmonise and develop methodological aspects and guidelines that are more relevant to nutrient recycling e g multifunctionality fertiliser offset accounting contaminant accounting even for the few methodology aspects that we explored methodological inconsistencies are prominent inconsistent method can be a barrier for the robust use of lca for decision making on wastewater based nutrient recycling in comparing similar studies in this review it is evident that some studies lack transparency on their inventory underlying methodological assumptions and system boundary i e what components are being included or excluded the lack of transparency prevents meaningful comparison across some studies and result generalisation integrating up to date cross disciplinary knowledge e g agricultural science soil science environmental toxicology into lca models is needed to better quantify the environmental impacts of applying recycled nutrient products in many studies there is a clear spatial disconnection between the recycled nutrient products and local factors such as soil related factors and type of avoided fertiliser in many of the studies reviewed lca was used in a comparative context to contrast different system configurations with nutrient recycling or to compare nutrient recycling systems against reference systems without nutrient recycling there is a clear lack of consideration of result uncertainty in these comparative lca studies if the results of lca are to be used to support decision result uncertainty has to be explored and communicated the future opportunities could be on performing more product perspective lca on recycled nutrient products integrating process perspective lca with other systems approaches for selecting and optimising individual recovery processes

oil hydraulic fracturing water treatment technologies 1 introduction the water footprint of oil and gas o g production relevant to unconventional gas and tight oil ugto recovery has received considerable attention in recent years though nation wide reviews on the topic remain scarce kondash and vengosh 2015 kondash et al 2018 hydraulic fracturing hf or fracking is the predominant well stimulation method used in the united states for ugto recovery from shale and carbonate reservoirs u s epa 2016a during hf operations a water based fluid fracking fracturing fluid is injected into hydrocarbon bearing deposits at pressures sufficient to crack or fracture the formation during production large quantities of water are generated alongside the recovered ugto typical water to oil ratio 3 1 many o g companies have great interest in reusing this water for additional hf operations to improve their water footprint i e minimize freshwater withdrawals and potential impacts upon disposal and to save on well development costs where applicable produced water pw is defined here as all waters generated from o g production post drilling pw accounts for the vast majority of the volume of fluids generated from oil and gas wells clark and veil 2015 2009 depending on the age and location of the well the pw to oil volume ratio wor can range from 3 1 to greater than 10 1 clark and veil 2009 with the ratio typically in the lower range 3 1 to 4 1 for shale reservoirs scanlon et al 2014 total u s pw volumes from both conventional and hydraulically fractured wells referred hereafter respectively as c pw and u pw are estimated upwards of 880 109 gal 3 3 109 m3 annually concomitant to the production of nearly 95 109 gal 3 6 108 m3 of oil and 30 109 ft3 8 5 108 m3 of natural gas of which u pw accounts for roughly 150 109 gal 5 7 108 m3 per year clark and veil 2015 silva et al 2017 thiel et al 2015 u pw currently accounts for a smaller portion 17 of the total u s

hf and raises the possibility of turning a waste into a valuable resource in addition the prospect of reusing and recycling u pw could help minimize the o g industry s freshwater withdrawals which while relatively minor on a national scale dieter et al 2018 could impact local municipal and or agricultural operations in arid and semi arid regions echchelh et al 2018 nicot and scanlon 2012 the

challenging in these tighter formations gerritsen and durlofsky 2005 kazemi et al 1976 this fluid is composed of water and proppant typically sand or ceramic at 87 and 13 vol respectively u s epa 2016a 2015 chemical additives account for 0 20 vol and can include friction reducing polymers white and mungal 2008 cross linked or liner gels barati and liang 2014 stringfellow et al 2014 biocides kahrilas et al 2015 surfactants lester et al 2015 xu et al 2012 and inhibitors for scale and corrosion lester et al 2015 stringfellow et al 2014 the proppant is deposited and embeds into the new fissures forming porous channels through which hydrocarbons and water then diffuse and flow up the wellbore to surface facilities for phase separation and recovery u s epa 2016a the use of hf technology in the u s dates back to the late 1940 s but it was not until ca 2000 when this method was coupled with advanced directional drilling techniques i e horizontal deviated wells that recovering the nation s shale hydrocarbon resources became economically viable montgomery and smith 2010 teff 2018 u s epa 2016a nearly one third of all us hf wells were constructed between 2000 and

agency 2017 explorations in the united kingdom cotton et al 2014 and continental europe have yet to yield commercial shale gas wells as of 2016 de silva et al 2016 inman 2016 similarly australian 396 1012 ft3 396 tcf or 11 2 1012 m3 of recoverable shale gas and south american development is an ongoing technical political and economic debate although argentina s vaca muerta play 308 tcf 8 7 1012 m3

full scale commercial development kuuskraa et al 2013 due in part to logistical and geological complexity water used for fracturing operations in areas such as the fuling gas field is expected to exceed 50 of the water used in u s operations total of 10 5 109 32 7 109 gal or 39 9 106 123 9 106 m3 median values of water required on a per well basis in the sichuan basin 9 106 gal well or 3 4 104

horn river and liard basins alberta duvernay muskwa basal banff montney and the colorado and saskatchewan bakken williston basin with the technical practices closely mirroring those in the u s alberta energy regulator 2015 in addition environmental regulations in canada as in the u s are a combination of subnational e g province state and national policies carter and eaton 2016 in 2017 total water volumes used for hf in alberta were over 6 34 109 gal 24 106 m3 including non saline water and 4 recycled water combined while british columbia reportedly used 2 3 109 gal 8 8 106 m3 alberta energy regulator 2018 to keep with the technical rather than regulatory focus of this work we do not discuss further pw in canadian ugto basins we also omit water treatment discussions for offshore operations as they have been discussed elsewhere clark and veil 2015 fakhru l razi et al 2009 zheng et al 2016 only 3 of the total u s pw volumes in 2012 came from offshore operations and its management differs greatly due to infrastructure restrictions clark and veil 2015 2 3 the hydraulic fracturing water cycle while this article focuses on end use implementation an understanding of the other stages is necessary to address treatment goals the hf water cycle consists of five stages acquisition fluid mixing injection u pw handling and end use implementation u s epa 2016a fluid mixing describes the process of formulating fracking fluids no standard formula exists formulation is a function of the well geology and depth initial water quality and operator discretion in general these mixtures are 99 8 wt water and proppant mixed with 0 2 vol of additional chemicals u s epa 2016a 2015 chemical disclosure registries such as the ground water protection council and interstate oil and gas compact commission s fracfocus document additives on an individual well basis gwpc and interstate oil and gas compact commission iogcc 2014 freshwater is by far the largest volume component used in the development of these fracturing fluids as an example from 2000 to 2011 the cumulative freshwater usage for shale gas hf operations was reported to vary throughout texas from 1 7 109 gal 6 5 106 m3 haynesville to 4 8 109 gal 18 106 m3 eagle ford and up to 38 3 109 gal 145 106 m3 barnett nicot and scanlon 2012 to place this in context water used across the entire barnett development in 2010 was 9 of the 81 4 109 gal 308 106 m3 consumed by the nearby city of dallas 2010 population of 1 2 million that same year and significantly less than the annual average statewide consumption of 5 22 1012 gal 19 8 109 m3 including rural communities nicot and scanlon 2012 twdb 2015 similarly in north dakota the total freshwater used for hf activities in the bakken from 2005 to 2013 was 15 8 109 gal 59 9 106 m3 scanlon et al 2014 from 2005 to 2014 the cumulative hf water volumes for 10 of the largest u s formations e g barnett bakken eagle ford marcellus niobrara permian and others was roughly 250 109 gal 940 106 m3 kondash and vengosh 2015 scanlon et al 2014 initial water acquisition and the subsequent u pw handling are dictated by the remote locations of well sites in some cases no centralized infrastructure exists so the initial assessment and site construction can take on the order of 10 16 weeks u s epa 2016a in preparation for u pw a variety of options are implemented depending on the region specific regulations site logistics and or projected water volumes groundwater protection council 2009 u s epa 2016a above ground storage tanks asts are typically closed loop systems in which pw is directly transferred from the wellhead through interconnecting pipelines u s epa 2016a these tanks can be either open or closed to the environment and provide intermediate storage before the pw is either trucked off site or in some cases reused at the well less often lined earthen pits are built as open air holding ponds while regulations have gradually phased out this method on a national scale pits are still common practice in specific high producing regions of the country such as texas railroad commision of texas 2018 barnett and permian shale and in some rare instances in the green river basin lyman et al 2018 finally it should be noted that u pw generated during the first few weeks of production is often referred to as flowback water to differentiate from water associated with long term post flowback production rosenblum et al 2017 this distinction is made because flowback water can contain larger quantities of residual hf chemicals sand silt and proppant from the near wellbore after initial well production begins presenting a very different water profile than post flowback or produced water this temporal variability can have a significant influence on the viability of management options during the first 21 days of production highlighting that suitable treatment technologies should exhibit flexible capacities even at a single well site oetjen et al 2018 2 4 produced water characteristics the chemical and ion content of u pw as well as c pw are highly variable and dependent on well location geology and operational parameters u pw composition variability arises primarily from formation waters found naturally alongside entrapped hydrocarbons water salinity and total dissolved solids tds correlate with the geological basin shale play and well depth khan et al 2016 shaffer et al 2013 for example amongst the big four u s plays i e bakken eagle ford permian and marcellus u s energy information administration 2015 the bakken region around north dakota has tds exceeding 200 000 mg l 1 whereas pennsylvania s marcellus shale averages closer to 100 000 mg l 1 maguire boyle and barron 2014 shaffer et al 2013 u s epa 2016a more recent work has also showcased the strong geographic dependence of dissolved organic carbon and bacterial speciation wang et al 2019 note that the level of trace hydrocarbons in u pw storage facilities is highly dependent on the efficacy of local separation equipment e g free water knockout and operator competency in general the tds in u pw ranges from brackish 10 000 mg l 1 to nearly saturated 260 000 mg l 1 with chloride sulfide sulfate carbonate and alkali and or alkaline earth metals being the dominant ions in extreme cases the tds can approach 400 000 mg l 1 10 saltier than seawater 35 000 mg l 1 at which point solids precipitation is inevitable due to supersaturation shaffer et al 2013 u s epa 2016a naturally occurring radioactive materials norms are another challenge in u pw and are present predominantly as radium 226 and radium 228 sulfates that have co precipitated with barium and strontium sulfate scales chapman et al 2012 international association of oil and gas 2008 rowan et al 2011 total organic carbon toc originates from fracking fluid additives treatment chemicals and trace oil and grease with typical concentrations 1000 mg l 1 but can approach as high as 6000 mg l 1 maguire boyle and barron 2014 total suspended solids tss including silica metal oxides and other minerals are also commonly encountered bacterial invasion and proliferation can be severely problematic for hf operations down well formation of biofilms over the fractured pores proppant pack or other flow paths can impede hydrocarbon extraction sulfate thiosulfate and sulfur reducing bacteria srb present an environmental health hazard from the bio production of hydrogen sulfide h2s and an operational threat due to the potential for well souring which can often represent a substantial cost for operators gaspar et al 2014 gieg et al 2011 moreover acid producing bacteria apb and srb both threaten wellbore tubulars and pipelines due to microbially influenced induced corrosion mic enning and garrelfs 2014 corrosion products e g organic acids and common precipitates such as iron oxides and iron sulfides can damage drilling equipment threaten wellbore integrity and ultimately shorten the lifespan of the well alley et al 2011 we identify ten contamination metrics to assess u pw quality total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss scale hardness iron sulfate norms heavy metals rcra8 organics and bacteria fig 1 highlights the major shale plays across the u s that have been considered in this study and illustrates the vast variation of their

database v2 3 blondes et al 2018 scale is defined here as the combined barium ba strontium sr calcium ca magnesium mg and iron fe ion concentrations that have precipitated with sulfate carbonate or

industries e g municipal waste treatment where these terms are sometimes at least colloquially used interchangeably iron describes dissolved and precipitated fe ii fe iii species sulfate is the cumulative concentration of all sulfate species e g feso4 baso4 etc norms represent the total concentration of ra 226 and ra 228 several other radioactive elements e g rn 222 sr isotopes have been documented in pw however national reporting of these elements is sparse whereas ra 226 and ra 228 are commonly measured the concentration of heavy metals has been defined as the cumulative concentration of arsenic as barium ba cadmium cd chromium cr lead pb mercury hg selenium se and silver ag as defined by the u s resource recovery and conservation act i e rcra 8 u s epa 2017 the value of organics is taken as the total organic carbon toc content of the water the working definition of bacteria used here is simply the total bacterial counts per volume of water count 100 ml 1 no distinction is made between species or function e g srb apb however reporting a national average for bacterial concentrations would be misleading bacterial control is already a central concern for oil field operators kahrilas et al 2015 and this extends to the mitigation of bacterial growth in the pw ponds storage tanks a similar analysis for the eight largest producing shale plays as opposed to the national average illustrated in fig 1 may be found in fig s1 elemental analyses organic classifications bacterial speciation and norm measurements for specific wells across the u s are not discussed here akob et al 2015 barbot et al 2013 harkness et al 2015 lutz et al 2013 oetjen et al 2018 orem et al 2007 thacker et al 2015 overall u pw is a highly variable and chemically complex water matrix that poses site specific treatment and reuse challenges we conclude that treatment technologies must be tailored to the localized water quality and specific needs of the intended end use compounded with region specific regulations well site logistics economics and differing field development goals a one size fits all treatment methodology is unfeasible 3 current pw management practices 3 1 overview of potential options here we identify three general end use categories disposal reuse and recycle disposal describes end uses with no subsequent purpose or utility such as direct injection into a disposal well evaporation or surface discharge treatment towards disposal prioritizes solids oil and microbial contaminant mitigation as well as regulatory compliance reuse goals are those focused towards internal reuse to further hydrocarbon production such as hf or enhanced recovery reuse could potentially close the water cycle for drilling and fracturing operations thus alleviating strains on freshwater withdrawals entrekin et al 2018 minimizing water transportation activities lutz et al 2013 and mitigating environmental contamination risks lauer et al 2016 mclaughlin et al 2016 internal reuse treatment is broadly defined but usually focuses on reducing solids residual oil grease iron and certain chemical additives from hf that could interact with the specific planned reuse option while leaving the tds unchanged recycle or beneficial disposition describes implementing pw for an alternative purpose echchelh et al 2018 requirements for this category can differ greatly but will usually require desalination for example the required water quality for crop irrigation ayers and westcot 1985 olkowski 2009 u s epa 2012b is far more stringently regulated than waters used for road dust ice control goodman 2017 north dakota department of health to emphasize this point a few recycle examples have been selected ranging from those that are currently in use to those that are simply proposed ideas e g potable water sabie and fernanld 2016 this discussion should not be considered a comprehensive list for additional context regulatory requirements for water disposal on a state by state basis may be found using the fracfocus search engine gwpc and interstate oil and gas compact commission iogcc 2014 precise figures for pw volumes on a national scale are not readily available surprisingly although recovered o g volumes have been rigorously documented since industrial production first began monitoring of pw volumes has only been performed in the last few decades and u pw specifically was not monitored as its own category until 2008 in the barnett shale clark and veil 2009 lewis and hughes 2008 and is in fact still not separately identified in some regions moreover while it is becoming commonplace to report pw volumes documenting its subsequent management remains rare to the best of our knowledge the most recent report of this nature was based on data gathered in 2012 clark and veil 2015 more recent reports on the big four u s shale regions suggests that from 2011 to 2016 u pw volumes generated within the first production year increased by up to 1440 in some regions reflecting an increase in per well water use of up to 770 kondash et al 2018 emphasizing the dynamic evolving nature of this issue however despite the evident annual variations in the precise water volumes utilized in ugto operations we estimate that the dominant pw management practices have remained comparatively consistent on a national scale 3 2 current practices the lack of complete high quality data limited our ability to quantify the water balance for ugto production separately from the water balance for the overall o g production in 2012 over 90 of all pw from conventional and ugto wells was estimated to have been reinjected underground of which 40 was injected into onsite disposal wells 5 was transported and injected into offsite disposal wells and 45 was used for enhanced recovery fig 2 clark and veil 2015 veil and clark 2011 besides re injection roughly 4 of pw was evaporated 3 was discharged to the surface note that this particular practice is becoming increasingly prohibited in light of evolving regulations and the rest was either sent to third party businesses for treatment or reused in fluid formulations clark and veil 2015 for u pw specifically we estimate that a far greater majority 90 national scale of the water reinjected underground is targeted towards disposal wells onsite or offsite given that pw cannot be implemented for enhanced recovery in unconventional wells that is most u pw is currently disposed highlighting the opportunity to increase its reuse again although reliable national statistics are lacking this point has been showcased clearly in recent sub national investigations such as the bakken shrestha et al 2017 in which 95 of u pw was disposed note that a key exception to this national trend is the marcellus region hill et al 2019 where recent regional regulations have led to a significantly greater amount 50 of u pw to be reused within the state to fracture new wells which is reflected by a decrease in the average distance traveled by surfaced water to a end use location from 95 miles in 2012 to 23 miles in 2017 however even in pennsylvania a state that has arguably the most rigorous documentation of pw management practices nearly one third of all liquid waste generated from 1991 to 2017 does not have a reported final destination hill et al 2019 disposal injection requires high permeability formations that can be saturated with pw effectively acting as subsurface storage this is commonplace in for example the delaware and midland basins of texas and is considered safe practice by regulatory agencies vidic et al 2013 however injection has been scrutinized for its association with elevated seismic activity davies et al 2013 drummond and grubert 2017 ellsworth 2013 jackson et al 2014 groundwater contamination he et al 2017 luek and gonsior 2017 and possibly even surface water contamination akob et al 2016 kassotis et al 2016 in select areas disposal injection treatment prioritizes lowering the tss such that well and or formation pores are not plugged and equipment well integrity is not compromised jiménez et al 2018 the relative ease and low cost of this practice provides its appeal but onsite disposal well availability can be limited i e in areas with intensive drilling or restrictive regulations requiring then pw to be transported by trucks offsite reusing pw by reinjecting it into a producing formation i e water or steam flooding is a widely practiced enhanced recovery method for conventional wells clark and veil 2015 as a well ages the output rate decreases due to diminished down well pressures water flooding involves pumping the fluid into the reservoir to offset the lost extraction volume increase pressure and stimulate transport of the remaining hydrocarbons this logical end use for c pw does not apply for u pw as the low porosity shale and carbonate formations have minimal pore volume that may be saturated with water 3 3 current treatment technologies current pw treatment approaches and some promising treatment technologies have been the subject of several excellent reviews colorado school of mines 2009 fakhru l razi et al 2009 jiménez et al 2018 silva et al 2017 the following section provides an overview of a typical pw treatment train currently used in industry fig 3 with the objective of highlighting in section 4 how emerging technologies may be used to bridge the gap in treatment capabilities within a fit for purpose framework physical methods e g filtration adsorption are applicable to inorganic and organic contaminants but can be impractical and cost prohibitive for particularly high tds and or tss waters due to excessive fouling plugging scaling and or large quantities of sludge generation chemical methods particularly chemical oxidation are common for bacterial control and or to decompose refractory organics sequential chemical physical methods entail adding an active chemical species such as a flocculant or complexing agent and then physically removing the ensuing product this approach is well established in municipal water treatment lee et al 2014 but still exhibits the aforementioned shortcomings of purely physical processes large expensive infrastructure e g clarifier or settling tanks is required for these approaches to be practical current technologies for u pw treatment are frequently categorized into primary secondary and occasionally tertiary treatments based primarily on the tds salinity of the water arthur et al 2005 a fourth treatment level zero liquid discharge zld is considered when treat to release of u pw is permitted by regulatory agencies primary treatment methods target removal of most solids residual oil grease iron fracturing fluid additives and bacteria secondary treatment entails removal of multivalent ions including ba2 ca2 mg2 sr2 fe2 so4 2 co3 2 and po4 3 that escaped primary treatment measures these ions can adversely affect the performance of fracturing fluid additives during internal reuse and contribute to scaling tendencies when mixed with incompatible waters tertiary treatment processes enable full salt removal through desalination and specialized filtration technologies in a typical ugto operation the produced oil gas and water are first separated at the wellhead using 2 or 3 phase separation equipment to prepare the hydrocarbons for sale american petroleum institute 1990 de sanding and or simple filtration systems such as sock filters are often implemented prior to these separators to remove proppant and other large debris the aqueous phase effluent is then further treated at a saltwater disposal swd facility or central processing facility cpf prior to disposal by well injection modification for internal reuse or occasionally permitted release utilizing an assortment of treatment technologies discussed in the following sections the block flow diagram provided in fig 3 illustrates the typical treatment train associated with current produced water management practices 3 3 1 separation and clarification separation and clarification technologies are selected based on water quality and facility economics with the goal of removing the smallest solids and oil droplets that passed through the oil water separators present solid particles can include silica metal oxides and sulfides inorganic scale and gelled polymers settling ponds frac pits and above ground storage tanks asts utilize quiescent gravity assisted phase separation to provide low cost removal of the densest solids with moderate retention times 12 48 h the primary drawbacks to settling ponds pits include a need for animal deterrent systems multiple liners to prevent containment loss leak detection capabilities and often a large physical footprint 4 21 million gallon capacity dynamic methods of separation include hydroclones media filtration and floatation equipment that can remove solids in a continuous manner at shorter residence times media filtration uses silica sand alumina carbon beds glass beads and walnut shells rawlins and sadeghi 2018 walnut shells in particular are rapidly growing in popularity as they are an inexpensive renewable filtering agent that can typically be disposed of in landfills defining characteristics of these technologies are that they provide very high near complete water recovery require zero to minimal additional infrastructure and are universally applicable to pw i e these technologies are not limited by tds or inorganic ion content speciation in practice approaches under this category may be easily scaled to accommodate any oil and grease concentrations typically encountered in the field but inherently generate an additional solid waste sludge stream that must be disposed 3 3 2 oxidation after simple filtration a common first option for u pw primary treatment is to send the aqueous phase to an oxidation unit that decomposes fracturing fluid polymers and additives kills bacteria and induces sedimentation of dissolved iron or other trace metals as metal oxides commonly used chemical oxidants for u pw include sodium hypochlorite chlorine dioxide erkenbrecher et al 2015 ozone organic peracids de paula et al 2013 hydrogen peroxide and oxygen via addition through aeration less common options include chlorine gas and permanganate but the inherently greater safety hazard associated with the storage and handling of these oxidants in remote locations limits their practicality similarly chlorine dioxide requires additional care due to its low boiling point 11 c and instability toward decomposition fracturing fluid chemicals can decompose into a plethora of products in either the wellbore due to elevated temperatures or in the well and or oxidation unit due to oxidative damage weaver et al 2003 xiong et al 2018 it should be noted that degradation products from oxidation unit effluents have not yet been fully quantified presenting an opportunity for future research as with separation and clarification processes chemical oxidation is not typically restricted by water tds or ion content and provides the appealing benefit of complete water recovery several of the contaminates in u pw e g iron sulfate nitrates organics polymers can provide a source of nutrition for microbes srbs and apbs are the main microbial invaders in u pw and can be treated using either chemical oxidants or non oxidizing biocides kahrilas et al 2015 for operators chemical oxygen demand cod and chloride residuals are standard measurements to qualify biocide effectiveness and bacterial counts before and after treatment and are typically reported using standard nace protocols which include techniques such as serial dilution bottle tests radio respirometry and atp photometry nace 1994 more recently emerging advanced oxidation process aop technologies such as electrochemical and electrocatalytic oxidation are undergoing development in the water treatment industry to replace bulk chemical oxidants and to further improve safety reduce field inventory and optimize manpower while a detailed discussion of aop technologies is provided in a later section it must be noted now that a small number of oil field service entities currently offer commercialized variants of these technologies for example the electrolysis of high chloride pw with 58 120 ppm ammonia was shown to generate chloramine in situ which subsequently functioned as an effective biocide achieving a 10 log reduction in srb and apb counts during pilot tests in the fayetteville shale boal and mowery 2015 3 3 3 coagulation and floatation and clarification colloidal particles and oil droplets are usually too small to remove from water during the early separation and oxidation treatments yet these contaminants must be removed prior to even subsurface disposal of u pw to avoid well impairment to achieve this inorganic salts of ferric iron or aluminum sulfate alum are mixed into the u pw with agitation to destabilize emulsions disrupt charged particles and coagulate polymers surfactants in a process called coagulation flocculation the ferric and alum salts form 3 d networks that help trap fine contaminants in their matrix resulting in a more clarified u pw gebbie 2006 these materials then coagulate and float to the top of the treatment tank for removal by skimming some operators especially in conventional o g facilities use dissolved gas floatation dgf or dissolved air floatation daf equipment to remove the coagulated sediment in a continuous manner sport 1969 daf and dgf accomplish this by injecting gas or air bubbles into the tank to float the agglomerated solids to the surface where they are removed by a mechanical skimmer the clarified aqueous phase is removed from the bottom of the tank and sent to the next processing step challenges to using this equipment include complications that arise due to the adhesive nature of the flocculant leading to undesirable coating and tank fouling during skimming operations as with the other aforementioned primary treatment options the appeal of these methods is that they are not typically restricted by the severity of the tds or inorganic ion concentration note that while these methods inherently require an investment in additional infrastructure they benefit from decades of refinement and optimization in conventional o g pw treatment finally divalent metals including ca2 and fe2 are precipitated chemically using alkali carbonate hydroxide or sulfate salts see section 3 3 4 water in this condition now void of most oil contaminants and solids can be stored for reuse in fracking operations or disposed by well injection a best practice is to provide a biocide treatment to manage microbial growth using either commercial non oxidizing biocides or chemical oxidants prior to injection into the disposal well 3 3 4 secondary treatment divalent ion removal preventing inorganic scale reducing water hardness and removing problematic divalent ions e g norms iron from u pw are the goals of secondary treatment processes whereas primary treatment methods are characterized by their robust capabilities and near universal applicability secondary treatment processes have more variable capabilities and are more restricted by pw quality and process economics most divalent ions present in pw are alkaline earth metals and iron although sulfate and carbonate are included in this description removing these ions is important to address concerns of potential norm or inorganic scale forming in the disposal well due to mixing of incompatible waters in hf operations where crosslinked guar polymers are used the boron or metal based crosslinking agents that viscosify these polymers can end up in u pw and should be removed in this stage to avoid future chemical compatibility issues traditional methods for removing the divalent ba2 ca2 sr2 ra2 and mg2 are sparse but include adding sulfate or carbonate ions to the water i e lime softening to induce precipitation of the metals as the metal sulfates or carbonates folio et al 2018 an advantage to this approach is the operational simplicity less restrictive tds constraints tds 100 000 mg l 1 and low cost for low salinity pw ion exchange processes are sometimes used to soften the water by removing the hardness ions brown and sheedy 2002 it is important to have first removed most tss particularly oxidized metals and oil and grease during primary treatment to avoid fouling of the exchange resins weak acid resins are effective for water where tds 3000 mg l 1 yet require special metallurgy and significant ph adjustments in between uses to regenerate the resins strong acid cations are less effective for water treatment when tds 3000 mg l 1 but are very durable and do not require significant attention to ph or complicated reactor design in general ion exchange processes are applicable for tds concentrations between 500 and 7000 mg l 1 colorado school of mines 2009 as discussed in greater detail in section 4 promising emerging technologies for this application i e preferential removal of multivalent ions over monovalent include nanofiltration tds 500 25 000 mg l 1 and electrically driven charge separation approaches e g cdi currently the suite of technologies which can be classified as dedicated secondary treatment methods is limited and presents an inviting opportunity for future research and case studies 3 3 5 tertiary treatment desalination tertiary treatment methods target salt removal to reduce tds and possibly iron or other heavy metals that passed through the primary and secondary treatments i e desalination the leading technology options in this treatment class include evaporation distillation crystallization and reverse forward or hybrid osmosis albeit with limitations for example while reverse osmosis ro is remarkably efficient for removing dissolved solids the maximum tolerated feed tds is 45 000 mg l 1 thus ro would likely need to be the final treatment step after high salt removal depending on the initial pw quality for high tds pw 40 000 mg l 1 distillation technologies e g multi stage flash vapor compression mechanical vapor compression are viable options but are prone to scaling when treating waters with elevated multivalent cation concentrations underscoring the need for additional secondary treatment technologies and suffer from low water recovery rates and high energy costs colorado school of mines 2009 most tertiary treatment options are constrained by the process economics equipment and footprint and are therefore seldom performed unless required by regulatory agencies this level of treatment is typically only seen in regions of the country that strictly limit the use of disposal wells and discharge volumes e g marcellus hill et al 2019 shaffer et al 2013 it is worth mentioning that these regulatory restrictions have contributed to an economic environment in which relatively high energy offsite treatment approaches e g crystallizer technology are viable options for u pw management as discussed in the following section desalination technologies benefit from a comparatively greater amount of dedicated research effort in the academic community emerging approaches ranging from a host of membrane based technologies to electrically driven ion removal methods all seek to minimize energy consumption and improve water recovery rates 4 emerging end use opportunities and u pw fit for purpose treatment options 4 1 end use selection and research philosophy the variation in u pw quality and treatment objectives implies that technologies must adopt a fit for purpose philosophy to match the treated water quality to the intended use alvarez et al 2018 anastas and zimmerman 2007 starting water quality dictates the feasibility of a treatment method and the potential end uses to emphasize this fig 4 provides a comparison between the national average for each of the ten established contamination metrics in pw defined under produced water characteristics and the required treatment objectives of six representative end uses which were selected to span promising options for reuse e g fracking fluid recycle e g agriculture livestock potable and disposal e g well injection surface discharge goals these six end uses should not be considered an exhaustive list but were chosen to illustrate that the desired purpose of the treated water dictates the priority contaminants and thus the suite of treatment technologies that must be deployed i e fit for purpose the chosen targets are surface aquifer discharge disposal well injection reformulated fracking fluid agricultural reuse for non consumable crops livestock watering and potable water the values reported in fig 4 further details in table s2 should be viewed as general guidelines u s epa 2016b as detailed below robust approaches are desired but a single unit with the capability to handle all possible contaminants over the potential concentrations is not realistic instead flexible and modular technologies that preferentially target specific classes of contaminants must be engineered when possible multifunctionality defined here as the ability to simultaneously treat different classes of pollutants that would traditionally require different sequential processes or conditions is also desirable practically multifunctionality manifests through technologies that can bridge the gap between the traditional treatment stages outlined in fig 3 regarding reuse quality standards for o g reservoir flooding or fracking fluid water are not formally established rather requirements are company and or site specific and loosely defined for example recent technical developments emphasize the use of friction reducers that tolerate remarkably high tds 300 000 mg l 1 environments sareen et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 this has resulted in the rise of slickwater and more recently high salt tolerant gel cross linked gel fracs barati and liang 2014 palisch et al 2010 with advanced friction reducers reuse is possible at tds levels that are one order of magnitude higher than was feasible less than a decade ago acharya et al 2011 aside from tds operators will also prioritize contaminants in the source water used for fracking fluids e g iron sulfate depending on the chemical additives formulation they intend to implement to illustrate the implications of source water characteristics in the context of fit for purpose treatment consider a simple example recent work characterizing flowback water from dj basin colorado reported tds of 22 500 mg l 1 tss of 360 mg l 1 a combined sulfide sulfate concentration of 1 6 mg l 1 and an oil and grease concentration of 59 mg l 1 cod 1218 mg l 1 lester et al 2015 if the intent is to reuse this water on site for further hf activities tds tss and sulfur species are all within a tolerable range for direct reuse however the organic load i e oil and grease would need to be reduced by a factor of 2x prior to reuse implying that treatment efficacy could be optimized by deploying technologies that selectively target these contaminants discussed in section 4 2 a key conclusion from this survey of treatment objectives discussed further in research needs and outlook is that in field reuse is the most achievable value added treatment objective i e excluding direct injection disposal which further supports the notion that the hf water cycle fig 2 could be closed or at least that local freshwater withdrawals would be significantly reduced at many drilling locations technologically this could be best achieved via improvements in primary treatment technologies regarding recycle targets the selected standards for potable water guidelines for drinking water quality fourth edition incorporating the first addendum 2017 u s epa 2012b u s epa 2003 agriculture irrigation ayers and westcot 1985 olkowski 2009 u s epa 2012b waldner and looper 2007 and livestock feed ayers and westcot 1985 u s epa 2012b waldner and looper 2007 are stringently defined however the bulk contamination metrics used here fail to capture the importance of some high priority low concentration contaminants e g lead in drinking water that would need to be addressed in a more detailed analysis amongst these recycle goals arguably the most promising is for irrigation of non consumable salt tolerant crops such as cotton lewis 2015 sabie r jr fernald a 2016 wherein human exposure risks are greatly minimized in general however a central conclusion from this analysis is that most recycle targets require an order of magnitude reduction in several of the identified contamination metrics and therefore stand as the most technically and economically challenging end uses specifically recycle goals are hampered by high concentrations of multivalent inorganic species e g norms heavy metals sulfur species fig 4d which are the main targets of current secondary treatment options a compelling motivation for emerging next generation technologies is to 1 offer methods with greater selectivity towards the removal of multivalent inorganic species and 2 bridge the gap between the function of traditional primary and secondary treatment purposes in other words deploy multifunctional primary treatment technologies that can offer the additional benefit of multivalent ion removal for disposal u pw discharged to municipal treatment plants or disposal wells designated class ii injection wells in the u s u s epa 2012a is regulated by the epa while surface discharge although very rarely permitted is regulated through a combination of national and sub national policy texas commission on environmental quality 2016 u s epa 2016b as discussed in section 3 2 current practices disposal injection is typically favored by operators in regions of the country that permit it as the associated treatment requirements are comparatively minimal and therefore less expensive often disposal injection requirements can be economically met after the current primary treatment steps alone when taken in context with the current treatment technologies employed for u pw treatment the situation that emerges is rife with opportunities for next generation on site treatment approaches alvarez et al 2018 pw may be stored on site for up to several weeks before being managed as throughput requirements i e temporal treatment capacity and operation mode e g batch continuous can be remarkably flexible parameters depending on site logistics and local water infrastructure availability the following discussion highlights a variety of next generation treatment technologies that hold promise for pw 4 2 targeting organics and bacteria in complex water matrices such as u pw few chemical or engineered technologies are available to selectively remove bacterial species and or hydrocarbons from the perspective of cost efficiency to date this technological shortcoming stands as the greatest barrier to in field reuse objectives biocides are actively used to control microbial growth but they inherently require consistent repetitive dosing regulations can limit their use and they are challenged by the development of bacterial resistance singer et al 2016 xi et al 2009 moreover the introduction of treatment chemicals particularly chlorine based biocides presents the risk to form persistent and harmful contaminants e g halogenated organics krasner et al 2006 this can be especially detrimental for many potential recycle opportunities outlined previously while the organic content is a small fraction of the inorganic content e g tds in pw the exact nature and amounts of these compounds are rarely known prior to treatment as a result this implies that defining the selectivity of successful technologies is in fact a balance approaches that target classes or types of compounds e g aromatic hydrocarbons will be more useful than those aimed at specific molecules e g benzene advanced oxidation processes aops are attractive for recalcitrant waters since they rely on the in situ formation of highly reactive non selective radicals to degrade organic pollutants holding potential to yield sterile brines without requiring physical separations fernández castro et al 2015 oller et al 2011 pera titus et al 2004 aops are generally based on 1 photolysis e g uv v uv 2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 3 ozonation o3 or 4 fenton fenton like processes pera titus et al 2004 however aop operation costs often restrict suitable target waters to a cod related linearly to toc below 5000 mg l 1 which is much lower 12 than in some u pw pera titus et al 2004 furthermore efficacy of photolysis approaches are greatly inhibited by u pw turbidity up to 1500 ntu and the near neutral ph 6 8 precludes fenton chemistry which exhibits optimum performance around ph 3 moreira et al 2017 a popular approach to improve aop performance is to combine them with biological treatments however successful pilot scale examples of aop biological treatments have been limited to milder environments i e brackish waters 3 wt salts with consistent effluents such as pharmaceutical tannery and textile wastewater oller et al 2011 similar emerging technologies employing heterogeneous catalysis heck et al 2019 have been recently demonstrated on the bench scale to function even in high salinity tds 100 000 mg l 1 environments yin et al 2019 as with traditional aops catalytic technologies hold the ability to generate oxidative species in situ and inherently avoid the generation of a separate concentrated waste stream albeit with the requirement of an additional chemical oxidant precursor similarly although the practical utility of photocatalytic water treatment technologies has recently been subject to debate loeb et al 2019 the possibility that pw might offer the precise type of niche application where engineered photocatalyst systems can flourish cannot be ruled out at this time the analogous electrochemical aops eaops arguably hold even greater promise the most fundamental being anodic oxidation ao ao processes can 1 directly oxidize organic pollutants via electron transfer and or 2 indirectly oxidize organics through generated reactive species while reactive oxygen species ros are the most classically desired oxidants bulk solution oxidants such as chlorine and sulfate persulfate may also be generated beneficially garcia segura et al 2018 moreira et al 2017 for further degradation capacity ao may be combined with the cathodic production of h2o2 utilizing a porous gas diffusion electrode ao cathodic h2o2 barazesh et al 2015 in theory the fe2 found naturally in pw could also be utilized to harness fenton chemistry electro fenton ef he et al 2019 though ef suffers from the same ph limitation as its conventional analogue moreira et al 2017 similarly photolysis enhanced ef methods still display poor performance in turbid waters and high cost inhibit implementation despite these limitations eaops specifically ao and ao cathodic h2o2 hold great promise for pw since as stated prior native ionic species can form powerful oxidants e g active chlorine to degrade organics and or act as a biocide ghanem et al 2016 furthermore pws have a mean conductivity around 140 000 μs cm 1 and can exceed 20 s cm 1 3 400 that of seawater suggesting that eaop efficiencies will not be hampered by charge transfer effects often observed in potential potable water sources nonetheless these complex electrolyte mixtures also pose serious challenges hydroxyl radicals can be rapidly scavenged by sulfate and chloride species iron complexes e g sulfato iron and chloro iron can hamper fenton reactions and side reactions can generate additional toxic pollutants such as perchlorate and halogenated organics that would need further treatment chaplin 2014 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 yin et al 2018 other tailored engineered nanomaterials enms may also find opportunity to offer at least incremental improvements to current pw treatment methods specifically the notion of multifunctional materials e g combined adsorptive and photocatalytic materials could bridge the gap between the traditional chemical and physical treatments alvarez et al 2018 as a basic example nano adsorbents typically offer significantly higher specific surface areas and sorption sites than many established materials e g carbon nanotubes vs activated carbon which can significantly increase the practicality of these materials in highly contaminated matrices such as pw qu et al 2013 in addition the surface of these materials can be further modified to contain say antibacterial antimicrobial particles e g nano silver or active catalytic sites to oxidize or fragment adsorbed organics and bacteria alvarez et al 2018 qu et al 2013 4 3 targeting inorganic contaminants even free of bacteria and organics pw end uses especially recycle goals are limited by remarkably high tds 200 000 mg l 1 hardness and scale as well as compounds containing iron sulfate norms and heavy metals shaffer et al provided one of the first thorough looks at promising desalination technologies for shale pw in 2013 shaffer et al 2013 reviewed were mechanical vapor compression mvc membrane distillation md and forward osmosis fo all three have potential to be economical but mvc is the most mature technology and the simplest to implement mvc which exploits the latent heat produced during the compression of vapor to generate additional energy for vaporization is the current standard for desalination during steam assisted gravity drainage in heavy oil fields an enhanced recovery technique and industry expertise is already established the modularized design of the evaporator lends itself well to the required flexibility tds capacity can be scaled with additional evaporator condenser units two primary disadvantages of mvc are the relatively high energy cost associated with operation 10 4 13 6 kwh m3 distillate shaffer et al 2013 and the need for a reliable electrical grid on site improving mvc efficiencies is an ongoing research topic e g material heat transfer drop wise distillation etc but it should be considered that coupling this technology with eaops could help justify the capital investment for a power grid at remote locations more recently a rigorous review of membrane based technologies for applications in o g pw was conducted by chang et al chang et al 2019 included in this discussion were high pressure membrane processes reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf osmotically driven membrane processes forward osmosis fo thermally driven membrane processes direct contact membrane distillation dcmd electrically driven membrane processes electrodialysis ed electrodeionization edi capacitive deionization cdi and more including microbial capacitive desalination deionization and vacuum membrane distillation while a detailed overview of each of these processes is beyond the scope of this review and would be redundant a discussion can offer an additional perspective on how best to implement these technologies in the context of establishing fit for purpose technologies a key shortcoming of membrane technologies is the large capital and operation costs associated with treating complex high salinity feeds and the relatively low water recovery rates 50 that are evident in most tests with real i e non synthetic pw in the pursuit of many recycle goals for which the concentration of key contaminants must decrease to ppm ppb levels e g heavy metals in drinking water the prospect of high reject could be tolerated for the sake of a high purity product water however if the intended end use is to reuse pw on site many if not most state of the art membrane technologies do not serve to resolve the issues that currently hinder oil field operators high cost low recovery treatments which generate additional now more concentrated waste streams do little to prevent the need for off site transportation and in most cases will struggle to find economic viability moreover from an environmental perspective it cannot be asserted at this time that minimizing the volume of disposed water at the cost of greater waste severity i e contaminant concentrations is an improvement over current practice this is not to say that membrane based technologies should not be employed in pw reuse applications but rather that research in this area would benefit from modifying the current metrics of success considering that reuse applications can generally tolerate relatively high 70 000 mg l 1 tds concentrations e g chlorides alkali alkaline earth metals but are often less tolerant of specific inorganic species such as iron precipitates such as iron oxides and iron sulfides can damage drilling equipment or boron borate crosslinking with gel fracturing fluids the prospect of engineering membrane based technologies with greater ion specificity i e secondary treatment options could provide an invaluable tool for operators another promising avenue for targeting dissolved and suspended contaminants is electrocoagulation ec garcia segura et al 2017 ec utilizes a sacrificial anode iron and or aluminum to release active coagulant precursor ions into solution while gas evolves at the cathode typically h2 holt et al 2005 it has historically been used to target hardness heavy metals oil and grease and other organic substances in a wide array of wastewaters including recent examples in the o g industry da costa et al 2016 ringler et al 2017 but has failed to find lasting commercial application esmaeilirad et al 2015 holt et al 2005 zhao et al 2014 this method is advantageous in that treatment can be performed with low capital cost minimal maintenance and natural settling can serve as the primary separation mechanism ec has the key benefit of being largely non selective towards contaminants thus fulfilling the requirement for a robust technology while also being modular enough to implement alongside other treatment technologies e g e aops an added advantage is that electrochemical redox processes are triggered to form hydroxyl radicals chlorine gas and related oxidants for killing bacteria in situ fedotov et al 2013 unfortunately specific high priority contaminates for hf reuse e g boron may not be practically addressed by ec alone chorghe et al 2017 further emphasizing the need for flexible modular technologies and treatment trains zhao et al 2014 additional limitations to the technology include scalability and the need for routine manual intervention to replace electrodes and or clean the equipment to prevent fouling however ec still stands out as a notable technology in terms of multifunctional capabilities ec or similar technologies could bridge the gap between late stage primary treatments e g coagulation and floatation and clarification and secondary treatment e g multivalent ion removal a related technology called magnetic ballast clarification has been recently reported to use a combination of coagulants and flocculating polymers in the presence of magnetic particles to clarify u pw at rates up to 5 gal min 1 ringler et al 2017 u pw and the magnetic particles are introduced into the process unit with agitation resulting in the magnetic particles being coated with the polymers surfactants and charged species a magnetic separator near the water surface then captures the contaminated magnetic particles for cleaning note also that ec treatment will inherently generate a sludge that can potentially contain high levels of heavy metals norms sulfur and toxic chemicals while a discussion of regulations is beyond scope it is safe to assert that ec will necessitate the handling and transportation of solid material offsite to date the environmental and economic impacts of this practice remain largely unexplored finally although it is the least mature of the technologies discussed here reductive heterogeneous catalysis is a promising emerging method to selectively target oxyanion contaminants in addition some small halogenated organics heck et al 2019 yin et al 2018 in a similar engineering approach to aops advanced reduction technologies arts operate through the in situ reduction of the target contaminant but with distinct difference being the requirement of a reductant precursor this stands in contrast to the previously discussed physical separations for inorganic contaminants that inherently generate additional waste streams the general principle of heterogeneous catalysis based arts is to transform the toxic compounds into benign products which depending on the targeted end use of the treated water do not necessitate additional removal 5 research needs and outlook the literature severely lacks case studies that focus on u pw treatment the body of research is growing but most publications to date emphasize desalination exclusively despite a minimal need to remove the most abundant ions e g na cl for hf reuse opportunities a primary objective of this work is to highlight end uses that can tolerate relatively high salinity provided that bacterial and organic content are minimized aside from evaluating performance in real waters a thorough investigation of the interplay and possible synergy between treatments is necessary several methods discussed here appear promising for u pw but case studies must be performed before industry will be willing to invest in high risk emerging technologies in addition more rigorous reporting of total pw volumes as well as the subsequent management practices of that water would greatly benefit the professional and scientific community surrounding this issue as with the example of elevated contaminants in ec sludge there are still many uncertainties regarding the potential toxicity and long term consequences of u pw reuse activities given our current understanding of u pw management the prospect of implementing the massive volumes of u pw that are currently disposed of towards reuse recycle opportunities warrants the attention of the scientific community however deploying decentralized treatment activities of this scale will be a novel task for industry and the volume severity of the waste generated from u pw treatment must be carefully weighed against the environmental benefit of reducing freshwater withdrawals furthermore reuse goals should be prioritized over recycle for relatively high quality u pw some recycle options such as crop irrigation are viable targets in one example texas a m in collaboration with anadarko petroleum successfully grew cotton in western texas using treated pw lewis 2015 however in most cases the feed more closely resembles that of seawater and technologies for this application necessitate a separate discussion regarding recycle options that involve direct human interaction consumption there are still many uncertainties pertaining to the identity and potential toxicity of the organic compounds butkovskyi et al 2017 for the general discussion presented here bulk metrics for organic content e g cod toc are appropriate however the reactivity and fate of many chemicals used in fracking fluids is not fully understood when it comes to potential human health effects among the newer technologies eaops particularly ao and ao cathodic h2o2 require the development of efficient chemically resistant electrodes a formalized understanding of catalytic structure property relationships under these conditions must be proposed before materials can be engineered that are resistant to chemical poisoning and selective towards the desired oxidant similarly a major obstacle for ec technology is electrode passivation future research must elucidate the passivation mechanisms in this class of waters and engineered solutions to reverse or prevent the process es is needed desalination research is a rich field and the technologies discussed here should not be considered comprehensive however there is a distinct void of technologies that can economically operate in complex matrices at tds levels surpassing 100 000 mg l 1 while many membrane based technologies have been investigated in recent years the inevitable occurrence of membrane fouling e g colloidal scale bio organic fouling coupled with membrane degradation continue to limit commercial applications broadly complex water matrices such as pw provide opportunities for innovative multifunctional materials such as adsorbents decorated with antibacterial nanoparticles or membranes embedded with active catalysts that can minimize biofouling through in situ generated oxidants finally although likely far from commercial viability emerging arts will benefit from a continued investigation into the molecular level structure activity relationships of nanoparticle catalysts there is currently a great need to discover new approaches to both improve selectivity and perhaps more importantly prevent poisoning by benign ionic species further a departure from precious metal based materials may be necessary for economic viability 6 conclusions overall fracking is poised to be the cornerstone of u s hydrocarbon production for the foreseeable future the enormous volumes of variably contaminated waters derived from these operations are a mounting environmental and economic risk necessitating new management practices for industry u pw management has proven to be a unique technological challenge there is no standard approach to u pw treatment due to the issues associated with the elevated concentrations of tds organic compounds bacteria iron sulfur species and norms u pw is a research target with immense societal impact but it is so far relatively overlooked by the scientific community we hope is that this publication will enhance appreciation for the scale and scope of this issue and promote the development of fit for purpose treatment approaches enhanced by higher selectivity for efficient removal of specific pollutants of greatest concern and by multifunctionality to simultaneously remove different classes of pollutants that require different treatment processes to enhance the cost effectiveness of produced water reuse

pw volumes but is expected to grow rapidly reusing c pw for o g production is current industry practice e g water flooding but hf wells present drastically different issues due to their innate lack of a built in reservoir for water reinjection u pw is mostly disposed 90 by reinjection into more permeable rock minimizing this volume would relieve concerns over induced seismic activity drummond and grubert 2017 ellsworth 2013 jackson et al 2014 walsh and zoback 2015 and surface spills mclaughlin et al 2016 shrestha et al 2017 the repurposing of u pw lowers the potential environmental impacts of hf and raises the possibility of turning a waste into a valuable resource in addition the prospect of reusing and recycling u pw could help minimize the o g industry s freshwater withdrawals which while relatively minor on a national scale dieter et al 2018 could impact local municipal and or agricultural operations in arid and semi arid regions echchelh et al 2018 nicot and scanlon 2012 the need for an economical and environmentally sustainable approach for managing the u pw is critical given the enormous volumes that are expected to be generated in the coming years since 2000 total u s o g production volumes have grown by nearly 55 and 45 respectively ugto is currently the primary hydrocarbon feedstock in the u s and production volumes are projected to increase for at least the next two decades u s energy information administration 2018 on this basis projected pw volumes are expected to increase by 50 and 20 in unconventional gas and oil producing regions by 2030 kondash et al 2018 in the next sections we 1 provide an overview of the technical challenges and environmental concerns associated with treating u pw 2 suggest fit for purpose treatment options and best practices for industry and 3 identify research needs and opportunities for new water treatment and reuse technologies 2 overview of the produced water problem 2 1 hydraulic fracturing in the u s ugto reservoirs have very low permeability 0 1 10 μdarcy bennion et al 2000 moghadam and chalaturnyk 2015 scanlon et al 2014 compared to conventional o g reservoirs 1 1000 md thus hydrocarbon recovery is more challenging in these tighter formations gerritsen and durlofsky 2005 kazemi et al 1976 this fluid is composed of water and proppant typically sand or ceramic at 87 and 13 vol respectively u s epa 2016a 2015 chemical additives account for 0 20 vol and can include friction reducing polymers white and mungal 2008 cross linked or liner gels barati and liang 2014 stringfellow et al 2014 biocides kahrilas et al 2015 surfactants lester et al 2015 xu et al 2012 and inhibitors for scale and corrosion lester et al 2015 stringfellow et al 2014 the proppant is deposited and embeds into the new fissures forming porous channels through which hydrocarbons and water then diffuse and flow up the wellbore to surface facilities for phase separation and recovery u s epa 2016a the use of hf technology in the u s dates back to the late 1940 s but it was not until ca 2000 when this method was coupled with advanced directional drilling techniques i e horizontal deviated wells that recovering the nation s shale hydrocarbon resources became economically viable montgomery and smith 2010 teff 2018 u s epa 2016a nearly one third of all us hf wells were constructed between 2000 and 2013 and from 2011 to 2014 an estimated 25 000 30 000 new wells were cracked annually u s epa 2016a contributing 1 in 2000 hf operations accounted for 50 and 80 of u s oil and gas volumes respectively in 2017 u s energy information administration 2018 u s epa 2016a 2 2 hydraulic fracturing internationally this critical review focuses on onshore u s operations with an emphasis on shale development i e ugto while interest in shale resources has spurred exploratory drilling internationally u s production volumes are nearly 100 that of the nearest producers canada and china international energy agency 2017 explorations in the united kingdom cotton et al 2014 and continental europe have yet to yield commercial shale gas wells as of 2016 de silva et al 2016 inman 2016 similarly australian 396 1012 ft3 396 tcf or 11 2 1012 m3 of recoverable shale gas and south american development is an ongoing technical political and economic debate although argentina s vaca muerta play 308 tcf 8 7 1012 m3

administration 2013 china despite containing the world s largest shale reserves at 1115 tcf 31 6 1012 m3 of technically recoverable shale gas and 32 2 bbbl 3 84 1012 m3 of tight oil has yet to achieve full scale commercial development kuuskraa et al 2013 due in part to logistical and geological complexity water used for fracturing operations in areas such as the fuling gas field is expected to exceed 50 of the water used in u s operations total of 10 5 109 32 7 109 gal or 39 9 106 123 9 106 m3 median values of water required on a per well basis in the sichuan basin 9 106 gal well or 3 4 104

horn river and liard basins alberta duvernay muskwa basal banff montney and the colorado and saskatchewan bakken williston basin with the technical practices closely mirroring those in the u s alberta energy regulator 2015 in addition environmental regulations in canada as in the u s are a combination of subnational e g province state and national policies carter and eaton 2016 in 2017 total water volumes used for hf in alberta were over 6 34 109 gal 24 106 m3 including non saline water and 4 recycled water combined while british columbia reportedly used 2 3 109 gal 8 8 106 m3 alberta energy regulator 2018 to keep with the technical rather than regulatory focus of this work we do not discuss further pw in canadian ugto basins we also omit water treatment discussions for offshore operations as they have been discussed elsewhere clark and veil 2015 fakhru l razi et al 2009 zheng et al 2016 only 3 of the total u s pw volumes in 2012 came from offshore operations and its management differs greatly due to infrastructure restrictions clark and veil 2015 2 3 the hydraulic fracturing water cycle while this article focuses on end use implementation an understanding of the other stages is necessary to address treatment goals the hf water cycle consists of five stages acquisition fluid mixing injection u pw handling and end use implementation u s epa 2016a fluid mixing describes the process of formulating fracking fluids no standard formula exists formulation is a function of the well geology and depth initial water quality and operator discretion in general these mixtures are 99 8 wt water and proppant mixed with 0 2 vol of additional chemicals u s epa 2016a 2015 chemical disclosure registries such as the ground water protection council and interstate oil and gas compact commission s fracfocus document additives on an individual well basis gwpc and interstate oil and gas compact commission iogcc 2014 freshwater is by far the largest volume component used in the development of these fracturing fluids as an example from 2000 to 2011 the cumulative freshwater usage for shale gas hf operations was reported to vary throughout texas from 1 7 109 gal 6 5 106 m3 haynesville to 4 8 109 gal 18 106 m3 eagle ford and up to 38 3 109 gal 145 106 m3 barnett nicot and scanlon 2012 to place this in context water used across the entire barnett development in 2010 was 9 of the 81 4 109 gal 308 106 m3 consumed by the nearby city of dallas 2010 population of 1 2 million that same year and significantly less than the annual average statewide consumption of 5 22 1012 gal 19 8 109 m3 including rural communities nicot and scanlon 2012 twdb 2015 similarly in north dakota the total freshwater used for hf activities in the bakken from 2005 to 2013 was 15 8 109 gal 59 9 106 m3 scanlon et al 2014 from 2005 to 2014 the cumulative hf water volumes for 10 of the largest u s formations e g barnett bakken eagle ford marcellus niobrara permian and others was roughly 250 109 gal 940 106 m3 kondash and vengosh 2015 scanlon et al 2014 initial water acquisition and the subsequent u pw handling are dictated by the remote locations of well sites in some cases no centralized infrastructure exists so the initial assessment and site construction can take on the order of 10 16 weeks u s epa 2016a in preparation for u pw a variety of options are implemented depending on the region specific regulations site logistics and or projected water volumes groundwater protection council 2009 u s epa 2016a above ground storage tanks asts are typically closed loop systems in which pw is directly transferred from the wellhead through interconnecting pipelines u s epa 2016a these tanks can be either open or closed to the environment and provide intermediate storage before the pw is either trucked off site or in some cases reused at the well less often lined earthen pits are built as open air holding ponds while regulations have gradually phased out this method on a national scale pits are still common practice in specific high producing regions of the country such as texas railroad commision of texas 2018 barnett and permian shale and in some rare instances in the green river basin lyman et al 2018 finally it should be noted that u pw generated during the first few weeks of production is often referred to as flowback water to differentiate from water associated with long term post flowback production rosenblum et al 2017 this distinction is made because flowback water can contain larger quantities of residual hf chemicals sand silt and proppant from the near wellbore after initial well production begins presenting a very different water profile than post flowback or produced water this temporal variability can have a significant influence on the viability of management options during the first 21 days of production highlighting that suitable treatment technologies should exhibit flexible capacities even at a single well site oetjen et al 2018 2 4 produced water characteristics the chemical and ion content of u pw as well as c pw are highly variable and dependent on well location geology and operational parameters u pw composition variability arises primarily from formation waters found naturally alongside entrapped hydrocarbons water salinity and total dissolved solids tds correlate with the geological basin shale play and well depth khan et al 2016 shaffer et al 2013 for example amongst the big four u s plays i e bakken eagle ford permian and marcellus u s energy information administration 2015 the bakken region around north dakota has tds exceeding 200 000 mg l 1 whereas pennsylvania s marcellus shale averages closer to 100 000 mg l 1 maguire boyle and barron 2014 shaffer et al 2013 u s epa 2016a more recent work has also showcased the strong geographic dependence of dissolved organic carbon and bacterial speciation wang et al 2019 note that the level of trace hydrocarbons in u pw storage facilities is highly dependent on the efficacy of local separation equipment e g free water knockout and operator competency in general the tds in u pw ranges from brackish 10 000 mg l 1 to nearly saturated 260 000 mg l 1 with chloride sulfide sulfate carbonate and alkali and or alkaline earth metals being the dominant ions in extreme cases the tds can approach 400 000 mg l 1 10 saltier than seawater 35 000 mg l 1 at which point solids precipitation is inevitable due to supersaturation shaffer et al 2013 u s epa 2016a naturally occurring radioactive materials norms are another challenge in u pw and are present predominantly as radium 226 and radium 228 sulfates that have co precipitated with barium and strontium sulfate scales chapman et al 2012 international association of oil and gas 2008 rowan et al 2011 total organic carbon toc originates from fracking fluid additives treatment chemicals and trace oil and grease with typical concentrations 1000 mg l 1 but can approach as high as 6000 mg l 1 maguire boyle and barron 2014 total suspended solids tss including silica metal oxides and other minerals are also commonly encountered bacterial invasion and proliferation can be severely problematic for hf operations down well formation of biofilms over the fractured pores proppant pack or other flow paths can impede hydrocarbon extraction sulfate thiosulfate and sulfur reducing bacteria srb present an environmental health hazard from the bio production of hydrogen sulfide h2s and an operational threat due to the potential for well souring which can often represent a substantial cost for operators gaspar et al 2014 gieg et al 2011 moreover acid producing bacteria apb and srb both threaten wellbore tubulars and pipelines due to microbially influenced induced corrosion mic enning and garrelfs 2014 corrosion products e g organic acids and common precipitates such as iron oxides and iron sulfides can damage drilling equipment threaten wellbore integrity and ultimately shorten the lifespan of the well alley et al 2011 we identify ten contamination metrics to assess u pw quality total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss scale hardness iron sulfate norms heavy metals rcra8 organics and bacteria fig 1 highlights the major shale plays across the u s that have been considered in this study and illustrates the vast variation of their concentrations across the u s for wells drilled since 2000 further data may be found in the si table s1 all data are sourced from the u s geological survey national produced waters geochemical database v2 3 blondes et al 2018 scale is defined here as the combined barium ba strontium sr calcium ca magnesium mg and iron fe ion concentrations that have precipitated with sulfate carbonate or sulfide anions whereas hardness is defined exclusively as the combined ca2 mg2 concentration in solution this distinction has been made to facilitate comparisons across various water treatment industries e g municipal waste treatment where these terms are sometimes at least colloquially used interchangeably iron describes dissolved and precipitated fe ii fe iii species sulfate is the cumulative concentration of all sulfate species e g feso4 baso4 etc norms represent the total concentration of ra 226 and ra 228 several other radioactive elements e g rn 222 sr isotopes have been documented in pw however national reporting of these elements is sparse whereas ra 226 and ra 228 are commonly measured the concentration of heavy metals has been defined as the cumulative concentration of arsenic as barium ba cadmium cd chromium cr lead pb mercury hg selenium se and silver ag as defined by the u s resource recovery and conservation act i e rcra 8 u s epa 2017 the value of organics is taken as the total organic carbon toc content of the water the working definition of bacteria used here is simply the total bacterial counts per volume of water count 100 ml 1 no distinction is made between species or function e g srb apb however reporting a national average for bacterial concentrations would be misleading bacterial control is already a central concern for oil field operators kahrilas et al 2015 and this extends to the mitigation of bacterial growth in the pw ponds storage tanks a similar analysis for the eight largest producing shale plays as opposed to the national average illustrated in fig 1 may be found in fig s1 elemental analyses organic classifications bacterial speciation and norm measurements for specific wells across the u s are not discussed here akob et al 2015 barbot et al 2013 harkness et al 2015 lutz et al 2013 oetjen et al 2018 orem et al 2007 thacker et al 2015 overall u pw is a highly variable and chemically complex water matrix that poses site specific treatment and reuse challenges we conclude that treatment technologies must be tailored to the localized water quality and specific needs of the intended end use compounded with region specific regulations well site logistics economics and differing field development goals a one size fits all treatment methodology is unfeasible 3 current pw management practices 3 1 overview of potential options here we identify three general end use categories disposal reuse and recycle disposal describes end uses with no subsequent purpose or utility such as direct injection into a disposal well evaporation or surface discharge treatment towards disposal prioritizes solids oil and microbial contaminant mitigation as well as regulatory compliance reuse goals are those focused towards internal reuse to further hydrocarbon production such as hf or enhanced recovery reuse could potentially close the water cycle for drilling and fracturing operations thus alleviating strains on freshwater withdrawals entrekin et al 2018 minimizing water transportation activities lutz et al 2013 and mitigating environmental contamination risks lauer et al 2016 mclaughlin et al 2016 internal reuse treatment is broadly defined but usually focuses on reducing solids residual oil grease iron and certain chemical additives from hf that could interact with the specific planned reuse option while leaving the tds unchanged recycle or beneficial disposition describes implementing pw for an alternative purpose echchelh et al 2018 requirements for this category can differ greatly but will usually require desalination for example the required water quality for crop irrigation ayers and westcot 1985 olkowski 2009 u s epa 2012b is far more stringently regulated than waters used for road dust ice control goodman 2017 north dakota department of health to emphasize this point a few recycle examples have been selected ranging from those that are currently in use to those that are simply proposed ideas e g potable water sabie and fernanld 2016 this discussion should not be considered a comprehensive list for additional context regulatory requirements for water disposal on a state by state basis may be found using the fracfocus search engine gwpc and interstate oil and gas compact commission iogcc 2014 precise figures for pw volumes on a national scale are not readily available surprisingly although recovered o g volumes have been rigorously documented since industrial production first began monitoring of pw volumes has only been performed in the last few decades and u pw specifically was not monitored as its own category until 2008 in the barnett shale clark and veil 2009 lewis and hughes 2008 and is in fact still not separately identified in some regions moreover while it is becoming commonplace to report pw volumes documenting its subsequent management remains rare to the best of our knowledge the most recent report of this nature was based on data gathered in 2012 clark and veil 2015 more recent reports on the big four u s shale regions suggests that from 2011 to 2016 u pw volumes generated within the first production year increased by up to 1440 in some regions reflecting an increase in per well water use of up to 770 kondash et al 2018 emphasizing the dynamic evolving nature of this issue however despite the evident annual variations in the precise water volumes utilized in ugto operations we estimate that the dominant pw management practices have remained comparatively consistent on a national scale 3 2 current practices the lack of complete high quality data limited our ability to quantify the water balance for ugto production separately from the water balance for the overall o g production in 2012 over 90 of all pw from conventional and ugto wells was estimated to have been reinjected underground of which 40 was injected into onsite disposal wells 5 was transported and injected into offsite disposal wells and 45 was used for enhanced recovery fig 2 clark and veil 2015 veil and clark 2011 besides re injection roughly 4 of pw was evaporated 3 was discharged to the surface note that this particular practice is becoming increasingly prohibited in light of evolving regulations and the rest was either sent to third party businesses for treatment or reused in fluid formulations clark and veil 2015 for u pw specifically we estimate that a far greater majority 90 national scale of the water reinjected underground is targeted towards disposal wells onsite or offsite given that pw cannot be implemented for enhanced recovery in unconventional wells that is most u pw is currently disposed highlighting the opportunity to increase its reuse again although reliable national statistics are lacking this point has been showcased clearly in recent sub national investigations such as the bakken shrestha et al 2017 in which 95 of u pw was disposed note that a key exception to this national trend is the marcellus region hill et al 2019 where recent regional regulations have led to a significantly greater amount 50 of u pw to be reused within the state to fracture new wells which is reflected by a decrease in the average distance traveled by surfaced water to a end use location from 95 miles in 2012 to 23 miles in 2017 however even in pennsylvania a state that has arguably the most rigorous documentation of pw management practices nearly one third of all liquid waste generated from 1991 to 2017 does not have a reported final destination hill et al 2019 disposal injection requires high permeability formations that can be saturated with pw effectively acting as subsurface storage this is commonplace in for example the delaware and midland basins of texas and is considered safe practice by regulatory agencies vidic et al 2013 however injection has been scrutinized for its association with elevated seismic activity davies et al 2013 drummond and grubert 2017 ellsworth 2013 jackson et al 2014 groundwater contamination he et al 2017 luek and gonsior 2017 and possibly even surface water contamination akob et al 2016 kassotis et al 2016 in select areas disposal injection treatment prioritizes lowering the tss such that well and or formation pores are not plugged and equipment well integrity is not compromised jiménez et al 2018 the relative ease and low cost of this practice provides its appeal but onsite disposal well availability can be limited i e in areas with intensive drilling or restrictive regulations requiring then pw to be transported by trucks offsite reusing pw by reinjecting it into a producing formation i e water or steam flooding is a widely practiced enhanced recovery method for conventional wells clark and veil 2015 as a well ages the output rate decreases due to diminished down well pressures water flooding involves pumping the fluid into the reservoir to offset the lost extraction volume increase pressure and stimulate transport of the remaining hydrocarbons this logical end use for c pw does not apply for u pw as the low porosity shale and carbonate formations have minimal pore volume that may be saturated with water 3 3 current treatment technologies current pw treatment approaches and some promising treatment technologies have been the subject of several excellent reviews colorado school of mines 2009 fakhru l razi et al 2009 jiménez et al 2018 silva et al 2017 the following section provides an overview of a typical pw treatment train currently used in industry fig 3 with the objective of highlighting in section 4 how emerging technologies may be used to bridge the gap in treatment capabilities within a fit for purpose framework physical methods e g filtration adsorption are applicable to inorganic and organic contaminants but can be impractical and cost prohibitive for particularly high tds and or tss waters due to excessive fouling plugging scaling and or large quantities of sludge generation chemical methods particularly chemical oxidation are common for bacterial control and or to decompose refractory organics sequential chemical physical methods entail adding an active chemical species such as a flocculant or complexing agent and then physically removing the ensuing product this approach is well established in municipal water treatment lee et al 2014 but still exhibits the aforementioned shortcomings of purely physical processes large expensive infrastructure e g clarifier or settling tanks is required for these approaches to be practical current technologies for u pw treatment are frequently categorized into primary secondary and occasionally tertiary treatments based primarily on the tds salinity of the water arthur et al 2005 a fourth treatment level zero liquid discharge zld is considered when treat to release of u pw is permitted by regulatory agencies primary treatment methods target removal of most solids residual oil grease iron fracturing fluid additives and bacteria secondary treatment entails removal of multivalent ions including ba2 ca2 mg2 sr2 fe2 so4 2 co3 2 and po4 3 that escaped primary treatment measures these ions can adversely affect the performance of fracturing fluid additives during internal reuse and contribute to scaling tendencies when mixed with incompatible waters tertiary treatment processes enable full salt removal through desalination and specialized filtration technologies in a typical ugto operation the produced oil gas and water are first separated at the wellhead using 2 or 3 phase separation equipment to prepare the hydrocarbons for sale american petroleum institute 1990 de sanding and or simple filtration systems such as sock filters are often implemented prior to these separators to remove proppant and other large debris the aqueous phase effluent is then further treated at a saltwater disposal swd facility or central processing facility cpf prior to disposal by well injection modification for internal reuse or occasionally permitted release utilizing an assortment of treatment technologies discussed in the following sections the block flow diagram provided in fig 3 illustrates the typical treatment train associated with current produced water management practices 3 3 1 separation and clarification separation and clarification technologies are selected based on water quality and facility economics with the goal of removing the smallest solids and oil droplets that passed through the oil water separators present solid particles can include silica metal oxides and sulfides inorganic scale and gelled polymers settling ponds frac pits and above ground storage tanks asts utilize quiescent gravity assisted phase separation to provide low cost removal of the densest solids with moderate retention times 12 48 h the primary drawbacks to settling ponds pits include a need for animal deterrent systems multiple liners to prevent containment loss leak detection capabilities and often a large physical footprint 4 21 million gallon capacity dynamic methods of separation include hydroclones media filtration and floatation equipment that can remove solids in a continuous manner at shorter residence times media filtration uses silica sand alumina carbon beds glass beads and walnut shells rawlins and sadeghi 2018 walnut shells in particular are rapidly growing in popularity as they are an inexpensive renewable filtering agent that can typically be disposed of in landfills defining characteristics of these technologies are that they provide very high near complete water recovery require zero to minimal additional infrastructure and are universally applicable to pw i e these technologies are not limited by tds or inorganic ion content speciation in practice approaches under this category may be easily scaled to accommodate any oil and grease concentrations typically encountered in the field but inherently generate an additional solid waste sludge stream that must be disposed 3 3 2 oxidation after simple filtration a common first option for u pw primary treatment is to send the aqueous phase to an oxidation unit that decomposes fracturing fluid polymers and additives kills bacteria and induces sedimentation of dissolved iron or other trace metals as metal oxides commonly used chemical oxidants for u pw include sodium hypochlorite chlorine dioxide erkenbrecher et al 2015 ozone organic peracids de paula et al 2013 hydrogen peroxide and oxygen via addition through aeration less common options include chlorine gas and permanganate but the inherently greater safety hazard associated with the storage and handling of these oxidants in remote locations limits their practicality similarly chlorine dioxide requires additional care due to its low boiling point 11 c and instability toward decomposition fracturing fluid chemicals can decompose into a plethora of products in either the wellbore due to elevated temperatures or in the well and or oxidation unit due to oxidative damage weaver et al 2003 xiong et al 2018 it should be noted that degradation products from oxidation unit effluents have not yet been fully quantified presenting an opportunity for future research as with separation and clarification processes chemical oxidation is not typically restricted by water tds or ion content and provides the appealing benefit of complete water recovery several of the contaminates in u pw e g iron sulfate nitrates organics polymers can provide a source of nutrition for microbes srbs and apbs are the main microbial invaders in u pw and can be treated using either chemical oxidants or non oxidizing biocides kahrilas et al 2015 for operators chemical oxygen demand cod and chloride residuals are standard measurements to qualify biocide effectiveness and bacterial counts before and after treatment and are typically reported using standard nace protocols which include techniques such as serial dilution bottle tests radio respirometry and atp photometry nace 1994 more recently emerging advanced oxidation process aop technologies such as electrochemical and electrocatalytic oxidation are undergoing development in the water treatment industry to replace bulk chemical oxidants and to further improve safety reduce field inventory and optimize manpower while a detailed discussion of aop technologies is provided in a later section it must be noted now that a small number of oil field service entities currently offer commercialized variants of these technologies for example the electrolysis of high chloride pw with 58 120 ppm ammonia was shown to generate chloramine in situ which subsequently functioned as an effective biocide achieving a 10 log reduction in srb and apb counts during pilot tests in the fayetteville shale boal and mowery 2015 3 3 3 coagulation and floatation and clarification colloidal particles and oil droplets are usually too small to remove from water during the early separation and oxidation treatments yet these contaminants must be removed prior to even subsurface disposal of u pw to avoid well impairment to achieve this inorganic salts of ferric iron or aluminum sulfate alum are mixed into the u pw with agitation to destabilize emulsions disrupt charged particles and coagulate polymers surfactants in a process called coagulation flocculation the ferric and alum salts form 3 d networks that help trap fine contaminants in their matrix resulting in a more clarified u pw gebbie 2006 these materials then coagulate and float to the top of the treatment tank for removal by skimming some operators especially in conventional o g facilities use dissolved gas floatation dgf or dissolved air floatation daf equipment to remove the coagulated sediment in a continuous manner sport 1969 daf and dgf accomplish this by injecting gas or air bubbles into the tank to float the agglomerated solids to the surface where they are removed by a mechanical skimmer the clarified aqueous phase is removed from the bottom of the tank and sent to the next processing step challenges to using this equipment include complications that arise due to the adhesive nature of the flocculant leading to undesirable coating and tank fouling during skimming operations as with the other aforementioned primary treatment options the appeal of these methods is that they are not typically restricted by the severity of the tds or inorganic ion concentration note that while these methods inherently require an investment in additional infrastructure they benefit from decades of refinement and optimization in conventional o g pw treatment finally divalent metals including ca2 and fe2 are precipitated chemically using alkali carbonate hydroxide or sulfate salts see section 3 3 4 water in this condition now void of most oil contaminants and solids can be stored for reuse in fracking operations or disposed by well injection a best practice is to provide a biocide treatment to manage microbial growth using either commercial non oxidizing biocides or chemical oxidants prior to injection into the disposal well 3 3 4 secondary treatment divalent ion removal preventing inorganic scale reducing water hardness and removing problematic divalent ions e g norms iron from u pw are the goals of secondary treatment processes whereas primary treatment methods are characterized by their robust capabilities and near universal applicability secondary treatment processes have more variable capabilities and are more restricted by pw quality and process economics most divalent ions present in pw are alkaline earth metals and iron although sulfate and carbonate are included in this description removing these ions is important to address concerns of potential norm or inorganic scale forming in the disposal well due to mixing of incompatible waters in hf operations where crosslinked guar polymers are used the boron or metal based crosslinking agents that viscosify these polymers can end up in u pw and should be removed in this stage to avoid future chemical compatibility issues traditional methods for removing the divalent ba2 ca2 sr2 ra2 and mg2 are sparse but include adding sulfate or carbonate ions to the water i e lime softening to induce precipitation of the metals as the metal sulfates or carbonates folio et al 2018 an advantage to this approach is the operational simplicity less restrictive tds constraints tds 100 000 mg l 1 and low cost for low salinity pw ion exchange processes are sometimes used to soften the water by removing the hardness ions brown and sheedy 2002 it is important to have first removed most tss particularly oxidized metals and oil and grease during primary treatment to avoid fouling of the exchange resins weak acid resins are effective for water where tds 3000 mg l 1 yet require special metallurgy and significant ph adjustments in between uses to regenerate the resins strong acid cations are less effective for water treatment when tds 3000 mg l 1 but are very durable and do not require significant attention to ph or complicated reactor design in general ion exchange processes are applicable for tds concentrations between 500 and 7000 mg l 1 colorado school of mines 2009 as discussed in greater detail in section 4 promising emerging technologies for this application i e preferential removal of multivalent ions over monovalent include nanofiltration tds 500 25 000 mg l 1 and electrically driven charge separation approaches e g cdi currently the suite of technologies which can be classified as dedicated secondary treatment methods is limited and presents an inviting opportunity for future research and case studies 3 3 5 tertiary treatment desalination tertiary treatment methods target salt removal to reduce tds and possibly iron or other heavy metals that passed through the primary and secondary treatments i e desalination the leading technology options in this treatment class include evaporation distillation crystallization and reverse forward or hybrid osmosis albeit with limitations for example while reverse osmosis ro is remarkably efficient for removing dissolved solids the maximum tolerated feed tds is 45 000 mg l 1 thus ro would likely need to be the final treatment step after high salt removal depending on the initial pw quality for high tds pw 40 000 mg l 1 distillation technologies e g multi stage flash vapor compression mechanical vapor compression are viable options but are prone to scaling when treating waters with elevated multivalent cation concentrations underscoring the need for additional secondary treatment technologies and suffer from low water recovery rates and high energy costs colorado school of mines 2009 most tertiary treatment options are constrained by the process economics equipment and footprint and are therefore seldom performed unless required by regulatory agencies this level of treatment is typically only seen in regions of the country that strictly limit the use of disposal wells and discharge volumes e g marcellus hill et al 2019 shaffer et al 2013 it is worth mentioning that these regulatory restrictions have contributed to an economic environment in which relatively high energy offsite treatment approaches e g crystallizer technology are viable options for u pw management as discussed in the following section desalination technologies benefit from a comparatively greater amount of dedicated research effort in the academic community emerging approaches ranging from a host of membrane based technologies to electrically driven ion removal methods all seek to minimize energy consumption and improve water recovery rates 4 emerging end use opportunities and u pw fit for purpose treatment options 4 1 end use selection and research philosophy the variation in u pw quality and treatment objectives implies that technologies must adopt a fit for purpose philosophy to match the treated water quality to the intended use alvarez et al 2018 anastas and zimmerman 2007 starting water quality dictates the feasibility of a treatment method and the potential end uses to emphasize this fig 4 provides a comparison between the national average for each of the ten established contamination metrics in pw defined under produced water characteristics and the required treatment objectives of six representative end uses which were selected to span promising options for reuse e g fracking fluid recycle e g agriculture livestock potable and disposal e g well injection surface discharge goals these six end uses should not be considered an exhaustive list but were chosen to illustrate that the desired purpose of the treated water dictates the priority contaminants and thus the suite of treatment technologies that must be deployed i e fit for purpose the chosen targets are surface aquifer discharge disposal well injection reformulated fracking fluid agricultural reuse for non consumable crops livestock watering and potable water the values reported in fig 4 further details in table s2 should be viewed as general guidelines u s epa 2016b as detailed below robust approaches are desired but a single unit with the capability to handle all possible contaminants over the potential concentrations is not realistic instead flexible and modular technologies that preferentially target specific classes of contaminants must be engineered when possible multifunctionality defined here as the ability to simultaneously treat different classes of pollutants that would traditionally require different sequential processes or conditions is also desirable practically multifunctionality manifests through technologies that can bridge the gap between the traditional treatment stages outlined in fig 3 regarding reuse quality standards for o g reservoir flooding or fracking fluid water are not formally established rather requirements are company and or site specific and loosely defined for example recent technical developments emphasize the use of friction reducers that tolerate remarkably high tds 300 000 mg l 1 environments sareen et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 this has resulted in the rise of slickwater and more recently high salt tolerant gel cross linked gel fracs barati and liang 2014 palisch et al 2010 with advanced friction reducers reuse is possible at tds levels that are one order of magnitude higher than was feasible less than a decade ago acharya et al 2011 aside from tds operators will also prioritize contaminants in the source water used for fracking fluids e g iron sulfate depending on the chemical additives formulation they intend to implement to illustrate the implications of source water characteristics in the context of fit for purpose treatment consider a simple example recent work characterizing flowback water from dj basin colorado reported tds of 22 500 mg l 1 tss of 360 mg l 1 a combined sulfide sulfate concentration of 1 6 mg l 1 and an oil and grease concentration of 59 mg l 1 cod 1218 mg l 1 lester et al 2015 if the intent is to reuse this water on site for further hf activities tds tss and sulfur species are all within a tolerable range for direct reuse however the organic load i e oil and grease would need to be reduced by a factor of 2x prior to reuse implying that treatment efficacy could be optimized by deploying technologies that selectively target these contaminants discussed in section 4 2 a key conclusion from this survey of treatment objectives discussed further in research needs and outlook is that in field reuse is the most achievable value added treatment objective i e excluding direct injection disposal which further supports the notion that the hf water cycle fig 2 could be closed or at least that local freshwater withdrawals would be significantly reduced at many drilling locations technologically this could be best achieved via improvements in primary treatment technologies regarding recycle targets the selected standards for potable water guidelines for drinking water quality fourth edition incorporating the first addendum 2017 u s epa 2012b u s epa 2003 agriculture irrigation ayers and westcot 1985 olkowski 2009 u s epa 2012b waldner and looper 2007 and livestock feed ayers and westcot 1985 u s epa 2012b waldner and looper 2007 are stringently defined however the bulk contamination metrics used here fail to capture the importance of some high priority low concentration contaminants e g lead in drinking water that would need to be addressed in a more detailed analysis amongst these recycle goals arguably the most promising is for irrigation of non consumable salt tolerant crops such as cotton lewis 2015 sabie r jr fernald a 2016 wherein human exposure risks are greatly minimized in general however a central conclusion from this analysis is that most recycle targets require an order of magnitude reduction in several of the identified contamination metrics and therefore stand as the most technically and economically challenging end uses specifically recycle goals are hampered by high concentrations of multivalent inorganic species e g norms heavy metals sulfur species fig 4d which are the main targets of current secondary treatment options a compelling motivation for emerging next generation technologies is to 1 offer methods with greater selectivity towards the removal of multivalent inorganic species and 2 bridge the gap between the function of traditional primary and secondary treatment purposes in other words deploy multifunctional primary treatment technologies that can offer the additional benefit of multivalent ion removal for disposal u pw discharged to municipal treatment plants or disposal wells designated class ii injection wells in the u s u s epa 2012a is regulated by the epa while surface discharge although very rarely permitted is regulated through a combination of national and sub national policy texas commission on environmental quality 2016 u s epa 2016b as discussed in section 3 2 current practices disposal injection is typically favored by operators in regions of the country that permit it as the associated treatment requirements are comparatively minimal and therefore less expensive often disposal injection requirements can be economically met after the current primary treatment steps alone when taken in context with the current treatment technologies employed for u pw treatment the situation that emerges is rife with opportunities for next generation on site treatment approaches alvarez et al 2018 pw may be stored on site for up to several weeks before being managed as throughput requirements i e temporal treatment capacity and operation mode e g batch continuous can be remarkably flexible parameters depending on site logistics and local water infrastructure availability the following discussion highlights a variety of next generation treatment technologies that hold promise for pw 4 2 targeting organics and bacteria in complex water matrices such as u pw few chemical or engineered technologies are available to selectively remove bacterial species and or hydrocarbons from the perspective of cost efficiency to date this technological shortcoming stands as the greatest barrier to in field reuse objectives biocides are actively used to control microbial growth but they inherently require consistent repetitive dosing regulations can limit their use and they are challenged by the development of bacterial resistance singer et al 2016 xi et al 2009 moreover the introduction of treatment chemicals particularly chlorine based biocides presents the risk to form persistent and harmful contaminants e g halogenated organics krasner et al 2006 this can be especially detrimental for many potential recycle opportunities outlined previously while the organic content is a small fraction of the inorganic content e g tds in pw the exact nature and amounts of these compounds are rarely known prior to treatment as a result this implies that defining the selectivity of successful technologies is in fact a balance approaches that target classes or types of compounds e g aromatic hydrocarbons will be more useful than those aimed at specific molecules e g benzene advanced oxidation processes aops are attractive for recalcitrant waters since they rely on the in situ formation of highly reactive non selective radicals to degrade organic pollutants holding potential to yield sterile brines without requiring physical separations fernández castro et al 2015 oller et al 2011 pera titus et al 2004 aops are generally based on 1 photolysis e g uv v uv 2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 3 ozonation o3 or 4 fenton fenton like processes pera titus et al 2004 however aop operation costs often restrict suitable target waters to a cod related linearly to toc below 5000 mg l 1 which is much lower 12 than in some u pw pera titus et al 2004 furthermore efficacy of photolysis approaches are greatly inhibited by u pw turbidity up to 1500 ntu and the near neutral ph 6 8 precludes fenton chemistry which exhibits optimum performance around ph 3 moreira et al 2017 a popular approach to improve aop performance is to combine them with biological treatments however successful pilot scale examples of aop biological treatments have been limited to milder environments i e brackish waters 3 wt salts with consistent effluents such as pharmaceutical tannery and textile wastewater oller et al 2011 similar emerging technologies employing heterogeneous catalysis heck et al 2019 have been recently demonstrated on the bench scale to function even in high salinity tds 100 000 mg l 1 environments yin et al 2019 as with traditional aops catalytic technologies hold the ability to generate oxidative species in situ and inherently avoid the generation of a separate concentrated waste stream albeit with the requirement of an additional chemical oxidant precursor similarly although the practical utility of photocatalytic water treatment technologies has recently been subject to debate loeb et al 2019 the possibility that pw might offer the precise type of niche application where engineered photocatalyst systems can flourish cannot be ruled out at this time the analogous electrochemical aops eaops arguably hold even greater promise the most fundamental being anodic oxidation ao ao processes can 1 directly oxidize organic pollutants via electron transfer and or 2 indirectly oxidize organics through generated reactive species while reactive oxygen species ros are the most classically desired oxidants bulk solution oxidants such as chlorine and sulfate persulfate may also be generated beneficially garcia segura et al 2018 moreira et al 2017 for further degradation capacity ao may be combined with the cathodic production of h2o2 utilizing a porous gas diffusion electrode ao cathodic h2o2 barazesh et al 2015 in theory the fe2 found naturally in pw could also be utilized to harness fenton chemistry electro fenton ef he et al 2019 though ef suffers from the same ph limitation as its conventional analogue moreira et al 2017 similarly photolysis enhanced ef methods still display poor performance in turbid waters and high cost inhibit implementation despite these limitations eaops specifically ao and ao cathodic h2o2 hold great promise for pw since as stated prior native ionic species can form powerful oxidants e g active chlorine to degrade organics and or act as a biocide ghanem et al 2016 furthermore pws have a mean conductivity around 140 000 μs cm 1 and can exceed 20 s cm 1 3 400 that of seawater suggesting that eaop efficiencies will not be hampered by charge transfer effects often observed in potential potable water sources nonetheless these complex electrolyte mixtures also pose serious challenges hydroxyl radicals can be rapidly scavenged by sulfate and chloride species iron complexes e g sulfato iron and chloro iron can hamper fenton reactions and side reactions can generate additional toxic pollutants such as perchlorate and halogenated organics that would need further treatment chaplin 2014 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 yin et al 2018 other tailored engineered nanomaterials enms may also find opportunity to offer at least incremental improvements to current pw treatment methods specifically the notion of multifunctional materials e g combined adsorptive and photocatalytic materials could bridge the gap between the traditional chemical and physical treatments alvarez et al 2018 as a basic example nano adsorbents typically offer significantly higher specific surface areas and sorption sites than many established materials e g carbon nanotubes vs activated carbon which can significantly increase the practicality of these materials in highly contaminated matrices such as pw qu et al 2013 in addition the surface of these materials can be further modified to contain say antibacterial antimicrobial particles e g nano silver or active catalytic sites to oxidize or fragment adsorbed organics and bacteria alvarez et al 2018 qu et al 2013 4 3 targeting inorganic contaminants even free of bacteria and organics pw end uses especially recycle goals are limited by remarkably high tds 200 000 mg l 1 hardness and scale as well as compounds containing iron sulfate norms and heavy metals shaffer et al provided one of the first thorough looks at promising desalination technologies for shale pw in 2013 shaffer et al 2013 reviewed were mechanical vapor compression mvc membrane distillation md and forward osmosis fo all three have potential to be economical but mvc is the most mature technology and the simplest to implement mvc which exploits the latent heat produced during the compression of vapor to generate additional energy for vaporization is the current standard for desalination during steam assisted gravity drainage in heavy oil fields an enhanced recovery technique and industry expertise is already established the modularized design of the evaporator lends itself well to the required flexibility tds capacity can be scaled with additional evaporator condenser units two primary disadvantages of mvc are the relatively high energy cost associated with operation 10 4 13 6 kwh m3 distillate shaffer et al 2013 and the need for a reliable electrical grid on site improving mvc efficiencies is an ongoing research topic e g material heat transfer drop wise distillation etc but it should be considered that coupling this technology with eaops could help justify the capital investment for a power grid at remote locations more recently a rigorous review of membrane based technologies for applications in o g pw was conducted by chang et al chang et al 2019 included in this discussion were high pressure membrane processes reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf osmotically driven membrane processes forward osmosis fo thermally driven membrane processes direct contact membrane distillation dcmd electrically driven membrane processes electrodialysis ed electrodeionization edi capacitive deionization cdi and more including microbial capacitive desalination deionization and vacuum membrane distillation while a detailed overview of each of these processes is beyond the scope of this review and would be redundant a discussion can offer an additional perspective on how best to implement these technologies in the context of establishing fit for purpose technologies a key shortcoming of membrane technologies is the large capital and operation costs associated with treating complex high salinity feeds and the relatively low water recovery rates 50 that are evident in most tests with real i e non synthetic pw in the pursuit of many recycle goals for which the concentration of key contaminants must decrease to ppm ppb levels e g heavy metals in drinking water the prospect of high reject could be tolerated for the sake of a high purity product water however if the intended end use is to reuse pw on site many if not most state of the art membrane technologies do not serve to resolve the issues that currently hinder oil field operators high cost low recovery treatments which generate additional now more concentrated waste streams do little to prevent the need for off site transportation and in most cases will struggle to find economic viability moreover from an environmental perspective it cannot be asserted at this time that minimizing the volume of disposed water at the cost of greater waste severity i e contaminant concentrations is an improvement over current practice this is not to say that membrane based technologies should not be employed in pw reuse applications but rather that research in this area would benefit from modifying the current metrics of success considering that reuse applications can generally tolerate relatively high 70 000 mg l 1 tds concentrations e g chlorides alkali alkaline earth metals but are often less tolerant of specific inorganic species such as iron precipitates such as iron oxides and iron sulfides can damage drilling equipment or boron borate crosslinking with gel fracturing fluids the prospect of engineering membrane based technologies with greater ion specificity i e secondary treatment options could provide an invaluable tool for operators another promising avenue for targeting dissolved and suspended contaminants is electrocoagulation ec garcia segura et al 2017 ec utilizes a sacrificial anode iron and or aluminum to release active coagulant precursor ions into solution while gas evolves at the cathode typically h2 holt et al 2005 it has historically been used to target hardness heavy metals oil and grease and other organic substances in a wide array of wastewaters including recent examples in the o g industry da costa et al 2016 ringler et al 2017 but has failed to find lasting commercial application esmaeilirad et al 2015 holt et al 2005 zhao et al 2014 this method is advantageous in that treatment can be performed with low capital cost minimal maintenance and natural settling can serve as the primary separation mechanism ec has the key benefit of being largely non selective towards contaminants thus fulfilling the requirement for a robust technology while also being modular enough to implement alongside other treatment technologies e g e aops an added advantage is that electrochemical redox processes are triggered to form hydroxyl radicals chlorine gas and related oxidants for killing bacteria in situ fedotov et al 2013 unfortunately specific high priority contaminates for hf reuse e g boron may not be practically addressed by ec alone chorghe et al 2017 further emphasizing the need for flexible modular technologies and treatment trains zhao et al 2014 additional limitations to the technology include scalability and the need for routine manual intervention to replace electrodes and or clean the equipment to prevent fouling however ec still stands out as a notable technology in terms of multifunctional capabilities ec or similar technologies could bridge the gap between late stage primary treatments e g coagulation and floatation and clarification and secondary treatment e g multivalent ion removal a related technology called magnetic ballast clarification has been recently reported to use a combination of coagulants and flocculating polymers in the presence of magnetic particles to clarify u pw at rates up to 5 gal min 1 ringler et al 2017 u pw and the magnetic particles are introduced into the process unit with agitation resulting in the magnetic particles being coated with the polymers surfactants and charged species a magnetic separator near the water surface then captures the contaminated magnetic particles for cleaning note also that ec treatment will inherently generate a sludge that can potentially contain high levels of heavy metals norms sulfur and toxic chemicals while a discussion of regulations is beyond scope it is safe to assert that ec will necessitate the handling and transportation of solid material offsite to date the environmental and economic impacts of this practice remain largely unexplored finally although it is the least mature of the technologies discussed here reductive heterogeneous catalysis is a promising emerging method to selectively target oxyanion contaminants in addition some small halogenated organics heck et al 2019 yin et al 2018 in a similar engineering approach to aops advanced reduction technologies arts operate through the in situ reduction of the target contaminant but with distinct difference being the requirement of a reductant precursor this stands in contrast to the previously discussed physical separations for inorganic contaminants that inherently generate additional waste streams the general principle of heterogeneous catalysis based arts is to transform the toxic compounds into benign products which depending on the targeted end use of the treated water do not necessitate additional removal 5 research needs and outlook the literature severely lacks case studies that focus on u pw treatment the body of research is growing but most publications to date emphasize desalination exclusively despite a minimal need to remove the most abundant ions e g na cl for hf reuse opportunities a primary objective of this work is to highlight end uses that can tolerate relatively high salinity provided that bacterial and organic content are minimized aside from evaluating performance in real waters a thorough investigation of the interplay and possible synergy between treatments is necessary several methods discussed here appear promising for u pw but case studies must be performed before industry will be willing to invest in high risk emerging technologies in addition more rigorous reporting of total pw volumes as well as the subsequent management practices of that water would greatly benefit the professional and scientific community surrounding this issue as with the example of elevated contaminants in ec sludge there are still many uncertainties regarding the potential toxicity and long term consequences of u pw reuse activities given our current understanding of u pw management the prospect of implementing the massive volumes of u pw that are currently disposed of towards reuse recycle opportunities warrants the attention of the scientific community however deploying decentralized treatment activities of this scale will be a novel task for industry and the volume severity of the waste generated from u pw treatment must be carefully weighed against the environmental benefit of reducing freshwater withdrawals furthermore reuse goals should be prioritized over recycle for relatively high quality u pw some recycle options such as crop irrigation are viable targets in one example texas a m in collaboration with anadarko petroleum successfully grew cotton in western texas using treated pw lewis 2015 however in most cases the feed more closely resembles that of seawater and technologies for this application necessitate a separate discussion regarding recycle options that involve direct human interaction consumption there are still many uncertainties pertaining to the identity and potential toxicity of the organic compounds butkovskyi et al 2017 for the general discussion presented here bulk metrics for organic content e g cod toc are appropriate however the reactivity and fate of many chemicals used in fracking fluids is not fully understood when it comes to potential human health effects among the newer technologies eaops particularly ao and ao cathodic h2o2 require the development of efficient chemically resistant electrodes a formalized understanding of catalytic structure property relationships under these conditions must be proposed before materials can be engineered that are resistant to chemical poisoning and selective towards the desired oxidant similarly a major obstacle for ec technology is electrode passivation future research must elucidate the passivation mechanisms in this class of waters and engineered solutions to reverse or prevent the process es is needed desalination research is a rich field and the technologies discussed here should not be considered comprehensive however there is a distinct void of technologies that can economically operate in complex matrices at tds levels surpassing 100 000 mg l 1 while many membrane based technologies have been investigated in recent years the inevitable occurrence of membrane fouling e g colloidal scale bio organic fouling coupled with membrane degradation continue to limit commercial applications broadly complex water matrices such as pw provide opportunities for innovative multifunctional materials such as adsorbents decorated with antibacterial nanoparticles or membranes embedded with active catalysts that can minimize biofouling through in situ generated oxidants finally although likely far from commercial viability emerging arts will benefit from a continued investigation into the molecular level structure activity relationships of nanoparticle catalysts there is currently a great need to discover new approaches to both improve selectivity and perhaps more importantly prevent poisoning by benign ionic species further a departure from precious metal based materials may be necessary for economic viability 6 conclusions overall fracking is poised to be the cornerstone of u s hydrocarbon production for the foreseeable future the enormous volumes of variably contaminated waters derived from these operations are a mounting environmental and economic risk necessitating new management practices for industry u pw management has proven to be a unique technological challenge there is no standard approach to u pw treatment due to the issues associated with the elevated concentrations of tds organic compounds bacteria iron sulfur species and norms u pw is a research target with immense societal impact but it is so far relatively overlooked by the scientific community we hope is that this publication will enhance appreciation for the scale and scope of this issue and promote the development of fit for purpose treatment approaches enhanced by higher selectivity for efficient removal of specific pollutants of greatest concern and by multifunctionality to simultaneously remove different classes of pollutants that require different treatment processes to enhance the cost effectiveness of produced water reuse

18078,thin film composite tfc membranes are the heart of reverse osmosis ro processes for desalination and water reuse in recent years nanomaterials with high permeability selectivity and chemical resistance and low fouling tendency have begun to emerge and be applied in many other fields this has stimulated the research on novel ro membranes consisting of nanomaterials non porous and porous in their selective layers encouraging results have been demonstrated herein the state of the art developments of polyamide thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes for ro processes are summarized since the concept of tfn was introduced in 2007 while it is obvious that nanomaterials could impart exclusive properties it should also be noted that significant challenges still exist for research and commercialization of tfn membranes such as selection of proper nanomaterials prevention of leaching of nanoparticles and performance and cost analysis before large scale ro membrane manufacturing future research directions are outlined to offer insights for the fabrication of much advanced tfn membranes with optimal interface morphology and separation performance graphical abstract image 1

overstated given the fact of increasing demand of fresh water due to growing population improving living standard and rapid industrialization water purification technologies to treat conventional water sources have received unprecedented attention in recent years besides vigorous search emerged for augmenting water supplies through desalination of unconventional water sources such as seawater and saline aquifers by safe reliable and affordable manners amy et al 2017 chandrashekara and avadhesh 2017 subramani and jacangelo 2015 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 through an ro process clean water can be obtained by pressurizing the salty water through a selective membrane owing to the simplicity and energy efficiency it is currently the most dominant technology worldwide for desalination and also a critical step in advanced wastewater reuse plants which provide clean water from municipal wastewater tang et al 2018 the thin film composite tfc polyamide ro membrane is now the primary membrane type for ro processes as depicted in fig 1 a it consists of a non woven fabric support a porous middle polymer layer and a thin 500 nm and highly cross linked polyamide layer to provide selectivity cadotte 1977 greenlee et al 2009 this selective layer which is dense and amorphous with interstitial voids of 0 5 nm among the polymer chains is usually formed by the interfacial polymerization reaction between m phenylenediamine mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc fig 1b xu et al 2013 it ideally allows only water molecules to pass through at a high rate and retains all solutes compared to other kinds of ro membranes tfc membranes are featured by excellent permeability high salt rejection and plausible tolerance to a wide ph range and high pressure tan et al 2018 however at this point of time some limitations and challenges are still significantly impeding the effectiveness of ro membranes to meet the increasing stringent water standard and requirement of energy efficiency and increasing the operational complexity since pre treatment or post treatment on water source or membranes is necessary first of all one major challenge of ro membranes is to achieve both high water permeability and selectivity simultaneously similar to all other membranes tfc ro membranes are subjected to a ubiquitous and pernicious trade off relationship between permeability i e how fast water molecules can pass through the selective layer and selectivity i e to what content salts are rejected by the selective layer geise et al 2011 park et al 2017 in addition the quality of product water will be jeopardized due to inadequate rejections to small neutral solutes e g boron in seawater and carcinogenic n nitrosodimethylamine in wastewater li and wang 2010 qasim et al 2019 furthermore the efficiency of ro membranes is commonly threatened and hindered by organic inorganic and microorganism foulants in natural raw waters kang and cao 2012 in particular biofouling control is imperative to ro membranes as the selective polyamide layer is not stable under prolonged exposure to oxidants e g free chlorine which are commonly utilized for the biofouling control on the other hand a membrane with enhanced resistance to chlorine could effectively eliminate biofouling with the addition of chlorine in the feed or during backwash these practical obstacles underscore the need for rational innovation in membrane design and catalyze a sustained search for novel materials especially the twenty first century has brought many exciting new opportunities associated with nanotechnology to membrane fabrication as they provide plentiful probable pathways to circumvent technical hurdles alvarez et al 2018 mauter et al 2018 through manipulation of chemical structure morphology and size of nanomaterials nanotechnology endows membranes with many preferable properties such as adsorptive optical quantum catalytic electrical or antifouling properties in particular for water salt separation in the ro process porous nanomaterials render great possibilities to shift the separation mechanism from diffusion to size exclusion wherein discrete pores in nanoparticles nps allow water to pass through and exclude undesired solutes which have larger sizes stevens et al 2017 nanotechnology also endows new paradigms for membrane design that can overcome the permeability selectivity trade off relationship of current ro membranes buonomenna 2013 chung et al 2019 lee et al 2011 pendergast and hoek 2011 furthermore nanotechnology enables the fabrication of multi functional ro membranes with resistance to biofouling because of the larger surface to volume ratio and anti microorganism propensity of some nps al aani et al 2017 jhaveri and murthy 2016 kang and cao 2012 based on increasing understanding of both biological and synthetic membranes at the molecular level key design criteria for new generation ro membranes have been raised they must have 1 free volume elements with proper sizes 2 a narrow free volume distribution and 3 a thin selective layer with highly tuned interactions between permeants and the membranes in 2007 hoek et al first reported the new concept of tfn ro membranes by embedding molecular sieve nps throughout the polyamide layer jeong et al 2007 since then growing research efforts have focused on deploying a variety of nanomaterials including non porous and porous ones to overcome the challenges of conventional tfc ro membranes buonomenna 2013 chung et al 2019 lee et al 2011 pendergast and hoek 2011 stevens et al 2017 depending on the hydrophilic hydrophobic nature of the nanomaterials they can be either distributed in the aqueous or organic phase in some works researchers preloaded nps on polymer supports before the interfacial polymerization li et al 2015 van goethem et al 2016 yang et al 2017 2019 the size structure chemical functions and loading amount of nps in polyamide layers alter the polyamide network structure free volume surface hydrophilicity thickness and ultimately the transport properties of tfn membranes in this review we summarize various attempts and progresses made on tfn ro membranes to date in addition potential opportune niches and development and implementation barriers are outlined along with research needs to overcome these barriers 2 thin film nanocomposite tfn ro membranes 2 1 incorporation of non porous nps in the past decade researchers have integrated a variety of solid nanofillers into the polyamide layers such as titanium dioxide nps silica nps cerium oxide nps silver nps and carbon quantum dots cqds to construct tfn layers ben sasson et al 2014 el aassar 2015 jadav and singh 2009 kim et al 2013 pang and zhang 2018 peyki et al 2015 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2017 2019 zhao and chung 2018 theoretically incorporation of such impermeable nps should jeopardize the permeability of tfn membranes because they reduce the effective area for permeation through the polymer films yet interestingly many experimental results showed that these nps still have potentials to promote water permeability even though these nanomaterials contain no internal pores channels lau et al 2015 researchers usually attributed this phenomenon to the enhanced surface hydrophilicity and increased free volume in the polyamide layers however some studies also unveiled an opposite trend water flux declined upon the addition of solid nanofillers in the polyamide layers in addition to water permeability contradictory results regarding to salt rejection either increased or declined have been reported as well lau et al 2015 as impermeable nanofillers can increase membrane permeability through defect formation they may also compromise solute rejection due to the undermined integrity of the selective layers despite dozens of related papers published systematic characterization investigation and interpretation are still needed to understand the underlying mechanisms governing the transport of water and salts in solid nanofiller incorporated tfn membranes for certain applications a loss in water permeability or salt rejection of the modified ro membranes may be tolerable due to additional benefits and functions of super hydrophilicity anti fouling properties or better chlorine resistance table 1 lists the research based on the tfn ro membranes with non porous nps 2 1 1 tio2 sio2 and ceo2 nps titanium oxide tio2 has received remarkable attention in membrane modification because of its anti biofouling properties bae and tak 2005 khorshidi et al 2018 kim et al 2003 38 40 tio2 nps can release strong oxidative species like hydroxylradicals superoxides and hydroperoxyl radicals under uv light irradiation which can kill most of microorganisms and inhibit the formation of biofilms effectively bae and tak 2005 khorshidi et al 2018 kim et al 2003 thus in a previous study tio2 nps have been anchored on the top of the polyamide layer by means of self assembly through the interaction between positively charged tio2 and negatively charged carboxylic groups of the polyamide zhou et al 2018 the incorporation of tio2 nps into the polyamide layers for ro processes by pre dispersing tio2 nps in either the organic phase of tmc or the aqueous phase of mpd before interfacial polymerization has been investigated el aassar 2015 the ro performance with respect to water permeability and salt rejection of these two kinds of tfn membranes were evaluated together with their antifouling effectiveness by introducing tio2 nps into the organic or aqueous phase both hydrophilicity and flux of the membranes were enhanced with a slightly increased or maintained salt rejection compared with neat tfc membranes the water flux under 15 5 bar increased from 33 6 to 39 6 and 40 2 lmh respectively for organic and aqueous phase pre dispersion while the salt rejection changed from 99 75 to 99 83 and 99 72 respectively khorshidi et al entrapped sub 10 nm tio2 nps into the polyamide matrix and proved enhanced thermal stability and antifouling properties of the resulting tfn membranes khorshidi et al 2018 filtration tests were initially conducted at room temperature and then elevated to 65 c to investigate their thermal stability all membranes provided higher water permeances and salt rejections at a higher operation temperature fig 2 a and b owing to the swelling of the polyamide layers as well as the higher diffusion coefficient of water molecules through the swollen membranes the anti biofouling activity of tfn membranes was evaluated by counting the number of e coli colonies formed over the uv illuminated membranes as shown in fig 2c the exposure of tio2 incorporated tfn membranes to the uv light remarkably lowered the viability of e coli these desirable features make these tfn membranes promising candidates for applications where the treatment of high temperature streams containing microorganisms is demanded silica is a chemically inert thermally stable and inexpensive material jadav et al 2010 lv et al 2017 niksefat et al 2014 obaid et al 2016 jadav et al investigated the effects of incorporating two sizes of silica nps 3 and 16 nm in situ into the polyamide layers jadav and singh 2009 thermogravimetric analysis tga results indicated that sio2 np modified tfn layers exhibited superior thermal stability additionally the pore size of nanocomposite layers was tunable with a radius varying from 0 34 to 0 73 nm depending on the silica content while the neat polyamide layer had a fixed pore size of 0 38 nm peyki and co workers embedded sio2 nps 15 20 nm into the polyamide layers and the membranes were for the first time investigated for high pressure desalination processes peyki et al 2015 results revealed that increasing sio2 loading enhanced water flux from 32 to 50 lmh using a nacl solution of 11 000 ppm as the feed under 44 bar salt rejection increased at first but decreased at a higher sio2 loading 0 01 wt which was commonly found in tfn membranes due to the inevitable defects in the selective layer as a result of nanoparticle agglomeration at a higher loading some other studies focused on the manipulation of tfc membranes by modified sio2 nps jadav et al 2010 kim et al 2013 pang and zhang 2018 cerium oxide ceo2 nps are potential candidates of nanofillers in the polyamide layer owing to their high surface area hydrophilicity antioxidant property and low cost wang et al 2019 recently wang s group fabricated novel tfn ro membranes by embedding hydrophilic ceo2 nps within the ultra thin polyamide layers wang et al 2019 the results indicated that ceo2 nps were steadily integrated into the polyamide network by chemical bonding between carboxyl groups of ceo2 nps and acyl chloride groups of tmc the enhanced surface hydrophilicity together with distinctly increased surface negative charge resulted in a significant increment of water permeance from 1 80 to 2 75 lmh bar without negatively affecting the membrane selectivity the presence of ceo2 nps in the polyamide layers also mitigated organic fouling towards bsa and humic acid as representative organic foulants 2 1 2 ag nps enhancement in antifouling properties of ro membranes especially anti biofouling is of great interest in real applications kang and cao 2012 bacteria attachment upon the membrane surface tends to form a cohesive biofilm leading to an increase in hydraulic resistance to the permeation besides the biofilm on membrane surface intensifies the concentration polarization and subsequently causes declines in water flux and salt rejection in recent years ag nps have been demonstrated as potential biocides in membrane separation processes since the continuous and slow release of silver ions can inactivate numerous types of bacteria attached to the membrane surface liu et al 2013 shen et al 2019 yang et al 2017 one strategy to improve the anti fouling properties of tfc membranes by ag nps is to chemically immobilize them on the surface of tfc layers this might be considered as a surface modification of ro membranes park et al 2016 yin et al 2013 several groups incorporated ag nps by preloading them on the polysulfone psf substrate before interfacial polymerization ben sasson et al 2014 yang et al 2017 2019 ben sasson s group irreversibly and uniformly bounded ag nps by reacting a silver salt agno3 with a reducing agent nabh4 on the support surface followed by interfacial polymerization ben sasson et al 2014 the embedded ag nps imparted strong antibacterial activity which consequently reduced more than 75 of live bacteria attached to the membrane surface via confocal microscopy they also revealed that ag nps could remarkably suppress biofilm formation with a 41 reduction of the total biovolume recently yang et al fabricated ag np incorporated tfn ro membranes using the same method fig 3 a yang et al 2019 by means of transmission electron microscopy tem characterizations the formation of nanochannels of 2 5 nm in size around ag nps in the polyamide layer was revealed which arose from the hydrolysis of tmc monomers and then the termination of interfacial polymerization by the water layer around each hydrophilic ag np fig 3b and c yang et al 2019 these nanochannels helped to triple the water permeance from 0 93 to 2 50 lmh bar in addition the modified membranes exhibited increased rejections against nacl boron and other small molecular organic compounds e g propylparaben norfloxacin and ofloxacin due to the combinative effects of the improved size donnan exclusion effects and suppressed hydrophobic interactions their work also revealed the enhancement mechanisms of water permeability using advanced analytic instruments which should be encouraged in future studies for a deeper understanding on tfn membranes however the anti fouling propensity of their membranes were not emphasized and characterized in addition the current strategy of in situ pre loading ag nps involves the utilization of extra and dangerous reducing agents such as nabh4 a better and environmentally friendly agent must be discovered to replace it although the existence of ag nps and the anti biofouling properties of the modified membranes have been verified the discharging rate of ag from these ag nps and the long term anti biofouling performance are usually not included in the studies if these tfn membranes could last the functionality for only several months it is challenging to reload ag nps into the polyamide layers 2 1 3 carbon based nps carbon quantum dots cqds which may be also referred as carbon dots cds or graphene graphene oxide quantum dots gqds goqds are an emerging class of carbon nanomaterials their productions can be facile and inexpensive and their physicochemical properties such as ultra small sizes good biocompatibility tunable hydrophilicity and rich surface functional groups are highly desirable in various sorts of applications baker and baker 2010 guo et al 2014 hui et al 2015 hutton et al 2017 lim et al 2015 leveraging on these unique advantages many research groups have utilized them to modify the selective skins in the past few years gai et al 2018 he et al 2018 li et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 zhao and chung 2018 li and co workers incorporated cds with a quantum size of 6 8 nm into the selective layers of ro membranes li et al 2017a cds were firstly well dispersed in an mpd aqueous solution and subsequently impregnated into the polyamide layer during the interfacial polymerization reaction as illustrated in fig 4 part of the carboxyl groups on cds interacted with the amine groups of mpd in the aqueous solution followed by some of the remaining carboxyl groups forming covalent bonds via condensation reactions with the terminal acyl chloride groups of tmc in the interfacial polymerization the top surface morphology of the selective layer transformed from a leaf like structure into a ridge and valley structure with an increased roughness this resulted in a higher flux due to the improved affinity with water and a decreased thickness of the polyamide layer in another study cqds were incorporated into the polyamide layer on the psf substrate by a similar approach song et al 2016 besides the enhanced water flux without compromising the salt rejection the addition of cqds also gave rise to a greater chlorine resistance hydrogen bonds in the polyamide matrix are vulnerable to active chlorine which leads to partial damage of the polyamide layer and ultimate loss of salt rejection song et al stated that cqds helped decelerate this process by two possible ways song et al 2016 first the hydrogen bonds between cqds and the polyamide layer made the polymer chains more compact and inhibited the replacement of amidic hydrogens another factor favored to chlorine resistance was the charge exclusion between coo from electron rich cqds and active chlorine ocl it not only hindered the contact between ocl and the membrane surface but also retarded the ocl diffusion in the polyamide matrix in a continuous ro test the cqd modified tfn membranes displayed a stable flux and salt rejection suggesting their outstanding sustainability which is greatly desired in real water reclamation and desalination processes in order to endow the tfn membranes with superior stability and performance the surface chemistry of cqds can be rationally tuned for instance fathizadeh s lab equipped cqds with amine groups by carbonizing citric acid with ammonia through a hydrothermal treatment fathizadeh et al 2019 the terminal amine groups of the modified cqds helped form chemical bonds between the polyamide matrix and cqds leading to a more stable dispersion of cqds in the polyamide matrix gai and colleagues functionalized cqds with na and introduced them into the polyamide layer on hollow fiber supports pure water permeance pwp of the membranes increased from 1 74 to 4 27 lmh bar and the salt rejection was well maintained at 98 6 gai et al 2019 asempour et al mixed another safe and biodegradable material cellulose nanocrystals into the polyamide active layers asempour et al 2018a their tfn membranes comprising nanocrystals in the range of 0 05 0 1 w v showed a doubled permeate flux with only a slight decrease in salt rejection in desalination experiments when using 300 ppm bsa as a representative foulant the tfn membranes exhibited a smaller water flux reduction of 11 than the pristine ones in filtration tests 2 2 incorporation of porous nps research on porous nanomaterials has blossomed for preparing next generation ultrahigh permeable membranes the rigid and engineered pore structure of nps with molecular sieving characteristics could impart a preferential flow path for water molecules through their internal pore structure stevens et al 2017 thereby with the aid of these nps the tfn membranes may be in a favorable position to outperform the conventional tfc ro membranes besides offering pores that can accommodate water molecules the hydrophilicity and charge properties of these nps could also result in greater affinity with water and increase in ion repulsion due to coulombic effects stevens et al 2017 table 2 summarizes recent advances in tfn ro membranes with these porous nps 2 2 1 mesoporous silica nps unlike amorphous silica nps ordered mesoporous silica nps possess an ordered internal structure tunable size and controllable morphology bao et al 2013 li et al 2016 liu et al 2016 yin et al 2012 bao and colleagues synthesized monodispersed spherical mesoporous nanosilica with an average particle size of 164 nm and pore size of 2 47 nm and then dispersed them in the organic phase before interfacial polymerization bao et al 2013 the surface hydrophilicity of the tfn ro membranes was remarkably promoted with a water contact angle decreasing from 81 to 47 thus the water flux increased from 19 lmh without nanosilica to 53 lmh with the addition of 0 1 wt v mesoporous nanosilica whereas all solute rejection rates were still higher than 96 yin et al compared the performance of tfn membranes containing non porous silica nps with mesoporous mcm 41 nps yin et al 2012 both nps had particle sizes of around 100 nm as shown in fig 5 a and b both tfn membranes showed that water flux rose with an increase in particle loading but the former rose much slower than the latter as illustrated in fig 5c the tfn membrane embedded with non porous silica nps had a 25 6 increase in flux from 28 5 to 35 8 lmh when the silica np concentration increased from zero to 0 1 wt while the tfn membranes consisting of mcm 41 showed a 63 5 flux jump from 28 5 to 46 6 lmh since tfn membranes with non porous silica nps and mcm 41 had similar chemical properties loading and hydrophilicity the difference in their flux increments suggested that a shorter flow path through the hydrophilic porous structure of mcm 41 nps played a positive role in promoting the water permeation by excluding the effects of the size and concentration of nps their work studied the roles of porosity more deeply from their results it appears that porous nps have a higher chance to break the trade off relationship between water permeability and selectivity due to their additional water channels and molecular sieving functions in order to determine if one should disperse nps in either the oil or aqueous phase liu et al synthesized monodispersed spherical mcm 48 nps with a 3d cubic mesostructure and then dispersed them in the aqueous mpd or organic tmc phase to prepare tfn membranes liu et al 2016 fig 6 compares their ro performance when mcm 48 nps were dispersed in the organic phase the resultant membranes had a lower ratio of flux enhancement from 24 to 40 lmh but their salt rejections were all above 95 fig 6a on the contrary when mcm 48 nps were dispersed in the aqueous phase the water flux could reach 68 lmh but the salt rejection declined severely from 97 to 80 fig 6b the differences could arise from the large pore size observed on both sides of the isolated polyamide layer in other words dispersing mcm 48 in the aqueous solution decreased the degree of cross linking substantially leading to form a loose polyamide layer with carboxylic groups and defects exposed on the surface their work really provided useful insights to understand the differences between dissolving nps in the aqueous or the oil phase before the interfacial polymerization although the observation may differ for other kinds of nps with distinct particle size surface chemistry hydrophilicity and pore structure 2 2 2 cnts tnts and hnts recently carbon nanotubes cnts have caught attention by many researchers because of the similarity in water transport channels between cnts and biological membranes farahbakhsh et al 2017 kim et al 2014a b lee et al 2014 park et al 2010 vatanpour et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 cnts have exceptional fluid transport properties due to their remarkably smooth inner walls molecular dynamic simulation indicated that membranes containing cnts with a proper diameter could be highly efficient for rejecting ions while allowing water transport lee et al 2014 however for tfn membranes incorporated with nanotubes an ordered alignment of these nanotubes i e vertically aligned within the polyamide matrix which should impart the membranes with the best separation performance is so far hardly achieved lee et al successfully prepared hydrophilic cnts by wrapping the walls of cap opened cnts via a bio inspired surface modification using dopamine solutions fig 7 followed by embedding them into the polyamide layer during interfacial polymerization lee et al 2014 the resultant tfn membranes showed much a higher water permeance i e from 2 50 to 3 31 lmh bar without deteriorating the selectivity i e salt rejection from 98 7 to 98 5 on the contrary tfns embedded with unmodified cnts did not show any flux improvement but lowered the salt rejection as the cnts were not well dispersed and less cap opened zhao et al found that the introduction of carboxyl functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts into the polyamide structure could also result in tfn membranes with improved antifouling property and chlorine resistance zhao et al 2014 in comparison to the pristine tfc membrane the tfn membrane comprising 0 1 wt functionalized mwcnts always showed a lower degree of flux decline in different filtration cycles using feed solutions containing bsa or ca hco3 2 the authors attributed the better antifouling property to the greater surface hydrophilicity as well as more negative surface charges upon the introduction of mwcnts in addition this tfn membrane exhibited better chlorine resistance when being evaluated under both dynamic and immersion modes owing to the protection of amide linkages by electron rich mwcnts similar results were also reported by park et al using tfn membranes incorporated with mwcnts the authors explained that the stronger interaction between the carboxylic groups of mwcnts and the amide bonds in the polyamide layer was the main reason for better membrane stability against chlorine park et al 2010 titanate nanotubes tnts and halloysite nanotubes hnts have also been explored as nanofillers due to their additional water transport channels enhanced hydrophilic properties good stability and large pore volumes asempour et al 2018b emadzadeh et al 2015 ghanbari et al 2015 emadzadeh et al produced amino functionalized tnts nh2 tnts and fabricated tfn membranes by embedding nh2 tnts into the polyamide layers emadzadeh et al 2015 results showed that the tfn membrane with an optimum loading of 0 05 w v exhibited a water flux 93 higher than the control without compromising the rejection additionally it mitigated the bsa fouling and achieved a promising flux recovery rate after a simple rinsing process ghanbari et al prepared hnt incorporated tfn membranes and found that with a loading of 0 05 w v hnts the membrane exhibited a water flux as high as 36 lmh at 15 bar and maintained a nacl rejection of 95 6 ghanbari et al 2015 asempour s group equipped the exterior surfaces of hnts with different functional groups amine groups hnt nh2 carboxylic acid hnt cooh and the first generation of dendrimer pamam dendrimer hnt g1 and then embedded them into polyamide layers by in situ interfacial polymerization ghanbari et al 2015 these three kinds of hnts were intended to address the issue of low compatibility and weak adhesion between hnts and the polyamide matrix compared to the reference tfc membranes a maximum increment of nearly 100 in water flux from 26 2 to 49 6 lmh was observed for hnt cooh based tfn membranes with a salt rejection of 99 1 by using a leaching test in a batch incubator followed by their tracing using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms it was proved that the tfn membranes comprising hnt nh2 and hnt g1exhibited significantly lower nanoparticle leaching rates due to the formation of covalent bonds between the amine groups of hnt nh2 and hnt g1 with the acyl chloride groups of tmc monomers 2 2 3 go and graphitic carbon nitride gcn nanosheets graphene oxide go is a derivative of graphene with abundant surface functional groups extremely high specific surface area extraordinary mechanical and thermal properties ali et al 2016 shen et al 2016 zhang and chung 2017 it can accelerate water transport by creating water channels between the go interlayers where water molecules are initially adsorbed by the hydrophilic oxygen containing groups and then diffuse rapidly between the hydrophobic carbon sheets in addition unlike silver nps go nanosheets are non depleting nanomaterials that inactivate bacteria by direct contact shen et al 2016 however because of their relatively large lateral size it is usually challenging to form a tfn layer consisting of go ali et al 2016 for example yin s lab embedded go with sizes ranging from 500 nm to several micrometer into the polyamide layers notwithstanding that the water permeance increased from 1 88 to 2 87 lmh bar the rejection towards nacl was also sacrificed from 95 7 to 93 8 yin et al 2016 this obstacle could be circumvented by incorporating much smaller go nanosheets 70 140 nm chae et al 2015 the unmodified polyamide layer with a more compact structure also helped to maintain the salt rejection at 99 4 the water permeability and anti biofouling property of the resultant go tfn membranes were promoted by approximately 80 and 98 based on the biovolume changes respectively compared with conventional tfc membranes the enhanced performance of go tfc membranes was ascribed to the changes of hydrophilicity surface charge surface roughness and polyamide layer thickness due to the go incorporation notably a high salt rejection was retained even at 48 000 ppm h chlorination by a sodium hypochlorite solution since the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the amide groups of the polyamide and the functional groups of go can protect the amide bonds from being attacked by chlorine both go size and concentration were the key factors to improve the performance of go tfn membranes in recent years ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride gcn nanosheets are in the spotlight for the fabrication of high performance water selective membranes due to their two dimensional graphene like structure regularly distributed triangular nanoscale pores of 3 11 å and structural defects on the laminar network fig 8 a liu et al 2018 however the poor dispersion of gcn dramatically impedes its application in tfn membranes one must tailor gcn with desirable functional groups gao et al synthesized the acidified graphitic carbon nitride acn with a smaller size and a higher solubility in water than gcn gao et al 2017 both acn and gcn nanosheets were entrapped into the polyamide layers by interfacial polymerization results in fig 8b and c revealed that the acn embedded tfn membranes possessed superior ro performance as they exhibited a 79 3 increase in water permeance from 1 57 to 2 81 lmh bar accompanied by a quite satisfactory nacl rejection of 98 6 moreover the addition of acn led to a superior antifouling capacity against protein bsa and natural organic foulants i e humic acid 2 2 4 zeolites zeolites are microporous aluminosilicate materials which can act as molecular sieves the uniform and well defined pore structure of zeolites can be customized to facilitate the size selective separation of molecules in addition zeolites are chemically and thermally stable which endow them for membrane applications like nanofiltration pervaporation gas separation and ro fathizadeh et al 2011 koros and zhang 2017 kosinov et al 2016 lind et al 2010 ma et al 2012 ong et al 2016 safarpour et al 2017 the a type zeolites in the sodium form naa have pore diameters of approximately 4 2 å that is between the diameter of water molecules 2 7 å and the diameters of hydrated sodium and chloride ions 8 9 å huang et al 2013a therefore these nps could provide preferential flow paths for water molecules but reject the hydrated salt ions by their pores therefore they have a lower transport resistance compared to those highly cross linked and nonporous polyamide layer in addition naa zeolites are rich in hydroxyl groups which could play an important role in making them more compatible with the polyamide matrix resulting in fewer voids the effects of particle size and mobile cation on naa nanocrystals were studied by lind et al lind et al 2009a b they observed that nanoparticle size may be considered as an additional degree of freedom in designing tfn ro membranes and the mobile cation could play an important role in determining the water permeance and salt rejection they suggested that zeolites might alter the polyamide film structure as a result of 1 the interaction between zeolites and monomers and or 2 the heat of hydration of the zeolite crystals smaller zeolites 100 nm produced a greater water flux due to larger characteristic pores while larger zeolite particles 300 nm exhibited more favorable surface properties by increasing the negative charge and lowering the contact angle owing to their exposure at the polyamide surface although naa zeolites may perform better than other nps in the polyamide layer to meet the harsh rejection requirements in ro processes they will undergo a de alumination reaction in an acidic feed solution due to the existence of alkaline al in the crystals additionally upon contact of multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 na inside naa will be exchanged with these multivalent cations possibly deteriorating the separation performance of the ro membranes huang et al overcame the drawbacks of naa zeolites by replacing them with another kind of chemically stable silicalite 1 nanozeolites huang et al 2013b silicalite 1 zeolites possess not only a medium pore size of 5 6 å but also rich hydroxyl groups on the surfaces in addition they are alumina free without counter ions and therefore are non susceptible to acid and multivalent ions ro tests showed that the silicalite incorporated tfn had a higher water permeability and improved tolerance to acid and multivalent cation cacl2 fig 9 another type of hydrophilic zeolite is zeolite nay with a pore size of 7 4 å which can create water paths larger than zeolite a in salt separation from water dong et al 2015 tem cross section images of the tfn layers confirmed the existence of zeolite nps in the dense nodular polyamide on the psf substrate rather than in the loose polyamide or on the surface under the optimum interfacial polymerization condition with the optimum zeolite loading of 0 15 wt the water flux increased from 2 56 to 4 79 lmh bar while providing a high salt rejection of 98 8 2 2 5 mofs metal organic frameworks mofs consisting of inorganic metal centers or clusters connected by organic linkers are a novel class of hybrid materials because they form flexible frameworks with one two and three dimensional porous structure li et al 2017b mofs are promising porous fillers due to their high surface area and porosity adjustable pore size and controllable surface functionality in particular the incorporation of mofs in polyamide layers provides unique advantages as 1 the pore structure and pore size of mofs can be tailored by simply changing the precursor metal salts and organic ligands and 2 mofs generally have better compatibility with polymeric materials since the organic linkers in mofs have stronger interactions with polymer chains li et al 2017b zhu et al 2017 zeolitic imidazolate frameworks zifs as a subclass of mofs built with tetrahedral metal ions and imidazole based organic linkers offer permanent porosity high mechanical strength and good chemical stability duan et al 2015 zifs have drawn intensive attention due to their high water permeability large specific surface area narrow pore aperture and good stability in water duan et al applied zif 8 as nanofillers in tfn membranes and increased the water permeance to 3 35 lmh bar which was 162 higher than the bare polyamide layer duan et al 2015 they attributed this improvement to faster water permeation in relatively more hydrophobic pores which had lower affinity toward water molecules aljundi found that the incorporation of 0 4 wt zif 8 in the polyamide layer could promote the surface hydrophilicity i e water contact angle dropped from 62 8 to 33 2 and water permeance without jeopardizing the selectivity in addition the modified membranes could remarkably reduce the bsa fouling by more than 75 aljundi 2017 the enhanced fouling resistance was attributed to the weak interaction between the surface and foulants lee et al first investigated the effects of zif 8 particle size on separation performance of tfn membranes lee et al 2019 different particle sizes 60 150 and 250 nm of zif 8 nps were synthesized and dispersed in aqueous solutions then deposited on the psf support prior to interfacial polymerization they found that zif 8 size affected surface coverage and external surface area per single particle the tfn membrane incorporated with zif 8 with an average size of 150 nm had the highest water permeance of 3 95 lmh bar and nacl rejection of 99 2 compared to the pristine tfc membrane and other tfn membranes consisting of other zif 8 sizes recently uio 66 formed by the central zr iv ions and terephthalic acid ligands with an intrinsic pore size of 6 1 å has been investigated as a nanofiller in tfn membranes for nanofiltration forward osmosis and ro due to its higher stability in water he et al 2017 liu et al 2019 ma et al 2017 at an optimal blending concentration of 0 05 w v in the oil phase the uio 66 tfn membrane showed an increase of 50 in water flux and a marginal increase in rejection compared with the benchmark tfc membrane liu et al 2019 for seawater desalination via ro the modified membrane exhibited an enhanced water flux of 61 32 lmh and rejection of 99 27 meanwhile the uio 66 blended tfn membrane promoted the boron rejection by 11 compared to the benchmark membrane 82 3 this might arise from the fact that the interaction between uio 66 and boric acid was chemisorption because uio 66 had a greater adsorption capacity than many conventional adsorbents in addition the partial blockage by adsorbed boron would reduce the effective pore size thus the subsequent boron diffusion across the blocked uio 66 nanochannels could be hindered fig 10 it is foreseeable that in the future more intensive research efforts will be given to mof incorporated tfn membranes as mofs are emerging nanomaterials with many potentials in view of the fact that mofs consist of both an organic part to provide a higher compatibility with the polyamide matrix and an inorganic part to upgrade the membrane performance novel mof embedded tfn membranes will likely be developed for commercial scale utilization comparing to other tfns they may outperform the current commercial ro membranes with higher water permeability and comparable salt rejection due to the molecular sieving functions of mofs 2 3 bio inspired tfn membranes in recent years researchers are devoted to mimicking the natural water channels from diverse chemical heterogeneities that govern intramolecular and intermolecular interactions the most popular one is the family of water channel proteins aquaporins aqps existing in the cells of many living organisms the proteins have an hourglass shape water channel with a narrow canal of 2 8 å just enough to transport a single water molecule kozono et al 2002 pohl et al 2001 water transports through this waterway by the osmotic pressure gradient kumar et al measured the water permeability of proteoliposomes containing aqps and postulated that aqp based ro membranes may possibly achieve a permeance as high as 601 lmh bar which is about two orders of magnitude than commercially available seawater ro membranes kumar et al 2007 since then a remarkable research interest has been made to incorporate this protein in membranes for water reuse and desalination fuwad et al 2019a b sun et al 2013 tang et al 2013 2015 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2012 however huge potentials are accompanied by more challenges such as the compatibility stability and cost of the membranes so far commercially available aqp based ro membranes are in the form of polyamide aqp composite membranes qi et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 similar to the aforementioned tfn membranes a microporous substrate was first soaked in an aqueous solution of mpd which contained a given amount of aqp then the substrates was exposed to a tmc solution and formed a polyamide rejection layer embedded with aqps the resultant membrane showed a permeance of 4 0 lmh bar 40 higher than a commercial brackish water ro membrane i e bw30 while maintaining a similar or better nacl rejection zhao et al 2012 the stability of aqp based membranes such as the tolerance to common chemical cleaning agents ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid sodium hydroxide and citric acid the sensitivity to temperature and applied pressure and the long term ro performance 100 day operation with a real ro feed were evaluated qi et al 2016 results revealed that the membranes were sensitive to changes of temperature and applied pressure but they showed good chemical stability against cleaning agents however fouling was observed in the continuous process which is a major issue for biomimetic ro membranes in addition poor performance of aqp based membranes has been reported possibly due to aging protein denature and short shelf life sahebi et al 2019 the performance stability of aqp based membranes in a wide range of operation conditions is worthy of further study in addition a synthetic approach to produce and purify aqps in large quantities and the techniques to produce mechanically robust and defect free membranes in large scales are under demand to lower the overall material and manufacture costs 3 outlook and future works while the incorporation of nps into conventional tfc membranes opens a new chapter for novel ro membranes limitations and challenges are also encountered regrading to their scalability reliability cost regenerability and safety especially for industrialized utilizations firstly since the discovery of nanomaterials a great variety of nanomaterials have been reported nevertheless only a small portion of them have been evaluated for the fabrication of tfn ro membranes therefore the fundamental science on how to select proper nanomaterials to meet the screen requirements and to demonstrate their full potential is the critical step in order to quest for the fabrication of defect free np incorporated polyamide layers one must consider their stability in water particle size pore structure charge properties solubility in water non polar solvents and chemical interaction with the polyamide layer meanwhile precise synthesis scalable and cost efficient fabrication of nps are essential to bring them for commercial applications protocols to position nps at the exact places in the polyamide layer are critical to design tfn ro membranes with desirable performance since the intrinsic physicochemical properties of nanomaterials are quite different from one another researchers must overcome the challenges and have breakthroughs on how to fabricate tfn ro membranes with ideal morphology and defect free tfn layers one key challenge is the np agglomeration in the water or oil phase during the preparation of mpd or tmc solutions the np agglomeration may stay in the polyamide layers and possibly generate deformities within the membrane structure thus in depth knowledge and surface modifications to disperse a variety of nps in the oil or aqueous phase homogeneously must be developed prior to producing the polyamide layer with minimal defects another example is the use of nanotubes such as cnts tnts and hnts ideally they could provide preferential paths for water molecules leading to an increase in water flux however large scale fabrication of tfn membranes with nanotubes vertically aligned across the polyamide layer i e the shortest path for water transport has not been achieved so far in addition the length of nanotubes might be larger than the thickness of polyamide layers as a result they can only be fully accommodated in the polyamide layers if they are horizontally or crookedly oriented both the stack agglomeration and unordered alignment of nanomaterials would inevitably contribute to longer paths and higher resistance for water transport across the selectivity layers owing to their nano sizes leaching nps from tfn ro membranes into the retentate and permeate streams is inevitable that has raised concerns about their environmental and health implications however the leaching rate of nps the risk of these nanomaterials to human being and the correlation between their toxicity and exposure remain difficult to be quantified for water treatment applications future research should not ignore them on the other hand membrane scientists must find ways to strongly anchor nps in the polyamide layer via easy and practical chemical bonding such as chemical reaction between nh2 from nanomaterials and cocl from tmc so that the robust tfn ro membranes have a long lifespan asempour et al 2018b wu et al 2013 in addition up to now most tfn membranes are still in the research stage in order to successfully adopt novel tfn technologies in the current ro membrane manufacture several factors must be investigated firstly it should be noted that the performances of the control membranes in some literatures are much poorer than the state of the art commercial ro membranes although the incorporation of nanomaterials helps improve the separation performance compared to such low performance control membranes whether it can truly improve the performance of commercial ro membranes is questionable and needs further investigation similarly most novel tfn ro membranes were evaluated only using highly idealized feed solutions for a short duration as these membranes aim to commercialize in the real world it is crucial for academic scientists to examine their newly developed membranes from an industrial perspective in other words their membranes must be tested not only using real brackish water bw but also real seawater sw under industrial testing protocols for bwro and swro a long term evaluation protocol must be considered to investigate the possible drop in performance cleaning and maintenance furthermore the economic benefits of using nanomaterials in ro membranes must outweigh the costs of development and production to both manufacturers and customers the additional cost includes 1 r d to establish both baseline and long term performance advantages and 2 the modified production process to produce the new membranes stevens et al 2017 to cut the cost process engineering innovation is important so that the tfn technologies can be fitted into the current ro membrane manufacturing and achieve a cost effective controllable and scalable process another cost is the bulky synthesis of nanomaterials a new process must be developed to utilize the nanomaterials more efficiently hence before commercialization it is critical to systematically analyze the above factors to determine whether the new developed tfn ro membrane is cost saving last but not the least ideally to replace the current tfc ro membranes the newly invented tfn ro membranes need not only possess an enhanced water permeability but also better resistance to chlorine and foulants long term performance studies of the newly developed ro membranes in a wide range of operation window are indispensable to confirm their robustness and to find the best conditions in order to maximize their separation performance and lifespan 4 conclusions the separation technologies based on tfc ro membranes will likely continuously dominate water reuse and seawater desalination in the foreseeable future the advent of nanomaterials has heralded a new chapter in ro technologies by proving a broad range of unprecedented opportunities in this review we have summarized the recent progresses in the field of tfn ro membranes although the research on tfn membranes is in its earliest stage the potential of using tfn membranes for modern water reuse and desalination is vivid due to

18078,thin film composite tfc membranes are the heart of reverse osmosis ro processes for desalination and water reuse in recent years nanomaterials with high permeability selectivity and chemical resistance and low fouling tendency have begun to emerge and be applied in many other fields this has stimulated the research on novel ro membranes consisting of nanomaterials non porous and porous in their selective layers encouraging results have been demonstrated herein the state of the art developments of polyamide thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes for ro processes are summarized since the concept of tfn was introduced in 2007 while it is obvious that nanomaterials could impart exclusive properties it should also be noted that significant challenges still exist for research and commercialization of tfn membranes such as selection of proper nanomaterials prevention of leaching of nanoparticles and performance and cost analysis before large scale ro membrane manufacturing future research directions are outlined to offer insights for the fabrication of much advanced tfn membranes with optimal interface morphology and separation performance graphical abstract image 1

overstated given the fact of increasing demand of fresh water due to growing population improving living standard and rapid industrialization water purification technologies to treat conventional water sources have received unprecedented attention in recent years besides vigorous search emerged for augmenting water supplies through desalination of unconventional water sources such as seawater and saline aquifers by safe reliable and affordable manners amy et al 2017 chandrashekara and avadhesh 2017 subramani and jacangelo 2015 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 through an ro process clean water can be obtained by pressurizing the salty water through a selective membrane owing to the simplicity and energy efficiency it is currently the most dominant technology worldwide for desalination and also a critical step in advanced wastewater reuse plants which provide clean water from municipal wastewater tang et al 2018 the thin film composite tfc polyamide ro membrane is now the primary membrane type for ro processes as depicted in fig 1 a it consists of a non woven fabric support a porous middle polymer layer and a thin 500 nm and highly cross linked polyamide layer to provide selectivity cadotte 1977 greenlee et al 2009 this selective layer which is dense and amorphous with interstitial voids of 0 5 nm among the polymer chains is usually formed by the interfacial polymerization reaction between m phenylenediamine mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc fig 1b xu et al 2013 it ideally allows only water molecules to pass through at a high rate and retains all solutes compared to other kinds of ro membranes tfc membranes are featured by excellent permeability high salt rejection and plausible tolerance to a wide ph range and high pressure tan et al 2018 however at this point of time some limitations and challenges are still significantly impeding the effectiveness of ro membranes to meet the increasing stringent water standard and requirement of energy efficiency and increasing the operational complexity since pre treatment or post treatment on water source or membranes is necessary first of all one major challenge of ro membranes is to achieve both high water permeability and selectivity simultaneously similar to all other membranes tfc ro membranes are subjected to a ubiquitous and pernicious trade off relationship between permeability i e how fast water molecules can pass through the selective layer and selectivity i e to what content salts are rejected by the selective layer geise et al 2011 park et al 2017 in addition the quality of product water will be jeopardized due to inadequate rejections to small neutral solutes e g boron in seawater and carcinogenic n nitrosodimethylamine in wastewater li and wang 2010 qasim et al 2019 furthermore the efficiency of ro membranes is commonly threatened and hindered by organic inorganic and microorganism foulants in natural raw waters kang and cao 2012 in particular biofouling control is imperative to ro membranes as the selective polyamide layer is not stable under prolonged exposure to oxidants e g free chlorine which are commonly utilized for the biofouling control on the other hand a membrane with enhanced resistance to chlorine could effectively eliminate biofouling with the addition of chlorine in the feed or during backwash these practical obstacles underscore the need for rational innovation in membrane design and catalyze a sustained search for novel materials especially the twenty first century has brought many exciting new opportunities associated with nanotechnology to membrane fabrication as they provide plentiful probable pathways to circumvent technical hurdles alvarez et al 2018 mauter et al 2018 through manipulation of chemical structure morphology and size of nanomaterials nanotechnology endows membranes with many preferable properties such as adsorptive optical quantum catalytic electrical or antifouling properties in particular for water salt separation in the ro process porous nanomaterials render great possibilities to shift the separation mechanism from diffusion to size exclusion wherein discrete pores in nanoparticles nps allow water to pass through and exclude undesired solutes which have larger sizes stevens et al 2017 nanotechnology also endows new paradigms for membrane design that can overcome the permeability selectivity trade off relationship of current ro membranes buonomenna 2013 chung et al 2019 lee et al 2011 pendergast and hoek 2011 furthermore nanotechnology enables the fabrication of multi functional ro membranes with resistance to biofouling because of the larger surface to volume ratio and anti microorganism propensity of some nps al aani et al 2017 jhaveri and murthy 2016 kang and cao 2012 based on increasing understanding of both biological and synthetic membranes at the molecular level key design criteria for new generation ro membranes have been raised they must have 1 free volume elements with proper sizes 2 a narrow free volume distribution and 3 a thin selective layer with highly tuned interactions between permeants and the membranes in 2007 hoek et al first reported the new concept of tfn ro membranes by embedding molecular sieve nps throughout the polyamide layer jeong et al 2007 since then growing research efforts have focused on deploying a variety of nanomaterials including non porous and porous ones to overcome the challenges of conventional tfc ro membranes buonomenna 2013 chung et al 2019 lee et al 2011 pendergast and hoek 2011 stevens et al 2017 depending on the hydrophilic hydrophobic nature of the nanomaterials they can be either distributed in the aqueous or organic phase in some works researchers preloaded nps on polymer supports before the interfacial polymerization li et al 2015 van goethem et al 2016 yang et al 2017 2019 the size structure chemical functions and loading amount of nps in polyamide layers alter the polyamide network structure free volume surface hydrophilicity thickness and ultimately the transport properties of tfn membranes in this review we summarize various attempts and progresses made on tfn ro membranes to date in addition potential opportune niches and development and implementation barriers are outlined along with research needs to overcome these barriers 2 thin film nanocomposite tfn ro membranes 2 1 incorporation of non porous nps in the past decade researchers have integrated a variety of solid nanofillers into the polyamide layers such as titanium dioxide nps silica nps cerium oxide nps silver nps and carbon quantum dots cqds to construct tfn layers ben sasson et al 2014 el aassar 2015 jadav and singh 2009 kim et al 2013 pang and zhang 2018 peyki et al 2015 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2017 2019 zhao and chung 2018 theoretically incorporation of such impermeable nps should jeopardize the permeability of tfn membranes because they reduce the effective area for permeation through the polymer films yet interestingly many experimental results showed that these nps still have potentials to promote water permeability even though these nanomaterials contain no internal pores channels lau et al 2015 researchers usually attributed this phenomenon to the enhanced surface hydrophilicity and increased free volume in the polyamide layers however some studies also unveiled an opposite trend water flux declined upon the addition of solid nanofillers in the polyamide layers in addition to water permeability contradictory results regarding to salt rejection either increased or declined have been reported as well lau et al 2015 as impermeable nanofillers can increase membrane permeability through defect formation they may also compromise solute rejection due to the undermined integrity of the selective layers despite dozens of related papers published systematic characterization investigation and interpretation are still needed to understand the underlying mechanisms governing the transport of water and salts in solid nanofiller incorporated tfn membranes for certain applications a loss in water permeability or salt rejection of the modified ro membranes may be tolerable due to additional benefits and functions of super hydrophilicity anti fouling properties or better chlorine resistance table 1 lists the research based on the tfn ro membranes with non porous nps 2 1 1 tio2 sio2 and ceo2 nps titanium oxide tio2 has received remarkable attention in membrane modification because of its anti biofouling properties bae and tak 2005 khorshidi et al 2018 kim et al 2003 38 40 tio2 nps can release strong oxidative species like hydroxylradicals superoxides and hydroperoxyl radicals under uv light irradiation which can kill most of microorganisms and inhibit the formation of biofilms effectively bae and tak 2005 khorshidi et al 2018 kim et al 2003 thus in a previous study tio2 nps have been anchored on the top of the polyamide layer by means of self assembly through the interaction between positively charged tio2 and negatively charged carboxylic groups of the polyamide zhou et al 2018 the incorporation of tio2 nps into the polyamide layers for ro processes by pre dispersing tio2 nps in either the organic phase of tmc or the aqueous phase of mpd before interfacial polymerization has been investigated el aassar 2015 the ro performance with respect to water permeability and salt rejection of these two kinds of tfn membranes were evaluated together with their antifouling effectiveness by introducing tio2 nps into the organic or aqueous phase both hydrophilicity and flux of the membranes were enhanced with a slightly increased or maintained salt rejection compared with neat tfc membranes the water flux under 15 5 bar increased from 33 6 to 39 6 and 40 2 lmh respectively for organic and aqueous phase pre dispersion while the salt rejection changed from 99 75 to 99 83 and 99 72 respectively khorshidi et al entrapped sub 10 nm tio2 nps into the polyamide matrix and proved enhanced thermal stability and antifouling properties of the resulting tfn membranes khorshidi et al 2018 filtration tests were initially conducted at room temperature and then elevated to 65 c to investigate their thermal stability all membranes provided higher water permeances and salt rejections at a higher operation temperature fig 2 a and b owing to the swelling of the polyamide layers as well as the higher diffusion coefficient of water molecules through the swollen membranes the anti biofouling activity of tfn membranes was evaluated by counting the number of e coli colonies formed over the uv illuminated membranes as shown in fig 2c the exposure of tio2 incorporated tfn membranes to the uv light remarkably lowered the viability of e coli these desirable features make these tfn membranes promising candidates for applications where the treatment of high temperature streams containing microorganisms is demanded silica is a chemically inert thermally stable and inexpensive material jadav et al 2010 lv et al 2017 niksefat et al 2014 obaid et al 2016 jadav et al investigated the effects of incorporating two sizes of silica nps 3 and 16 nm in situ into the polyamide layers jadav and singh 2009 thermogravimetric analysis tga results indicated that sio2 np modified tfn layers exhibited superior thermal stability additionally the pore size of nanocomposite layers was tunable with a radius varying from 0 34 to 0 73 nm depending on the silica content while the neat polyamide layer had a fixed pore size of 0 38 nm peyki and co workers embedded sio2 nps 15 20 nm into the polyamide layers and the membranes were for the first time investigated for high pressure desalination processes peyki et al 2015 results revealed that increasing sio2 loading enhanced water flux from 32 to 50 lmh using a nacl solution of 11 000 ppm as the feed under 44 bar salt rejection increased at first but decreased at a higher sio2 loading 0 01 wt which was commonly found in tfn membranes due to the inevitable defects in the selective layer as a result of nanoparticle agglomeration at a higher loading some other studies focused on the manipulation of tfc membranes by modified sio2 nps jadav et al 2010 kim et al 2013 pang and zhang 2018 cerium oxide ceo2 nps are potential candidates of nanofillers in the polyamide layer owing to their high surface area hydrophilicity antioxidant property and low cost wang et al 2019 recently wang s group fabricated novel tfn ro membranes by embedding hydrophilic ceo2 nps within the ultra thin polyamide layers wang et al 2019 the results indicated that ceo2 nps were steadily integrated into the polyamide network by chemical bonding between carboxyl groups of ceo2 nps and acyl chloride groups of tmc the enhanced surface hydrophilicity together with distinctly increased surface negative charge resulted in a significant increment of water permeance from 1 80 to 2 75 lmh bar without negatively affecting the membrane selectivity the presence of ceo2 nps in the polyamide layers also mitigated organic fouling towards bsa and humic acid as representative organic foulants 2 1 2 ag nps enhancement in antifouling properties of ro membranes especially anti biofouling is of great interest in real applications kang and cao 2012 bacteria attachment upon the membrane surface tends to form a cohesive biofilm leading to an increase in hydraulic resistance to the permeation besides the biofilm on membrane surface intensifies the concentration polarization and subsequently causes declines in water flux and salt rejection in recent years ag nps have been demonstrated as potential biocides in membrane separation processes since the continuous and slow release of silver ions can inactivate numerous types of bacteria attached to the membrane surface liu et al 2013 shen et al 2019 yang et al 2017 one strategy to improve the anti fouling properties of tfc membranes by ag nps is to chemically immobilize them on the surface of tfc layers this might be considered as a surface modification of ro membranes park et al 2016 yin et al 2013 several groups incorporated ag nps by preloading them on the polysulfone psf substrate before interfacial polymerization ben sasson et al 2014 yang et al 2017 2019 ben sasson s group irreversibly and uniformly bounded ag nps by reacting a silver salt agno3 with a reducing agent nabh4 on the support surface followed by interfacial polymerization ben sasson et al 2014 the embedded ag nps imparted strong antibacterial activity which consequently reduced more than 75 of live bacteria attached to the membrane surface via confocal microscopy they also revealed that ag nps could remarkably suppress biofilm formation with a 41 reduction of the total biovolume recently yang et al fabricated ag np incorporated tfn ro membranes using the same method fig 3 a yang et al 2019 by means of transmission electron microscopy tem characterizations the formation of nanochannels of 2 5 nm in size around ag nps in the polyamide layer was revealed which arose from the hydrolysis of tmc monomers and then the termination of interfacial polymerization by the water layer around each hydrophilic ag np fig 3b and c yang et al 2019 these nanochannels helped to triple the water permeance from 0 93 to 2 50 lmh bar in addition the modified membranes exhibited increased rejections against nacl boron and other small molecular organic compounds e g propylparaben norfloxacin and ofloxacin due to the combinative effects of the improved size donnan exclusion effects and suppressed hydrophobic interactions their work also revealed the enhancement mechanisms of water permeability using advanced analytic instruments which should be encouraged in future studies for a deeper understanding on tfn membranes however the anti fouling propensity of their membranes were not emphasized and characterized in addition the current strategy of in situ pre loading ag nps involves the utilization of extra and dangerous reducing agents such as nabh4 a better and environmentally friendly agent must be discovered to replace it although the existence of ag nps and the anti biofouling properties of the modified membranes have been verified the discharging rate of ag from these ag nps and the long term anti biofouling performance are usually not included in the studies if these tfn membranes could last the functionality for only several months it is challenging to reload ag nps into the polyamide layers 2 1 3 carbon based nps carbon quantum dots cqds which may be also referred as carbon dots cds or graphene graphene oxide quantum dots gqds goqds are an emerging class of carbon nanomaterials their productions can be facile and inexpensive and their physicochemical properties such as ultra small sizes good biocompatibility tunable hydrophilicity and rich surface functional groups are highly desirable in various sorts of applications baker and baker 2010 guo et al 2014 hui et al 2015 hutton et al 2017 lim et al 2015 leveraging on these unique advantages many research groups have utilized them to modify the selective skins in the past few years gai et al 2018 he et al 2018 li et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 zhao and chung 2018 li and co workers incorporated cds with a quantum size of 6 8 nm into the selective layers of ro membranes li et al 2017a cds were firstly well dispersed in an mpd aqueous solution and subsequently impregnated into the polyamide layer during the interfacial polymerization reaction as illustrated in fig 4 part of the carboxyl groups on cds interacted with the amine groups of mpd in the aqueous solution followed by some of the remaining carboxyl groups forming covalent bonds via condensation reactions with the terminal acyl chloride groups of tmc in the interfacial polymerization the top surface morphology of the selective layer transformed from a leaf like structure into a ridge and valley structure with an increased roughness this resulted in a higher flux due to the improved affinity with water and a decreased thickness of the polyamide layer in another study cqds were incorporated into the polyamide layer on the psf substrate by a similar approach song et al 2016 besides the enhanced water flux without compromising the salt rejection the addition of cqds also gave rise to a greater chlorine resistance hydrogen bonds in the polyamide matrix are vulnerable to active chlorine which leads to partial damage of the polyamide layer and ultimate loss of salt rejection song et al stated that cqds helped decelerate this process by two possible ways song et al 2016 first the hydrogen bonds between cqds and the polyamide layer made the polymer chains more compact and inhibited the replacement of amidic hydrogens another factor favored to chlorine resistance was the charge exclusion between coo from electron rich cqds and active chlorine ocl it not only hindered the contact between ocl and the membrane surface but also retarded the ocl diffusion in the polyamide matrix in a continuous ro test the cqd modified tfn membranes displayed a stable flux and salt rejection suggesting their outstanding sustainability which is greatly desired in real water reclamation and desalination processes in order to endow the tfn membranes with superior stability and performance the surface chemistry of cqds can be rationally tuned for instance fathizadeh s lab equipped cqds with amine groups by carbonizing citric acid with ammonia through a hydrothermal treatment fathizadeh et al 2019 the terminal amine groups of the modified cqds helped form chemical bonds between the polyamide matrix and cqds leading to a more stable dispersion of cqds in the polyamide matrix gai and colleagues functionalized cqds with na and introduced them into the polyamide layer on hollow fiber supports pure water permeance pwp of the membranes increased from 1 74 to 4 27 lmh bar and the salt rejection was well maintained at 98 6 gai et al 2019 asempour et al mixed another safe and biodegradable material cellulose nanocrystals into the polyamide active layers asempour et al 2018a their tfn membranes comprising nanocrystals in the range of 0 05 0 1 w v showed a doubled permeate flux with only a slight decrease in salt rejection in desalination experiments when using 300 ppm bsa as a representative foulant the tfn membranes exhibited a smaller water flux reduction of 11 than the pristine ones in filtration tests 2 2 incorporation of porous nps research on porous nanomaterials has blossomed for preparing next generation ultrahigh permeable membranes the rigid and engineered pore structure of nps with molecular sieving characteristics could impart a preferential flow path for water molecules through their internal pore structure stevens et al 2017 thereby with the aid of these nps the tfn membranes may be in a favorable position to outperform the conventional tfc ro membranes besides offering pores that can accommodate water molecules the hydrophilicity and charge properties of these nps could also result in greater affinity with water and increase in ion repulsion due to coulombic effects stevens et al 2017 table 2 summarizes recent advances in tfn ro membranes with these porous nps 2 2 1 mesoporous silica nps unlike amorphous silica nps ordered mesoporous silica nps possess an ordered internal structure tunable size and controllable morphology bao et al 2013 li et al 2016 liu et al 2016 yin et al 2012 bao and colleagues synthesized monodispersed spherical mesoporous nanosilica with an average particle size of 164 nm and pore size of 2 47 nm and then dispersed them in the organic phase before interfacial polymerization bao et al 2013 the surface hydrophilicity of the tfn ro membranes was remarkably promoted with a water contact angle decreasing from 81 to 47 thus the water flux increased from 19 lmh without nanosilica to 53 lmh with the addition of 0 1 wt v mesoporous nanosilica whereas all solute rejection rates were still higher than 96 yin et al compared the performance of tfn membranes containing non porous silica nps with mesoporous mcm 41 nps yin et al 2012 both nps had particle sizes of around 100 nm as shown in fig 5 a and b both tfn membranes showed that water flux rose with an increase in particle loading but the former rose much slower than the latter as illustrated in fig 5c the tfn membrane embedded with non porous silica nps had a 25 6 increase in flux from 28 5 to 35 8 lmh when the silica np concentration increased from zero to 0 1 wt while the tfn membranes consisting of mcm 41 showed a 63 5 flux jump from 28 5 to 46 6 lmh since tfn membranes with non porous silica nps and mcm 41 had similar chemical properties loading and hydrophilicity the difference in their flux increments suggested that a shorter flow path through the hydrophilic porous structure of mcm 41 nps played a positive role in promoting the water permeation by excluding the effects of the size and concentration of nps their work studied the roles of porosity more deeply from their results it appears that porous nps have a higher chance to break the trade off relationship between water permeability and selectivity due to their additional water channels and molecular sieving functions in order to determine if one should disperse nps in either the oil or aqueous phase liu et al synthesized monodispersed spherical mcm 48 nps with a 3d cubic mesostructure and then dispersed them in the aqueous mpd or organic tmc phase to prepare tfn membranes liu et al 2016 fig 6 compares their ro performance when mcm 48 nps were dispersed in the organic phase the resultant membranes had a lower ratio of flux enhancement from 24 to 40 lmh but their salt rejections were all above 95 fig 6a on the contrary when mcm 48 nps were dispersed in the aqueous phase the water flux could reach 68 lmh but the salt rejection declined severely from 97 to 80 fig 6b the differences could arise from the large pore size observed on both sides of the isolated polyamide layer in other words dispersing mcm 48 in the aqueous solution decreased the degree of cross linking substantially leading to form a loose polyamide layer with carboxylic groups and defects exposed on the surface their work really provided useful insights to understand the differences between dissolving nps in the aqueous or the oil phase before the interfacial polymerization although the observation may differ for other kinds of nps with distinct particle size surface chemistry hydrophilicity and pore structure 2 2 2 cnts tnts and hnts recently carbon nanotubes cnts have caught attention by many researchers because of the similarity in water transport channels between cnts and biological membranes farahbakhsh et al 2017 kim et al 2014a b lee et al 2014 park et al 2010 vatanpour et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 cnts have exceptional fluid transport properties due to their remarkably smooth inner walls molecular dynamic simulation indicated that membranes containing cnts with a proper diameter could be highly efficient for rejecting ions while allowing water transport lee et al 2014 however for tfn membranes incorporated with nanotubes an ordered alignment of these nanotubes i e vertically aligned within the polyamide matrix which should impart the membranes with the best separation performance is so far hardly achieved lee et al successfully prepared hydrophilic cnts by wrapping the walls of cap opened cnts via a bio inspired surface modification using dopamine solutions fig 7 followed by embedding them into the polyamide layer during interfacial polymerization lee et al 2014 the resultant tfn membranes showed much a higher water permeance i e from 2 50 to 3 31 lmh bar without deteriorating the selectivity i e salt rejection from 98 7 to 98 5 on the contrary tfns embedded with unmodified cnts did not show any flux improvement but lowered the salt rejection as the cnts were not well dispersed and less cap opened zhao et al found that the introduction of carboxyl functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts into the polyamide structure could also result in tfn membranes with improved antifouling property and chlorine resistance zhao et al 2014 in comparison to the pristine tfc membrane the tfn membrane comprising 0 1 wt functionalized mwcnts always showed a lower degree of flux decline in different filtration cycles using feed solutions containing bsa or ca hco3 2 the authors attributed the better antifouling property to the greater surface hydrophilicity as well as more negative surface charges upon the introduction of mwcnts in addition this tfn membrane exhibited better chlorine resistance when being evaluated under both dynamic and immersion modes owing to the protection of amide linkages by electron rich mwcnts similar results were also reported by park et al using tfn membranes incorporated with mwcnts the authors explained that the stronger interaction between the carboxylic groups of mwcnts and the amide bonds in the polyamide layer was the main reason for better membrane stability against chlorine park et al 2010 titanate nanotubes tnts and halloysite nanotubes hnts have also been explored as nanofillers due to their additional water transport channels enhanced hydrophilic properties good stability and large pore volumes asempour et al 2018b emadzadeh et al 2015 ghanbari et al 2015 emadzadeh et al produced amino functionalized tnts nh2 tnts and fabricated tfn membranes by embedding nh2 tnts into the polyamide layers emadzadeh et al 2015 results showed that the tfn membrane with an optimum loading of 0 05 w v exhibited a water flux 93 higher than the control without compromising the rejection additionally it mitigated the bsa fouling and achieved a promising flux recovery rate after a simple rinsing process ghanbari et al prepared hnt incorporated tfn membranes and found that with a loading of 0 05 w v hnts the membrane exhibited a water flux as high as 36 lmh at 15 bar and maintained a nacl rejection of 95 6 ghanbari et al 2015 asempour s group equipped the exterior surfaces of hnts with different functional groups amine groups hnt nh2 carboxylic acid hnt cooh and the first generation of dendrimer pamam dendrimer hnt g1 and then embedded them into polyamide layers by in situ interfacial polymerization ghanbari et al 2015 these three kinds of hnts were intended to address the issue of low compatibility and weak adhesion between hnts and the polyamide matrix compared to the reference tfc membranes a maximum increment of nearly 100 in water flux from 26 2 to 49 6 lmh was observed for hnt cooh based tfn membranes with a salt rejection of 99 1 by using a leaching test in a batch incubator followed by their tracing using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms it was proved that the tfn membranes comprising hnt nh2 and hnt g1exhibited significantly lower nanoparticle leaching rates due to the formation of covalent bonds between the amine groups of hnt nh2 and hnt g1 with the acyl chloride groups of tmc monomers 2 2 3 go and graphitic carbon nitride gcn nanosheets graphene oxide go is a derivative of graphene with abundant surface functional groups extremely high specific surface area extraordinary mechanical and thermal properties ali et al 2016 shen et al 2016 zhang and chung 2017 it can accelerate water transport by creating water channels between the go interlayers where water molecules are initially adsorbed by the hydrophilic oxygen containing groups and then diffuse rapidly between the hydrophobic carbon sheets in addition unlike silver nps go nanosheets are non depleting nanomaterials that inactivate bacteria by direct contact shen et al 2016 however because of their relatively large lateral size it is usually challenging to form a tfn layer consisting of go ali et al 2016 for example yin s lab embedded go with sizes ranging from 500 nm to several micrometer into the polyamide layers notwithstanding that the water permeance increased from 1 88 to 2 87 lmh bar the rejection towards nacl was also sacrificed from 95 7 to 93 8 yin et al 2016 this obstacle could be circumvented by incorporating much smaller go nanosheets 70 140 nm chae et al 2015 the unmodified polyamide layer with a more compact structure also helped to maintain the salt rejection at 99 4 the water permeability and anti biofouling property of the resultant go tfn membranes were promoted by approximately 80 and 98 based on the biovolume changes respectively compared with conventional tfc membranes the enhanced performance of go tfc membranes was ascribed to the changes of hydrophilicity surface charge surface roughness and polyamide layer thickness due to the go incorporation notably a high salt rejection was retained even at 48 000 ppm h chlorination by a sodium hypochlorite solution since the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the amide groups of the polyamide and the functional groups of go can protect the amide bonds from being attacked by chlorine both go size and concentration were the key factors to improve the performance of go tfn membranes in recent years ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride gcn nanosheets are in the spotlight for the fabrication of high performance water selective membranes due to their two dimensional graphene like structure regularly distributed triangular nanoscale pores of 3 11 å and structural defects on the laminar network fig 8 a liu et al 2018 however the poor dispersion of gcn dramatically impedes its application in tfn membranes one must tailor gcn with desirable functional groups gao et al synthesized the acidified graphitic carbon nitride acn with a smaller size and a higher solubility in water than gcn gao et al 2017 both acn and gcn nanosheets were entrapped into the polyamide layers by interfacial polymerization results in fig 8b and c revealed that the acn embedded tfn membranes possessed superior ro performance as they exhibited a 79 3 increase in water permeance from 1 57 to 2 81 lmh bar accompanied by a quite satisfactory nacl rejection of 98 6 moreover the addition of acn led to a superior antifouling capacity against protein bsa and natural organic foulants i e humic acid 2 2 4 zeolites zeolites are microporous aluminosilicate materials which can act as molecular sieves the uniform and well defined pore structure of zeolites can be customized to facilitate the size selective separation of molecules in addition zeolites are chemically and thermally stable which endow them for membrane applications like nanofiltration pervaporation gas separation and ro fathizadeh et al 2011 koros and zhang 2017 kosinov et al 2016 lind et al 2010 ma et al 2012 ong et al 2016 safarpour et al 2017 the a type zeolites in the sodium form naa have pore diameters of approximately 4 2 å that is between the diameter of water molecules 2 7 å and the diameters of hydrated sodium and chloride ions 8 9 å huang et al 2013a therefore these nps could provide preferential flow paths for water molecules but reject the hydrated salt ions by their pores therefore they have a lower transport resistance compared to those highly cross linked and nonporous polyamide layer in addition naa zeolites are rich in hydroxyl groups which could play an important role in making them more compatible with the polyamide matrix resulting in fewer voids the effects of particle size and mobile cation on naa nanocrystals were studied by lind et al lind et al 2009a b they observed that nanoparticle size may be considered as an additional degree of freedom in designing tfn ro membranes and the mobile cation could play an important role in determining the water permeance and salt rejection they suggested that zeolites might alter the polyamide film structure as a result of 1 the interaction between zeolites and monomers and or 2 the heat of hydration of the zeolite crystals smaller zeolites 100 nm produced a greater water flux due to larger characteristic pores while larger zeolite particles 300 nm exhibited more favorable surface properties by increasing the negative charge and lowering the contact angle owing to their exposure at the polyamide surface although naa zeolites may perform better than other nps in the polyamide layer to meet the harsh rejection requirements in ro processes they will undergo a de alumination reaction in an acidic feed solution due to the existence of alkaline al in the crystals additionally upon contact of multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 na inside naa will be exchanged with these multivalent cations possibly deteriorating the separation performance of the ro membranes huang et al overcame the drawbacks of naa zeolites by replacing them with another kind of chemically stable silicalite 1 nanozeolites huang et al 2013b silicalite 1 zeolites possess not only a medium pore size of 5 6 å but also rich hydroxyl groups on the surfaces in addition they are alumina free without counter ions and therefore are non susceptible to acid and multivalent ions ro tests showed that the silicalite incorporated tfn had a higher water permeability and improved tolerance to acid and multivalent cation cacl2 fig 9 another type of hydrophilic zeolite is zeolite nay with a pore size of 7 4 å which can create water paths larger than zeolite a in salt separation from water dong et al 2015 tem cross section images of the tfn layers confirmed the existence of zeolite nps in the dense nodular polyamide on the psf substrate rather than in the loose polyamide or on the surface under the optimum interfacial polymerization condition with the optimum zeolite loading of 0 15 wt the water flux increased from 2 56 to 4 79 lmh bar while providing a high salt rejection of 98 8 2 2 5 mofs metal organic frameworks mofs consisting of inorganic metal centers or clusters connected by organic linkers are a novel class of hybrid materials because they form flexible frameworks with one two and three dimensional porous structure li et al 2017b mofs are promising porous fillers due to their high surface area and porosity adjustable pore size and controllable surface functionality in particular the incorporation of mofs in polyamide layers provides unique advantages as 1 the pore structure and pore size of mofs can be tailored by simply changing the precursor metal salts and organic ligands and 2 mofs generally have better compatibility with polymeric materials since the organic linkers in mofs have stronger interactions with polymer chains li et al 2017b zhu et al 2017 zeolitic imidazolate frameworks zifs as a subclass of mofs built with tetrahedral metal ions and imidazole based organic linkers offer permanent porosity high mechanical strength and good chemical stability duan et al 2015 zifs have drawn intensive attention due to their high water permeability large specific surface area narrow pore aperture and good stability in water duan et al applied zif 8 as nanofillers in tfn membranes and increased the water permeance to 3 35 lmh bar which was 162 higher than the bare polyamide layer duan et al 2015 they attributed this improvement to faster water permeation in relatively more hydrophobic pores which had lower affinity toward water molecules aljundi found that the incorporation of 0 4 wt zif 8 in the polyamide layer could promote the surface hydrophilicity i e water contact angle dropped from 62 8 to 33 2 and water permeance without jeopardizing the selectivity in addition the modified membranes could remarkably reduce the bsa fouling by more than 75 aljundi 2017 the enhanced fouling resistance was attributed to the weak interaction between the surface and foulants lee et al first investigated the effects of zif 8 particle size on separation performance of tfn membranes lee et al 2019 different particle sizes 60 150 and 250 nm of zif 8 nps were synthesized and dispersed in aqueous solutions then deposited on the psf support prior to interfacial polymerization they found that zif 8 size affected surface coverage and external surface area per single particle the tfn membrane incorporated with zif 8 with an average size of 150 nm had the highest water permeance of 3 95 lmh bar and nacl rejection of 99 2 compared to the pristine tfc membrane and other tfn membranes consisting of other zif 8 sizes recently uio 66 formed by the central zr iv ions and terephthalic acid ligands with an intrinsic pore size of 6 1 å has been investigated as a nanofiller in tfn membranes for nanofiltration forward osmosis and ro due to its higher stability in water he et al 2017 liu et al 2019 ma et al 2017 at an optimal blending concentration of 0 05 w v in the oil phase the uio 66 tfn membrane showed an increase of 50 in water flux and a marginal increase in rejection compared with the benchmark tfc membrane liu et al 2019 for seawater desalination via ro the modified membrane exhibited an enhanced water flux of 61 32 lmh and rejection of 99 27 meanwhile the uio 66 blended tfn membrane promoted the boron rejection by 11 compared to the benchmark membrane 82 3 this might arise from the fact that the interaction between uio 66 and boric acid was chemisorption because uio 66 had a greater adsorption capacity than many conventional adsorbents in addition the partial blockage by adsorbed boron would reduce the effective pore size thus the subsequent boron diffusion across the blocked uio 66 nanochannels could be hindered fig 10 it is foreseeable that in the future more intensive research efforts will be given to mof incorporated tfn membranes as mofs are emerging nanomaterials with many potentials in view of the fact that mofs consist of both an organic part to provide a higher compatibility with the polyamide matrix and an inorganic part to upgrade the membrane performance novel mof embedded tfn membranes will likely be developed for commercial scale utilization comparing to other tfns they may outperform the current commercial ro membranes with higher water permeability and comparable salt rejection due to the molecular sieving functions of mofs 2 3 bio inspired tfn membranes in recent years researchers are devoted to mimicking the natural water channels from diverse chemical heterogeneities that govern intramolecular and intermolecular interactions the most popular one is the family of water channel proteins aquaporins aqps existing in the cells of many living organisms the proteins have an hourglass shape water channel with a narrow canal of 2 8 å just enough to transport a single water molecule kozono et al 2002 pohl et al 2001 water transports through this waterway by the osmotic pressure gradient kumar et al measured the water permeability of proteoliposomes containing aqps and postulated that aqp based ro membranes may possibly achieve a permeance as high as 601 lmh bar which is about two orders of magnitude than commercially available seawater ro membranes kumar et al 2007 since then a remarkable research interest has been made to incorporate this protein in membranes for water reuse and desalination fuwad et al 2019a b sun et al 2013 tang et al 2013 2015 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2012 however huge potentials are accompanied by more challenges such as the compatibility stability and cost of the membranes so far commercially available aqp based ro membranes are in the form of polyamide aqp composite membranes qi et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 similar to the aforementioned tfn membranes a microporous substrate was first soaked in an aqueous solution of mpd which contained a given amount of aqp then the substrates was exposed to a tmc solution and formed a polyamide rejection layer embedded with aqps the resultant membrane showed a permeance of 4 0 lmh bar 40 higher than a commercial brackish water ro membrane i e bw30 while maintaining a similar or better nacl rejection zhao et al 2012 the stability of aqp based membranes such as the tolerance to common chemical cleaning agents ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid sodium hydroxide and citric acid the sensitivity to temperature and applied pressure and the long term ro performance 100 day operation with a real ro feed were evaluated qi et al 2016 results revealed that the membranes were sensitive to changes of temperature and applied pressure but they showed good chemical stability against cleaning agents however fouling was observed in the continuous process which is a major issue for biomimetic ro membranes in addition poor performance of aqp based membranes has been reported possibly due to aging protein denature and short shelf life sahebi et al 2019 the performance stability of aqp based membranes in a wide range of operation conditions is worthy of further study in addition a synthetic approach to produce and purify aqps in large quantities and the techniques to produce mechanically robust and defect free membranes in large scales are under demand to lower the overall material and manufacture costs 3 outlook and future works while the incorporation of nps into conventional tfc membranes opens a new chapter for novel ro membranes limitations and challenges are also encountered regrading to their scalability reliability cost regenerability and safety especially for industrialized utilizations firstly since the discovery of nanomaterials a great variety of nanomaterials have been reported nevertheless only a small portion of them have been evaluated for the fabrication of tfn ro membranes therefore the fundamental science on how to select proper nanomaterials to meet the screen requirements and to demonstrate their full potential is the critical step in order to quest for the fabrication of defect free np incorporated polyamide layers one must consider their stability in water particle size pore structure charge properties solubility in water non polar solvents and chemical interaction with the polyamide layer meanwhile precise synthesis scalable and cost efficient fabrication of nps are essential to bring them for commercial applications protocols to position nps at the exact places in the polyamide layer are critical to design tfn ro membranes with desirable performance since the intrinsic physicochemical properties of nanomaterials are quite different from one another researchers must overcome the challenges and have breakthroughs on how to fabricate tfn ro membranes with ideal morphology and defect free tfn layers one key challenge is the np agglomeration in the water or oil phase during the preparation of mpd or tmc solutions the np agglomeration may stay in the polyamide layers and possibly generate deformities within the membrane structure thus in depth knowledge and surface modifications to disperse a variety of nps in the oil or aqueous phase homogeneously must be developed prior to producing the polyamide layer with minimal defects another example is the use of nanotubes such as cnts tnts and hnts ideally they could provide preferential paths for water molecules leading to an increase in water flux however large scale fabrication of tfn membranes with nanotubes vertically aligned across the polyamide layer i e the shortest path for water transport has not been achieved so far in addition the length of nanotubes might be larger than the thickness of polyamide layers as a result they can only be fully accommodated in the polyamide layers if they are horizontally or crookedly oriented both the stack agglomeration and unordered alignment of nanomaterials would inevitably contribute to longer paths and higher resistance for water transport across the selectivity layers owing to their nano sizes leaching nps from tfn ro membranes into the retentate and permeate streams is inevitable that has raised concerns about their environmental and health implications however the leaching rate of nps the risk of these nanomaterials to human being and the correlation between their toxicity and exposure remain difficult to be quantified for water treatment applications future research should not ignore them on the other hand membrane scientists must find ways to strongly anchor nps in the polyamide layer via easy and practical chemical bonding such as chemical reaction between nh2 from nanomaterials and cocl from tmc so that the robust tfn ro membranes have a long lifespan asempour et al 2018b wu et al 2013 in addition up to now most tfn membranes are still in the research stage in order to successfully adopt novel tfn technologies in the current ro membrane manufacture several factors must be investigated firstly it should be noted that the performances of the control membranes in some literatures are much poorer than the state of the art commercial ro membranes although the incorporation of nanomaterials helps improve the separation performance compared to such low performance control membranes whether it can truly improve the performance of commercial ro membranes is questionable and needs further investigation similarly most novel tfn ro membranes were evaluated only using highly idealized feed solutions for a short duration as these membranes aim to commercialize in the real world it is crucial for academic scientists to examine their newly developed membranes from an industrial perspective in other words their membranes must be tested not only using real brackish water bw but also real seawater sw under industrial testing protocols for bwro and swro a long term evaluation protocol must be considered to investigate the possible drop in performance cleaning and maintenance furthermore the economic benefits of using nanomaterials in ro membranes must outweigh the costs of development and production to both manufacturers and customers the additional cost includes 1 r d to establish both baseline and long term performance advantages and 2 the modified production process to produce the new membranes stevens et al 2017 to cut the cost process engineering innovation is important so that the tfn technologies can be fitted into the current ro membrane manufacturing and achieve a cost effective controllable and scalable process another cost is the bulky synthesis of nanomaterials a new process must be developed to utilize the nanomaterials more efficiently hence before commercialization it is critical to systematically analyze the above factors to determine whether the new developed tfn ro membrane is cost saving last but not the least ideally to replace the current tfc ro membranes the newly invented tfn ro membranes need not only possess an enhanced water permeability but also better resistance to chlorine and foulants long term performance studies of the newly developed ro membranes in a wide range of operation window are indispensable to confirm their robustness and to find the best conditions in order to maximize their separation performance and lifespan 4 conclusions the separation technologies based on tfc ro membranes will likely continuously dominate water reuse and seawater desalination in the foreseeable future the advent of nanomaterials has heralded a new chapter in ro technologies by proving a broad range of unprecedented opportunities in this review we have summarized the recent progresses in the field of tfn ro membranes although the research on tfn membranes is in its earliest stage the potential of using tfn membranes for modern water reuse and desalination is vivid due to their unique and multi functional properties despite of the recent progresses we have highlighted the future research focus in order to bring tfn ro membranes as the next generation ro membranes with improved safety and resiliency of water supply in this article first more fundamental researches and in depth studies on nanomaterial properties i e optimization of size shape pore structure surface chemistry and charge hydrophilicity synthesis cost and compatibility with the polyamide matrix their membrane formation anti fouling mechanism boron rejection performance chlorine resistance and toxicity are required for better science advancement for industrial deployment systemic analyses should be accomplished on 1 long term processes using real brackish water or seawater and 2 cost saving

18079,a dynamic membrane dm is a layer of particles deposited via permeation drag onto a conventional membrane such that the deposited particles act as a secondary membrane that minimizes fouling of

deposited via permeate drag on a conventional membrane with the deposited particles acting as a secondary membrane ersahin et al 2012 johnson 1972 li et al 2018a tanny 1978 in most cases a cake which is also considered a dm if it is beneficial in improving permeate quality is invariably formed from the rejected constituents of the feed al malack and anderson 1997b based on whether the dm is composed of feed constituents deposited during filtration or intentionally pre deposited particles with desired properties on the primary membrane pm ersahin et al 2012 dms can be divided into two types namely 1 self formed dms whereby the solid particles from wastewater form the dm and aid in improving permeate quality hu et al 2018 and 2 dms formed via deposition of materials such as metallic compounds especially oxides polymers activated carbon soil based compounds and nanoparticles on surfaces of meshes or ultrafiltration uf microfiltration mf nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro membranes pre deposited dm systems have the flexibility of choice of appropriate materials having the relevant properties with which to form the dm also while self formed dms require some time for the permeate quality to stabilize rezvani et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 the desired quality of the permeate can be obtained right away for pre deposited dms thus despite the additional material cost incurred for pre deposited dm systems they afford a greater degree of overall control al malack et al 2004 self formed dms are mostly used in ultrafiltration applications with the majority of self formed dms studied in dynamic membrane bioreactors dmbrs and in some other applications such as protein separation barefoot et al 1993 kuberkar vinod and davis robert 2008 matsuyama et al 1994 meyer et al 2015 nakao et al 1982 zhang et al 2002 two component mixture separation horng et al 2007 2009 hwang and cheng 2003 nakao et al 1982 surface water treatment kim et al 2008 malczewska et al 2015 thomas and mixon 1972 xu et al 2013 and fouling mitigation kim et al 2008 malczewska et al 2015 among others al malack et al 2004 kishihara et al 1989 lu et al 2016 perona et al 1967 in particular for 2 the term dynamic membrane al malack and anderson 1998 chu et al 2012 johnson et al 1972 has been used interchangeably with the term formed in place membrane ersahin et al 2012 szaniawska and spencer 1996 1997 zhang and spencer 1993 with some studies omitting the term dynamic membrane completely cai et al 2008 ding et al 2018 ellerie et al 2013 regardless of dm type the dm either a enhances the performance of the pm b renders the properties of the pm immaterial e g dm on ultrafiltration pms performing reverse osmosis or c protects the pm from fouling previous reviews on dms have either exclusively looked at dmbrs hu et al 2018 focused on a specific application e g municipal wastewater alepu et al 2016 or have given an overview of both categories of dms together namely self formed primarily consisting of dynamic membrane bioreactors dmbrs and pre deposited ersahin et al 2012 li et al 2018a they have examined the overall factors affecting dm formation and performance but a comprehensive discussion of dm material classes their fouling mitigation capabilities and application is lacking this review is focused only on deposition type 2 i e pre deposited dynamic membranes dms whereby the secondary membrane is formed prior to filtration and not permanently adhered or chemically bound bullón et al 2000 latulippe et al 2009 li and garth spencer 1992 to the primary one the scanning electron microscopy sem images of two pre deposited dms are shown in fig 1 note that henceforth in this review the abbreviation dm will refer to pre deposited dms only unless otherwise specified this review summarizes the kinds of materials that have been used to form pre deposited dms see section 2 1 notably out of the eight types of dm materials two types namely metal oxide and metal oxide polymer dominate 47 hence relatively more attention is given to them tanny 1978 categorized dms into three classes namely i ii and iii this classification is applicable to both self formed and pre deposited dms class i is whereby the diameter of the pm pore is lesser than the smallest particles of the dm material examples of which are the dms comprising protein concentrates formed during the ultrafiltration of cheese whey matthews et al 1976 or skim milk pompei et al 1973 the formation generally proceeds via concentration polarization class ii dms are those whereby the diameter of the pm is much larger up to three orders of magnitude than the diameter of the depositing particles examples of which are dust or bacteria in the feed that can bridge pores and create flocculation centers and hydrous zr iv oxide dms formed on porous ceramic tubes grace 1956 johnson 1976 tanny et al 1979 class ii dms form via the mechanisms of pore constriction and cake filtration class iii dms are those whereby the pm pore size is similar to the diameter of the depositing particles examples are anionic or cationic polyelectrolytes dynamically deposited on cellulose acetate ca membranes and polyelectrolytes deposited on already formed class i dms tanny and jagur grodzinski 1973 in such cases the polymer molecule diffuses and resides inside the surface pores of a pm thus altering its flux and rejection properties to form a class iii dm a survey of available literature on dms reveals that class ii dms are popularly used for filtration purposes al malack and anderson 1996b bowen et al 1995 freilich and tanny 1980 murkes 1990 more recently class i dms have been utilized for removal of organics from water cai et al 2013 huang et al 2009 yang et al 2011 the key advantages of dms are i fouling prevention of the pm by adsorbing organics and colloidal particles in the feed ersahin et al 2012 and therefore offering higher flux and lower transmembrane pressures tmps li et al 2018a ii eliminating the need for expensive pms iii easy removal from the pm surface by backwashing zhang et al 2014 or brushing ersahin et al 2012 and re deposition in situ iv high temperature stability groves et al 1983 and v capability to treat a variety of feeds ranging from domestic wastewater al malack and anderson 1996a to high strength industrial effluents groves et al 1983 while advantages i ii and iii have been reported for both pre deposited and self formed dms advantages iv and v have only been reported for the former despite these clear advantages practical implementation remains limited at least in part due to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of dms in terms of operational mechanisms and utilization therefore this review attempts to present the state of the art to date on dm research spanning materials formation and regeneration and applications directions for future research are also proposed 1 1 structure of review this review is divided into 7 sections section 1 introduces dms and discusses their classification and chronological development section 2 gives details of the key categories of dm materials employed and studied to date and some aspects related to the formation of dms on pms also discussed are factors affecting formation of dms methods employed for their regeneration and several modifications to dm systems for improvement in formation and or performance section 3 examines the fouling mitigation abilities of the various dm materials section 4 details the various applications wherein dms have been employed at the end of each sub section in sections 2 4 some future perspectives specific to the content of that sub section are presented additionally the important areas on which future research relating to dm formation fouling mitigation by dms and their applications could focus are summarized at the end of sections 2 3 and 4 respectively section 5 presents technical and economic advantages of dms over conventional methods and some challenges involved in constructing and operating dm systems in section 6 directions for future research to make dms industrially viable and further their understanding are suggested section 7 concludes the review 1 2 brief chronology the first report on dms was in 1966 by the oakridge national laboratory marcinkowsky et al 1966 whereby hydrous zirconium zr iv oxide served as a dm on a ro membrane for salt rejection since then numerous papers on dms have been published as displayed in fig 2 a and fig 2b further shows the break down on the number of popular dms studied the data used to create fig 2a was obtained from scopus after an initial keyword search of dynamic membrane or dynamically formed and membrane or formed in place and membrane and limit to subjarea ceng or limit to subjarea envi yielded about 350 results papers on pre deposited dms were manually sorted from them note that in fig 2b as also in figs 3 4 7 and 11 the number of dm systems i e the number of unique pm dm pairs rather than number of papers are presented because some papers report on several dm materials in each for example since kim et al 2008 investigated heated aluminum oxide particles haops heated iron oxide particles hiops and powdered activated carbon pac dms on a cellulose ester ce pm these are counted as 3 dm systems likewise the same dm material deposited on two different pms is also counted as two dm systems six important observations can be drawn from fig 2b firstly hydrous zr iv oxide membranes were only popular in the decade of discovery i e 1960s since composite hydrous zr iv oxide polymer dms were soon created which exhibited much better salt retention capabilities than the single layered zr iv oxide dms secondly the hydrous zr iv oxide polymer dms mainly used for salt rejection found popularity till the 1990s after which the number of systems studied declined rapidly this could be due to the introduction of cheaper ro membranes into the market which caused dms to be less favored thirdly increasing number of metal oxide e g iron oxide aluminum oxide titanium oxide and powdered activated carbon pac systems were studied from the decades of 1991 2000 and 2001 2010 respectively due to their ability to be used for uf mf which started gaining popularity near the start of the twenty first century for these dms along with removal of impurities from the feed research emphasis was also placed on their anti fouling properties fourthly polymer dms were popular in the 1970s but experienced a dip in popularity thereafter due to the discovery of composite hydrous zr iv oxide polymer dms then gained increased attention near the start of the twenty first century due to greater focus on sugars in solute rejection and industrial effluent treatment fifthly soil based dms like kaolin and diatomite have gained popularity since the 2000s presumably due to their usefulness in water and oily wastewater treatment finally nanoparticle dms are expectedly studied only in the present decade due to the increasing popularity of nanoparticles 2 formation and regeneration 2 1 materials used for dm formation various materials have been studied to form dms in this review dms have been classified into eight categories based on their material namely metal oxides e g hydrous zr iv oxide haops polymers e g polyacrylic acid paa polyvinyl alcohol pva soil based e g kaolin diatomite other metallic e g alcl3 fecl3 caco3 activated carbon e g pac granular activated carbon gac nanoparticles e g carbon nanotubes cnts carbon nanofibers cnfs dual or hybrid e g hydrous zr iv oxide paa haops pac and others e g anion exchange resin ovalbumin note that dual or hybrid dms use a combination of two discrete dm materials as an overview fig 3 displays the number of dm systems studied to date of each dm material type along with the number of dm systems of some key dms for each type metal oxides especially hydrous zr iv oxide the first material to be studied as a dm and dual dms like the combination of hydrous zr iv oxide and polymers have been the most studied materials for the formation of dms this can be attributed to the extensive research on dms to perform ro and organic solute rejection in their early years of inception dual metal oxide polymer dms have also found popularity in industrial effluent treatment the primary membrane for zr iv dms were either porous meshes or mf membranes of various materials like silver carbon stainless steel ceramic cotton acropore and polysulfone dual dms with both layers comprising of polymers like paa polyethyleneimine and paa polystyrene sulfonic acid have also been used marcinkowsky et al 1966 sachs and lonsdale 1971 shor et al 1968b within the last two decades metal oxide particles like mno2 heated iron oxide particles hiops and heated aluminum oxide particles haops have gained popularity in uf mf operations these dms were used for the dual purposes of purification as well as fouling mitigation of the primary membrane a combination of adsorbents namely pac and haops has been employed for achieving a better balance between organic content removal and fouling mitigation cai et al 2008 these dms were formed either by a mixture of the adsorbents or layer by layer of each other composite dms employed include kaolin mno2 dms and yttrium or zr complexes with silicon and al2o3 for oily wastewater treatment the next most popular dm material class is polymers because of the inherent versatility traditionally used for solute rejection applications they have recently gained popularity for treating industrial effluents polyacrylic acid paa and polyvinyl alcohol pva were the most common dm material while the most common pms were cellulose acetate ca and polyethersulfone pes mf uf flat sheet membranes other metallic dms like hydroxides have also been investigated mainly for oily wastewater treatment applications tubular ceramic or polymeric uf mf pms have been most commonly used with these soil based dms mainly kaolin and diatomite have been employed in oily wastewater and water treatment applications these have mostly been used in mf uf systems with polyester membranes ceramic membranes and meshes as pms furthermore nanoparticles especially cnts have been shown to be promising as an emerging dm material dms have been used to perform all four types of filtration mf uf nf and ro while metal oxide and or polyelectrolytes were chosen as dm materials for ro due to their ion exclusion effect sachs and lonsdale 1971 shor et al 1968b the specific choice of zr iv or paa seems to be by trial and error marcinkowsky et al 1966 however research on the interactions between most dms and the components they reject and criteria for identification of appropriate dm classes most suitable for individual applications is still lacking future research on these aspects would help in choosing the most fitting dms for various feeds table 1 presents an overview of all dm materials used in literature along with the pms employed filtration type and applications 2 2 dm formation this section discusses various aspects related to the formation of pre deposited dms the formation of self formed dms especially of those in dmbrs mainly used for municipal waste water treatment proceeds via a different mechanism and is not in the scope of this review the description of which can be found elsewhere alepu et al 2016 ersahin et al 2012 hu et al 2018 2 2 1 formation mechanism dm deposition is typically performed in the two key operation modes namely dead end and cross flow fig 4a shows the breakdown of number of dm systems in each configuration per dm material category clearly the cross flow mode is dominant presumably due to the associated lower tmps the typical experimental setup used for the formation of a dm in the more popular cross flow mode is schematically illustrated in fig 4b all research exploring dm formation filtration in tubular modules has only focused on single channel modules however to be relevant commercially studies focused on the hydrodynamics and design aspects of dm formation and performance in multi tube modules are imperative the process of formation of all the types of dms mentioned in section 2 1 is essentially the same a solution or suspension containing the dm material is circulated for a cross flow configuration or filtered for a dead end configuration through the membrane cell at a desired flow rate for a desired period of time certain dm materials such as pac were used as obtained from vendors cai et al 2008 thiruvenkatachari et al 2006 while others e g zr iv oxide shor et al 1968b mno2 al malack and anderson 1996b were synthesized for the dual dms the second dm material e g paa polymer was deposited by circulating the specific feed solution for a specific amount of time over the initially formed dm e g hydrous zr iv oxide on the primary membrane as mentioned in section 1 class ii dms i e the diameter of the depositing particles is much smaller than the pm pore size are the most widely employed among the three classes the various stages of dm formation have been observed by various authors by tracking the permeation rate and the total permeate volume as a function of time during the initial stages of membrane formation pore clogging was observed thereby reducing the paths through which the permeate can flow the pore blocking mechanism can be described by freilich and tanny 1978a 1 k t 2 t v t 1 j 0 where k is the blocking constant t is the time elapsed v t is the volume per unit area of the membrane filtered at time t and j 0 is the flux after the pm pores have been sufficiently clogged the dm formation proceeds via the thickening of the cake layer in this case the particle diameter becomes greater than the pore diameter and the cake layer increases in thickness due to the deposition of a fraction or all of the dm material in the suspension freilich and tanny 1978a determined that dm formation in this second stage proceeds via 2 t v 1 k v 2 v f where v f is the volume of permeate that must pass through the primary membrane to create a dm with resistance equal to that of the primary membrane and k is a constant related to the cake resistance thus class ii dm formation mechanism can be summarized as two key steps 1 when a dm material suspension like zr iv oxide colloidal suspension is introduced over a porous support such as a stainless steel mesh or a uf membrane the particles are first deposited onto the walls of the pores of the pm which causes the pores to block i e pore blocking or pore bridging and 2 a continuing supply of the colloidal particles then results in the deposition of a cake layer on the pore blocked pm to form a dm class iii dms are formed when a second material usually a polyelectrolyte is added after a class ii dm has already been formed on the pm altman et al 1999 tanny and johnson james 1978 when a polyelectrolyte e g paa is introduced over the already formed class ii dm e g hydrous zr iv oxide at low ph the paa molecules are just the right size to penetrate into the pores of the zr iv dm instead of forming a gel layer on the surface causing the polyelectrolyte molecules to enter the surface pores of the class ii dm by a purely diffusional process tanny 1978 on raising the ph they ionize and expand thus getting immobilized on the surface of the dm and blocking them this leads to the formation of a dual dm with the class iii polyelectrolyte dm formed in the already pre deposited class ii zr iv dm resulting in increased salt rejection capabilities at the cost of a reduced permeate flux altman et al 1999 tanny and johnson james 1978 class i dms are formed when the pores of the pm are small enough to completely retain the particles of the dm material concentration polarization is the mechanism that governs their formation tanny 1978 specifically a boundary layer of a particular thickness is created as more and more of the particles are accumulated at the pm interface the concentration of the dm material within the boundary layer depends on the balance between convective flow and back diffusion due to the permeate flux the concentration at the pm surface goes on increasing until it reaches gel concentration this gel layer which is the dm continues to grow till either its resistance becomes too large for permeation or the dm material in the circulation tank is completely deposited there is only one study pan et al 2015 exploring the mechanism of deposition of class i dms at the particle level the three primary criteria for a particle to deposit on the surface of a tubular pm in cross flow mode are i net radial force ii net axial moment and iii net circumferential moment the first two criteria are more dominant than the third with the former being the most dominant at lower flux values and the latter at higher flux values class i dms are gaining popularity in recent times and more research on their formation mechanisms is warranted in the future understanding quantitatively how class i dms form would help in optimizing their formation 2 2 2 dm resistance in the case of class ii dms blocking of the pores of the pm by the dm material would increase filtration resistance significantly with the overall resistance of the pm dm potentially much larger than that of the pm alone this has been observed by several authors using hydrous zr iv oxide kuppers et al 1967 and hydrous zr iv oxide paa dms whereby the resistance increased by three akamatsu et al 2011 johnson et al 1972 to four times akamatsu et al 2011 after dm deposition and mno2 dms whereby the resistance increased by up to six times al malack and anderson 1997c nonetheless the class ii dms performing ro could still be operated at fluxes of above 100 lmh lonsdale 1973 while those performing uf could yield constant permeate fluxes of 50 75 lmh al malack and anderson 1997c kuppers et al 1967 for much longer periods of time than the bare uf membranes due to fouling mitigation al malack and anderson 1997c hence even though the resistance of the systems increased dramatically after dm deposition the permeate flux was shown to be sufficient by typical industry standards najafpour et al 2007 in the case of class i dms the resistance was not as severely affected during dm formation as that in class ii dm systems owing to the larger diameter of the dm material particles notably the resistance of the bare membrane was observed to increase rapidly during filtration due to severe fouling which was effectively mitigated by the dm cai and benjamin 2011 cai et al 2013 in such cases the benefits of a dm far outweigh the small increase in overall resistance it causes 2 2 3 dm stability the dm is held in place on the pm by permeate drag towards the membrane along with several physical interactions like electrostatic forces and the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of both membranes al malack and anderson 1997a the stability of the dm dictates whether the same dm needs be reused after cleaning or whether a fresh dm would be deposited after the preceding one becomes saturated see section 2 4 stability is more important in the former case as the dm would have to withstand a cleaning cycle the stability of nanoparticle dms intended to be used for several filtration cleaning cycles is vital considering the health and safety hazards upon exposure li and huang 2010 there has been some success in developing stable cnt dms on the inner surfaces of hollow fiber pms gallagher et al 2013 but adhesion of cnts to flat sheet uf pms was in general not stable de lannoy et al 2012 dumée et al 2010 multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts in general and larger 50 80 nm mwcnts in particular were found to form the most stable dms and were the most resistant to backwashing ajmani et al 2012 modification of mwcnts by cooh groups yielded less stable dms than that from the unmodified ones however the former gave better anti fouling performance than the latter other nanoparticle dms such as nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi could be more successfully adhered to flat sheet dms especially via pre treatment with ethanol which decreased aggregation amongst particles ma et al 2015 2017 even so a small amount of dm particles still detached during backwash hence future research is necessary to develop anti fouling nanoparticle dms that strongly adhere to flat sheet pms as regards other dms dual zr polymer dms have been reported to be stable for up to three months and could be used without reduction in performance as long as they were stored under water johnson et al 1972 wilde et al 1988 these dms must not be allowed to dry otherwise the deposited layer has been observed to peel off johnson et al 1972 nakao et al 1986 wilde et al 1988 most recent class i metal oxide dms are designed to be used only for a single run and no stability issue during the filtration run has been reported whether deposited on flat sheet or tubular dms 2 2 4 dm characterization techniques scanning electron microscopy sem is by far the most popular technique for characterizing dms for almost a decade since their inception in the late 1960s dms were evaluated only on the basis of their salt rejection capabilities igawa et al 1977 were the first to capture sem images of the al iii paa dms since then sem images have been commonly presented for all types of dms to observe their formation both on the surface and within the pores of pms sem images allow for analysis of deposition uniformity and thickness and also identification of fouling patterns kim et al 2008 as well as tolerance to backwashing ajmani et al 2012 gallagher et al 2013 image analysis software such as imagej has also been used in conjunction with sem to determine the pore size distribution of the deposited dm ajmani et al 2012 2014 the atomic force microscopy afm is popular for characterizing the surface of dms specifically surface roughness ba et al 2010 bai et al 2015 deng et al 2008 kwon et al 2009 and surface pore size distribution deng et al 2008 which provides an indication of the antifouling capabilities of a dm bai et al 2015 deng et al 2008 techniques to determine the surface chemical composition of dms include fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ba et al 2010 bai et al 2015 deng et al 2008 igawa et al 1977 zhang and zhao 2017 and x ray spectroscopy bai et al 2015 zhang and zhao 2017 2 3 factors affecting dm formation 2 3 1 dm material 2 3 1 1 effect of dm material concentration the concentration of dm material in the feed stream played an important role in dm formation a higher dm material concentration was observed to lead to a thicker dm layer cai et al 2000 pan et al 2015 however pan et al 2015 reported that with increasing dm material concentration the uniformity of the dm thickness decreased with increasing dm material concentration a greater dm mass was expectedly obtained zhao et al 2006 and the dm formed more quickly noor et al 2002 however increasing the dm concentration led to a dm with greater resistance al malack and anderson 1997b ma et al 2015 and a sharp decline in permeate cai et al 2000 but an increase in stability al malack and anderson 1997b in the case of dual or hybrid dms the changes in concentration of the material of the second layer has been shown to not affect permeation flux during its formation for the metal oxide polymer dms tanny and johnson james 1978 moreover it has also been observed that the presence of an additional polymer improved the overall structural integrity of a dm tanny and johnson james 1978 2 3 1 2 effect of dm material size regarding particle sizes the particle size distribution psd of a dm was narrower and the average diameter lesser than those of the feed stream wu et al 2017 the average particle diameter of the particles deposited as the dm was lesser than that in the feed suspension since smaller particles had a greater tendency to deposit on the membrane regarding the effect of particle diameter of the feed constituents smaller particle diameters have been tied to greater dm resistance ajmani et al 2012 zhao et al 2005b leading to lower permeate flux yang et al 2011 zhao et al 2005b and mechanically stronger dms nakao et al 1986 with respect to the effect of permeation on psd as the permeate flux through the dm increased the psd of the dm narrowed holdich and boston 1990 2 3 1 3 summary in summary larger concentrations and smaller particle diameters of the dm material led to thicker but non uniform and mechanically stronger dms at the cost of increased resistance hence a balance between the quality of the dm formed and the desirable quantity of permeate flux needs to be maintained when operating dm filtration the effects of other physico chemical properties of dm materials on their formation have been scarcely reported with only one study reporting that the formation time of a dm increased as the hydrophobicity of the dm material increased al malack and anderson 1998 the interaction of the dm material with the feed solvent and the pm especially in the case of dual polymeric dms also plays an important role in dm formation especially if the two layers of the dm do not have chemical affinity towards each other and interact unstably ozari et al 1977 more research concerning these effects is necessary 2 3 2 structure of pm 2 3 2 1 effect of pm pore size and tube diameter pore diameter has been reported to be the most important property of the pm affecting formation of dms johnson et al 1968 dms formed more easily johnson et al 1972 and quickly altman et al 1999 cai et al 2000 rumyantsev et al 2000 and also gave better performance in terms of solute rejection altman et al 1999 igawa et al 1978 on pms with smaller pores pore diameters for the formation of class ii dms typically ranged from a few tenths of a micron to a few microns el nashar 1977 johnson et al 1968 the influence of pm pore diameter on dm thickness is not yet clearly understood with contradictory reports of dm thickness increasing altman et al 1999 or varying non monotonically freilich and tanny 1978b with decreasing pm pore diameter what is however known is pore diameter variability in pms always affects flux adversely freilich and tanny 1978b wilde et al 1988 ultimately affecting dm thickness even a small proportion of pores larger than the mean diameter have been observed to affect dm formation and performance negatively johnson et al 1968 in case of tubular pms the inner diameter of the tube also affected dm formation with increasing inner diameter making dm formation more and more difficult dahlheimer et al 1970 2 3 2 2 effect of pm strength and texture the physical properties of the primary membrane also affected the formation of dm as evident from two observations relating to the texture and strength of pms i xu et al 2013 reported that the formation time for a polyaluminum chloride dm on a non woven fabric filter was less than that on a dacron polyester mesh because the latter was slippery i e less resistance to particle interception and thereby the dm particles took more time to lodge into the mesh pores and ii diaper et al 1996 used five different pms namely carbon tube carbosep stainless steel mesh coated with ceramic ceramesh polyurethane coated with polyester weave primapor multifilament weave and polymer unspecified to form a hydrous zr iv oxide paa dm for ro and found that the woven pms like multifilament weave and primapor formed unstable dms due to distortion of fibers by the high pressure during formation and subsequent enlargement of pores while the non woven pms like carbosep ceramesh and polymer formed stable dms however it has also been observed that the properties of the pm do not affect dm performance significantly holdich and boston 1990 2 3 2 3 summary in summary a pm with smaller pores and rougher surface favored better class ii dm formation however this conclusion is based largely on zr iv polymer dms which have mostly been investigated for ro and effect of pm structure has not been explored for other dm materials since the particles forming class i dms are much larger than the pm pores pm pore size is not expected to have a significant effect on class i dm formation however pm surface roughness and strength may still have a considerable impact these effects have still not been investigated in the more recent publications employing class i dms for uf and mf applications such studies would be useful in the selection of the most compatible pm dm pairs for these operations 2 3 3 ph 2 3 3 1 effect of ph on dual dms whereas single layered dms can be deposited at a range of ph values with accordingly varying properties the formation of dual dms has been observed to be critically dependent on ph as the deposition of paa onto the zr iv dm involved changes in the paa molecules that were important for the paa to attach to zr iv after the deposition of the zr iv dm the ph was reduced to 2 so that the paa chains were coiled and able to penetrate into the pores of the zr iv layer altman et al 1999 the incremental increase of ph to neutrality after specific durations of time johnson et al 1972 caused the coiled paa molecules to ionize and expand into the pores of the deposited zr iv layer thus forming a dual zr iv paa dm with significantly lower permeability nomura and shoji kimura 1980 and increased salt rejection capabilities wilde et al 1988 2 3 3 2 effect of ph on dm resistance the relationship between the resistance of the formed dm and the ph at which it was formed was different for different dm materials polymer dms have been reported to exhibit contrasting behaviors towards changes in ph for example for paa dms decreasing ph led to a denser dm formation increased resistance since the repulsion between paa molecules decreased and thereby packed more compactly igawa et al 1978 on the other hand for methylcellulose the effect of ph on membrane formation was not pronounced igawa et al 1978 for metal oxide dms in particular hydrous zr iv oxide the dm resistance exhibited a non monotonic relationship with increasing ph namely increased peaked at ph 3 5 and then decreased freilich and tanny 1980 an optimum ph between 3 2 and 3 8 was recommended for such dms the low resistances at a high ph were due to increased particle size whereas the lower resistances at very low ph were attributed to the repulsion of zr particles freilich and tanny 1980 for dual metal oxide polymer dms the flux decreased with increasing ph indicating an increase in resistance which can be explained by the expansion of the paa molecules into the zr pores as mentioned earlier nomura and shoji kimura 1980 2 3 3 3 effect of ph on dm particle size the feed ph has had an important influence on the particle size of the dm with the dm particle size known to increase with increasing ph al malack and anderson 1997b altman et al 1999 freilich and tanny 1980 rumyantsev et al 2000 turkson et al 1989 this effect has especially been observed for metal oxide dms with rumyantsev et al 2000 and freilich and tanny 1980 recording an increase in the dm particle size with increasing ph for a hydrous zr iv oxide dm and al malack and anderson 1997c noting an increased dm particle size for mno2 dm on polyester tubes this was attributed to agglomeration of dm particles at higher ph values al malack and anderson 1997b rumyantsev et al 2000 accordingly the type of pm used to deposit a dm depends strongly on the ph a mf pm should typically be used at a lower ph to successfully deposit the sub micron particles whereas a mesh pm would work fine if the ph is higher than 4 5 rumyantsev et al 2000 2 3 3 4 effect of ph on dm formation time in terms of dm formation time a higher ph usually indicated faster dm formation al malack and anderson 1997b cai et al 2000 freilich and tanny 1980 this was due to the different periods of duration required for the dm material from the suspension to settle or deposit onto the pm surface for example in the case of mno2 dms the precipitation of mno2 proceeded via two steps mno4 mn 2 mno2 at a lower ph whereas via a single step mno4 mno2 at higher ph values cai et al 2000 however while the dm formation time decreased with increasing ph the dm formed was more uniform and compact at a lower acidic ph but less dense at a higher basic ph cai et al 2000 2 3 3 5 summary in summary ph played an extremely important role in the formation of dual salt rejecting dms where the formation of the second layer of the dm depended on the careful adjustment of ph during the deposition process for single layered dms generally acidic ph values of greater than 3 have been recommended for the formation of dms however there may be some exceptions like mg oh 2 dms on ceramic al2o3 tubes where the dms were stable in alkaline environments and were re dispersed or destroyed at ph levels below 5 zhao et al 2005b the effect of ph on the formation of the more recent class i dms has not yet been investigated and past reports on using various class i dms prescribe conditions for their deposition that are specific only to the system they have investigated future efforts on this would help gain insights into the optimum ph values needed to form these dms 2 3 4 hydrodynamics 2 3 4 1 cross flow velocity cross flow velocity had a direct effect on the thickness of the dm formed with dm layer thickness freilich and tanny 1978b igawa et al 1978 noor et al 2002 pan et al 2015 rumyantsev et al 2000 wu et al 2017 zhao et al 2006 or mass wu et al 2017 increasing with decreasing feed velocity however too low a velocity resulted in non uniform dm deposition on the pm pan et al 2015 moreover increasing permeate turbidity with increasing cross flow velocity during the coating process was reported which was attributed to the increased amount of dm material in the permeate at higher velocities due to higher shear chu et al 2012 regarding the interplay between cross flow velocity and dm particle size the average particle diameter of the dm has been shown to be less than that of the feed and further decreased with increasing cross flow velocity wu et al 2017 this is because as cross flow velocity is increased the average diameter of the dm particles sheared off the pm increased due to shear induced diffusion effects 2 3 4 2 pressure the greater the transmembrane pressure tmp across the pm the greater was the driving force the greater was the flux through the pm el nashar 1977 wu et al 2017 and the greater was the compaction experienced by the dynamic layer pan et al 2015 hence dms formed at a greater tmp were found to be thinner pan et al 2015 but were denser igawa et al 1977 and had greater specific mass wu et al 2017 zhao et al 2006 than those formed at a lower tmp this resulted directly in the increase in the resistance of such a dm which produced lower permeate fluxes studies employing metal oxide nakao et al 1986 wilde et al 1988 pac wu et al 2017 polymer igawa et al 1977 and dual layer dms johnson et al 1972 have reported lower fluxes during filtration when using dms formed at high tmps with increasing tmp flux decreased rapidly at first with the rate of drop decreasing gradually igawa et al 1977 2 3 4 3 summary in summary a reasonably low cross flow velocity yielded thicker dms and high formation pressure yielded dms with greater specific mass in case of dead end systems the cross flow velocity is not applicable and pressure is the sole hydrodynamic factor on which dm formation depends however for cross flow systems a balance between permeate flux pressure adjustment and retentate flux adjustment of cross flow velocity must be achieved to obtain the optimum dm in other words the tmp must be sufficiently high to get a dm with sufficient specific mass while at the same time the cross flow velocity needs to be sufficient to achieve uniform deposition 2 3 5 interplay between various factors table 2 summarizes the important factors affecting dm formation and their effect on six dm properties namely dm specific mass which has also been represented in the form of dm thickness dm particle size dm uniformity dm formation speed dm strength dm permeability and rejection the property impacted by the most number of factors 6 is dm specific mass whereas the factor on which the most number of properties depend is dm material concentration however most authors have investigated the effect of these factors in isolation and where studies have considered multiple parameters they have determined the optimum conditions by trial and error altman et al 1999 polom 2013 zhang and zhao 2017 zhao et al 2006 hence the combined effect of all factors on dm properties has been difficult to predict ersahin et al 2012 there have nevertheless been some efforts lonsdale 1973 noor et al 2002 pan et al 2012 2015 wu et al 2017 to study the effects of at least some of these factors in combination two examples illustrating the usefulness of this are as follows i the control of influencing factors could be prioritized according to the dm requirement pan et al 2012 determined that controlling formation tmp was more important than cross flow velocity to obtain a dm with better permeability while controlling the latter was more important to obtain a dm with better rejection ii the choice of pm could be made based on the ph of dm formation for example a lower ph during formation gave a dm with smaller particles hence a pm with smaller pores would be ideal for depositing such a dm rumyantsev et al 2000 attempts to determine the most dominant factor influencing a specific dm property have led to contradicting conclusions to illustrate one study pan et al 2015 found that the cross flow velocity was the most dominant factor determining the specific mass of a class i dm whereas another study found that factor to be tmp wu et al 2017 hence future studies need to consider larger combinations of parameters and operating conditions to identify the dominant influencing factors that would be generally applicable to a wider range of dm systems in addition the effect of chemical properties of the dm material on their formation has sparsely been reported but has been shown to play an important role al malack and anderson 1998 ozari et al 1977 moreover the effects of electrostatic interactions between the dm material and pm have also not been reported further research on these aspects is thus necessary 2 4 dm regeneration one of the advantages of dms as mentioned earlier is that they can easily be removed and a new dm can be deposited onto the pm some authors have also attempted to clean the dm itself and reuse the same dm for subsequent runs but the methods have been less successful than those involving completely removing the used dm various cleaning methods employed for different dm systems are given below 2 4 1 reusing the same dm various methods to clean the dm and reuse it for the subsequent runs have been attempted though the success rate is low unsuccessful techniques were i switching the circulation pump on and off repeatedly which led to collapse of pm walls causing parts of the dm to get destabilized and dislodge ii circulation of tap water which caused bits of the dm to dislodge and enter the circulation tank iii sulfuric acid cleaning which also caused dm dislodgement and iv air scouring which caused shearing away of the dm material or stretching of the polyester tube pm leading to pore expansion and dislodgement of the dm al malack and anderson 1997a two partially successful techniques useful for inorganic dms were i calcination at high temperatures 200 400 c causing the volatile oil components to be removed and thus leaving the dm clean enough to be reused with 10 reduction in performance zhang et al 2018b and ii alkaline cleaning with naoh for 5 min and fenton reagent a combination of ferric ions and hydrogen peroxide for 15 min with up to 52 flux recovery soesanto et al 2019 2 4 2 removing used dm from pm physical cleaning by brushes the outside surface of the tubular pm can be cleaned by brushes while circulating water through the channels this technique dislodged all of the dm material and the pm is returned to its original condition on which a new dm can be deposited al malack and anderson 1997a acid cleaning the most commonly used acid was hydrochloric acid hcl ba et al 2010 cai et al 2000 higher acid concentrations drastically reduced cleaning time cai et al 2000 an advantage of acid cleaning was that waste acid from other processes was employed as cleaning agents for dms cai et al 2000 however the effectiveness of acid cleaning greatly depended on the dm and type of fouling for instance it was observed ba et al 2010 that for a pva dm 100 flux could be restored for bovine serum albumin bsa fouling but not for humic acid ha or sodium alginate sa fouling for a polyvinyl sulfate potassium salt pvs dm 100 flux was restored after bsa and ha fouling but not sa fouling and for a paa dm flux could not be restored indicating fouling could not be effectively cleared off by hcl backwashing by water or air the use of water either via in situ backwashing lee et al 2002 lu et al 2016 or ex situ washing aghili et al 2017 and air backwashing chu et al 2012 has proven to be effective in cleaning fouled dms more than 80 of the original flux could be regained after several runs a combination of water and air comprising a specific protocol of four steps namely water backwash flushing air injection and short rest periods all within 1 min has also been used successfully and was able to achieve 100 flux recovery even after many runs malczewska et al 2015 combination if the chemical nature of the dm and or foulant is known a combination of backwashing and chemical cleaning can be used for example a backwash of alkalescent water ph 8 0 employed to clean an fe2o3 dm used to treat oily wastewater caused an 8 increase in the flux recovery rate as compared to a backwash with only deionized di water ba et al 2010 the alkaline environment caused the dm material to become negatively charged repulsing the oil droplets as well as the pm surface causing the dm along with the oily foulant to be carried off 2 4 3 summary removing the fouled dm completely and recoating a fresh dm has been more successful than cleaning and reusing the same dm various methods including physical cleaning acid cleaning and backwashing flushing with air and or water have been employed to clear off used dms except for one study al malack and anderson 1997a none has focused exclusively on dm cleaning and different authors have set their own procedures empirically as can be seen some procedures have been more successful than others furthermore standards in terms of flux decline and the point of initiating the cleaning process have been ad hoc a systematic research on factors influencing the success of cleaning procedures and identifying key parameters to initiate cleaning would help in increasing the efficiency of dm filtration 2 5 variations to dm systems several authors have used some other techniques in conjunction with dms via modified or hybrid systems to improve dm performance additives have been used during the formation of dms or filtration through them to aid their formation enhance their performance or reduce costs of dm systems addition of salts have aided formation by increasing dm material rejection on the pm igawa et al 1978 addition of coagulants e g alum polyaluminum silicate sulfate pass have helped increase permeate flux al malack and anderson 1996a and improve performance al malack et al 1998 and the addition of reductants e g sodium formate have aided formation as well as performance cai et al 2000 most surfactants except sodium dodecyl sulfate sds have proven to be detrimental to dm filtration luppino and spencer 1982 the use of filter aids e g cellulose asbestos perlite diatomite have enabled the use of meshes with up to 50 μm openings as pms thus decreasing overall cost dahlheimer et al 1970 johnson et al 1968 rotating modules and application of electric fields have helped in moving solute particles or molecules away from the dm turkson et al 1989 the introduction of intermittent vibrations have aided in dislodging saturated dm particles and exposing the fresh particles underneath thus consistently maintaining performance at optimum levels shi and benjamin 2008 turbulence promoters which are physical entities on the feed side of the membrane have been used to enhance dm performance in terms of rejection and flux thomas et al 1970 thomas and watson 1968 only about 7 of the publications on dms employ some kind of modifications furthermore turbulence promoters have not been employed by authors since the 1970s hence further research on applying existing variations to more dm systems and developing new such techniques is warranted future research could also investigate parameters and design considerations choosing the appropriate variation for a dm system and the corresponding quantifiable economic benefits and the applicability of combinations of such modifications 2 6 perspectives the following directions for future research are suggested with regard to formation and regeneration of dms firstly the mechanism for the deposition of class i dms has not been extensively explored understanding quantitatively how class i dms form will help in optimizing their formation procedures secondly as seen from table 2 the influence of many factors on the various aspects of dm formation has not been studied yet for example the effect of the structure of the pm on dm formation for the more recent dms involving uf mf has not been studied moreover the effect of chemical properties of the dm material on their formation has sparsely been reported but has been shown to play an important role al malack and anderson 1998 ozari et al 1977 effects of electrostatic interactions between the dm material and the pm have also not been reported such studies will be useful in the selection of the most compatible pm dm pairs for these operations thirdly in view of the importance of identifying key parameters for triggering dm regeneration and choosing the most suitable and efficient procedure for doing so systematic research exclusively focusing on these aspects is recommended fourthly all research exploring dm formation in tubular modules has focused on single channel modules multi channel modules come with their unique challenges like ensuring uniform distribution of feed to all channels to be relevant commercially studies focused on the hydrodynamics and design aspects of dm formation and performance in multi tube modules are imperative with respect to modified dm systems further research is recommended on applying one or a combination of existing variations to more dm systems 3 fouling mitigation membrane fouling is an inevitable part of any membrane filtration process various methods for fouling mitigation have been studied in literature the presence of dms which act as an adsorbing protective layer against foulants helps mitigate the fouling of the pms a schematic illustrating how dms mitigate fouling is presented in fig 5 showing the deposition of dm saturation of dm by foulants and finally the removal of the dm 3 1 pac haops and hiops natural organic matter nom has long been considered a major concern in water treatment as it can manifest as biofouling and serve as a precursor for the formation of chlorinated disinfection by products dbps the effect of the removal of nom on fouling thus warrants investigation the rate of fouling by feed water treated with conventional batch adsorption has been shown to be greater than that of feed water filtered through a dm which was attributed to the physical presence of the adsorbents on the pm that removed non adsorbable foulants kim et al 2008 pac pre treatment has widely been used to remove nom from feed waters however while some authors reported effective fouling mitigation acero et al 2012 konieczny and klomfas 2002 lee et al 2007 others reported either no effect matsui et al 2006 on fouling or worsened fouling li and chen 2004 zhao et al 2005a in particular when pac was used as dms whether self formed or pre deposited most authors reported that pac was ineffective in mitigating fouling though organics were more effectively removed than other adsorbents a sharp decline in permeate flux was observed when pac was mixed with the feed williams joseph et al 2005 zhang et al 2018a in some cases the presence of the pac dm caused unreasonable flux reduction ellerie et al 2013 moreover pac was unable to prevent irreversible fouling caused by humic acid ha from synthetic yiantsios and karabelas 2001 as well as real sea water wu et al 2017 feeds a study reported that though a pac dm performed better than a bare polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf membrane loss in permeate flux of at least 48 due to ha fouling was observed in just the second cycle soesanto et al 2019 also colloidal nom could not be adsorbed onto pac which has been identified as a significant contributor to fouling lin et al 1999 nilson and digiano 1996 pac dms have achieved more success in fouling mitigation in hollow fiber pm modules where it was observed that the reduction in permeate flux was less than half that in mixed adsorption systems thiruvenkatachari et al 2006 in gravity driven membrane filtration gdm ding et al 2018 shao et al 2017 the reduced flux caused by increased fouling due to pac dms was outweighed by their superior nom removal capabilities furthermore compared to sand which is traditionally used as dm in gdm pac dms reduced irreversible fouling in the pm shao et al 2017 heated aluminum oxide particles haops and heated iron oxide particles hiops have been the most successfully used dm materials to counter pm fouling in mf uf systems it has been found through a series of studies cai and benjamin 2011 cai et al 2008 2013 kim et al 2008 2010 liu and benjamin 2016 malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 modarresi and benjamin 2018 shi and benjamin 2008 wang and benjamin 2016 by benjamin and co workers that haops and hiops performed much better as dms than a slew of other materials such as pac sio2 fecl3 and ion exchange ix resins in fouling mitigation in fact an sio2 dm fouled more rapidly than the bare membrane because the non adsorbent particles combined with coagulated nom to form a gel solid layer at the membrane solution interface with low permeability kim et al 2008 however a comparison of pac haops and hiops as dm materials to counter fouling calls for greater scrutiny as the former removed much greater dissolved organic carbon doc than the latter two kim et al 2008 as seen from fig 6 the rate of increase of resistance i e fouling was greater for pac than haops or hiops suggesting that the pac dm fouled more rapidly that the other two this was attributed to the fact that haops and hiops adsorbed foulants preferentially over non foulant molecules while pac did the opposite fig 6 as a result greater overall removal of foulants was achieved with haops and hiops than with pac even though the highest removal of doc was achieved by the pac this is evident from the sem images in fig 6 where the pm appears more fouled after filtration through the pac dm than the metal oxide dms studies with surrogate foulants like alginate cai and benjamin 2011 and fractionated nom wang and benjamin 2016 also attest to the fact that heated metal oxide particles like haops make better dms for fouling mitigation dual haops and pac dms were shown to be even more effective on feed waters containing nom having a range of suva254 absorbance at 254 nm divided by the dissolved organic carbon concentration values with the system performance improved in terms of both nom removal and foulant resistance compared to the system with haops only cai et al 2008 this was attributed to each adsorbent preferentially removing specific noms specifically with haops selectively adsorbing the higher suva254 nom fraction while pac the lower suva254 fraction this was further confirmed by a recent study modarresi and benjamin 2018 that investigated the effect of varying ratios of the two adsorbents in the dual dm they found that the overall nom removal for the dual haops pac dm was greater than that of the individual haops and pac dms and also that haops and pac had stronger affinities for different components of the nom which improved the overall removal of nom nom removal was heavily reliant on the haops pac ratio in the dm with removal varying non monotonically as the proportion of haops increased peaking at an optimal 1 1 ratio in summary haops hiops and pac have been the most common dm materials used in fouling mitigation haops dms were the most effective in capturing foulant nom fractions pac dms though capable of removing more nom from the feed than haops were relatively less effective in capturing the nom fractions tied to severe fouling when haops pac dual dms were employed the twin benefits of increased nom removal and fouling mitigation were obtained haops dms have also been successfully employed as pre treatments to minimize fouling in uf mf systems future studies may focus on investigating these dms in the industrially relevant multi channel tubular systems and quantitative understanding of the adsorption processes on haops and hiops dms 3 2 carbon nanotubes carbon nanotubes cnts have been extensively used as standalone membranes or in conjunction with ceramic or polymer membranes as composite membranes where they were permanently immobilized e g embedded grafted on these membranes ihsanullah 2019 however standalone cnt membranes suffered from structural issues like irregular alignment whereas composite membranes affected or weakened the properties of cnts ihsanullah 2019 cnt dms seem to alleviate both these problems since the pm while providing structural support does not interfere with the properties of cnts despite this there are relatively fewer studies using cnt dms to counter nom fouling single walled cnts swcnts multi wall cnts mwcnts and mwcnts modified with surfactant s mwcnt ammonia group mwcnt nh2 and carboxyl group mwcnt cooh have been explored ajmani et al 2012 in terms of fouling all the cnt dm membrane systems outperformed the bare membrane except s mwcnt among the cnts it was reported that the unmodified mwcnts the mwcnt nh2 and swcnts performed similarly and better than the mwcnt cooh in terms of fouling the s mwcnts performed poorer than all other cnts due to the even and dense distribution which declined the baseline permeation flux larger mwcnts were more capable of fouling mitigation due to the formation of a homogeneous dm as opposed to a heterogeneous one by smaller mwcnts thereby allowing for better coverage of the pm and better adsorption of nom ajmani et al 2014 furthermore larger mwcnts adsorbed the large molecular weight nom with high fouling potential whereas the smaller mwcnts adsorbed the lower molecular weight nom with lower fouling potential a higher mwcnt loading improved the anti fouling performance of the system due to greater nom removal while the increase in tmp was minimal which allowed for the use of maximum loading during filtration operations mwcnt dms have also been used to study the effect of model foulants like bsa ha and sa bai et al 2015 the mwcnts were modified with polyethylene glycol mwcnt peg and carboxylated groups mwcnt cooh in terms of ha fouling the mwcnt peg dm exhibited the best anti fouling due to the presence of a large number of hydrophilic groups on the mwcnt peg dm for bsa fouling the mwcnt cooh dm displayed the best anti fouling performance due to both bsa and dm being negatively charged thus preventing the foulant penetration due to electrostatic repulsion all dms exhibited relatively poor anti fouling performance for sa due its internal cross linking however the mwcnt cooh dm fared better than the others similarly due to its large negative charge carbon nanofibers cnfs modified by ethanol showed good anti fouling capabilities with respect to both bsa and sa and a permeate flux of more than 90 of the initial value an increase in the anti fouling performance was expectedly observed with increasing surface loading of the dm material liu et al 2018 in summary swcnts and mwcnts have effectively been used as dms to control fouling during filtration of surface water as well as fouling due to bsa ha and sa anti fouling capabilities of mwcnts improved with increasing diameter future studies could focus on improving the stability of cnt dms on flat sheet pms as well as exploring the anti fouling potential of nanoparticle dms in tubular modules which are more industrially relevant 3 3 others other dm materials such as pva ba et al 2010 na et al 2000 nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi ma et al 2015 aluminum flocs ma et al 2017 paa and hydrous zr iv oxide paa altman et al 1999 pvs ba et al 2010 and co polymers akamatsu et al 2011 2013 have been employed to mitigate fouling these systems have been tested for anti fouling by bsa ha and sa which are popular fouling surrogates these dms could target only specific foulants e g nzvi targeted ha ma et al 2015 paa offered better anti fouling for ha and sa than bsa pva mitigated bsa fouling but not ha and sa pvs prevented bsa and sa fouling but not ha ba et al 2010 the aforementioned dms have only been used to test fouling mitigation with synthetic foulant feeds further research needs to be done on the effectiveness of these dms on real wastewater feeds 3 4 perspectives several recommendations for future research pertaining to fouling mitigation by dms can be made firstly most of the studies investigating fouling mitigation by dms have employed flat sheet pms there have been a few recent studies malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 wang and benjamin 2016 using haops dms on tubular pms but none for other dm materials future studies may focus on fouling mitigation by different dms in single and multi channel tubular modules secondly though there have been some qualitative studies cai and benjamin 2011 cai et al 2013 kim et al 2010 and only two recent quantitative investigations ma et al 2019 modarresi and benjamin 2018 on the adsorption of foulants on haops dms more such quantitative insights for a variety of dms and foulants will be useful in optimizing run times and identifying the threshold to initiate cleaning thirdly the effect of ph on the fouling mitigation performance of dms has scarcely been reported though has been shown to be important in the removal of nom liu and benjamin 2016 ma et al 2015 future studies investigating the effect of ph on the anti fouling capabilities of different dms will enable their optimum utilization fourthly nanoparticle dms especially cnts were found to be unstable on flat sheet pms and authors have expressed concern over their large scale applicability future work could focus on improving the stability and adherence to flat sheet as well as tubular pms fifthly polymer based dms e g paa polyvinyl alcohol have only been tested for their anti fouling capabilities on model foulants like bsa ha and sa future research testing polymer based dms with real world feeds e g lake water wastewater will help ascertain their practical utility finally studies on the economic viability of dms performing fouling mitigation and comparisons of their performance against conventional fouling mitigation techniques will further enhance their industrial practicality 4 applications in this section dms involving ro nf uf and mf membranes are reviewed in terms of their applications for solute rejection industrial effluent treatment water and wastewater treatment oily wastewater treatment and other miscellaneous applications fig 7 summarizes the number of dm systems used for the various applications to reflect the focus to date previous reviews have analyzed the overall effect of various factors on dm performance ersahin et al 2012 li et al 2018a the effect of some factors may be dependent only on the dm material or pm but that of some others may be dependent on the feed for example while temperature had no effect on rejection of salts in solute rejection applications it affected salt rejection in industrial effluent treatment therefore this review summarizes the impact of various factors based on the type of application 4 1 solute rejection 4 1 1 dms employed for solute rejection membrane performance is commonly measured in terms of rejection of the unwanted component in the feed solution fig 8 gives an overview of the key dms used for solute rejection the earliest and widest application of dms has been in ro for salt rejection nacl has by far been the most common solute used to test the rejection capabilities of dms antoniou et al 1980 cabellon et al 1971 dahlheimer et al

et al 1969 sachs and lonsdale 1971 shor et al 1968a shor et al 1968b tanny and johnson james 1978 thomas and mixon 1972 other popular solutes included various salts e g mgcl2 dahlheimer et al 1970

kova 1995 knyazkova and kavitskaya 2000 kraus et al 1966 marcinkowsky et al 1966 sachs et al 1969 sachs and lonsdale 1971 shor et al 1968b and various sugars e g glucose kuppers et al 1967 nakao et al 1982 nomura and shoji kimura 1980 yamagiwa et al 1989 raffinose ba et al 2010 kuppers et al 1967 nakao et al 1982 1986 yamagiwa et al 1989 and galactose ba et al 2010 dms have also been used to reject polyethylene glycol tsapiuk 1996 van oers et al 1995 yamagiwa et al 1989 and atrazine ellerie et al 2013 among single layered dms the polymer dms consistently gave a better performance than hydrous zr iv oxide dms in terms of rejecting both salts and sugars an important advantage for polymer dms rejecting organic solutes was that the rejection of these dms was primarily a function of the molecular weight of the solute with greater rejection obtained for heavier solutes while hydrous zr iv oxide and polymer dms were versatile in their removal of different solutes some dms like methylcellulose and gelatin targeted specific solutes like sulfate salts and polyethylene glycol respectively dual layered dms typically gave better salt and organic solute rejections than single layered ones the formation of an ionic bond between the carboxyl group of paa and the basic metal ions enhanced salt rejection igawa et al 1977 in the case of organic solute rejection the second dm material e g paa served as a means to reduce the pore size of the first dm e g hydrous zr iv oxide so that the resulting dm not only retained more solute but also was mechanically stronger altman et al 1999 triple layered dms performed worse than dual layered membranes with the dm of co polymers paa poly styrenesulfonic acid pssa paa giving 90 nacl rejection ozari et al 1977 4 1 2 factors affecting dm solute rejection the factors affecting dms performing solute rejection are ph feed concentration pressure temperature dm material concentration dm particle size dm coating time pm structure and the time elapsed between dm formation and deployment regarding the effect of ph on the rejection performance of dms for salts the rejection generally increased with ph johnson et al 1972 shor et al 1968b the relationship is much less clear for organic solute rejection performance with only one report available which reported a peak in performance at neutral ph wang et al 1999 increasing feed concentration decreased rejection correia and judd 1996b drioli et al 1975 el nashar 1977 johnson et al 1972 kraus et al 1966 sachs et al 1969 while increasing operating pressure increased rejection deng et al 2008 knyazkova and kavitskaya 2000 kraus et al 1967 sachs et al 1969 while the cross flow velocity knyazkova and kavitskaya 2000 and operating temperature johnson et al 1972 nomura and shoji kimura 1980 did not have any significant effect on rejection increasing the latter increased permeate flux due to the viscosity of the filtrate decreasing johnson et al 1972 nomura and shoji kimura 1980 increasing the concentration of dm material and dm coating time increased rejection igawa et al 1978 nakao et al 1982 wang et al 1999 but decreased flux igawa et al 1978 a smaller particle size of the deposited dm rumyantsev et al 2000 and a tighter fabric altman et al 1999 rumyantsev et al 2000 for the pm also increased rejection lower rejections were reported when dms were dried or stored in water for extended periods of time rumyantsev et al 2000 4 1 3 summary in summary almost all dms were able to reject more than one salt or organic solute dual zr polyelectrolyte dms gave the best performance in terms of salt rejection and polymer dms were most suitable for organic solute rejection the effect of ph is clear for salt rejecting dms with increasing ph giving higher rejections whereas it is not clear with regard to organic solutes and further investigations are needed the use of dms for salt rejection has declined in recent years but they continue to show good potential for rejection of high molecular weight organic solutes 4 2 industrial effluent treatment 4 2 1 dms used in industrial effluent treatment the advantages of dms in treating industrial effluents include high temperature stability long service life of the support tube dm replaceability in situ availability of a range of dms for tailoring to a particular application and high membrane flux rates groves et al 1983 despite the advantages dms offer studies on dms used for treating industrial effluents are few however within the limited number of studies available dms have been shown to be useful in treating a variety of industrial effluents including dye effluents brandon et al 1981 textile dyeing wastewater el nashar 1980 polymer manufacturing effluent groves et al 1983 polyester dyeing effluent groves et al 1983 wool scouring effluent groves et al 1983 and industrial stripped gas liquor van reenen and sanderson 1989a dms have also been successfully tested with synthetic pollutants in removing color brandon et al 1981 de amorim and ramos 2006 ellerie et al 2013 halogens gao et al 2013 and sodium acetate wang et al 1998 zr iv polymer dual dms appeared to be the most suitable for treating industrial effluents especially since they were capable of removing multiple pollutants thus industrial effluents which typically comprise of a variety pollutants can be effectively treated using a single dm a venn diagram summarizing the dms capable of rejecting multiple components is given in fig 9 specifically the most versatile dm was hydrous zr iv oxide poly acrylic acid covinyl alcohol which rejected over 80 of sulfate sodium potassium calcium magnesium ammonia chloride fluoride nitrates phosphates acetic acid propionic acid among others from an industrial stripped gas liquor van reenen and sanderson 1989a hydrous zr iv oxide paa dms were also applied on a wide variety of effluents with capabilities to reject more than 90 of color from synthetic brandon et al 1981 and real brandon et al 1981 el nashar 1980 groves et al 1983 dye effluents over 90 of total solids groves et al 1983 up to 62 of sodium and potassium ions groves et al 1983 up to 50 of acetic acid groves et al 1983 and 100 of grease and suspended solids groves et al 1983 among others a dm composed of fine zr particles was able to reject 99 color 93 dissolved solids and 45 acetic acid from alkaline wastewater whereas a nano caco3 dm removed up to 90 br and 99 cl from a halogenated feed gao et al 2013 apart from the four dms mentioned above all others reported in literature aghili et al 2017 cai et al 2000 de amorim and ramos 2006 ellerie et al 2013 kryvoruchko et al 2004 mikhlin and tanny 1979 nyobe et al 2019 wang et al 1998 demonstrated abilities to reject only a single component 4 2 2 factors affecting industrial effluent treatment by dm the effect of various factors on treating industrial effluents by dm have not been extensively studied presumably due to the complex nature of the feeds and large number of components simultaneously rejected by these dms some studies report on the effect of operating pressure temperature ph dm material feed concentration and cross flow velocity on the performance of dms rejection of various components like salt doc color ammonia and urea increased with an increase in operating pressure for a zr iv paa dm el nashar 1977 1980 whereas the dye rejection performance of a pac dm worsened with increasing pressure nyobe et al 2019 while the permeate flux increased with increasing temperature due to decreased viscosity el nashar 1977 1980 its effect on rejection was different for different components increasing temperature had no effect on the rejection of color ammonia or urea but decreased the rejection of salts and doc el nashar 1977 this is in contrast to solute rejection where temperature had no effect on salt retention this could be due to the presence of additional components in an industrial effluent but further research is required to ascertain this increasing ph values increased color and lactic acid rejections by polymer and dual dms de amorim and ramos 2006 polom 2013 with regard to cross flow velocity it was reported to have no effect on dm rejection el nashar 1977 4 2 3 summary there are relatively fewer studies on dms treating industrial effluents but dual dms especially hydrous zr iv polymer have shown tremendous versatility in terms of the number of components rejected this highlights the need to do further research on dms by treating a variety of industrial effluents and exploring dms targeted at particular pollutants from these effluents furthermore compared to the number of components rejected knowledge on the effect of various operating conditions on the performance of these dms is limited since different industrial effluents are of different compositions and are released at varying ph values temperatures pressures and viscosities the exploration of the effect of these is critical 4 3 treatment of water and wastewater 4 3 1 dms used in water and wastewater treatment applicability of dms has recently been shown for treatment of surface water as well as domestic wastewater the chief functionality of such dms is the removal of organic matter from contaminated water the widely accepted parameters for measuring dm performance are removal of doc or total organic carbon toc the most commonly used indicator of permeate quality in domestic wastewaters is turbidity measured in nephelometric turbidity units ntu with a turbidity of 0 2 ntu post treatment considered acceptable inorganic metal compounds al malack and anderson 1996a b 1997a b c 1998 al malack et al 1998 noor et al 2002 like mno2 caco3 fecl3 and naalo2 and soil based compounds holdich and boston 1990 including diatomite kaolin fluorospar limestone and silicate have been used to successfully treat domestic wastewaters all dms performed equally well achieving more than 99 reduction in turbidity however metal chloride dms clogged very quickly due to the formation of flocs with particles from the wastewater al malack and anderson 1998 for surface water treatment pac dms were the most popular followed by iron or aluminum oxide particles polymers sand then nanoparticles aghili et al 2017 ajmani et al 2014 cai and benjamin 2011 cai et al 2008 choo et al 2005 chu et al 2012 ding et al 2018 harman et al 2010 kim et al 2008 kim and jang 2018 kwon et al 2009 lee et al 2002 liu and benjamin 2016 malczewska 2017 malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 shao et al 2017 sharp and escobar 2006 shi and benjamin 2008 wang and benjamin 2016 in decreasing order of removal effectiveness pac dms shao et al 2017 wu et al 2017 and pac metal oxide dms gave the best performance depending on the nature of feed with doc removals of up to 92 and 88 respectively followed by heated metal oxide particles cai and benjamin 2011 cai et al 2008 2013 kim et al 2008 2010 liu and benjamin 2016 malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 modarresi and benjamin 2018 shi and benjamin 2008 wang and benjamin 2016 anion exchange resins shao et al 2017 and sand chu et al 2012 ding et al 2018 this was attributed to the high surface area of pac which is three orders of magnitude greater than the lowest performing dm namely sand whereas pac and metal oxide dms were effective in doc removal sand dms were highly efficient in capturing bacteria 99 from contaminated water despite poor performance with respect to doc removal chu et al 2012 some studies used synthetic feeds containing bsa sa ha transparent exopolymer particle tep altman et al 1999 liu and benjamin 2016 ma et al 2015 and ovalbumin altman et al 1999 to test organic matter removal 4 3 2 factors affecting dm treatment of water and wastewater the factors affecting dm water treatment are feed source ph dm material dosage dm thickness and filtration flux dm performance varied greatly with the source of feed for example pac dms removed 90 doc from seawater wu et al 2017 whereas only 45 removal was achieved from polluted river water shao et al 2017 with respect to ph an acidic environment was found beneficial for doc removal altman et al 1999 liu and benjamin 2016 ma et al 2015 the rejection of nom was expectedly found to increase with increasing dm material dosage as increasing amounts of adsorbents became available cai et al 2008 2013 lee et al 2002 liu et al 2018 also breakthrough occurred later for thicker dms wu et al 2017 implying overall doc removal increased with increasing dm thickness the effect of flux is identical to that of decreasing ph a greater filtration flux was also found to increase nom retention on the dm liu and benjamin 2016 4 3 3 summary in summary pac metal oxide and soil based dms have been used to treat domestic and surface waters this application has recently gained popularity as the demand for domestic water treatment has risen pac was the most effective dm material for doc removal whereas sands dms were more capable of capturing bacteria however as seen from section 3 1 pac dms were also responsible for causing the highest flux decline hence the choice of dm should be made depending on whether nom removal is more important or fouling mitigation a combination of dms has been shown to achieve both objectives cai et al 2008 and further studies on such dual dms are necessary e g a dm harnessing the benefits of sand dms for disinfection and those of pac for nom removal regarding the mechanism of organic matter removal by dms several studies have fitted langmuir adsorption isotherms and kinetics obtained from batch experiments to dm systems cai et al 2008 modarresi and benjamin 2018 nyobe et al 2019 but the latter are more complex owing to involvement of flow hydrodynamics and lower contact time with the adsorbent independent studies considering these aspects could be undertaken to model the dm system more accurately since the performance of these dms varied dramatically with the nature of the feed water future work must also focus on making dm systems adaptable to the feed e g installing a system to vary the amounts of pac and haops as needed during deposition 4 4 oily wastewater treatment 4 4 1 dms used in oily wastewater treatment the treatment of oily wastewaters is another important application of dms soil based and metal oxide dms have been primarily used for oily wastewater treatment along with yttrium y and zirconium zr complexes performance is typically measured in terms of oil retention or toc chemical oxygen demand cod reduction soil based and metal oxide dms have been employed for oil in water feeds whereas y and zr complex dms have been used with oily seawater feeds since the latter also can partially desalinate the feed zhang et al 2018b zhang and zhao 2017 among the soil based and metal oxide dms treating oily wastewater diatomite dms shao et al 2020 and kaolin mno2 dual dms yang et al 2011 were the most effective giving 99 9 of oil rejection while the worst were polystyrene dms with a still impressive 98 rejection fazullin and mavrin 2019 among the metal complex dms used to treat oily seawater containing organics the best performing was the dual yxsi1 xo2 so3h yss phosphorylated yxsi1 xo2 al2o3 pysa dm with 89 retention and the worst performing was the diatomite dm with 67 rejection zhang and zhao 2017 fig 10 shows the best performance in terms of oil rejection of the various dms used for oily wastewater and oily seawater treatment 4 4 2 factors affecting dm oily wastewater treatment generally a higher ph value favored the separation performance of the dms yang et al 2011 zhao et al 2005b however the effect of ph on permeate flux is not clear with one study reporting the flux to be varying arbitrarily with increasing ph yang et al 2011 while another reporting a decrease in flux with increasing ph zhao et al 2005b increasing the operating pressure increased oil rejection zhang and zhao 2017 zhao et al 2006 whereas an increase in the operating temperature caused a slight reduction in rejection yang et al 2011 and enhanced permeate flux due to a decrease in viscosity pan et al 2012 yang et al 2011 an increase in the feed oil concentration increased oil retention while decreasing permeate flux yang et al 2011 among other factors a decrease in dm particle size shao et al 2020 an increase in the concentration of the dm material zhao et al 2006 and increase in dm thickness zhang and zhao 2017 led to higher oil rejections while increasing cross flow velocity reduced dm performance pan et al 2012 zhao et al 2006 also rejection reduced slightly with increasing pm pore size pan et al 2012 4 4 3 summary in summary metal oxide and soil based and y and zr complex dms have been used to treat oily wastewater and oily seawater feeds respectively the performance of most dms has been impressive with over 95 rejections this is the least popular among all applications for dms since it was discovered only in the current century but is fast emerging future research could focus on testing dms on oily wastewater feeds from a variety of sources to establish their applicability beyond a specific system and on understanding the variability of permeate flux with ph 4 5 others polydimethylsiloxane dms guo et al 2010 and paa polyethyleneimine pei dms prepared by alternately filtering both polyelectrolytes have been employed for pervaporation of alcohol water mixtures zhang et al 2006 2008 2009 the separation factor increased with increasing feed concentration guo et al 2010 number of bi layers for paa pei zhang et al 2006 filtration time zhang et al 2006 and with cross flow mode relative to dead end guo et al 2010 dual zr iv paa dms have also been used to separate two component mixtures e g potassium chloride and isopropanol yarlagadda and spencer 1990 sodium chloride and lactose szaniawska and spencer 1996 sodium nitrate and dye xu and spencer 1997 lactic acid and water polom 2013 4 6 summary and perspectives fig 11 summarizes the common dms employed for each of the applications classified by application and dm material category solute rejection is by far the most common application of dms this is due to a large number of dm systems exploring salt rejection via ro since ro is the application for which dms were initiated for and substantial research has expectedly ensued to further enhance desalination the second most popular application is the treatment of domestic waters the removal of organic matter from surface waters has gained importance recently due to the increased necessity for water treatment for environmental sustainability and the growing attention on fouling mitigation in ro plants the treatment of industrial effluents via dms is relatively less popular presumably due to the complex and varied nature of such feeds the least common dm application is the treatment of oily wastewaters but is fast emerging and has gained popularity only in the present century among the dm categories the dual and metal oxide dms appear to be the most versatile and employed in large numbers in all applications and the least versatile is activated carbon with a total of 12 systems being employed in three application categories nanoparticles as a dm material have also been employed in three of the five application categories and due to their emergence relatively recently the number of systems investigated is as yet small based on this analysis the following directions for future research with respect to applications of dms are recommended firstly research on dms used to treat industrial effluents which represents a growing environmental threat because of the complexity and variety in composition rai 2009 ritter et al 2002 is lacking hence a greater focus on developing dms that have shown potential for treating industrial effluents is necessary one example is the hydrous zr iv oxide paa dm which may have fallen out of favor due to its extensive use in the now obsolete application of salt rejection however it has shown tremendous versatility in the treatment of a variety of industrial effluents secondly further exploration on the capabilities of a single dm to capture multiple components e g oil and heavy metal ions will be useful to treat complex feeds thirdly there has been no study assessing the consistency in performance of a dm for the same application with feed solutions from different sources e g oily wastewater from different refineries such studies will more comprehensively ascertain the robustness of dms for their respective applications fourthly nanoparticles have clearly shown much promise in applications for the limited number of studies on them to date further research on the increasingly popular nanoparticles as dms will help exploit their full potential finally studies investigating the nature of interactions between the rejected solute and the dm qualitatively and quantitatively will help to identify thresholds for initiation of cleaning and improve the efficiency of dm systems 5 technical and economic assessment 5 1 technical advantages of dms several technical advantages of dms over conventional membranes have been documented the key advantage of dms over conventional membranes is that they can easily be replaced in situ this circumvents the problem of flux reduction due to irreversible fouling malczewska et al 2015 shao et al 2020 since the dm can be completely removed and replaced by a fresh layer when fouled severely secondly unlike their conventional counterparts e g polyamide ca membranes used for ro dms can be operated at high temperatures and can handle hot industrial effluents without stability issues groves et al 1983 thirdly dms can operate at higher fluxes with reasonable salt rejection compared to ro membranes alone lonsdale 1973 fourthly dms have been shown to give better rejection than surface modified pms e g dip coating due to greater uniformity deng et al 2008 furthermore dms have also been shown to reject more nom as well as provide better fouling mitigation compared to the addition of adsorbents to the feed stream cai et al 2008 or using a stirred vessel ellerie et al 2013 because the dm protects the pm from contacting the nom fifthly dms are extremely useful to prevent downstream ro fouling especially in cases of feeds containing high concentrations of nom kim and jang 2018 or sea water feeds with large amounts of organic matter wu et al 2017 which represents huge benefits over conventional uf mf ro pre treatments that are inadequate finally unlike traditional pms dms can be tailored to match the treatment requirements of specific feeds and designed to remove specific feed constituents groves et al 1983 thereby lower cost pms e g stainless steel ceramic can last longer than uf mf membranes groves et al 1983 5 2 economic advantages of dms the few publications that have carried out detailed economic analysis including capital as well as operating costs of dm systems vis à vis conventional systems have shown the former to be more economical with respect to salt rejection removal of nom and oily wastewater treatment each of these areas is considered in brief below 5 2 1 salt rejection though the operation and maintenance costs of dm systems are admittedly higher than conventional systems due to the expenses involved with cleaning re deposition and higher pressures the savings in capital cost more than offset the increased operation costs thomas 1974 reported that the capital costs for the dm plant were 64 lower than that for the conventional hollow fiber membrane while the operation and maintenance costs were 52 higher owing to increased operating pressures and requirement of periodic cleaning overall the lower capital costs for the dm plant more than offset the higher operation and maintenance costs such that the total costs for the dm plant were 12 lesser than the conventional hollow fiber plant in cases whereby there is a non significant difference between the overall costs of dm and conventional systems the former has been shown to be superior in terms of flux and ability to withstand hot industrial feed streams groves et al 1983 5 2 2 organic matter removal in the case of using dms for organic matter removal savings in capital and operating costs have been reported compared to conventional systems kim and jang 2018 performed for an industrial scale treatment of water containing nom a comparative cost analysis between two methods namely i the conventional method comprising coagulation via polyaluminum chloride mixing and settlement and ii filtration using heated aluminum oxide and binary fe al oxide dms taking into consideration the capital costs for the adsorbent cake layer and decreased flux compared to the conventional method savings in capital costs of 36 45 and 23 32 were reported when using the heated aluminum oxide and fe al oxide dms respectively on the ceramic sheets pms as opposed to the conventional method ajmani et al 2012 reported that the cost of operating cnt dms for treating surface water is the same as that for conventional hollow fiber or flat sheet membranes but the dms additionally offer benefits of lower tmp and longer run times due to more effective fouling mitigation effectiveness and also negate the need for pre treatment 5 2 3 oily wastewater treatment economic benefits in using dms for oily wastewater treatment involve energy savings due to reduction in irreversible fouling of the pm for example zhang et al 2018b reported an energy saving of 22 when yxsi1 xo2 so3h yss yxsi1 xo2 al2o3 pysa dm was used to treat oily seawater the average pressure required to be generated by the ro pump reduced from 4 4 mpa for the conventional system to 3 43 mpa for the dm system thus inducing the saving in case of oily seawater treatment dms can be economically employed to pre treat feeds during algal blooms which are periodic events setting up a temporary pre treatment dm system in such situations has proven to be more cost effective in terms of energy footprint and capital expenditure than setting up a conventional column reactor kim et al 2017 5 2 4 summary based on the economic analyses of dm systems available in literature cases whereby dms would incur lower expenses than conventional methods can be identified as follows i capital costs of conventional systems are high dms offer a cheaper alternative if the dm material is easily and cheaply available moreover dms can be deposited on pm with larger pores e g meshes malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 which are far less costlier than conventional uf or mf membranes ii extreme temperatures or corrosives are involved conventional membranes may not be able to withstand such conditions groves et al 1983 and could have operational lifespan shortened considerably dms have been proven to withstand extreme operating conditions at much lower maintenance costs iii high fouling environments dms could improve the lifespan of a pm appreciably since the dm would prevent contact between the pm and foulants this would help reduce maintenance costs and improve productivity by reducing the downtime iv filtration operation at high tmps whereby the majority of operation costs are for maintaining the required tmp dms would enable the use of a low pressure e g uf membrane as pm instead of high pressure e g ro membrane thus reducing costs v periodic requirement for a pre treatment step e g during algal blooms dms would be far more economical in terms of capital costs than setting up a conventional filtration system 5 3 challenges despite these technical and economic advantages dms are still not applied in industry on a large scale due to some inherent problems associated with dms and some research gaps which need to be the focus of future studies on dms this section briefly discusses the problems and research gaps that prevent industrial scale deployment of dms one of the problems that plagues dms is that of irreproducibility especially in the case of dms performing ro large variabilities in terms of dm formation and performance kraus et al 1967 for example thickness and flux diaper et al 1996 freilich and tanny 1978a holdich and boston 1990 johnson et al 1968 kraus et al 1966 nomura and shoji kimura 1980 have been widely reported this greatly hinders dms from being employed in industry secondly issues of dm stability have been reported which are important especially for nanoparticle dms considering the potential danger to health and environment various authors expressed concerns that the adhesion of cnts to pms is still not as strong as required for large scale operations ajmani et al 2012 bai et al 2015 ellerie et al 2013 gallagher et al 2013 thirdly several dms exhibit variable flux with changes in ph the cause of which has not fully been understood yet yang et al 2011 zhao et al 2005b for example it has been reported in the case of kaolin mno2 dms treating oily wastewater that the flux varies erratically as the ph is increased and then lowered yang et al 2011 industrial feeds may not always be at the same ph so this problem needs to be addressed before deploying dms to treat oily wastewater on a large scale fourthly a highly concentrated sludge which could be harmful to the environment if released untreated is generated when the old dm is replaced by a new one especially in the case of anti fouling dms cai and benjamin 2011 kim and jang 2018 malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 since the sludge will be greater in volume than that produced during conventional membrane filtration because it contains the dm material in addition to the captured components effective disposal strategies need to be formulated before dms can be employed widely 6 future perspectives apart from the above mentioned challenges gaps exist in the current knowledge base on dms that could go a long way to make dms more industrially viable if bridged these are summarized in the following broad areas dm formation mechanisms the formation mechanisms of recent class i dms have not been investigated thoroughly though there is one study on this pan et al 2015 several assumptions like rigid particles neglect of re suspension and laminar regime limit its utility electrostatic interactions between dm particles and pms have also not been investigated factors influencing dm formation as seen from table 2 the effects of influencing factors on various properties of dms have not been comprehensively investigated synergistic impact of the factors and identification of dominant ones have also not been addressed furthermore effects of the chemical properties of dm materials on their formation have not been assessed dm cleaning trigger criteria for initiation of dm cleaning have been set in an ad hoc manner and the influence and evaluation of the effectiveness of various cleaning protocols have not been systematically studied as yet dm configurations most research on the anti fouling potential of dms has been done using flat sheet and dead end configurations where tubular modules are used all of them are single channel systems rather than the more industrially relevant multi channel systems dms on hollow fiber pms have also not been studied much despite showing promise especially in terms of stability thiruvenkatachari et al 2006 modifications to dm systems despite showing clear improvements in terms of formation and performance modifications to dm systems e g additives rotation have been relatively less studied out of the almost 150 publications on pre deposited dms only 11 employ some kind of modification fouling mitigation by dms most research has focused on adsorption mechanisms on dms qualitatively but the effect of ph on their fouling mitigation efficacy has not been evaluated also the majority of studies on antifouling dms have used synthetic foulants as opposed to real feeds applications of dms metal oxide and polyelectrolyte dms have been studied less in recent times presumably due to the emergence of better ro membranes there has been very little research however on the use of these dms in other applications where they have shown potential studies identifying dms targeted at specific components in a feed are also lacking though dms have been shown to be economically beneficial compared to their conventional counterparts like hollow fiber membrane systems such analyses are scarce in literature in terms of fouling mitigation no attempt to assess the industrial practicability of dms against currently practiced techniques has been made studies exploring scale up of dm systems are also lacking after considering various problems and gaps in the current research on dms several avenues to make dms industrially viable in the near future could be suggested besides that based on the discussion from the previous section future research directions that could make dms further attractive in the long term and increase our understanding regarding dms are recommended fig 12 provides an overview of the directions for future research on dms to i make them industrially viable in the near future and ii further the understanding for application in the long term 6 1 future research on industrial viability of dms dms have proven to be as or more cost effective than using conventional systems however they are still not applied on an industrial level several ways in which dms could be made industrially practicable in the near future are given below 1 polyelectrolyte dms have already been shown to be effective in treating industrial effluents groves et al 1983 van reenen and sanderson 1989a and in nf applications deng et al 2008 industrial effluents have been identified as an ever growing environmental threat rai 2009 ritter et al 2002 making their adequate treatment increasingly important further research on dms targeting specific industrial waste compounds would make them more applicable in industry given the tightening environmental regulations 2 many dms have been shown to be very effective using flat sheet configurations e g fouling mitigation where tubular modules are used only a single tube system is examined since single tube modules are rarely employed in industry future studies focusing on various aspects of design and dm formation performance and fouling mitigation in tubular multi channel modules will help enhance the industrial relevance of dms 3 a mesh instead of a conventional mf or uf membrane as a pm has been used to deposit the dm malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 na et al 2000 future efforts on making dms on meshes industrially viable would not only reduce the tmp thereby lowering operation costs but also reduce capital costs since meshes are much cheaper than uf mf membranes 4 uf membranes with a feed pre treated with haops dms on a nylon mesh have been observed to operate without tmp build up for up to a fortnight malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 further such research on downstream ro fouling mitigation by dms would make them industrially attractive 5 determining the trigger point for commencement of dm cleaning has to date been ad hoc and cleaning procedures have been empirical some protocols e g air and water backwashing and flushing malczewska et al 2015 have proven to be more effective than others e g only water backwashing lee et al 2002 lu et al 2016 since cleaning would entail a halt in the filtration process future work focusing on optimizing dm regeneration protocols and identifying criteria to initiate cleaning would play an important role in integrating dm systems in industrial processes it would also be useful in prolonging pm life 6 modifications to dm systems such as use of filter aids dahlheimer et al 1970 johnson et al 1968 turbulence promoters thomas et al 1970 and introduction of vibrations shi and benjamin 2008 have proven to improve dm performance and prolong operation duration but have been relatively less studied further research into such variations will aid in cost reduction and enhancing the overall effectiveness of dms 7 more studies comparing the economic and practical aspects of dms such as overall costs and energy expenditures and rejection and fouling mitigation capabilities to those of currently practiced industrial techniques will be needed for their large scale adoption in industry studies exploring scale up of dm systems would also be required 6 2 future research on furthering the understanding on dms though there have been a lot of studies on dms there are several gaps in our understanding of their formation and functioning some directions for long term future research on furthering the mechanistic understanding of dms are recommended as follows 1 the formation mechanism of class i dms has not been quantitatively investigated class i dms are gaining recent popularity to perform mf uf operations e g haops hiops moreover understanding on the effects of various factors on the formation of class i and ii dms both in isolation and in combination is still incomplete hence further research into more quantitative analysis of formation mechanisms of class i dms and factors influencing dm formation is imperative 2 though dm performance has been well studied quantitatively using batch adsorption kinetics there has been no study modeling dm performance considering flow hydrodynamics and little insights into interactions between the dm material and rejected solute are available one recent study has looked into the mechanism of adsorption of nom onto haops dms via molecular dynamics simulations ma et al 2019 more such studies investigating the nature of interactions between the captured solute or foulant and the dm and considering flow and adsorption together will enable optimization of filtration durations and initiation of cleaning regeneration 3 nanoparticles an emerging dm material have proven to be versatile in terms of their application as evident from a few recent studies though they provide some advantages over standalone and composite cnt membranes a major issue for these dms is their lack of stability on pms causing them to be inapplicable on a large scale hence further research is required to fully exploit nanoparticles as dm materials 4 a variety of dms has been used for a single application with varying degrees of performance but the most suitable dm within an application for a type of feed or pollutant has not yet been determined to take the full advantage of the flexibility that dms offer future work needs to focus on identifying the best dm or dm class for a particular type of feed and engineering dms targeted at removing certain undesirable components from a variety of feeds 7 conclusions a comprehensive review of pre deposited dms has been carried out the key dms employed along with their formation factors affecting formation regeneration techniques and modifications to dm systems are discussed also presented are the important roles of dms in fouling mitigation of the pms and the wide ranging applications of dms technical and economic advantages of dms over conventional methods are considered while discussing some challenges prevalent in current dm research based on these directions for future research to recognize their potential in terms of industrial applicability as well as furthering mechanistic understanding are suggested ten noteworthy inferences can be drawn from this review i dms have been effectively employed in all major types of filtration systems namely ro nf uf and mf ii the dm material structure of the pm ph and hydrodynamic conditions influence various aspects of dm formation iii with respect to dm regeneration shearing off the used dm then depositing a new dm is preferred rather than cleaning and reusing the same dm physical removal use of chemicals and backwashing are popularly used for clearing off the spent dm iv metal oxide dms are the most versatile in terms of applications and are among the most commonly studied dm materials along with polymers and dual metal oxide polymer layers v nanoparticles are an emerging versatile dm material that show promising results for fouling mitigation however their stability on pms is a major concern vi dms have traditionally found popularity in salt rejection ro applications whereas removal of organic matter from water along with fouling mitigation are currently the most popular functions of dms vii though analysis is scarce dms have been shown to be more cost effective than conventional methods like coagulation for organic matter removal and conventional hollow fiber membrane systems viii some operational problems and gaps in the current knowledge on dms still hinder their applicability in industry on a large scale ix with further research in areas like dm treatment of industrial effluents multi channel tubular dm systems dm cleaning modification to dm systems reduction in operation costs and scale up of dm systems dms have a large potential to be employed on an industrial level x future research on formation mechanisms dm foulant interactions nanoparticle dms and identification of the most suitable dms for different applications would further our current understanding on dms

18079,a dynamic membrane dm is a layer of particles deposited via permeation drag onto a conventional membrane such that the deposited particles act as a secondary membrane that minimizes fouling of the primary membrane to lower transmembrane pressures tmp and enable higher permeate fluxes since the first dm was created in 1966 at the oak ridge national laboratory numerous studies have reported synthesis of dms using various materials and explored their abilities to perform reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf dms are classified into two categories namely i self formed whereby the feed constituents form the dm and ii pre deposited whereby the dm is formed by a layer of particles other than the feed prior to introduction of the feed this paper endeavors to present a comprehensive review of the state of the art on the latter key materials used as dms their formation and various factors influencing it regeneration of dms and modifications to

deposited via permeate drag on a conventional membrane with the deposited particles acting as a secondary membrane ersahin et al 2012 johnson 1972 li et al 2018a tanny 1978 in most cases a cake which is also considered a dm if it is beneficial in improving permeate quality is invariably formed from the rejected constituents of the feed al malack and anderson 1997b based on whether the dm is composed of feed constituents deposited during filtration or intentionally pre deposited particles with desired properties on the primary membrane pm ersahin et al 2012 dms can be divided into two types namely 1 self formed dms whereby the solid particles from wastewater form the dm and aid in improving permeate quality hu et al 2018 and 2 dms formed via deposition of materials such as metallic compounds especially oxides polymers activated carbon soil based compounds and nanoparticles on surfaces of meshes or ultrafiltration uf microfiltration mf nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro membranes pre deposited dm systems have the flexibility of choice of appropriate materials having the relevant properties with which to form the dm also while self formed dms require some time for the permeate quality to stabilize rezvani et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 the desired quality of the permeate can be obtained right away for pre deposited dms thus despite the additional material cost incurred for pre deposited dm systems they afford a greater degree of overall control al malack et al 2004 self formed dms are mostly used in ultrafiltration applications with the majority of self formed dms studied in dynamic membrane bioreactors dmbrs and in some other applications such as protein separation barefoot et al 1993 kuberkar vinod and davis robert 2008 matsuyama et al 1994 meyer et al 2015 nakao et al 1982 zhang et al 2002 two component mixture separation horng et al 2007 2009 hwang and cheng 2003 nakao et al 1982 surface water treatment kim et al 2008 malczewska et al 2015 thomas and mixon 1972 xu et al 2013 and fouling mitigation kim et al 2008 malczewska et al 2015 among others al malack et al 2004 kishihara et al 1989 lu et al 2016 perona et al 1967 in particular for 2 the term dynamic membrane al malack and anderson 1998 chu et al 2012 johnson et al 1972 has been used interchangeably with the term formed in place membrane ersahin et al 2012 szaniawska and spencer 1996 1997 zhang and spencer 1993 with some studies omitting the term dynamic membrane completely cai et al 2008 ding et al 2018 ellerie et al 2013 regardless of dm type the dm either a enhances the performance of the pm b renders the properties of the pm immaterial e g dm on ultrafiltration pms performing reverse osmosis or c protects the pm from fouling previous reviews on dms have either exclusively looked at dmbrs hu et al 2018 focused on a specific application e g municipal wastewater alepu et al 2016 or have given an overview of both categories of dms together namely self formed primarily consisting of dynamic membrane bioreactors dmbrs and pre deposited ersahin et al 2012 li et al 2018a they have examined the overall factors affecting dm formation and performance but a comprehensive discussion of dm material classes their fouling mitigation capabilities and application is lacking this review is focused only on deposition type 2 i e pre deposited dynamic membranes dms whereby the secondary membrane is formed prior to filtration and not permanently adhered or chemically bound bullón et al 2000 latulippe et al 2009 li and garth spencer 1992 to the primary one the scanning electron microscopy sem images of two pre deposited dms are shown in fig 1 note that henceforth in this review the abbreviation dm will refer to pre deposited dms only unless otherwise specified this review summarizes the kinds of materials that have been used to form pre deposited dms see section 2 1 notably out of the eight types of dm materials two types namely metal oxide and metal oxide polymer dominate 47 hence relatively more attention is given to them tanny 1978 categorized dms into three classes namely i ii and iii this classification is applicable to both self formed and pre deposited dms class i is whereby the diameter of the pm pore is lesser than the smallest particles of the dm material examples of which are the dms comprising protein concentrates formed during the ultrafiltration of cheese whey matthews et al 1976 or skim milk pompei et al 1973 the formation generally proceeds via concentration polarization class ii dms are those whereby the diameter of the pm is much larger up to three orders of magnitude than the diameter of the depositing particles examples of which are dust or bacteria in the feed that can bridge pores and create flocculation centers and hydrous zr iv oxide dms formed on porous ceramic tubes grace 1956 johnson 1976 tanny et al 1979 class ii dms form via the mechanisms of pore constriction and cake filtration class iii dms are those whereby the pm pore size is similar to the diameter of the depositing particles examples are anionic or cationic polyelectrolytes dynamically deposited on cellulose acetate ca membranes and polyelectrolytes deposited on already formed class i dms tanny and jagur grodzinski 1973 in such cases the polymer molecule diffuses and resides inside the surface pores of a pm thus altering its flux and rejection properties to form a class iii dm a survey of available literature on dms reveals that class ii dms are popularly used for filtration purposes al malack and anderson 1996b bowen et al 1995 freilich and tanny 1980 murkes 1990 more recently class i dms have been utilized for removal of organics from water cai et al 2013 huang et al 2009 yang et al 2011 the key advantages of dms are i fouling prevention of the pm by adsorbing organics and colloidal particles in the feed ersahin et al 2012 and therefore offering higher flux and lower transmembrane pressures tmps li et al 2018a ii eliminating the need for expensive pms iii easy removal from the pm surface by backwashing zhang et al 2014 or brushing ersahin et al 2012 and re deposition in situ iv high temperature stability groves et al 1983 and v capability to treat a variety of feeds ranging from domestic wastewater al malack and anderson 1996a to high strength industrial effluents groves et al 1983 while advantages i ii and iii have been reported for both pre deposited and self formed dms advantages iv and v have only been reported for the former despite these clear advantages practical implementation remains limited at least in part due to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of dms in terms of operational mechanisms and utilization therefore this review attempts to present the state of the art to date on dm research spanning materials formation and regeneration and applications directions for future research are also proposed 1 1 structure of review this review is divided into 7 sections section 1 introduces dms and discusses their classification and chronological development section 2 gives details of the key categories of dm materials employed and studied to date and some aspects related to the formation of dms on pms also discussed are factors affecting formation of dms methods employed for their regeneration and several modifications to dm systems for improvement in formation and or performance section 3 examines the fouling mitigation abilities of the various dm materials section 4 details the various applications wherein dms have been employed at the end of each sub section in sections 2 4 some future perspectives specific to the content of that sub section are presented additionally the important areas on which future research relating to dm formation fouling mitigation by dms and their applications could focus are summarized at the end of sections 2 3 and 4 respectively section 5 presents technical and economic advantages of dms over conventional methods and some challenges involved in constructing and operating dm systems in section 6 directions for future research to make dms industrially viable and further their understanding are suggested section 7 concludes the review 1 2 brief chronology the first report on dms was in 1966 by the oakridge national laboratory marcinkowsky et al 1966 whereby hydrous zirconium zr iv oxide served as a dm on a ro membrane for salt rejection since then numerous papers on dms have been published as displayed in fig 2 a and fig 2b further shows the break down on the number of popular dms studied the data used to create fig 2a was obtained from scopus after an initial keyword search of dynamic membrane or dynamically formed and membrane or formed in place and membrane and limit to subjarea ceng or limit to subjarea envi yielded about 350 results papers on pre deposited dms were manually sorted from them note that in fig 2b as also in figs 3 4 7 and 11 the number of dm systems i e the number of unique pm dm pairs rather than number of papers are presented because some papers report on several dm materials in each for example since kim et al 2008 investigated heated aluminum oxide particles haops heated iron oxide particles hiops and powdered activated carbon pac dms on a cellulose ester ce pm these are counted as 3 dm systems likewise the same dm material deposited on two different pms is also counted as two dm systems six important observations can be drawn from fig 2b firstly hydrous zr iv oxide membranes were only popular in the decade of discovery i e 1960s since composite hydrous zr iv oxide polymer dms were soon created which exhibited much better salt retention capabilities than the single layered zr iv oxide dms secondly the hydrous zr iv oxide polymer dms mainly used for salt rejection found popularity till the 1990s after which the number of systems studied declined rapidly this could be due to the introduction of cheaper ro membranes into the market which caused dms to be less favored thirdly increasing number of metal oxide e g iron oxide aluminum oxide titanium oxide and powdered activated carbon pac systems were studied from the decades of 1991 2000 and 2001 2010 respectively due to their ability to be used for uf mf which started gaining popularity near the start of the twenty first century for these dms along with removal of impurities from the feed research emphasis was also placed on their anti fouling properties fourthly polymer dms were popular in the 1970s but experienced a dip in popularity thereafter due to the discovery of composite hydrous zr iv oxide polymer dms then gained increased attention near the start of the twenty first century due to greater focus on sugars in solute rejection and industrial effluent treatment fifthly soil based dms like kaolin and diatomite have gained popularity since the 2000s presumably due to their usefulness in water and oily wastewater treatment finally nanoparticle dms are expectedly studied only in the present decade due to the increasing popularity of nanoparticles 2 formation and regeneration 2 1 materials used for dm formation various materials have been studied to form dms in this review dms have been classified into eight categories based on their material namely metal oxides e g hydrous zr iv oxide haops polymers e g polyacrylic acid paa polyvinyl alcohol pva soil based e g kaolin diatomite other metallic e g alcl3 fecl3 caco3 activated carbon e g pac granular activated carbon gac nanoparticles e g carbon nanotubes cnts carbon nanofibers cnfs dual or hybrid e g hydrous zr iv oxide paa haops pac and others e g anion exchange resin ovalbumin note that dual or hybrid dms use a combination of two discrete dm materials as an overview fig 3 displays the number of dm systems studied to date of each dm material type along with the number of dm systems of some key dms for each type metal oxides especially hydrous zr iv oxide the first material to be studied as a dm and dual dms like the combination of hydrous zr iv oxide and polymers have been the most studied materials for the formation of dms this can be attributed to the extensive research on dms to perform ro and organic solute rejection in their early years of inception dual metal oxide polymer dms have also found popularity in industrial effluent treatment the primary membrane for zr iv dms were either porous meshes or mf membranes of various materials like silver carbon stainless steel ceramic cotton acropore and polysulfone dual dms with both layers comprising of polymers like paa polyethyleneimine and paa polystyrene sulfonic acid have also been used marcinkowsky et al 1966 sachs and lonsdale 1971 shor et al 1968b within the last two decades metal oxide particles like mno2 heated iron oxide particles hiops and heated aluminum oxide particles haops have gained popularity in uf mf operations these dms were used for the dual purposes of purification as well as fouling mitigation of the primary membrane a combination of adsorbents namely pac and haops has been employed for achieving a better balance between organic content removal and fouling mitigation cai et al 2008 these dms were formed either by a mixture of the adsorbents or layer by layer of each other composite dms employed include kaolin mno2 dms and yttrium or zr complexes with silicon and al2o3 for oily wastewater treatment the next most popular dm material class is polymers because of the inherent versatility traditionally used for solute rejection applications they have recently gained popularity for treating industrial effluents polyacrylic acid paa and polyvinyl alcohol pva were the most common dm material while the most common pms were cellulose acetate ca and polyethersulfone pes mf uf flat sheet membranes other metallic dms like hydroxides have also been investigated mainly for oily wastewater treatment applications tubular ceramic or polymeric uf mf pms have been most commonly used with these soil based dms mainly kaolin and diatomite have been employed in oily wastewater and water treatment applications these have mostly been used in mf uf systems with polyester membranes ceramic membranes and meshes as pms furthermore nanoparticles especially cnts have been shown to be promising as an emerging dm material dms have been used to perform all four types of filtration mf uf nf and ro while metal oxide and or polyelectrolytes were chosen as dm materials for ro due to their ion exclusion effect sachs and lonsdale 1971 shor et al 1968b the specific choice of zr iv or paa seems to be by trial and error marcinkowsky et al 1966 however research on the interactions between most dms and the components they reject and criteria for identification of appropriate dm classes most suitable for individual applications is still lacking future research on these aspects would help in choosing the most fitting dms for various feeds table 1 presents an overview of all dm materials used in literature along with the pms employed filtration type and applications 2 2 dm formation this section discusses various aspects related to the formation of pre deposited dms the formation of self formed dms especially of those in dmbrs mainly used for municipal waste water treatment proceeds via a different mechanism and is not in the scope of this review the description of which can be found elsewhere alepu et al 2016 ersahin et al 2012 hu et al 2018 2 2 1 formation mechanism dm deposition is typically performed in the two key operation modes namely dead end and cross flow fig 4a shows the breakdown of number of dm systems in each configuration per dm material category clearly the cross flow mode is dominant presumably due to the associated lower tmps the typical experimental setup used for the formation of a dm in the more popular cross flow mode is schematically illustrated in fig 4b all research exploring dm formation filtration in tubular modules has only focused on single channel modules however to be relevant commercially studies focused on the hydrodynamics and design aspects of dm formation and performance in multi tube modules are imperative the process of formation of all the types of dms mentioned in section 2 1 is essentially the same a solution or suspension containing the dm material is circulated for a cross flow configuration or filtered for a dead end configuration through the membrane cell at a desired flow rate for a desired period of time certain dm materials such as pac were used as obtained from vendors cai et al 2008 thiruvenkatachari et al 2006 while others e g zr iv oxide shor et al 1968b mno2 al malack and anderson 1996b were synthesized for the dual dms the second dm material e g paa polymer was deposited by circulating the specific feed solution for a specific amount of time over the initially formed dm e g hydrous zr iv oxide on the primary membrane as mentioned in section 1 class ii dms i e the diameter of the depositing particles is much smaller than the pm pore size are the most widely employed among the three classes the various stages of dm formation have been observed by various authors by tracking the permeation rate and the total permeate volume as a function of time during the initial stages of membrane formation pore clogging was observed thereby reducing the paths through which the permeate can flow the pore blocking mechanism can be described by freilich and tanny 1978a 1 k t 2 t v t 1 j 0 where k is the blocking constant t is the time elapsed v t is the volume per unit area of the membrane filtered at time t and j 0 is the flux after the pm pores have been sufficiently clogged the dm formation proceeds via the thickening of the cake layer in this case the particle diameter becomes greater than the pore diameter and the cake layer increases in thickness due to the deposition of a fraction or all of the dm material in the suspension freilich and tanny 1978a determined that dm formation in this second stage proceeds via 2 t v 1 k v 2 v f where v f is the volume of permeate that must pass through the primary membrane to create a dm with resistance equal to that of the primary membrane and k is a constant related to the cake resistance thus class ii dm formation mechanism can be summarized as two key steps 1 when a dm material suspension like zr iv oxide colloidal suspension is introduced over a porous support such as a stainless steel mesh or a uf membrane the particles are first deposited onto the walls of the pores of the pm which causes the pores to block i e pore blocking or pore bridging and 2 a continuing supply of the colloidal particles then results in the deposition of a cake layer on the pore blocked pm to form a dm class iii dms are formed when a second material usually a polyelectrolyte is added after a class ii dm has already been formed on the pm altman et al 1999 tanny and johnson james 1978 when a polyelectrolyte e g paa is introduced over the already formed class ii dm e g hydrous zr iv oxide at low ph the paa molecules are just the right size to penetrate into the pores of the zr iv dm instead of forming a gel layer on the surface causing the polyelectrolyte molecules to enter the surface pores of the class ii dm by a purely diffusional process tanny 1978 on raising the ph they ionize and expand thus getting immobilized on the surface of the dm and blocking them this leads to the formation of a dual dm with the class iii polyelectrolyte dm formed in the already pre deposited class ii zr iv dm resulting in increased salt rejection capabilities at the cost of a reduced permeate flux altman et al 1999 tanny and johnson james 1978 class i dms are formed when the pores of the pm are small enough to completely retain the particles of the dm material concentration polarization is the mechanism that governs their formation tanny 1978 specifically a boundary layer of a particular thickness is created as more and more of the particles are accumulated at the pm interface the concentration of the dm material within the boundary layer depends on the balance between convective flow and back diffusion due to the permeate flux the concentration at the pm surface goes on increasing until it reaches gel concentration this gel layer which is the dm continues to grow till either its resistance becomes too large for permeation or the dm material in the circulation tank is completely deposited there is only one study pan et al 2015 exploring the mechanism of deposition of class i dms at the particle level the three primary criteria for a particle to deposit on the surface of a tubular pm in cross flow mode are i net radial force ii net axial moment and iii net circumferential moment the first two criteria are more dominant than the third with the former being the most dominant at lower flux values and the latter at higher flux values class i dms are gaining popularity in recent times and more research on their formation mechanisms is warranted in the future understanding quantitatively how class i dms form would help in optimizing their formation 2 2 2 dm resistance in the case of class ii dms blocking of the pores of the pm by the dm material would increase filtration resistance significantly with the overall resistance of the pm dm potentially much larger than that of the pm alone this has been observed by several authors using hydrous zr iv oxide kuppers et al 1967 and hydrous zr iv oxide paa dms whereby the resistance increased by three akamatsu et al 2011 johnson et al 1972 to four times akamatsu et al 2011 after dm deposition and mno2 dms whereby the resistance increased by up to six times al malack and anderson 1997c nonetheless the class ii dms performing ro could still be operated at fluxes of above 100 lmh lonsdale 1973 while those performing uf could yield constant permeate fluxes of 50 75 lmh al malack and anderson 1997c kuppers et al 1967 for much longer periods of time than the bare uf membranes due to fouling mitigation al malack and anderson 1997c hence even though the resistance of the systems increased dramatically after dm deposition the permeate flux was shown to be sufficient by typical industry standards najafpour et al 2007 in the case of class i dms the resistance was not as severely affected during dm formation as that in class ii dm systems owing to the larger diameter of the dm material particles notably the resistance of the bare membrane was observed to increase rapidly during filtration due to severe fouling which was effectively mitigated by the dm cai and benjamin 2011 cai et al 2013 in such cases the benefits of a dm far outweigh the small increase in overall resistance it causes 2 2 3 dm stability the dm is held in place on the pm by permeate drag towards the membrane along with several physical interactions like electrostatic forces and the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of both membranes al malack and anderson 1997a the stability of the dm dictates whether the same dm needs be reused after cleaning or whether a fresh dm would be deposited after the preceding one becomes saturated see section 2 4 stability is more important in the former case as the dm would have to withstand a cleaning cycle the stability of nanoparticle dms intended to be used for several filtration cleaning cycles is vital considering the health and safety hazards upon exposure li and huang 2010 there has been some success in developing stable cnt dms on the inner surfaces of hollow fiber pms gallagher et al 2013 but adhesion of cnts to flat sheet uf pms was in general not stable de lannoy et al 2012 dumée et al 2010 multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts in general and larger 50 80 nm mwcnts in particular were found to form the most stable dms and were the most resistant to backwashing ajmani et al 2012 modification of mwcnts by cooh groups yielded less stable dms than that from the unmodified ones however the former gave better anti fouling performance than the latter other nanoparticle dms such as nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi could be more successfully adhered to flat sheet dms especially via pre treatment with ethanol which decreased aggregation amongst particles ma et al 2015 2017 even so a small amount of dm particles still detached during backwash hence future research is necessary to develop anti fouling nanoparticle dms that strongly adhere to flat sheet pms as regards other dms dual zr polymer dms have been reported to be stable for up to three months and could be used without reduction in performance as long as they were stored under water johnson et al 1972 wilde et al 1988 these dms must not be allowed to dry otherwise the deposited layer has been observed to peel off johnson et al 1972 nakao et al 1986 wilde et al 1988 most recent class i metal oxide dms are designed to be used only for a single run and no stability issue during the filtration run has been reported whether deposited on flat sheet or tubular dms 2 2 4 dm characterization techniques scanning electron microscopy sem is by far the most popular technique for characterizing dms for almost a decade since their inception in the late 1960s dms were evaluated only on the basis of their salt rejection capabilities igawa et al 1977 were the first to capture sem images of the al iii paa dms since then sem images have been commonly presented for all types of dms to observe their formation both on the surface and within the pores of pms sem images allow for analysis of deposition uniformity and thickness and also identification of fouling patterns kim et al 2008 as well as tolerance to backwashing ajmani et al 2012 gallagher et al 2013 image analysis software such as imagej has also been used in conjunction with sem to determine the pore size distribution of the deposited dm ajmani et al 2012 2014 the atomic force microscopy afm is popular for characterizing the surface of dms specifically surface roughness ba et al 2010 bai et al 2015 deng et al 2008 kwon et al 2009 and surface pore size distribution deng et al 2008 which provides an indication of the antifouling capabilities of a dm bai et al 2015 deng et al 2008 techniques to determine the surface chemical composition of dms include fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ba et al 2010 bai et al 2015 deng et al 2008 igawa et al 1977 zhang and zhao 2017 and x ray spectroscopy bai et al 2015 zhang and zhao 2017 2 3 factors affecting dm formation 2 3 1 dm material 2 3 1 1 effect of dm material concentration the concentration of dm material in the feed stream played an important role in dm formation a higher dm material concentration was observed to lead to a thicker dm layer cai et al 2000 pan et al 2015 however pan et al 2015 reported that with increasing dm material concentration the uniformity of the dm thickness decreased with increasing dm material concentration a greater dm mass was expectedly obtained zhao et al 2006 and the dm formed more quickly noor et al 2002 however increasing the dm concentration led to a dm with greater resistance al malack and anderson 1997b ma et al 2015 and a sharp decline in permeate cai et al 2000 but an increase in stability al malack and anderson 1997b in the case of dual or hybrid dms the changes in concentration of the material of the second layer has been shown to not affect permeation flux during its formation for the metal oxide polymer dms tanny and johnson james 1978 moreover it has also been observed that the presence of an additional polymer improved the overall structural integrity of a dm tanny and johnson james 1978 2 3 1 2 effect of dm material size regarding particle sizes the particle size distribution psd of a dm was narrower and the average diameter lesser than those of the feed stream wu et al 2017 the average particle diameter of the particles deposited as the dm was lesser than that in the feed suspension since smaller particles had a greater tendency to deposit on the membrane regarding the effect of particle diameter of the feed constituents smaller particle diameters have been tied to greater dm resistance ajmani et al 2012 zhao et al 2005b leading to lower permeate flux yang et al 2011 zhao et al 2005b and mechanically stronger dms nakao et al 1986 with respect to the effect of permeation on psd as the permeate flux through the dm increased the psd of the dm narrowed holdich and boston 1990 2 3 1 3 summary in summary larger concentrations and smaller particle diameters of the dm material led to thicker but non uniform and mechanically stronger dms at the cost of increased resistance hence a balance between the quality of the dm formed and the desirable quantity of permeate flux needs to be maintained when operating dm filtration the effects of other physico chemical properties of dm materials on their formation have been scarcely reported with only one study reporting that the formation time of a dm increased as the hydrophobicity of the dm material increased al malack and anderson 1998 the interaction of the dm material with the feed solvent and the pm especially in the case of dual polymeric dms also plays an important role in dm formation especially if the two layers of the dm do not have chemical affinity towards each other and interact unstably ozari et al 1977 more research concerning these effects is necessary 2 3 2 structure of pm 2 3 2 1 effect of pm pore size and tube diameter pore diameter has been reported to be the most important property of the pm affecting formation of dms johnson et al 1968 dms formed more easily johnson et al 1972 and quickly altman et al 1999 cai et al 2000 rumyantsev et al 2000 and also gave better performance in terms of solute rejection altman et al 1999 igawa et al 1978 on pms with smaller pores pore diameters for the formation of class ii dms typically ranged from a few tenths of a micron to a few microns el nashar 1977 johnson et al 1968 the influence of pm pore diameter on dm thickness is not yet clearly understood with contradictory reports of dm thickness increasing altman et al 1999 or varying non monotonically freilich and tanny 1978b with decreasing pm pore diameter what is however known is pore diameter variability in pms always affects flux adversely freilich and tanny 1978b wilde et al 1988 ultimately affecting dm thickness even a small proportion of pores larger than the mean diameter have been observed to affect dm formation and performance negatively johnson et al 1968 in case of tubular pms the inner diameter of the tube also affected dm formation with increasing inner diameter making dm formation more and more difficult dahlheimer et al 1970 2 3 2 2 effect of pm strength and texture the physical properties of the primary membrane also affected the formation of dm as evident from two observations relating to the texture and strength of pms i xu et al 2013 reported that the formation time for a polyaluminum chloride dm on a non woven fabric filter was less than that on a dacron polyester mesh because the latter was slippery i e less resistance to particle interception and thereby the dm particles took more time to lodge into the mesh pores and ii diaper et al 1996 used five different pms namely carbon tube carbosep stainless steel mesh coated with ceramic ceramesh polyurethane coated with polyester weave primapor multifilament weave and polymer unspecified to form a hydrous zr iv oxide paa dm for ro and found that the woven pms like multifilament weave and primapor formed unstable dms due to distortion of fibers by the high pressure during formation and subsequent enlargement of pores while the non woven pms like carbosep ceramesh and polymer formed stable dms however it has also been observed that the properties of the pm do not affect dm performance significantly holdich and boston 1990 2 3 2 3 summary in summary a pm with smaller pores and rougher surface favored better class ii dm formation however this conclusion is based largely on zr iv polymer dms which have mostly been investigated for ro and effect of pm structure has not been explored for other dm materials since the particles forming class i dms are much larger than the pm pores pm pore size is not expected to have a significant effect on class i dm formation however pm surface roughness and strength may still have a considerable impact these effects have still not been investigated in the more recent publications employing class i dms for uf and mf applications such studies would be useful in the selection of the most compatible pm dm pairs for these operations 2 3 3 ph 2 3 3 1 effect of ph on dual dms whereas single layered dms can be deposited at a range of ph values with accordingly varying properties the formation of dual dms has been observed to be critically dependent on ph as the deposition of paa onto the zr iv dm involved changes in the paa molecules that were important for the paa to attach to zr iv after the deposition of the zr iv dm the ph was reduced to 2 so that the paa chains were coiled and able to penetrate into the pores of the zr iv layer altman et al 1999 the incremental increase of ph to neutrality after specific durations of time johnson et al 1972 caused the coiled paa molecules to ionize and expand into the pores of the deposited zr iv layer thus forming a dual zr iv paa dm with significantly lower permeability nomura and shoji kimura 1980 and increased salt rejection capabilities wilde et al 1988 2 3 3 2 effect of ph on dm resistance the relationship between the resistance of the formed dm and the ph at which it was formed was different for different dm materials polymer dms have been reported to exhibit contrasting behaviors towards changes in ph for example for paa dms decreasing ph led to a denser dm formation increased resistance since the repulsion between paa molecules decreased and thereby packed more compactly igawa et al 1978 on the other hand for methylcellulose the effect of ph on membrane formation was not pronounced igawa et al 1978 for metal oxide dms in particular hydrous zr iv oxide the dm resistance exhibited a non monotonic relationship with increasing ph namely increased peaked at ph 3 5 and then decreased freilich and tanny 1980 an optimum ph between 3 2 and 3 8 was recommended for such dms the low resistances at a high ph were due to increased particle size whereas the lower resistances at very low ph were attributed to the repulsion of zr particles freilich and tanny 1980 for dual metal oxide polymer dms the flux decreased with increasing ph indicating an increase in resistance which can be explained by the expansion of the paa molecules into the zr pores as mentioned earlier nomura and shoji kimura 1980 2 3 3 3 effect of ph on dm particle size the feed ph has had an important influence on the particle size of the dm with the dm particle size known to increase with increasing ph al malack and anderson 1997b altman et al 1999 freilich and tanny 1980 rumyantsev et al 2000 turkson et al 1989 this effect has especially been observed for metal oxide dms with rumyantsev et al 2000 and freilich and tanny 1980 recording an increase in the dm particle size with increasing ph for a hydrous zr iv oxide dm and al malack and anderson 1997c noting an increased dm particle size for mno2 dm on polyester tubes this was attributed to agglomeration of dm particles at higher ph values al malack and anderson 1997b rumyantsev et al 2000 accordingly the type of pm used to deposit a dm depends strongly on the ph a mf pm should typically be used at a lower ph to successfully deposit the sub micron particles whereas a mesh pm would work fine if the ph is higher than 4 5 rumyantsev et al 2000 2 3 3 4 effect of ph on dm formation time in terms of dm formation time a higher ph usually indicated faster dm formation al malack and anderson 1997b cai et al 2000 freilich and tanny 1980 this was due to the different periods of duration required for the dm material from the suspension to settle or deposit onto the pm surface for example in the case of mno2 dms the precipitation of mno2 proceeded via two steps mno4 mn 2 mno2 at a lower ph whereas via a single step mno4 mno2 at higher ph values cai et al 2000 however while the dm formation time decreased with increasing ph the dm formed was more uniform and compact at a lower acidic ph but less dense at a higher basic ph cai et al 2000 2 3 3 5 summary in summary ph played an extremely important role in the formation of dual salt rejecting dms where the formation of the second layer of the dm depended on the careful adjustment of ph during the deposition process for single layered dms generally acidic ph values of greater than 3 have been recommended for the formation of dms however there may be some exceptions like mg oh 2 dms on ceramic al2o3 tubes where the dms were stable in alkaline environments and were re dispersed or destroyed at ph levels below 5 zhao et al 2005b the effect of ph on the formation of the more recent class i dms has not yet been investigated and past reports on using various class i dms prescribe conditions for their deposition that are specific only to the system they have investigated future efforts on this would help gain insights into the optimum ph values needed to form these dms 2 3 4 hydrodynamics 2 3 4 1 cross flow velocity cross flow velocity had a direct effect on the thickness of the dm formed with dm layer thickness freilich and tanny 1978b igawa et al 1978 noor et al 2002 pan et al 2015 rumyantsev et al 2000 wu et al 2017 zhao et al 2006 or mass wu et al 2017 increasing with decreasing feed velocity however too low a velocity resulted in non uniform dm deposition on the pm pan et al 2015 moreover increasing permeate turbidity with increasing cross flow velocity during the coating process was reported which was attributed to the increased amount of dm material in the permeate at higher velocities due to higher shear chu et al 2012 regarding the interplay between cross flow velocity and dm particle size the average particle diameter of the dm has been shown to be less than that of the feed and further decreased with increasing cross flow velocity wu et al 2017 this is because as cross flow velocity is increased the average diameter of the dm particles sheared off the pm increased due to shear induced diffusion effects 2 3 4 2 pressure the greater the transmembrane pressure tmp across the pm the greater was the driving force the greater was the flux through the pm el nashar 1977 wu et al 2017 and the greater was the compaction experienced by the dynamic layer pan et al 2015 hence dms formed at a greater tmp were found to be thinner pan et al 2015 but were denser igawa et al 1977 and had greater specific mass wu et al 2017 zhao et al 2006 than those formed at a lower tmp this resulted directly in the increase in the resistance of such a dm which produced lower permeate fluxes studies employing metal oxide nakao et al 1986 wilde et al 1988 pac wu et al 2017 polymer igawa et al 1977 and dual layer dms johnson et al 1972 have reported lower fluxes during filtration when using dms formed at high tmps with increasing tmp flux decreased rapidly at first with the rate of drop decreasing gradually igawa et al 1977 2 3 4 3 summary in summary a reasonably low cross flow velocity yielded thicker dms and high formation pressure yielded dms with greater specific mass in case of dead end systems the cross flow velocity is not applicable and pressure is the sole hydrodynamic factor on which dm formation depends however for cross flow systems a balance between permeate flux pressure adjustment and retentate flux adjustment of cross flow velocity must be achieved to obtain the optimum dm in other words the tmp must be sufficiently high to get a dm with sufficient specific mass while at the same time the cross flow velocity needs to be sufficient to achieve uniform deposition 2 3 5 interplay between various factors table 2 summarizes the important factors affecting dm formation and their effect on six dm properties namely dm specific mass which has also been represented in the form of dm thickness dm particle size dm uniformity dm formation speed dm strength dm permeability and rejection the property impacted by the most number of factors 6 is dm specific mass whereas the factor on which the most number of properties depend is dm material concentration however most authors have investigated the effect of these factors in isolation and where studies have considered multiple parameters they have determined the optimum conditions by trial and error altman et al 1999 polom 2013 zhang and zhao 2017 zhao et al 2006 hence the combined effect of all factors on dm properties has been difficult to predict ersahin et al 2012 there have nevertheless been some efforts lonsdale 1973 noor et al 2002 pan et al 2012 2015 wu et al 2017 to study the effects of at least some of these factors in combination two examples illustrating the usefulness of this are as follows i the control of influencing factors could be prioritized according to the dm requirement pan et al 2012 determined that controlling formation tmp was more important than cross flow velocity to obtain a dm with better permeability while controlling the latter was more important to obtain a dm with better rejection ii the choice of pm could be made based on the ph of dm formation for example a lower ph during formation gave a dm with smaller particles hence a pm with smaller pores would be ideal for depositing such a dm rumyantsev et al 2000 attempts to determine the most dominant factor influencing a specific dm property have led to contradicting conclusions to illustrate one study pan et al 2015 found that the cross flow velocity was the most dominant factor determining the specific mass of a class i dm whereas another study found that factor to be tmp wu et al 2017 hence future studies need to consider larger combinations of parameters and operating conditions to identify the dominant influencing factors that would be generally applicable to a wider range of dm systems in addition the effect of chemical properties of the dm material on their formation has sparsely been reported but has been shown to play an important role al malack and anderson 1998 ozari et al 1977 moreover the effects of electrostatic interactions between the dm material and pm have also not been reported further research on these aspects is thus necessary 2 4 dm regeneration one of the advantages of dms as mentioned earlier is that they can easily be removed and a new dm can be deposited onto the pm some authors have also attempted to clean the dm itself and reuse the same dm for subsequent runs but the methods have been less successful than those involving completely removing the used dm various cleaning methods employed for different dm systems are given below 2 4 1 reusing the same dm various methods to clean the dm and reuse it for the subsequent runs have been attempted though the success rate is low unsuccessful techniques were i switching the circulation pump on and off repeatedly which led to collapse of pm walls causing parts of the dm to get destabilized and dislodge ii circulation of tap water which caused bits of the dm to dislodge and enter the circulation tank iii sulfuric acid cleaning which also caused dm dislodgement and iv air scouring which caused shearing away of the dm material or stretching of the polyester tube pm leading to pore expansion and dislodgement of the dm al malack and anderson 1997a two partially successful techniques useful for inorganic dms were i calcination at high temperatures 200 400 c causing the volatile oil components to be removed and thus leaving the dm clean enough to be reused with 10 reduction in performance zhang et al 2018b and ii alkaline cleaning with naoh for 5 min and fenton reagent a combination of ferric ions and hydrogen peroxide for 15 min with up to 52 flux recovery soesanto et al 2019 2 4 2 removing used dm from pm physical cleaning by brushes the outside surface of the tubular pm can be cleaned by brushes while circulating water through the channels this technique dislodged all of the dm material and the pm is returned to its original condition on which a new dm can be deposited al malack and anderson 1997a acid cleaning the most commonly used acid was hydrochloric acid hcl ba et al 2010 cai et al 2000 higher acid concentrations drastically reduced cleaning time cai et al 2000 an advantage of acid cleaning was that waste acid from other processes was employed as cleaning agents for dms cai et al 2000 however the effectiveness of acid cleaning greatly depended on the dm and type of fouling for instance it was observed ba et al 2010 that for a pva dm 100 flux could be restored for bovine serum albumin bsa fouling but not for humic acid ha or sodium alginate sa fouling for a polyvinyl sulfate potassium salt pvs dm 100 flux was restored after bsa and ha fouling but not sa fouling and for a paa dm flux could not be restored indicating fouling could not be effectively cleared off by hcl backwashing by water or air the use of water either via in situ backwashing lee et al 2002 lu et al 2016 or ex situ washing aghili et al 2017 and air backwashing chu et al 2012 has proven to be effective in cleaning fouled dms more than 80 of the original flux could be regained after several runs a combination of water and air comprising a specific protocol of four steps namely water backwash flushing air injection and short rest periods all within 1 min has also been used successfully and was able to achieve 100 flux recovery even after many runs malczewska et al 2015 combination if the chemical nature of the dm and or foulant is known a combination of backwashing and chemical cleaning can be used for example a backwash of alkalescent water ph 8 0 employed to clean an fe2o3 dm used to treat oily wastewater caused an 8 increase in the flux recovery rate as compared to a backwash with only deionized di water ba et al 2010 the alkaline environment caused the dm material to become negatively charged repulsing the oil droplets as well as the pm surface causing the dm along with the oily foulant to be carried off 2 4 3 summary removing the fouled dm completely and recoating a fresh dm has been more successful than cleaning and reusing the same dm various methods including physical cleaning acid cleaning and backwashing flushing with air and or water have been employed to clear off used dms except for one study al malack and anderson 1997a none has focused exclusively on dm cleaning and different authors have set their own procedures empirically as can be seen some procedures have been more successful than others furthermore standards in terms of flux decline and the point of initiating the cleaning process have been ad hoc a systematic research on factors influencing the success of cleaning procedures and identifying key parameters to initiate cleaning would help in increasing the efficiency of dm filtration 2 5 variations to dm systems several authors have used some other techniques in conjunction with dms via modified or hybrid systems to improve dm performance additives have been used during the formation of dms or filtration through them to aid their formation enhance their performance or reduce costs of dm systems addition of salts have aided formation by increasing dm material rejection on the pm igawa et al 1978 addition of coagulants e g alum polyaluminum silicate sulfate pass have helped increase permeate flux al malack and anderson 1996a and improve performance al malack et al 1998 and the addition of reductants e g sodium formate have aided formation as well as performance cai et al 2000 most surfactants except sodium dodecyl sulfate sds have proven to be detrimental to dm filtration luppino and spencer 1982 the use of filter aids e g cellulose asbestos perlite diatomite have enabled the use of meshes with up to 50 μm openings as pms thus decreasing overall cost dahlheimer et al 1970 johnson et al 1968 rotating modules and application of electric fields have helped in moving solute particles or molecules away from the dm turkson et al 1989 the introduction of intermittent vibrations have aided in dislodging saturated dm particles and exposing the fresh particles underneath thus consistently maintaining performance at optimum levels shi and benjamin 2008 turbulence promoters which are physical entities on the feed side of the membrane have been used to enhance dm performance in terms of rejection and flux thomas et al 1970 thomas and watson 1968 only about 7 of the publications on dms employ some kind of modifications furthermore turbulence promoters have not been employed by authors since the 1970s hence further research on applying existing variations to more dm systems and developing new such techniques is warranted future research could also investigate parameters and design considerations choosing the appropriate variation for a dm system and the corresponding quantifiable economic benefits and the applicability of combinations of such modifications 2 6 perspectives the following directions for future research are suggested with regard to formation and regeneration of dms firstly the mechanism for the deposition of class i dms has not been extensively explored understanding quantitatively how class i dms form will help in optimizing their formation procedures secondly as seen from table 2 the influence of many factors on the various aspects of dm formation has not been studied yet for example the effect of the structure of the pm on dm formation for the more recent dms involving uf mf has not been studied moreover the effect of chemical properties of the dm material on their formation has sparsely been reported but has been shown to play an important role al malack and anderson 1998 ozari et al 1977 effects of electrostatic interactions between the dm material and the pm have also not been reported such studies will be useful in the selection of the most compatible pm dm pairs for these operations thirdly in view of the importance of identifying key parameters for triggering dm regeneration and choosing the most suitable and efficient procedure for doing so systematic research exclusively focusing on these aspects is recommended fourthly all research exploring dm formation in tubular modules has focused on single channel modules multi channel modules come with their unique challenges like ensuring uniform distribution of feed to all channels to be relevant commercially studies focused on the hydrodynamics and design aspects of dm formation and performance in multi tube modules are imperative with respect to modified dm systems further research is recommended on applying one or a combination of existing variations to more dm systems 3 fouling mitigation membrane fouling is an inevitable part of any membrane filtration process various methods for fouling mitigation have been studied in literature the presence of dms which act as an adsorbing protective layer against foulants helps mitigate the fouling of the pms a schematic illustrating how dms mitigate fouling is presented in fig 5 showing the deposition of dm saturation of dm by foulants and finally the removal of the dm 3 1 pac haops and hiops natural organic matter nom has long been considered a major concern in water treatment as it can manifest as biofouling and serve as a precursor for the formation of chlorinated disinfection by products dbps the effect of the removal of nom on fouling thus warrants investigation the rate of fouling by feed water treated with conventional batch adsorption has been shown to be greater than that of feed water filtered through a dm which was attributed to the physical presence of the adsorbents on the pm that removed non adsorbable foulants kim et al 2008 pac pre treatment has widely been used to remove nom from feed waters however while some authors reported effective fouling mitigation acero et al 2012 konieczny and klomfas 2002 lee et al 2007 others reported either no effect matsui et al 2006 on fouling or worsened fouling li and chen 2004 zhao et al 2005a in particular when pac was used as dms whether self formed or pre deposited most authors reported that pac was ineffective in mitigating fouling though organics were more effectively removed than other adsorbents a sharp decline in permeate flux was observed when pac was mixed with the feed williams joseph et al 2005 zhang et al 2018a in some cases the presence of the pac dm caused unreasonable flux reduction ellerie et al 2013 moreover pac was unable to prevent irreversible fouling caused by humic acid ha from synthetic yiantsios and karabelas 2001 as well as real sea water wu et al 2017 feeds a study reported that though a pac dm performed better than a bare polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf membrane loss in permeate flux of at least 48 due to ha fouling was observed in just the second cycle soesanto et al 2019 also colloidal nom could not be adsorbed onto pac which has been identified as a significant contributor to fouling lin et al 1999 nilson and digiano 1996 pac dms have achieved more success in fouling mitigation in hollow fiber pm modules where it was observed that the reduction in permeate flux was less than half that in mixed adsorption systems thiruvenkatachari et al 2006 in gravity driven membrane filtration gdm ding et al 2018 shao et al 2017 the reduced flux caused by increased fouling due to pac dms was outweighed by their superior nom removal capabilities furthermore compared to sand which is traditionally used as dm in gdm pac dms reduced irreversible fouling in the pm shao et al 2017 heated aluminum oxide particles haops and heated iron oxide particles hiops have been the most successfully used dm materials to counter pm fouling in mf uf systems it has been found through a series of studies cai and benjamin 2011 cai et al 2008 2013 kim et al 2008 2010 liu and benjamin 2016 malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 modarresi and benjamin 2018 shi and benjamin 2008 wang and benjamin 2016 by benjamin and co workers that haops and hiops performed much better as dms than a slew of other materials such as pac sio2 fecl3 and ion exchange ix resins in fouling mitigation in fact an sio2 dm fouled more rapidly than the bare membrane because the non adsorbent particles combined with coagulated nom to form a gel solid layer at the membrane solution interface with low permeability kim et al 2008 however a comparison of pac haops and hiops as dm materials to counter fouling calls for greater scrutiny as the former removed much greater dissolved organic carbon doc than the latter two kim et al 2008 as seen from fig 6 the rate of increase of resistance i e fouling was greater for pac than haops or hiops suggesting that the pac dm fouled more rapidly that the other two this was attributed to the fact that haops and hiops adsorbed foulants preferentially over non foulant molecules while pac did the opposite fig 6 as a result greater overall removal of foulants was achieved with haops and hiops than with pac even though the highest removal of doc was achieved by the pac this is evident from the sem images in fig 6 where the pm appears more fouled after filtration through the pac dm than the metal oxide dms studies with surrogate foulants like alginate cai and benjamin 2011 and fractionated nom wang and benjamin 2016 also attest to the fact that heated metal oxide particles like haops make better dms for fouling mitigation dual haops and pac dms were shown to be even more effective on feed waters containing nom having a range of suva254 absorbance at 254 nm divided by the dissolved organic carbon concentration values with the system performance improved in terms of both nom removal and foulant resistance compared to the system with haops only cai et al 2008 this was attributed to each adsorbent preferentially removing specific noms specifically with haops selectively adsorbing the higher suva254 nom fraction while pac the lower suva254 fraction this was further confirmed by a recent study modarresi and benjamin 2018 that investigated the effect of varying ratios of the two adsorbents in the dual dm they found that the overall nom removal for the dual haops pac dm was greater than that of the individual haops and pac dms and also that haops and pac had stronger affinities for different components of the nom which improved the overall removal of nom nom removal was heavily reliant on the haops pac ratio in the dm with removal varying non monotonically as the proportion of haops increased peaking at an optimal 1 1 ratio in summary haops hiops and pac have been the most common dm materials used in fouling mitigation haops dms were the most effective in capturing foulant nom fractions pac dms though capable of removing more nom from the feed than haops were relatively less effective in capturing the nom fractions tied to severe fouling when haops pac dual dms were employed the twin benefits of increased nom removal and fouling mitigation were obtained haops dms have also been successfully employed as pre treatments to minimize fouling in uf mf systems future studies may focus on investigating these dms in the industrially relevant multi channel tubular systems and quantitative understanding of the adsorption processes on haops and hiops dms 3 2 carbon nanotubes carbon nanotubes cnts have been extensively used as standalone membranes or in conjunction with ceramic or polymer membranes as composite membranes where they were permanently immobilized e g embedded grafted on these membranes ihsanullah 2019 however standalone cnt membranes suffered from structural issues like irregular alignment whereas composite membranes affected or weakened the properties of cnts ihsanullah 2019 cnt dms seem to alleviate both these problems since the pm while providing structural support does not interfere with the properties of cnts despite this there are relatively fewer studies using cnt dms to counter nom fouling single walled cnts swcnts multi wall cnts mwcnts and mwcnts modified with surfactant s mwcnt ammonia group mwcnt nh2 and carboxyl group mwcnt cooh have been explored ajmani et al 2012 in terms of fouling all the cnt dm membrane systems outperformed the bare membrane except s mwcnt among the cnts it was reported that the unmodified mwcnts the mwcnt nh2 and swcnts performed similarly and better than the mwcnt cooh in terms of fouling the s mwcnts performed poorer than all other cnts due to the even and dense distribution which declined the baseline permeation flux larger mwcnts were more capable of fouling mitigation due to the formation of a homogeneous dm as opposed to a heterogeneous one by smaller mwcnts thereby allowing for better coverage of the pm and better adsorption of nom ajmani et al 2014 furthermore larger mwcnts adsorbed the large molecular weight nom with high fouling potential whereas the smaller mwcnts adsorbed the lower molecular weight nom with lower fouling potential a higher mwcnt loading improved the anti fouling performance of the system due to greater nom removal while the increase in tmp was minimal which allowed for the use of maximum loading during filtration operations mwcnt dms have also been used to study the effect of model foulants like bsa ha and sa bai et al 2015 the mwcnts were modified with polyethylene glycol mwcnt peg and carboxylated groups mwcnt cooh in terms of ha fouling the mwcnt peg dm exhibited the best anti fouling due to the presence of a large number of hydrophilic groups on the mwcnt peg dm for bsa fouling the mwcnt cooh dm displayed the best anti fouling performance due to both bsa and dm being negatively charged thus preventing the foulant penetration due to electrostatic repulsion all dms exhibited relatively poor anti fouling performance for sa due its internal cross linking however the mwcnt cooh dm fared better than the others similarly due to its large negative charge carbon nanofibers cnfs modified by ethanol showed good anti fouling capabilities with respect to both bsa and sa and a permeate flux of more than 90 of the initial value an increase in the anti fouling performance was expectedly observed with increasing surface loading of the dm material liu et al 2018 in summary swcnts and mwcnts have effectively been used as dms to control fouling during filtration of surface water as well as fouling due to bsa ha and sa anti fouling capabilities of mwcnts improved with increasing diameter future studies could focus on improving the stability of cnt dms on flat sheet pms as well as exploring the anti fouling potential of nanoparticle dms in tubular modules which are more industrially relevant 3 3 others other dm materials such as pva ba et al 2010 na et al 2000 nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi ma et al 2015 aluminum flocs ma et al 2017 paa and hydrous zr iv oxide paa altman et al 1999 pvs ba et al 2010 and co polymers akamatsu et al 2011 2013 have been employed to mitigate fouling these systems have been tested for anti fouling by bsa ha and sa which are popular fouling surrogates these dms could target only specific foulants e g nzvi targeted ha ma et al 2015 paa offered better anti fouling for ha and sa than bsa pva mitigated bsa fouling but not ha and sa pvs prevented bsa and sa fouling but not ha ba et al 2010 the aforementioned dms have only been used to test fouling mitigation with synthetic foulant feeds further research needs to be done on the effectiveness of these dms on real wastewater feeds 3 4 perspectives several recommendations for future research pertaining to fouling mitigation by dms can be made firstly most of the studies investigating fouling mitigation by dms have employed flat sheet pms there have been a few recent studies malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 wang and benjamin 2016 using haops dms on tubular pms but none for other dm materials future studies may focus on fouling mitigation by different dms in single and multi channel tubular modules secondly though there have been some qualitative studies cai and benjamin 2011 cai et al 2013 kim et al 2010 and only two recent quantitative investigations ma et al 2019 modarresi and benjamin 2018 on the adsorption of foulants on haops dms more such quantitative insights for a variety of dms and foulants will be useful in optimizing run times and identifying the threshold to initiate cleaning thirdly the effect of ph on the fouling mitigation performance of dms has scarcely been reported though has been shown to be important in the removal of nom liu and benjamin 2016 ma et al 2015 future studies investigating the effect of ph on the anti fouling capabilities of different dms will enable their optimum utilization fourthly nanoparticle dms especially cnts were found to be unstable on flat sheet pms and authors have expressed concern over their large scale applicability future work could focus on improving the stability and adherence to flat sheet as well as tubular pms fifthly polymer based dms e g paa polyvinyl alcohol have only been tested for their anti fouling capabilities on model foulants like bsa ha and sa future research testing polymer based dms with real world feeds e g lake water wastewater will help ascertain their practical utility finally studies on the economic viability of dms performing fouling mitigation and comparisons of their performance against conventional fouling mitigation techniques will further enhance their industrial practicality 4 applications in this section dms involving ro nf uf and mf membranes are reviewed in terms of their applications for solute rejection industrial effluent treatment water and wastewater treatment oily wastewater treatment and other miscellaneous applications fig 7 summarizes the number of dm systems used for the various applications to reflect the focus to date previous reviews have analyzed the overall effect of various factors on dm performance ersahin et al 2012 li et al 2018a the effect of some factors may be dependent only on the dm material or pm but that of some others may be dependent on the feed for example while temperature had no effect on rejection of salts in solute rejection applications it affected salt rejection in industrial effluent treatment therefore this review summarizes the impact of various factors based on the type of application 4 1 solute rejection 4 1 1 dms employed for solute rejection membrane performance is commonly measured in terms of rejection of the unwanted component in the feed solution fig 8 gives an overview of the key dms used for solute rejection the earliest and widest application of dms has been in ro for salt rejection nacl has by far been the most common solute used to test the rejection capabilities of dms antoniou et al 1980 cabellon et al 1971 dahlheimer et al 1970 deng et al 2008 freilich and tanny 1978a b 1980 igawa et al 1977 igawa et al 1978 johnson et al 1972 kraus et al 1966 marcinkowsky et al 1966 nomura and shoji kimura 1980 ozari et al 1977 sachs et al 1969 sachs and lonsdale 1971 shor et al 1968a shor et al 1968b tanny and johnson james 1978 thomas and mixon 1972 other popular solutes included various salts e g mgcl2 dahlheimer et al 1970 deng et al 2008 igawa et al 1977 johnson et al 1968 marcinkowsky et al 1966 ozari et al 1977 sachs et al 1969 sachs and lonsdale 1971 shor et al 1968a shor et al 1968b thomas and watson 1968 nano3 van

kova 1995 knyazkova and kavitskaya 2000 kraus et al 1966 marcinkowsky et al 1966 sachs et al 1969 sachs and lonsdale 1971 shor et al 1968b and various sugars e g glucose kuppers et al 1967 nakao et al 1982 nomura and shoji kimura 1980 yamagiwa et al 1989 raffinose ba et al 2010 kuppers et al 1967 nakao et al 1982 1986 yamagiwa et al 1989 and galactose ba et al 2010 dms have also been used to reject polyethylene glycol tsapiuk 1996 van oers et al 1995 yamagiwa et al 1989 and atrazine ellerie et al 2013 among single layered dms the polymer dms consistently gave a better performance than hydrous zr iv oxide dms in terms of rejecting both salts and sugars an important advantage for polymer dms rejecting organic solutes was that the rejection of these dms was primarily a function of the molecular weight of the solute with greater rejection obtained for heavier solutes while hydrous zr iv oxide and polymer dms were versatile in their removal of different solutes some dms like methylcellulose and gelatin targeted specific solutes like sulfate salts and polyethylene glycol respectively dual layered dms typically gave better salt and organic solute rejections than single layered ones the formation of an ionic bond between the carboxyl group of paa and the basic metal ions enhanced salt rejection igawa et al 1977 in the case of organic solute rejection the second dm material e g paa served as a means to reduce the pore size of the first dm e g hydrous zr iv oxide so that the resulting dm not only retained more solute but also was mechanically stronger altman et al 1999 triple layered dms performed worse than dual layered membranes with the dm of co polymers paa poly styrenesulfonic acid pssa paa giving 90 nacl rejection ozari et al 1977 4 1 2 factors affecting dm solute rejection the factors affecting dms performing solute rejection are ph feed concentration pressure temperature dm material concentration dm particle size dm coating time pm structure and the time elapsed between dm formation and deployment regarding the effect of ph on the rejection performance of dms for salts the rejection generally increased with ph johnson et al 1972 shor et al 1968b the relationship is much less clear for organic solute rejection performance with only one report available which reported a peak in performance at neutral ph wang et al 1999 increasing feed concentration decreased rejection correia and judd 1996b drioli et al 1975 el nashar 1977 johnson et al 1972 kraus et al 1966 sachs et al 1969 while increasing operating pressure increased rejection deng et al 2008 knyazkova and kavitskaya 2000 kraus et al 1967 sachs et al 1969 while the cross flow velocity knyazkova and kavitskaya 2000 and operating temperature johnson et al 1972 nomura and shoji kimura 1980 did not have any significant effect on rejection increasing the latter increased permeate flux due to the viscosity of the filtrate decreasing johnson et al 1972 nomura and shoji kimura 1980 increasing the concentration of dm material and dm coating time increased rejection igawa et al 1978 nakao et al 1982 wang et al 1999 but decreased flux igawa et al 1978 a smaller particle size of the deposited dm rumyantsev et al 2000 and a tighter fabric altman et al 1999 rumyantsev et al 2000 for the pm also increased rejection lower rejections were reported when dms were dried or stored in water for extended periods of time rumyantsev et al 2000 4 1 3 summary in summary almost all dms were able to reject more than one salt or organic solute dual zr polyelectrolyte dms gave the best performance in terms of salt rejection and polymer dms were most suitable for organic solute rejection the effect of ph is clear for salt rejecting dms with increasing ph giving higher rejections whereas it is not clear with regard to organic solutes and further investigations are needed the use of dms for salt rejection has declined in recent years but they continue to show good potential for rejection of high molecular weight organic solutes 4 2 industrial effluent treatment 4 2 1 dms used in industrial effluent treatment the advantages of dms in treating industrial effluents include high temperature stability long service life of the support tube dm replaceability in situ availability of a range of dms for tailoring to a particular application and high membrane flux rates groves et al 1983 despite the advantages dms offer studies on dms used for treating industrial effluents are few however within the limited number of studies available dms have been shown to be useful in treating a variety of industrial effluents including dye effluents brandon et al 1981 textile dyeing wastewater el nashar 1980 polymer manufacturing effluent groves et al 1983 polyester dyeing effluent groves et al 1983 wool scouring effluent groves et al 1983 and industrial stripped gas liquor van reenen and sanderson 1989a dms have also been successfully tested with synthetic pollutants in removing color brandon et al 1981 de amorim and ramos 2006 ellerie et al 2013 halogens gao et al 2013 and sodium acetate wang et al 1998 zr iv polymer dual dms appeared to be the most suitable for treating industrial effluents especially since they were capable of removing multiple pollutants thus industrial effluents which typically comprise of a variety pollutants can be effectively treated using a single dm a venn diagram summarizing the dms capable of rejecting multiple components is given in fig 9 specifically the most versatile dm was hydrous zr iv oxide poly acrylic acid covinyl alcohol which rejected over 80 of sulfate sodium potassium calcium magnesium ammonia chloride fluoride nitrates phosphates acetic acid propionic acid among others from an industrial stripped gas liquor van reenen and sanderson 1989a hydrous zr iv oxide paa dms were also applied on a wide variety of effluents with capabilities to reject more than 90 of color from synthetic brandon et al 1981 and real brandon et al 1981 el nashar 1980 groves et al 1983 dye effluents over 90 of total solids groves et al 1983 up to 62 of sodium and potassium ions groves et al 1983 up to 50 of acetic acid groves et al 1983 and 100 of grease and suspended solids groves et al 1983 among others a dm composed of fine zr particles was able to reject 99 color 93 dissolved solids and 45 acetic acid from alkaline wastewater whereas a nano caco3 dm removed up to 90 br and 99 cl from a halogenated feed gao et al 2013 apart from the four dms mentioned above all others reported in literature aghili et al 2017 cai et al 2000 de amorim and ramos 2006 ellerie et al 2013 kryvoruchko et al 2004 mikhlin and tanny 1979 nyobe et al 2019 wang et al 1998 demonstrated abilities to reject only a single component 4 2 2 factors affecting industrial effluent treatment by dm the effect of various factors on treating industrial effluents by dm have not been extensively studied presumably due to the complex nature of the feeds and large number of components simultaneously rejected by these dms some studies report on the effect of operating pressure temperature ph dm material feed concentration and cross flow velocity on the performance of dms rejection of various components like salt doc color ammonia and urea increased with an increase in operating pressure for a zr iv paa dm el nashar 1977 1980 whereas the dye rejection performance of a pac dm worsened with increasing pressure nyobe et al 2019 while the permeate flux increased with increasing temperature due to decreased viscosity el nashar 1977 1980 its effect on rejection was different for different components increasing temperature had no effect on the rejection of color ammonia or urea but decreased the rejection of salts and doc el nashar 1977 this is in contrast to solute rejection where temperature had no effect on salt retention this could be due to the presence of additional components in an industrial effluent but further research is required to ascertain this increasing ph values increased color and lactic acid rejections by polymer and dual dms de amorim and ramos 2006 polom 2013 with regard to cross flow velocity it was reported to have no effect on dm rejection el nashar 1977 4 2 3 summary there are relatively fewer studies on dms treating industrial effluents but dual dms especially hydrous zr iv polymer have shown tremendous versatility in terms of the number of components rejected this highlights the need to do further research on dms by treating a variety of industrial effluents and exploring dms targeted at particular pollutants from these effluents furthermore compared to the number of components rejected knowledge on the effect of various operating conditions on the performance of these dms is limited since different industrial effluents are of different compositions and are released at varying ph values temperatures pressures and viscosities the exploration of the effect of these is critical 4 3 treatment of water and wastewater 4 3 1 dms used in water and wastewater treatment applicability of dms has recently been shown for treatment of surface water as well as domestic wastewater the chief functionality of such dms is the removal of organic matter from contaminated water the widely accepted parameters for measuring dm performance are removal of doc or total organic carbon toc the most commonly used indicator of permeate quality in domestic wastewaters is turbidity measured in nephelometric turbidity units ntu with a turbidity of 0 2 ntu post treatment considered acceptable inorganic metal compounds al malack and anderson 1996a b 1997a b c 1998 al malack et al 1998 noor et al 2002 like mno2 caco3 fecl3 and naalo2 and soil based compounds holdich and boston 1990 including diatomite kaolin fluorospar limestone and silicate have been used to successfully treat domestic wastewaters all dms performed equally well achieving more than 99 reduction in turbidity however metal chloride dms clogged very quickly due to the formation of flocs with particles from the wastewater al malack and anderson 1998 for surface water treatment pac dms were the most popular followed by iron or aluminum oxide particles polymers sand then nanoparticles aghili et al 2017 ajmani et al 2014 cai and benjamin 2011 cai et al 2008 choo et al 2005 chu et al 2012 ding et al 2018 harman et al 2010 kim et al 2008 kim and jang 2018 kwon et al 2009 lee et al 2002 liu and benjamin 2016 malczewska 2017 malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 shao et al 2017 sharp and escobar 2006 shi and benjamin 2008 wang and benjamin 2016 in decreasing order of removal effectiveness pac dms shao et al 2017 wu et al 2017 and pac metal oxide dms gave the best performance depending on the nature of feed with doc removals of up to 92 and 88 respectively followed by heated metal oxide particles cai and benjamin 2011 cai et al 2008 2013 kim et al 2008 2010 liu and benjamin 2016 malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 modarresi and benjamin 2018 shi and benjamin 2008 wang and benjamin 2016 anion exchange resins shao et al 2017 and sand chu et al 2012 ding et al 2018 this was attributed to the high surface area of pac which is three orders of magnitude greater than the lowest performing dm namely sand whereas pac and metal oxide dms were effective in doc removal sand dms were highly efficient in capturing bacteria 99 from contaminated water despite poor performance with respect to doc removal chu et al 2012 some studies used synthetic feeds containing bsa sa ha transparent exopolymer particle tep altman et al 1999 liu and benjamin 2016 ma et al 2015 and ovalbumin altman et al 1999 to test organic matter removal 4 3 2 factors affecting dm treatment of water and wastewater the factors affecting dm water treatment are feed source ph dm material dosage dm thickness and filtration flux dm performance varied greatly with the source of feed for example pac dms removed 90 doc from seawater wu et al 2017 whereas only 45 removal was achieved from polluted river water shao et al 2017 with respect to ph an acidic environment was found beneficial for doc removal altman et al 1999 liu and benjamin 2016 ma et al 2015 the rejection of nom was expectedly found to increase with increasing dm material dosage as increasing amounts of adsorbents became available cai et al 2008 2013 lee et al 2002 liu et al 2018 also breakthrough occurred later for thicker dms wu et al 2017 implying overall doc removal increased with increasing dm thickness the effect of flux is identical to that of decreasing ph a greater filtration flux was also found to increase nom retention on the dm liu and benjamin 2016 4 3 3 summary in summary pac metal oxide and soil based dms have been used to treat domestic and surface waters this application has recently gained popularity as the demand for domestic water treatment has risen pac was the most effective dm material for doc removal whereas sands dms were more capable of capturing bacteria however as seen from section 3 1 pac dms were also responsible for causing the highest flux decline hence the choice of dm should be made depending on whether nom removal is more important or fouling mitigation a combination of dms has been shown to achieve both objectives cai et al 2008 and further studies on such dual dms are necessary e g a dm harnessing the benefits of sand dms for disinfection and those of pac for nom removal regarding the mechanism of organic matter removal by dms several studies have fitted langmuir adsorption isotherms and kinetics obtained from batch experiments to dm systems cai et al 2008 modarresi and benjamin 2018 nyobe et al 2019 but the latter are more complex owing to involvement of flow hydrodynamics and lower contact time with the adsorbent independent studies considering these aspects could be undertaken to model the dm system more accurately since the performance of these dms varied dramatically with the nature of the feed water future work must also focus on making dm systems adaptable to the feed e g installing a system to vary the amounts of pac and haops as needed during deposition 4 4 oily wastewater treatment 4 4 1 dms used in oily wastewater treatment the treatment of oily wastewaters is another important application of dms soil based and metal oxide dms have been primarily used for oily wastewater treatment along with yttrium y and zirconium zr complexes performance is typically measured in terms of oil retention or toc chemical oxygen demand cod reduction soil based and metal oxide dms have been employed for oil in water feeds whereas y and zr complex dms have been used with oily seawater feeds since the latter also can partially desalinate the feed zhang et al 2018b zhang and zhao 2017 among the soil based and metal oxide dms treating oily wastewater diatomite dms shao et al 2020 and kaolin mno2 dual dms yang et al 2011 were the most effective giving 99 9 of oil rejection while the worst were polystyrene dms with a still impressive 98 rejection fazullin and mavrin 2019 among the metal complex dms used to treat oily seawater containing organics the best performing was the dual yxsi1 xo2 so3h yss phosphorylated yxsi1 xo2 al2o3 pysa dm with 89 retention and the worst performing was the diatomite dm with 67 rejection zhang and zhao 2017 fig 10 shows the best performance in terms of oil rejection of the various dms used for oily wastewater and oily seawater treatment 4 4 2 factors affecting dm oily wastewater treatment generally a higher ph value favored the separation performance of the dms yang et al 2011 zhao et al 2005b however the effect of ph on permeate flux is not clear with one study reporting the flux to be varying arbitrarily with increasing ph yang et al 2011 while another reporting a decrease in flux with increasing ph zhao et al 2005b increasing the operating pressure increased oil rejection zhang and zhao 2017 zhao et al 2006 whereas an increase in the operating temperature caused a slight reduction in rejection yang et al 2011 and enhanced permeate flux due to a decrease in viscosity pan et al 2012 yang et al 2011 an increase in the feed oil concentration increased oil retention while decreasing permeate flux yang et al 2011 among other factors a decrease in dm particle size shao et al 2020 an increase in the concentration of the dm material zhao et al 2006 and increase in dm thickness zhang and zhao 2017 led to higher oil rejections while increasing cross flow velocity reduced dm performance pan et al 2012 zhao et al 2006 also rejection reduced slightly with increasing pm pore size pan et al 2012 4 4 3 summary in summary metal oxide and soil based and y and zr complex dms have been used to treat oily wastewater and oily seawater feeds respectively the performance of most dms has been impressive with over 95 rejections this is the least popular among all applications for dms since it was discovered only in the current century but is fast emerging future research could focus on testing dms on oily wastewater feeds from a variety of sources to establish their applicability beyond a specific system and on understanding the variability of permeate flux with ph 4 5 others polydimethylsiloxane dms guo et al 2010 and paa polyethyleneimine pei dms prepared by alternately

and water polom 2013 4 6 summary and perspectives fig 11 summarizes the common dms employed for each of the applications classified by application and dm material category solute rejection is by far the most common application of dms this is due to a large number of dm systems exploring salt rejection via ro since ro is the application for which dms were initiated for and substantial research has expectedly ensued to further enhance desalination the second most popular application is the treatment of domestic waters the removal of organic matter from surface waters has gained importance recently due to the increased necessity for water treatment for environmental sustainability and the growing attention on fouling mitigation in ro plants the treatment of industrial effluents via dms is relatively less popular presumably due to the complex and varied nature of such feeds the least common dm application is the treatment of oily wastewaters but is fast emerging and has gained popularity only in the present century among the dm categories the dual and metal oxide dms appear to be the most versatile and employed in large numbers in all applications and the least versatile is activated carbon with a total of 12 systems being employed in three application categories nanoparticles as a dm material have also been employed in three of the five application categories and due to their emergence relatively recently the number of systems investigated is as yet small based on this analysis the following directions for future research with respect to applications of dms are recommended firstly research on dms used to treat industrial effluents which represents a growing environmental threat because of the complexity and variety in composition rai 2009 ritter et al 2002 is lacking hence a greater focus on developing dms that have shown potential for treating industrial effluents is necessary one example is the hydrous zr iv oxide paa dm which may have fallen out of favor due to its extensive use in the now obsolete application of salt rejection however it has shown tremendous versatility in the treatment of a variety of industrial effluents secondly further exploration on the capabilities of a single dm to capture multiple components e g oil and heavy metal ions will be useful to treat complex feeds thirdly there has been no study assessing the consistency in performance of a dm for the same application with feed solutions from different sources e g oily wastewater from different refineries such studies will more comprehensively ascertain the robustness of dms for their respective applications fourthly nanoparticles have clearly shown much promise in applications for the limited number of studies on them to date further research on the increasingly popular nanoparticles as dms will help exploit their full potential finally studies investigating the nature of interactions between the rejected solute and the dm qualitatively and quantitatively will help to identify thresholds for initiation of cleaning and improve the efficiency of dm systems 5 technical and economic assessment 5 1 technical advantages of dms several technical advantages of dms over conventional membranes have been documented the key advantage of dms over conventional membranes is that they can easily be replaced in situ this circumvents the problem of flux reduction due to irreversible fouling malczewska et al 2015 shao et al 2020 since the dm can be completely removed and replaced by a fresh layer when fouled severely secondly unlike their conventional counterparts e g polyamide ca membranes used for ro dms can be operated at high temperatures and can handle hot industrial effluents without stability issues groves et al 1983 thirdly dms can operate at higher fluxes with reasonable salt rejection compared to ro membranes alone lonsdale 1973 fourthly dms have been shown to give better rejection than surface modified pms e g dip coating due to greater uniformity deng et al 2008 furthermore dms have also been shown to reject more nom as well as provide better fouling mitigation compared to the addition of adsorbents to the feed stream cai et al 2008 or using a stirred vessel ellerie et al 2013 because the dm protects the pm from contacting the nom fifthly dms are extremely useful to prevent downstream ro fouling especially in cases of feeds containing high concentrations of nom kim and jang 2018 or sea water feeds with large amounts of organic matter wu et al 2017 which represents huge benefits over conventional uf mf ro pre treatments that are inadequate finally unlike traditional pms dms can be tailored to match the treatment requirements of specific feeds and designed to remove specific feed constituents groves et al 1983 thereby lower cost pms e g stainless steel ceramic can last longer than uf mf membranes groves et al 1983 5 2 economic advantages of dms the few publications that have carried out detailed economic analysis including capital as well as operating costs of dm systems vis à vis conventional systems have shown the former to be more economical with respect to salt rejection removal of nom and oily wastewater treatment each of these areas is considered in brief below 5 2 1 salt rejection though the operation and maintenance costs of dm systems are admittedly higher than conventional systems due to the expenses involved with cleaning re deposition and higher pressures the savings in capital cost more than offset the increased operation costs thomas 1974 reported that the capital costs for the dm plant were 64 lower than that for the conventional hollow fiber membrane while the operation and maintenance costs were 52 higher owing to increased operating pressures and requirement of periodic cleaning overall the lower capital costs for the dm plant more than offset the higher operation and maintenance costs such that the total costs for the dm plant were 12 lesser than the conventional hollow fiber plant in cases whereby there is a non significant difference between the overall costs of dm and conventional systems the former has been shown to be superior in terms of flux and ability to withstand hot industrial feed streams groves et al 1983 5 2 2 organic matter removal in the case of using dms for organic matter removal savings in capital and operating costs have been reported compared to conventional systems kim and jang 2018 performed for an industrial scale treatment of water containing nom a comparative cost analysis between two methods namely i the conventional method comprising coagulation via polyaluminum chloride mixing and settlement and ii filtration using heated aluminum oxide and binary fe al oxide dms taking into consideration the capital costs for the adsorbent cake layer and decreased flux compared to the conventional method savings in capital costs of 36 45 and 23 32 were reported when using the heated aluminum oxide and fe al oxide dms respectively on the ceramic sheets pms as opposed to the conventional method ajmani et al 2012 reported that the cost of operating cnt dms for treating surface water is the same as that for conventional hollow fiber or flat sheet membranes but the dms additionally offer benefits of lower tmp and longer run times due to more effective fouling mitigation effectiveness and also negate the need for pre treatment 5 2 3 oily wastewater treatment economic benefits in using dms for oily wastewater treatment involve energy savings due to reduction in irreversible fouling of the pm for example zhang et al 2018b reported an energy saving of 22 when yxsi1 xo2 so3h yss yxsi1 xo2 al2o3 pysa dm was used to treat oily seawater the average pressure required to be generated by the ro pump reduced from 4 4 mpa for the conventional system to 3 43 mpa for the dm system thus inducing the saving in case of oily seawater treatment dms can be economically employed to pre treat feeds during algal blooms which are periodic events setting up a temporary pre treatment dm system in such situations has proven to be more cost effective in terms of energy footprint and capital expenditure than setting up a conventional column reactor kim et al 2017 5 2 4 summary based on the economic analyses of dm systems available in literature cases whereby dms would incur lower expenses than conventional methods can be identified as follows i capital costs of conventional systems are high dms offer a cheaper alternative if the dm material is easily and cheaply available moreover dms can be deposited on pm with larger pores e g meshes malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 which are far less costlier than conventional uf or mf membranes ii extreme temperatures or corrosives are involved conventional membranes may not be able to withstand such conditions groves et al 1983 and could have operational lifespan shortened considerably dms have been proven to withstand extreme operating conditions at much lower maintenance costs iii high fouling environments dms could improve the lifespan of a pm appreciably since the dm would prevent contact between the pm and foulants this would help reduce maintenance costs and improve productivity by reducing the downtime iv filtration operation at high tmps whereby the majority of operation costs are for maintaining the required tmp dms would enable the use of a low pressure e g uf membrane as pm instead of high pressure e g ro membrane thus reducing costs v periodic requirement for a pre treatment step e g during algal blooms dms would be far more economical in terms of capital costs than setting up a conventional filtration system 5 3 challenges despite these technical and economic advantages dms are still not applied in industry on a large scale due to some inherent problems associated with dms and some research gaps which need to be the focus of future studies on dms this section briefly discusses the problems and research gaps that prevent industrial scale deployment of dms one of the problems that plagues dms is that of irreproducibility especially in the case of dms performing ro large variabilities in terms of dm formation and performance kraus et al 1967 for example thickness and flux diaper et al 1996 freilich and tanny 1978a holdich and boston 1990 johnson et al 1968 kraus et al 1966 nomura and shoji kimura 1980 have been widely reported this greatly hinders dms from being employed in industry secondly issues of dm stability have been reported which are important especially for nanoparticle dms considering the potential danger to health and environment various authors expressed concerns that the adhesion of cnts to pms is still not as strong as required for large scale operations ajmani et al 2012 bai et al 2015 ellerie et al 2013 gallagher et al 2013 thirdly several dms exhibit variable flux with changes in ph the cause of which has not fully been understood yet yang et al 2011 zhao et al 2005b for example it has been reported in the case of kaolin mno2 dms treating oily wastewater that the flux varies erratically as the ph is increased and then lowered yang et al 2011 industrial feeds may not always be at the same ph so this problem needs to be addressed before deploying dms to treat oily wastewater on a large scale fourthly a highly concentrated sludge which could be harmful to the environment if released untreated is generated when the old dm is replaced by a new one especially in the case of anti fouling dms cai and benjamin 2011 kim and jang 2018 malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 since the sludge will be greater in volume than that produced during conventional membrane filtration because it contains the dm material in addition to the captured components effective disposal strategies need to be formulated before dms can be employed widely 6 future perspectives apart from the above mentioned challenges gaps exist in the current knowledge base on dms that could go a long way to make dms more industrially viable if bridged these are summarized in the following broad areas dm formation mechanisms the formation mechanisms of recent class i dms have not been investigated thoroughly though there is one study on this pan et al 2015 several assumptions like rigid particles neglect of re suspension and laminar regime limit its utility electrostatic interactions between dm particles and pms have also not been investigated factors influencing dm formation as seen from table 2 the effects of influencing factors on various properties of dms have not been comprehensively investigated synergistic impact of the factors and identification of dominant ones have also not been addressed furthermore effects of the chemical properties of dm materials on their formation have not been assessed dm cleaning trigger criteria for initiation of dm cleaning have been set in an ad hoc manner and the influence and evaluation of the effectiveness of various cleaning protocols have not been systematically studied as yet dm configurations most research on the anti fouling potential of dms has been done using flat sheet and dead end configurations where tubular modules are used all of them are single channel systems rather than the more industrially relevant multi channel systems dms on hollow fiber pms have also not been studied much despite showing promise especially in terms of stability thiruvenkatachari et al 2006 modifications to dm systems despite showing clear improvements in terms of formation and performance modifications to dm systems e g additives rotation have been relatively less studied out of the almost 150 publications on pre deposited dms only 11 employ some kind of modification fouling mitigation by dms most research has focused on adsorption mechanisms on dms qualitatively but the effect of ph on their fouling mitigation efficacy has not been evaluated also the majority of studies on antifouling dms have used synthetic foulants as opposed to real feeds applications of dms metal oxide and polyelectrolyte dms have been studied less in recent times presumably due to the emergence of better ro membranes there has been very little research however on the use of these dms in other applications where they have shown potential studies identifying dms targeted at specific components in a feed are also lacking though dms have been shown to be economically beneficial compared to their conventional counterparts like hollow fiber membrane systems such analyses are scarce in literature in terms of fouling mitigation no attempt to assess the industrial practicability of dms against currently practiced techniques has been made studies exploring scale up of dm systems are also lacking after considering various problems and gaps in the current research on dms several avenues to make dms industrially viable in the near future could be suggested besides that based on the discussion from the previous section future research directions that could make dms further attractive in the long term and increase our understanding regarding dms are recommended fig 12 provides an overview of the directions for future research on dms to i make them industrially viable in the near future and ii further the understanding for application in the long term 6 1 future research on industrial viability of dms dms have proven to be as or more cost effective than using conventional systems however they are still not applied on an industrial level several ways in which dms could be made industrially practicable in the near future are given below 1 polyelectrolyte dms have already been shown to be effective in treating industrial effluents groves et al 1983 van reenen and sanderson 1989a and in nf applications deng et al 2008 industrial effluents have been identified as an ever growing environmental threat rai 2009 ritter et al 2002 making their adequate treatment increasingly important further research on dms targeting specific industrial waste compounds would make them more applicable in industry given the tightening environmental regulations 2 many dms have been shown to be very effective using flat sheet configurations e g fouling mitigation where tubular modules are used only a single tube system is examined since single tube modules are rarely employed in industry future studies focusing on various aspects of design and dm formation performance and fouling mitigation in tubular multi channel modules will help enhance the industrial relevance of dms 3 a mesh instead of a conventional mf or uf membrane as a pm has been used to deposit the dm malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 na et al 2000 future efforts on making dms on meshes industrially viable would not only reduce the tmp thereby lowering operation costs but also reduce capital costs since meshes are much cheaper than uf mf membranes 4 uf membranes with a feed pre treated with haops dms on a nylon mesh have been observed to operate without tmp build up for up to a fortnight malczewska and benjamin 2016 malczewska et al 2015 further such research on downstream ro fouling mitigation by dms would make them industrially attractive 5 determining the trigger point for commencement of dm cleaning has to date been ad hoc and cleaning procedures have been empirical some protocols e g air and water backwashing and flushing malczewska et al 2015 have proven to be more effective than others e g only water backwashing lee et al 2002 lu et al 2016 since cleaning would entail a halt in the filtration process future work focusing on optimizing dm regeneration protocols and identifying criteria to initiate cleaning would play an important role in integrating dm systems in industrial processes it would also be useful in prolonging pm life 6 modifications to dm systems such as use of filter aids dahlheimer et al 1970 johnson et al 1968 turbulence promoters thomas et al 1970 and introduction of vibrations shi and benjamin 2008 have proven to improve dm performance and prolong operation duration but have been relatively less studied further research into such variations will aid in cost reduction and enhancing the overall effectiveness of dms 7 more studies comparing the economic and practical aspects of dms such as overall costs and energy expenditures and rejection and fouling mitigation capabilities to those of currently practiced industrial techniques will be needed for their large scale adoption in industry studies exploring scale up of dm systems would also be required 6 2 future research on furthering the understanding on dms though there have been a lot of studies on dms there are several gaps in our understanding of their formation and functioning some directions for long term future research on furthering the mechanistic understanding of dms are recommended as follows 1 the formation mechanism of class i dms has not been quantitatively investigated class i dms are gaining recent popularity to perform mf uf operations e g haops hiops moreover understanding on the effects of various factors on the formation of class i and ii dms both in isolation and in combination is still incomplete hence further research into more quantitative analysis of formation mechanisms of class i dms and factors influencing dm formation is imperative 2 though dm performance has been well studied quantitatively using batch adsorption kinetics there has been no study modeling dm performance considering flow hydrodynamics and little insights into interactions between the dm material and rejected solute are available one recent study has looked into the mechanism of adsorption of nom onto haops dms via molecular dynamics simulations ma et al 2019 more such studies investigating the nature of interactions between the captured solute or foulant and the dm and considering flow and adsorption together will enable optimization of filtration durations and initiation of cleaning regeneration 3 nanoparticles an emerging dm material have proven to be versatile in terms of their application as evident from a few recent studies though they provide some advantages over standalone and composite cnt membranes a major issue for these dms is their lack of stability on pms causing them to be inapplicable on a large scale hence further research is required to fully exploit nanoparticles as dm materials 4 a variety of dms has been used for a single application with varying degrees of performance but the most suitable dm within an application for a type of feed or pollutant has not yet been determined to take the full advantage of the flexibility that dms offer future work needs to focus on identifying the best dm or dm class for a particular type of feed and engineering dms targeted at removing certain undesirable components from a variety of feeds 7 conclusions a comprehensive review of pre deposited dms has been carried out the key dms employed along with their formation factors affecting formation regeneration techniques and modifications to dm systems are discussed also presented are the important roles of dms in fouling mitigation of the pms and the wide ranging applications of dms technical and economic advantages of dms over conventional methods are considered while discussing some challenges prevalent in current dm research based on these directions for future research to recognize their potential in terms of industrial applicability as well as furthering mechanistic understanding are suggested ten noteworthy inferences can be drawn from this review i dms have been effectively employed in all major types of filtration systems namely ro nf uf and mf ii the dm material structure of the pm ph and hydrodynamic conditions influence various aspects of dm formation iii with respect to dm regeneration shearing off the used dm then depositing a new dm is preferred rather than cleaning and reusing the same dm physical removal use of chemicals and backwashing are popularly used for clearing off the spent dm iv metal oxide dms are the most versatile in terms of applications and are among the most commonly studied dm materials along with polymers and dual metal oxide polymer layers v nanoparticles are an emerging versatile dm material that show promising results for fouling mitigation however their stability on pms is a major concern vi dms have traditionally found popularity in salt rejection ro applications whereas removal of organic matter from water along with fouling mitigation are currently the most popular functions of dms vii though analysis is scarce dms have been shown to be more cost effective than conventional methods like coagulation for organic matter removal and conventional hollow fiber membrane systems viii some operational problems and gaps in the current knowledge on dms still hinder their applicability in industry on a large scale ix with further research in areas like dm treatment of industrial effluents multi channel tubular dm systems dm cleaning modification to dm systems reduction in operation costs and scale up of dm systems dms have a large potential to be employed on an industrial level x future research on formation mechanisms dm foulant interactions nanoparticle dms and identification of the most suitable dms for different applications would further our current understanding on dms
