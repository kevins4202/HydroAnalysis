5275,in this study the effect of distance dependent dispersion coefficients on density driven flow is investigated the linear asymptotic model which assumes that dispersivities increase linearly with distance from the source of contamination and reach asymptotic values at a large asymptotic distance is employed an in house numerical model is adapted to handle distance dependent dispersion the effect of asymptotic dispersion on aquifer contamination is analyzed for two tests i a seawater intrusion problem in a coastal aquifer and ii a leachate transport problem from a surface deposit site global sensitivity analysis gsa combined with the polynomial chaos expansion pce surrogate modeling is conducted to assess the influence of the dispersion coefficients on the contamination plume for both configurations for the seawater intrusion problem the results show that the length of the toe is mainly controlled by the asymptotic transverse dispersivity whereas the spread of the concentration is sensitive to the asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity and the asymptotic dispersivity distance the latter is the most important parameter controlling the amount of salt which intrudes into the aquifer for the leachate transport problem the results show that the asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity coefficient does not affect the concentration distribution the asymptotic dispersivity distance has a strong effect on the total amount of contaminant that enters the aquifer this effect can be three times more important than the effect of the asymptotic transverse dispersivity these findings are likely to be helpful for the investigation and management of density driven flow problems keywords density driven flow saltwater intrusion leachate transport variable dispersion asymptotic model global sensitivity analysis 1 introduction density driven flow ddf is a particular configuration of transport in porous media in which the fluid concentration causes a change in groundwater density which can significantly affect the flow dynamics ddf can be encountered in several applications related to contaminant transport in aquifers among these applications a well known problem is the contamination of coastal aquifers by saltwater intrusion werner et al 2013 which is a major concern around the world another important example is groundwater contamination by leachates from surface industrial waste and landfills frind 1982 managing and predicting the evolution of pollutants in such situations require accurate numerical simulations the simulation of ddf problems is based on coupling darcy s groundwater flow equation to the solute transport equation via a state relation expressing the density as a function of solute concentration transport of solute in the aquifer is ruled by advection representing the solute displacement by the mean fluid flow and by dispersion which accounts for solute spreading caused by velocity variations due to the heterogeneity of the porous medium at different scales liu and kitanidis 2013 kitanidis 2017 dai et al 2020 dispersion processes have been found to play a major role in ddf problems as they cause mixing between different fluids the effect of dispersion on ddf has been widely investigated in the literature for instance abarca et al 2007 studied the effect of dispersion on ddf in the context of seawater intrusion and showed that when dispersion is taken into account concentration isolines resemble those observed in real coastal aquifers emami meybodi 2017 studied instabilities driven by dispersion for an unstable ddf problem with mixed convective flow wen et al 2018 defined a dispersive rayleigh number and investigated the effect of dispersion on the rayleigh darcy convection problem fahs et al 2020 investigated the effect of dispersion on thermal ddf problem in most ddf models dispersion is ruled using a velocity dependent dispersion tensor involving constant coefficients characterizing mixing in the longitudinal parallel to the flow and transverse orthogonal to flow directions in the last decades many studies have shown that this conventional approach cannot satisfactorily represent field transport especially for aquifers with spatial heterogeneity pickens and grisak 1981a alternative approaches have developed such as stochastic models e g gelhar 1992 zhang 2002 kerrou and renard 2010 pool et al 2015 or continuous time random walk methods e g berkowitz et al 2000 dentz et al 2004 however these methods usually require sufficient field measurements to formulate statistical structure and are known to be computationally expensive wang et al 2006 such difficulties have motivated using the conventional dispersion approach but by considering that the dispersivity values are temporal or scale dependent pickens and grisak 1981a in other words the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients are not constant but can vary with the distance from the source of contamination indeed in a tracer test molz et al 1983 found that dispersivity is not constant but increases with the travel distance because of the scale dependence of dispersivities this phenomenon has been observed both in field scale transport e g pickens and grisak 1981a gelhar et al 1992 schulze makuch 2005 and laboratory scale transport e g silliman and simpson 1987 khan and jury 1990 huang et al 1995 vanderborght and vereecken 2007 according to gao et al 2012 the scale dependence of dispersivity can be related to different processes such as the heterogeneity of the porous media at different scales gelhar et al 1992 huang et al 2006 the fractal nature of the pore space in the aquifer wheatcraft and tyler 1988 or the anomalous transport cortis and berkowitz 2004 mishra and parker 1990 showed that a hyperbolic dispersivity distance function allows a good fitting of the data estimated from a natural gradient tracer experiment kangle et al 1996 provided a one dimensional analytical solution with linear asymptotic dispersion chen et al 2003 2007 investigated distance dependent dispersion for convergent and divergent flow fields with linear scale dependent dispersion chen et al 2008a studied one dimensional transport with hyperbolic asymptotic dispersivity function pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 derived a general analytical solution for one dimensional transport with distance dependent coefficients gao et al 2010 2012 investigated mobile immobile transport model with asymptotic scale dependent dispersivity you and zhan 2013 developed semi analytical solutions for solute transport in a finite column with linear asymptotic and exponential distance dependent dispersivities and time dependent sources thus in the literature the effect of asymptotic dispersivity has been essentially investigated for simplified situations of 1d transport e g basha and el habel 1993 yates 1992 david logan 1996 pang and hunt 2001 chen et al 2003 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 sharma and abgaze 2015 wang et al 2019 2d problems with a uniform flow field e g hunt 2002 chen et al 2008b or radially convergent divergent flow fields e g chen et al 2003 2006 2007 to the best our knowledge investigation of distance dependent dispersion coefficients in cases involving complex velocity fields such as in ddf problems have not been undertaken the aim of this work is to incorporate distance dependent dispersion in a ddf model and to investigate the effect of dispersion parameters on contaminant transport our assumption is that the distance dependent dispersion coefficients are more representative to dispersion processes than constant coefficients as conceptual models we consider i the henry problem describing seawater intrusion swi in a coastal aquifer henry 1964 and ii the leachate transport problem proposed by frind 1982 to investigate the leachate plume from a surface deposit site the effect of distance dependent dispersivities on the aquifer contamination is investigated using global sensitivity analysis gsa combined with polynomial chaos expansion pce surrogate modelling sudret 2008 fajraoui et al 2012 2017 mara et al 2017 2 methods 2 1 the mathematical model and numerical code the mathematical model for water movement through porous media is based on the mass conservation equation and darcy s law guevara morel et al 2015 ρ s h t ε ρ c c t ρ q 0 q ρ 0 g μ k h ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 z where ρ is the fluid density ml 3 s the specific mass storativity related to head changes l 1 h the equivalent freshwater head l t the time t ε the porosity c the relative concentration q the darcy s velocity lt 1 ρ 0 the density of the displaced fluid ml 3 g the gravity acceleration lt 2 μ the fluid dynamic viscosity ml 1t 1 k the permeability tensor l2 and z

of the flow transport system are of dirichlet neuman or mixed type flow and transport equations are coupled via the linear mixture density equation ρ ρ 0 ρ 1 ρ 0 c where ρ 1 is density of contaminant in this work we assume that the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients are a function of the distance from the source of contamination distance dependent dispersivities are generally ruled using one of the four types of functions suggested by pickens and grisak 1981b including linear parabolic asymptotic and exponential functions the linear distance dependent dispersivity function has been largely used in the literature e g pang and hunt 2001 gao et al 2010 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 chen et al 2008b however this function seems to be unphysical because field observations show that a constant dispersivity could be asymptotically reached gelhar et al 1992 pickens and grisak 1981a huang et al 1995 used a linear asymptotic distance dependent function where the dispersivity value increases linearly with the transport distance and reaches an asymptotic value at a certain large distance the linear asymptotic model was adopted by you and zhan 2013 and is employed in this work 6 α l t x α l t 0 ℓ ℓ 0 0 ℓ ℓ 0 α l t 0 ℓ 0 ℓ where ℓ corresponds to the distance from the source of contamination α l 0 and α t 0 are respectively the asymptotic longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients and ℓ 0 is the asymptotic distance after which both longitudinal and transverse dispersivities reach their asymptotic values α l t α l t 0 the coupled flow transport system is solved with an advanced in house numerical model using triangular meshes ackerer and younes 2008 the flow equations eqs 1 2 are solved by the mixed finite element method younes et al 2010 the transport equation eq 3 is solved by combining two numerical methods discontinuous galerkin dg method for solving advection and multipoint flux approximation mpfa method for solving dispersion coupling between flow and transport equations is performed using the non iterative scheme proposed in younes and ackerer 2010 with proper time management this scheme was shown to be highly efficient and more accurate than the standard iterative procedure the in house code has been validated by comparison against semi analytical solutions in fahs et al 2016 performance and robustness of the code has been highlighted in shao et al 2018 by comparison against comsol multiphysics in this work the in house code is modified to handle distance dependent dispersion coefficients both longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are defined elementwise and their values are calculated using eq 6 where ℓ corresponds to the distance from the center of each element to the source of contamination 2 2 the henry saltwater intrusion problem real applications of swi at a field scale are increasingly reported in the literature however in several theoretical and applied studies swi is often investigated based on the hypothetical henry problem henry 1964 fig 1 a this problem represents a common benchmark that is widely used for multiple purposes as understanding physical processes numerical model verification and parameter sensitivity analyses a detailed review of the different use of the henry problem as a surrogate representation of swi can be found in werner et al 2013 and fahs et al 2018 the henry problem represents swi in a vertical cross section of a confined coastal aquifer where an inland freshwater flow is in equilibrium with seawater that intrudes into the aquifer from the seaside due to its higher density fig 1a the first studies on the henry problem have been limited to pure molecular diffusion cases more realistic configurations that include velocity dependent dispersion have been suggested in abarca et al 2007 and fahs et al 2016 these cases will be considered here as this work deals with asymptotic dispersion coefficients following simpson and clement 2004 we decrease the freshwater recharge by half to increase the density dependent effects compared to boundary forces further we use a larger rectangular domain with an aspect ratio l h 3 as proposed by zidane et al 2012 to reduce the influence of the left boundary condition on the saltwater distribution the parameters and boundary conditions for the henry problem are given in table 1 the numerical model is employed to analyze the saltwater intrusion by considering that uncertainty of model outputs is associated with the following dispersion parameters the asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity α l 0 the asymptotic transverse dispersivity α t 0 and the asymptotic distance ℓ 0 note that the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are assumed to be independent the corresponding uncertainty ranges table 2 are chosen in accordance with the dimensions of the investigated problem and they are sufficiently large to explore the role of each parameter 2 3 the leachate transport problem in unconfined aquifer this problem was proposed by frind 1982 to investigate groundwater contamination by leachates from sanitary landfills or industrial waste disposal sites a typical problem is considered fig 1b where a disposal site unprotected from precipitation is situated above the water table in a rectangular unconfined aquifer of 3000 m length and 24 m thickness the parameters and boundary conditions are described in table 3 large uncertainty ranges table 4 are associated to the dispersion parameters α l 0 α t 0 and ℓ 0 in order to investigate the role of each of them note that because the leachate transport problem has larger dimensions than the synthetic henry problem the dispersion parameters are allowed to have larger values than previously 3 global sensitivity analysis effect of the dispersion parameters on ddf is investigated using global sensitivity analysis gsa to this aim the variance based sensitivity indices of sobol sobol 2001 are computed using polynomial chaos expansion pce the sobol indices measure the contribution of an input alone or by interactions with other inputs to the output variance they are well adapted for gsa since they do not require any assumption of monotony or linearity of the model saltelli et al 2006 two sobol indices are noteworthy the first order sensitivity index 4 s i v e y χ i v y v i v the total sensitivity index 5 s t i e v y χ i v y v i t v where y is the model output χ is the set of parameters χ α l 0 α t 0 ℓ 0 e is the mathematical expectation the average v is the mathematical variance e and v are their respective conditional forms χ i represents one of the parameters and χ i stands for the set of parameters χ without the parameter χ i the first order sensitivity index or main effect index s i 0 1 measures the amount by which the variance of y is reduced when the true value of χ i is known the total sensitivity index s t i 0 1 measures the remaining uncertainty in y after all parameters are known except χ i it evaluates the contribution of χ i to the response variance including its interactions with the other parameters i e χ ĩ if interactions between parameters are negligible we have i s i 1 and s i s t i i the marginal effect y χ i of the parameter χ i on the model output y enables to investigate the range of variation of y with respect to χ i y χ i e y χ i in this work we use the polynomial chaos expansion pce surrogate modeling to infer sensitivity indices fajraoui et al 2012 2017 younes et al 2016 shao et al 2017 pce allows an efficient evaluation of the sobol indices since they can be easily calculated using the pce coefficients sudret 2008 since we deal with only three uncertain parameters α l 0 α t 0 and ℓ 0 we use a full surrogate pce of order 4 the number of polynomial coefficients in the expansion is therefore 7 4 3 35 the coefficients of the surrogate pce are calculated by a least square technique minimizing the sum of squared errors between model responses and the pce to this aim a hundred of evaluations of the henry and leachate transport problems are performed using parameter values randomly generated in the intervals of variation given in table 2 and table 4 respectively 4 results for the henry swi problem a mesh converged solution is obtained a uniform triangular mesh formed by 4800 elements the effect of the dispersion parameters on saltwater intrusion is investigated based on the following metrics see fig 2 the positions x 0 1 x 0 5 and x 0 9 of respectively the 10 50 and 90 isochlors at the aquifer bottom note that the x 0 5 is related to the well known length of the toe l toe which is the distance between the seaside boundary and x 0 5 the spread of the concentration l s x 0 9 x 0 1 which corresponds to the distance between the 10 and the 90 isochlors at the bottom of the domain the total mass in the domain the values of steady state concentration at the following selected points a 1 1 5 0 a 2 2 5 0 and a 3 2 5 1 4 1 salinity distribution fig 3 a depicts the mean concentration values as well as the corresponding 10 50 and 90 concentration contours this figure shows that the distribution of the mean concentration reflects the general distribution of salinity in coastal aquifers which gives confidence to the accuracy of the pce surrogate model saltwater intrudes from the right and reaches equilibrium with the inland freshwater flow saltwater intrusion is more pronounced near the bottom because of density effects the mean concentration distribution in fig 3a shows a wide mixing zone due to the large uncertainty ranges of the dispersion parameters table 2 the distribution of the variance of the concentration shows that high variances regions are located at the center of the domain near the bottom of the aquifer fig 3b this makes sense as the length of the toe is mainly controlled by the dispersion processes abarca et al 2007 fahs et al 2016 indeed it is well known that low dispersion increases the buoyancy forces compared to dispersion effects and yields much more intrusion near the bottom of the aquifer younes and fahs 2014 this explains the high variance region near a1 in fig 3b significant variability of the salinity can be observed also at top of the aquifer near the seaside fig 3b in this zone the groundwater flow is discharging to the sea thus the salinity of this zone is mainly due to dispersion the dashed contour in fig 3b shows the region where the effect of dispersion parameters is significant which corresponds to 5 of the standard deviation of the concentrations the spatial maps of first order sobol indices representing the sensitivity of the salinity distribution to α l 0 α t 0 and ℓ 0 are plotted in the fig 4 for the region of significant variance the region delimited by the dashed lines fig 4a shows that α l 0 has a negligible effect on salinity distribution except around a2 where a moderate effect can be observed the parameter α t 0 is the most influential parameter as its zone of high sensitivity is situated in the region of high variability fig 4b significant sensitivity to α t 0 is observed around a3 but the highest sensitivity area is situated in the mixing zone near a1 this is in agreement with the results of fahs et al 2016 and is related to the fact that in this zone the velocity field is not parallel to the concentration gradient as shown in fahs et al 2016 in such a case the dispersion processes are dominated by the transverse dispersion and hence the salinity distribution is highly sensitive to α t 0 in this zone the parameter ℓ 0 is influential near the seaside boundary fig 4c which makes sense since far from the sea the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients reach their asymptotic values and the salinity distribution become insensitive to ℓ 0 4 2 sensitivity of the swi metrics the sobol indices for the concentration at the observation points a1 a2 a3 as well as for the swi metrics are depicted in table 5 this table also gives the mean value and the standard deviation for all quantities of interest the results of this table show that the concentration near a1 is mostly influenced by α t 0 s 2 0 81 in this region moderate interactions occur between parameters i 1 3 s i 0 86 the effects of α l 0 and ℓ 0 alone are insignificant s 2 0 01 and s 3 0 04 but their total effects including interactions are moderately significant s t 1 0 12 and s t 3 0 11 the results around a1 are coherent with the results discussed previously based on the spatial maps of sobol indices fig 4 around a2 located near the sea boundary high concentrations can be observed mean 0 79 the concentration has slight variability std 0 1 which indicates that swi reaches this point whatever the values of the dispersion parameters the most influential parameter near a2 is ℓ 0 s 3 0 42 the parameters α l 0 and α t 0 have significant and close effects s 1 0 27 and s 2 0 24 interactions between dispersion parameters are not significant i 1 3 s i 0 94 the point a3 is located near the top of the domain and close to the sea boundary the standard deviation std 0 11 of concentrations is relatively significant mean 0 27 the most influential parameter in this region is ℓ 0 s 3 0 6 followed by the parameter α t 0 s 2 0 33 the parameter α l 0 is irrelevant s 1 0 02 interactions between the three dispersion parameters are not significant i 1 3 s i 0 95 the 10 isochlor intersects the substratum at an average distance of 1 39 m from the sea boundary x 0 1 has high variability std 0 17 m the parameter α t 0 is the most influential parameter s 2 0 64 the parameter α l 0 has a small first order sensitivity index s 1 0 13 whereas the parameter ℓ 0 has a negligible first order sensitivity index s 3 0 06 however because of interaction between parameters i 1 3 s i 0 82 α l 0 and ℓ 0 are influential since their total sensitivity indices are significant s t 1 0 29 and s t 2 0 2 the 50 isochlor intersects the substratum at an average distance of 2 0 m the dispersion parameters have a strong effect on that position since the standard deviation is significant std 0 19 as x 0 1 x 0 5 is mainly controlled by the parameter α t 0 s 2 0 73 the parameters α l 0 s 1 0 07 and ℓ 0 s 3 0 13 have a limited effect because the 50 isochlor is closer to the sea than the 10 isochlor x 0 5 is more sensitive to ℓ 0 than x 0 1 small interactions are observed between the dispersion parameters i 1 3 s i 0 93 therefore x 0 5 and in consequence l toe are mainly controlled by the asymptotic transverse dispersivity since interactions are small the marginal effect of α t 0 depicted in the fig 5 a reflects the behavior of x 0 5 when varying α t 0 the other parameters are set at their mean values fig 5a shows a high sensitivity for α t 0 0 3 and a weaker sensitivity for higher values of α t 0 in this figure x 0 5 increases with α t 0 which is consistent with physics as the decrease in α t 0 induces more saltwater intrusion and hence a decrease of x 0 5 the 90 isochlor intersects the substratum at an average distance of 2 66 m with a standard deviation of 0 19 m x 0 9 is sensitive to the three dispersion parameters as the isochlor 90 is close to the sea the most influential parameter is ℓ 0 s 3 0 46 comes next α l 0 s 1 0 30 and finally α t 0 s 2 0 16 small interactions exist between the dispersion parameters i 1 3 s i 0 93 marginal effects of the three sensitive dispersion parameters on x 0 9 are plotted in the fig 5 the sensitivity of x 0 9 to α l 0 fig 5b has a positive slope as an increase of α l 0 induces an increase of the spreading of the concentration front resulting in an increase of x 0 9 the sensitivity of x 0 9 to α t 0 fig 5c is similar to that observed for x 0 5 this demonstrates that saltwater intrusion is mainly controlled by the asymptotic transverse dispersivity a decrease of α t 0 induces more intrusion which results in a decrease of x 0 5 and x 0 9 the sensitivity of the intrusion to α t 0 is more pronounced for small values of this parameter the x 0 9 varies almost linearly with a negative slope with respect to the parameter ℓ 0 fig 5d indeed the 90 isochlor is located near the sea boundary the average x 0 9 is 2 66 m where the effect of ℓ 0 is significant see fig 4c in that region the increase of ℓ 0 yields less dispersion effects which results in more saltwater intrusion and hence a decrease in x 0 9 for the spread of the concentration ls the most influential parameter is α l 0 s 1 0 5 followed by ℓ 0 s 3 0 41 the sensitivity of l s to α l 0 is much more important than that of x 0 1 and x 0 9 furthermore although α t 0 is influential on x 0 9 and on x 0 1 it has no effect on l s s 2 0 05 the interactions between parameters are almost absent i 1 3 s i 0 97 the marginal effects of the parameters α l 0 and ℓ 0 on l s are depicted in the fig 5 l s increases linearly with the value of α l 0 fig 5e this confirms that the spreading is directly proportional to the value of α l 0 the sensitivity of l s to ℓ 0 has a negative slope fig 5f the increase of ℓ 0 yields less dispersion which results in less spreading of the concentration front and hence a reduction in l s the standard deviation of the total mass in the aquifer is around 10 of its mean value significant interactions occur between the dispersion parameters i 1 3 s i 0 67 the total sensitivity indices of the three dispersion parameters s t 1 0 46 s t 2 0 23 and s t 3 0 64 are significantly higher than their first order indices s 1 0 16 s 2 0 16 and s 3 0 35 this shows that ℓ 0 plays the most important role on the amount of mass which has intruded into the domain followed by α l 0 strong interactions mainly occur between these two parameters since s t 3 s 3 0 29 and s t 1 s 1 0 3 whereas s t 2 s 2 0 07 5 results of the leachate transport problem starting with no leachate in the aquifer the leachate transport problem is simulated for 24 years a mesh converged solution is obtained using a uniform triangular mesh formed by 14 400 triangular elements a hundred simulations were performed using independent random parameter values generated inside the intervals given in table 4 the mean leachate plume is shown in the fig 6 a the leachate enters the aquifer due to dispersion and vertical infiltration within the aquifer the leachate plume moves to the right side due to the hydraulic gradient between left and right sides a stable flow is obtained for all explored dispersivity values because of i the large dispersion and ii the weak density difference between the contaminant and freshwater the distribution of the variance of the concentration shows that high variability is located below the disposal site fig 6b towards the bottom of the aquifer the center of the zone of high variability is shifted to the right of the disposal site center because of the basic advective flow in the aquifer which goes from left to right fig 7 shows the spatial distributions of the first order sobol indices for the region of significant variability delimited by dashed lines the asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity α l 0 has a negligible first order sensitivity index fig 7a note that this does not imply the irrelevance of α l 0 since the first order index does not take into account interactions between parameters to judge the inefficiency of α l 0 we evaluate the total sobol index of α l 0 fig 8 shows that in the region of high variance α l 0 has no effect on the concentration distribution neither alone nor in interaction with the other parameters therefore the parameter α l 0 is irrelevant for concentration distribution thus in this case mixing by dispersion is mainly related to transverse dispersivity the parameters α t 0 and ℓ 0 have strong influence on the concentration distribution fig 7b and 7c in the region of high variability below the landfill site significant interactions are observed between these two parameters the amount of interaction between parameters can be evaluated by computing r 1 i s i if interactions between parameters are absent then i s i 1 and r 0 fig 9 shows that interactions between α t 0 and ℓ 0 are observed in two regions located in the lower half of domain moderate interactions occur in the region between 100 m and 500 m higher interactions occur in a larger zone located downstream the deposit site between 1000 m and 1500 m the effects of dispersion parameters are investigated for the total mass in the domain and for the final concentration at the following selected points a 1 265 0 a 2 655 0 and a 3 1025 0 in table 6 the results of this table show that the concentration around a1 is first influenced by ℓ 0 s 3 0 58 and then by α t 0 s 2 0 29 the parameter α l 0 is irrelevant s t 1 0 moderate interactions occur between α l 0 and ℓ 0 i 1 3 s i 0 87 the concentration around a2 is almost equally influenced by α t 0 s 2 0 51 and ℓ 0 s 3 0 46 in this region the model is almost additive since interactions between parameters are almost absent i 1 3 s i 0 97 around a3 the parameters α t 0 and ℓ 0 have close first order sensitivity indices s 2 0 37 and s 3 0 39 and close total sensitivity indices s t 2 0 6 and s t 3 0 63 in this region strong interactions occur between these two parameters i 1 3 s i 0 76 the total mass in the system has a mean of 10 667 and a significant variance of 4 058 the parameter α l 0 has no effect s 1 0 the parameter ℓ 0 has a strong effect on the total mass value this effect s 3 0 74 is three times more important than the effect of α t 0 s 2 0 24 the effects of the two parameters are additive since interactions between them are almost absent i 1 3 s i 0 98 the marginal effects of the parameters α t 0 and ℓ 0 on the total mass are plotted in fig 10 the sensitivity of the total mass to α t 0 depicts a curve with a positive slope since the total mass increases as α t 0 increases the marginal effect of ℓ 0 is represented by a negative slope curve which is consistent with physics the leachate plume and consequently the total mass increase as dispersion increases i e ℓ 0 decreases 6 conclusions transport of pollutants in aquifers is usually modeled using the advection dispersion transport equation with constant dispersion coefficients recently laboratory and field transport observations have shown that dispersivities are distance dependent the most popular function for distance dependent dispersivity is the linear asymptotic model which assumes that the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients increase linearly with the distance from the source of contamination until some asymptotic distance ℓ 0 after which the dispersion coefficients reach asymptotic values in the literature this model has been investigated in simple configurations dealing with either one dimensional or uniform two dimensional flow fields in this work we investigate the effects of asymptotic dispersion model in the case of contaminant transport with ddf that involves complex velocity field the linear asymptotic model has been incorporated in an advanced in house ddf numerical model the new developed code was used to investigate the effect of the dispersion coefficients asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity α l 0 asymptotic transverse dipersivity α t 0 and asymptotic distance ℓ 0 on the contamination plume for two conceptual models the henry saltwater intrusion problem and a leachate transport problem from a surface deposit site the effects of dispersion parameters are evaluated using global sensitivity analysis gsa combined with the polynomial chaos expansion pce surrogate modelling to compute both first order and total sobol sensitivity indices the results for the henry problem showed that the concentration at the center bottom of the domain is mostly influenced by the asymptotic value of the transverse dispersion α t 0 whereas near the sea boundary the most influential parameter is the asymptotic distance ℓ 0 the position of the 50 isochlor is mainly controlled by the parameter α t 0 the spread of the concentration is not influenced by α t 0 but by α l 0 and ℓ 0 the total amount of mass intruded in the aquifer is influenced by ℓ 0 and then by α l 0 and interactions between them the results for the leachate transport problem show that α l 0 has no effect neither alone nor in interaction with the other parameters on the concentration distribution the parameters α t 0 and ℓ 0 have a strong influence on the concentration distribution below the landfill site strong interactions occur between these two parameters in the aquifer the total mass in the aquifer is strongly influenced by ℓ 0 the sensitivity to ℓ 0 is three times more important than to α t 0 and the effects of these two parameters on the total mass are additive interactions are insignificant this study showed that distance dependent dispersion coefficients can significantly affect contaminant distribution in aquifers in the case of density driven flow it demonstrates the advantage of using gsa with pce surrogate modeling for such investigation since it allows to determine for each parameter the regions of high influence and the regions where the effect of the parameter is insignificant it also allows to determine regions of high interactions between parameters and to explore the marginal effect of sensitive parameters on the model output the linear asymptotic model is used in this paper to simulate distance dependent dispersion coefficients several other models have been suggested on the literature the

effect of asymptotic dispersion on aquifer contamination is analyzed for two tests i a seawater intrusion problem in a coastal aquifer and ii a leachate transport problem from a surface deposit site global sensitivity analysis gsa combined with the polynomial chaos expansion pce surrogate modeling is conducted to assess the influence of the dispersion coefficients on the contamination plume for both configurations for the seawater intrusion problem the results show that the length of the toe is mainly controlled by the asymptotic transverse dispersivity whereas the spread of the concentration is sensitive to the asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity and the asymptotic dispersivity distance the latter is the most important parameter controlling the amount of salt which intrudes into the aquifer for the leachate transport problem the results show that the asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity coefficient does not affect the concentration distribution the asymptotic dispersivity distance has a strong effect on the total amount of contaminant that enters the aquifer this effect can be three times more important than the effect of the asymptotic transverse dispersivity these findings are likely to be helpful for the investigation and management of density driven flow problems keywords density driven flow saltwater intrusion leachate transport variable dispersion asymptotic model global sensitivity analysis 1 introduction density driven flow ddf is a particular configuration of transport in porous media in which the fluid concentration causes a change in groundwater density which can significantly affect the flow dynamics ddf can be encountered in several applications related to contaminant transport in aquifers among these applications a well known problem is the contamination of coastal aquifers by saltwater intrusion werner et al 2013 which is a major concern around the world another important example is groundwater contamination by leachates from surface industrial waste and landfills frind 1982 managing and predicting the evolution of pollutants in such situations require accurate numerical simulations the simulation of ddf problems is based on coupling darcy s groundwater flow equation to the solute transport equation via a state relation expressing the density as a function of solute concentration transport of solute in the aquifer is ruled by advection representing the solute displacement by the mean fluid flow and by dispersion which accounts for solute spreading caused by velocity variations due to the heterogeneity of the porous medium at different scales liu and kitanidis 2013 kitanidis 2017 dai et al 2020 dispersion processes have been found to play a major role in ddf problems as they cause mixing between different fluids the effect of dispersion on ddf has been widely investigated in the literature for instance abarca et al 2007 studied the effect of dispersion on ddf in the context of seawater intrusion and showed that when dispersion is taken into account concentration isolines resemble those observed in real coastal aquifers emami meybodi 2017 studied instabilities driven by dispersion for an unstable ddf problem with mixed convective flow wen et al 2018 defined a dispersive rayleigh number and investigated the effect of dispersion on the rayleigh darcy convection problem fahs et al 2020 investigated the effect of dispersion on thermal ddf problem in most ddf models dispersion is ruled using a velocity dependent dispersion tensor involving constant coefficients characterizing mixing in the longitudinal parallel to the flow and transverse orthogonal to flow directions in the last decades many studies have shown that this conventional approach cannot satisfactorily represent field transport especially for aquifers with spatial heterogeneity pickens and grisak 1981a alternative approaches have developed such as stochastic models e g gelhar 1992 zhang 2002 kerrou and renard 2010 pool et al 2015 or continuous time random walk methods e g berkowitz et al 2000 dentz et al 2004 however these methods usually require sufficient field measurements to formulate statistical structure and are known to be computationally expensive wang et al 2006 such difficulties have motivated using the conventional dispersion approach but by considering that the dispersivity values are temporal or scale dependent pickens and grisak 1981a in other words the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients are not constant but can vary with the distance from the source of contamination indeed in a tracer test molz et al 1983 found that dispersivity is not constant but increases with the travel distance because of the scale dependence of dispersivities this phenomenon has been observed both in field scale transport e g pickens and grisak 1981a gelhar et al 1992 schulze makuch 2005 and laboratory scale transport e g silliman and simpson 1987 khan and jury 1990 huang et al 1995 vanderborght and vereecken 2007 according to gao et al 2012 the scale dependence of dispersivity can be related to different processes such as the heterogeneity of the porous media at different scales gelhar et al 1992 huang et al 2006 the fractal nature of the pore space in the aquifer wheatcraft and tyler 1988 or the anomalous transport cortis and berkowitz 2004 mishra and parker 1990 showed that a hyperbolic dispersivity distance function allows a good fitting of the data estimated from a natural gradient tracer experiment kangle et al 1996 provided a one dimensional analytical solution with linear asymptotic dispersion chen et al 2003 2007 investigated distance dependent dispersion for convergent and divergent flow fields with linear scale dependent dispersion chen et al 2008a studied one dimensional transport with hyperbolic asymptotic dispersivity function pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 derived a general analytical solution for one dimensional transport with distance dependent coefficients gao et al 2010 2012 investigated mobile immobile transport model with asymptotic scale dependent dispersivity you and zhan 2013 developed semi analytical solutions for solute transport in a finite column with linear asymptotic and exponential distance dependent dispersivities and time dependent sources thus in the literature the effect of asymptotic dispersivity has been essentially investigated for simplified situations of 1d transport e g basha and el habel 1993 yates 1992 david logan 1996 pang and hunt 2001 chen et al 2003 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 sharma and abgaze 2015 wang et al 2019 2d problems with a uniform flow field e g hunt 2002 chen et al 2008b or radially convergent divergent flow fields e g chen et al 2003 2006 2007 to the best our knowledge investigation of distance dependent dispersion coefficients in cases involving complex velocity fields such as in ddf problems have not been undertaken the aim of this work is to incorporate distance dependent dispersion in a ddf model and to investigate the effect of dispersion parameters on contaminant transport our assumption is that the distance dependent dispersion coefficients are more representative to dispersion processes than constant coefficients as conceptual models we consider i the henry problem describing seawater intrusion swi in a coastal aquifer henry 1964 and ii the leachate transport problem proposed by frind 1982 to investigate the leachate plume from a surface deposit site the effect of distance dependent dispersivities on the aquifer contamination is investigated using global sensitivity analysis gsa combined with polynomial chaos expansion pce surrogate modelling sudret 2008 fajraoui et al 2012 2017 mara et al 2017 2 methods 2 1

of the flow transport system are of dirichlet neuman or mixed type flow and transport equations are coupled via the linear mixture density equation ρ ρ 0 ρ 1 ρ 0 c where ρ 1 is density of contaminant in this work we assume that the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients are a function of the distance from the source of contamination distance dependent dispersivities are generally ruled using one of the four types of functions suggested by pickens and grisak 1981b including linear parabolic asymptotic and exponential functions the linear distance dependent dispersivity function has been largely used in the literature e g pang and hunt 2001 gao et al 2010 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 chen et al 2008b however this function seems to be unphysical because field observations show that a constant dispersivity could be asymptotically reached gelhar et al 1992 pickens and grisak 1981a huang et al 1995 used a linear asymptotic distance dependent function where the dispersivity value increases linearly with the transport distance and reaches an asymptotic value at a certain large distance the linear asymptotic model was adopted by you and zhan 2013 and is employed in this work 6 α l t x α l t 0 ℓ ℓ 0 0 ℓ ℓ 0 α l t 0 ℓ 0 ℓ where ℓ corresponds to the distance from the source of contamination α l 0 and α t 0 are respectively the asymptotic longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients and ℓ 0 is the asymptotic distance after which both longitudinal and transverse dispersivities reach their asymptotic values α l t α l t 0 the coupled flow transport system is solved with an advanced in house numerical model using triangular meshes ackerer and younes 2008 the flow equations eqs 1 2 are solved by the mixed finite element method younes et al 2010 the transport equation eq 3 is solved by combining two numerical methods discontinuous galerkin dg method for solving advection and multipoint flux approximation mpfa method for solving dispersion coupling between flow and transport equations is performed using the non iterative scheme proposed in younes and ackerer 2010 with proper time management this scheme was shown to be highly efficient and more accurate than the standard iterative procedure the in house code has been validated by comparison against semi analytical solutions in fahs et al 2016 performance and robustness of the code has been highlighted in shao et al 2018 by comparison against comsol multiphysics in this work the in house code is modified to handle distance dependent dispersion coefficients both longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are defined elementwise and their values are calculated using eq 6 where ℓ corresponds to the distance from the center of each element to the source of contamination 2 2 the henry saltwater intrusion problem real applications of swi at a field scale are increasingly reported in the literature however in several theoretical and applied studies swi is often investigated based on the hypothetical henry problem henry 1964 fig 1 a this problem represents a common benchmark that is widely used for multiple purposes as understanding physical processes numerical model verification and parameter sensitivity analyses a detailed review of the different use of the henry problem as a surrogate representation of swi can be found in werner et al 2013 and fahs et al 2018 the henry problem represents swi in a vertical cross section of a confined coastal aquifer where an inland freshwater flow is in equilibrium with seawater that intrudes into the aquifer from the seaside due to its higher density fig 1a the first studies on the henry problem have been limited to pure molecular diffusion cases more realistic configurations that include velocity dependent dispersion have been suggested in abarca et al 2007 and fahs et al 2016 these cases will be considered here as this work deals with asymptotic dispersion coefficients following simpson and clement 2004 we decrease the freshwater recharge by half to increase the density dependent effects compared to boundary forces further we use a larger rectangular domain with an aspect ratio l h 3 as proposed by zidane et al 2012 to reduce the influence of the left boundary condition on the saltwater distribution the parameters and boundary conditions for the henry problem are given in table 1 the numerical model is employed to analyze the saltwater intrusion by considering that uncertainty of model outputs is associated with the following dispersion parameters the asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity α l 0 the asymptotic transverse dispersivity α t 0 and the asymptotic distance ℓ 0 note that the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are assumed to be independent the corresponding uncertainty ranges table 2 are chosen in accordance with the dimensions of the investigated problem and they are sufficiently large to explore the role of each parameter 2 3 the leachate transport problem in unconfined aquifer this problem was proposed by frind 1982 to investigate groundwater contamination by leachates from sanitary landfills or industrial waste disposal sites a typical problem is considered fig 1b where a disposal site unprotected from precipitation is situated above the water table in a rectangular unconfined aquifer of 3000 m length and 24 m thickness the parameters and boundary conditions are described in table 3 large uncertainty ranges table 4 are associated to the dispersion parameters α l 0 α t 0 and ℓ 0 in order to investigate the role of each of them note that because the leachate transport problem has larger dimensions than the synthetic henry problem the dispersion parameters are allowed to have larger values than previously 3 global sensitivity analysis effect of the dispersion parameters on ddf is investigated using global sensitivity analysis gsa to this aim the variance based sensitivity indices of sobol sobol 2001 are computed using polynomial chaos expansion pce the sobol indices measure the contribution of an input alone or by interactions with other inputs to the output variance they are well adapted for gsa since they do not require any assumption of monotony or linearity of the model saltelli et al 2006 two sobol indices are noteworthy the first order sensitivity index 4 s i v e y χ i v y v i v the total sensitivity index 5 s t i e v y χ i v y v i t v where y is the model output χ is the set of parameters χ α l 0 α t 0 ℓ 0 e is the mathematical expectation the average v is the mathematical variance e and v are their respective conditional forms χ i represents one of the parameters and χ i stands for the set of parameters χ without the parameter χ i the first order sensitivity index or main effect index s i 0 1 measures the amount by which the variance of y is reduced when the true value of χ i is known the total sensitivity index s t i 0 1 measures the remaining uncertainty in y after all parameters are known except χ i it evaluates the contribution of χ i to the response variance including its interactions with the other parameters i e χ ĩ if interactions between parameters are negligible we have i s i 1 and s i s t i i the marginal effect y χ i of the parameter χ i on the model output y enables to investigate the range of variation of y with respect to χ i y χ i e y χ i in this work we use the polynomial chaos expansion pce surrogate modeling to infer sensitivity indices fajraoui et al 2012 2017 younes et al 2016 shao et al 2017 pce allows an efficient evaluation of the sobol indices since they can be easily calculated using the pce coefficients sudret 2008 since we deal with only three uncertain parameters α l 0 α t 0 and ℓ 0 we use a full surrogate pce of order 4 the number of polynomial coefficients in the expansion is therefore 7 4 3 35 the coefficients of the surrogate pce are calculated by a least square technique minimizing the sum of squared errors between model responses and the pce to this aim a hundred of evaluations of the henry and leachate transport problems are performed using parameter values randomly generated in the intervals of variation given in table 2 and table 4 respectively 4 results for the henry swi problem a mesh converged solution is obtained a uniform triangular mesh formed by 4800 elements the effect of the dispersion parameters on saltwater intrusion is investigated based on the following metrics see fig 2 the positions x 0 1 x 0 5 and x 0 9 of respectively the 10 50 and 90 isochlors at the aquifer bottom note that the x 0 5 is related to the well known length of the toe l toe which is the distance between the seaside boundary and x 0 5 the spread of the concentration l s x 0 9 x 0 1 which corresponds to the distance between the 10 and the 90 isochlors at the bottom of the domain the total mass in the domain the values of steady state concentration at the following selected points a 1 1 5 0 a 2 2 5 0 and a 3 2 5 1 4 1 salinity distribution fig 3 a depicts the mean concentration values as well as the corresponding 10 50 and 90 concentration contours this figure shows that the distribution of the mean concentration reflects the general distribution of salinity in coastal aquifers which gives confidence to the accuracy of the pce surrogate model saltwater intrudes from the right and reaches equilibrium with the inland freshwater flow saltwater intrusion is more pronounced near the bottom because of density effects the mean concentration distribution in fig 3a shows a wide mixing zone due to the large uncertainty ranges of the dispersion parameters table 2 the distribution of the variance of the concentration shows that high variances regions are located at the center of the domain near the bottom of the aquifer fig 3b this makes sense as the length of the toe is mainly controlled by the dispersion processes abarca et al 2007 fahs et al 2016 indeed it is well known that low dispersion increases the buoyancy forces compared to dispersion effects and yields much more intrusion near the bottom of the aquifer younes and fahs 2014 this explains the high variance region near a1 in fig 3b significant variability of the salinity can be observed also at top of the aquifer near the seaside fig 3b in this zone the groundwater flow is discharging to the sea thus the salinity of this zone is mainly due to dispersion the dashed contour in fig 3b shows the region where the effect of dispersion parameters is significant which corresponds to 5 of the standard deviation of the concentrations the spatial maps of first order sobol indices representing the sensitivity of the salinity distribution to α l 0 α t 0 and ℓ 0 are plotted in the fig 4 for the region of significant variance the region delimited by the dashed lines fig 4a shows that α l 0 has a negligible effect on salinity distribution except around a2 where a moderate effect can be observed the parameter α t 0 is the most influential parameter as its zone of high sensitivity is situated in the region of high variability fig 4b significant sensitivity to α t 0 is observed around a3 but the highest sensitivity area is situated in the mixing zone near a1 this is in agreement with the results of fahs et al 2016 and is related to the fact that in this zone the velocity field is not parallel to the concentration gradient as shown in fahs et al 2016 in such a case the dispersion processes are dominated by the transverse dispersion and hence the salinity distribution is highly sensitive to α t 0 in this zone the parameter ℓ 0 is influential near the seaside boundary fig 4c which makes sense since far from the sea the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients reach their asymptotic values and the salinity distribution become insensitive to ℓ 0 4 2 sensitivity of the swi metrics the sobol indices for the concentration at the observation points a1 a2 a3 as well as for the swi metrics are depicted in table 5 this table also gives the mean value and the standard deviation for all quantities of interest the results of this table show that the concentration near a1 is mostly influenced by α t 0 s 2 0 81 in this region moderate interactions occur between parameters i 1 3 s i 0 86 the effects of α l 0 and ℓ 0 alone are insignificant s 2 0 01 and s 3 0 04 but their total effects including interactions are moderately significant s t 1 0 12 and s t 3 0 11 the results around a1 are coherent with the results discussed previously based on the spatial maps of sobol indices fig 4 around a2 located near the sea boundary high concentrations can be observed mean 0 79 the concentration has slight variability std 0 1 which indicates that swi reaches this point whatever the values of the dispersion parameters the most influential parameter near a2 is ℓ 0 s 3 0 42 the parameters α l 0 and α t 0 have significant and close effects s 1 0 27 and s 2 0 24 interactions between dispersion parameters are not significant i 1 3 s i 0 94 the point a3 is located near the top of the domain and close to the sea boundary the standard deviation std 0 11 of concentrations is relatively significant mean 0 27 the most influential parameter in this region is ℓ 0 s 3 0 6 followed by the parameter α t 0 s 2 0 33 the parameter α l 0 is irrelevant s 1 0 02 interactions between the three dispersion parameters are not significant i 1 3 s i 0 95 the 10 isochlor intersects the substratum at an average distance of 1 39 m from the sea boundary x 0 1 has high variability std 0 17 m the parameter α t 0 is the most influential parameter s 2 0 64 the parameter α l 0 has a small first order sensitivity index s 1 0 13 whereas the parameter ℓ 0 has a negligible first order sensitivity index s 3 0 06 however because of interaction between parameters i 1 3 s i 0 82 α l 0 and ℓ 0 are influential since their total sensitivity indices are significant s t 1 0 29 and s t 2 0 2 the 50 isochlor intersects the substratum at an average distance of 2 0 m the dispersion parameters have a strong effect on that position since the standard deviation is significant std 0 19 as x 0 1 x 0 5 is mainly controlled by the parameter α t 0 s 2 0 73 the parameters α l 0 s 1 0 07 and ℓ 0 s 3 0 13 have a limited effect because the 50 isochlor is closer to the sea than the 10 isochlor x 0 5 is more sensitive to ℓ 0 than x 0 1 small interactions are observed between the dispersion parameters i 1 3 s i 0 93 therefore x 0 5 and in consequence l toe are mainly controlled by the asymptotic transverse dispersivity since interactions are small the marginal effect of α t 0 depicted in the fig 5 a reflects the behavior of x 0 5 when varying α t 0 the other parameters are set at their mean values fig 5a shows a high sensitivity for α t 0 0 3 and a weaker sensitivity for higher values of α t 0 in this figure x 0 5 increases with α t 0 which is consistent with physics as the decrease in α t 0 induces more saltwater intrusion and hence a decrease of x 0 5 the 90 isochlor intersects the substratum at an average distance of 2 66 m with a standard deviation of 0 19 m x 0 9 is sensitive to the three dispersion parameters as the isochlor 90 is close to the sea the most influential parameter is ℓ 0 s 3 0 46 comes next α l 0 s 1 0 30 and finally α t 0 s 2 0 16 small interactions exist between the dispersion parameters i 1 3 s i 0 93 marginal effects of the three sensitive dispersion parameters on x 0 9 are plotted in the fig 5 the sensitivity of x 0 9 to α l 0 fig 5b has a positive slope as an increase of α l 0 induces an increase of the spreading of the concentration front resulting in an increase of x 0 9 the sensitivity of x 0 9 to α t 0 fig 5c is similar to that observed for x 0 5 this demonstrates that saltwater intrusion is mainly controlled by the asymptotic transverse dispersivity a decrease of α t 0 induces more intrusion which results in a decrease of x 0 5 and x 0 9 the sensitivity of the intrusion to α t 0 is more pronounced for small values of this parameter the x 0 9 varies almost linearly with a negative slope with respect to the parameter ℓ 0 fig 5d indeed the 90 isochlor is located near the sea boundary the average x 0 9 is 2 66 m where the effect of ℓ 0 is significant see fig 4c in that region the increase of ℓ 0 yields less dispersion effects which results in more saltwater intrusion and hence a decrease in x 0 9 for the spread of the concentration ls the most influential parameter is α l 0 s 1 0 5 followed by ℓ 0 s 3 0 41 the sensitivity of l s to α l 0 is much more important than that of x 0 1 and x 0 9 furthermore although α t 0 is influential on x 0 9 and on x 0 1 it has no effect on l s s 2 0 05 the interactions between parameters are almost absent i 1 3 s i 0 97 the marginal effects of the parameters α l 0 and ℓ 0 on l s are depicted in the fig 5 l s increases linearly with the value of α l 0 fig 5e this confirms that the spreading is directly proportional to the value of α l 0 the sensitivity of l s to ℓ 0 has a negative slope fig 5f the increase of ℓ 0 yields less dispersion which results in less spreading of the concentration front and hence a reduction in l s the standard deviation of the total mass in the aquifer is around 10 of its mean value significant interactions occur between the dispersion parameters i 1 3 s i 0 67 the total sensitivity indices of the three dispersion parameters s t 1 0 46 s t 2 0 23 and s t 3 0 64 are significantly higher than their first order indices s 1 0 16 s 2 0 16 and s 3 0 35 this shows that ℓ 0 plays the most important role on the amount of mass which has intruded into the domain followed by α l 0 strong interactions mainly occur between these two parameters since s t 3 s 3 0 29 and s t 1 s 1 0 3 whereas s t 2 s 2 0 07 5 results of the leachate transport problem starting with no leachate in the aquifer the leachate transport problem is simulated for 24 years a mesh converged solution is obtained using a uniform triangular mesh formed by 14 400 triangular elements a hundred simulations were performed using independent random parameter values generated inside the intervals given in table 4 the mean leachate plume is shown in the fig 6 a the leachate enters the aquifer due to dispersion and vertical infiltration within the aquifer the leachate plume moves to the right side due to the hydraulic gradient between left and right sides a stable flow is obtained for all explored dispersivity values because of i the large dispersion and ii the weak density difference between the contaminant and freshwater the distribution of the variance of the concentration shows that high variability is located below the disposal site fig 6b towards the bottom of the aquifer the center of the zone of high variability is shifted to the right of the disposal site center because of the basic advective flow in the aquifer which goes from left to right fig 7 shows the spatial distributions of the first order sobol indices for the region of significant variability delimited by dashed lines the asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity α l 0 has a negligible first order sensitivity index fig 7a note that this does not imply the irrelevance of α l 0 since the first order index does not take into account interactions between parameters to judge the inefficiency of α l 0 we evaluate the total sobol index of α l 0 fig 8 shows that in the region of high variance α l 0 has no effect on the concentration distribution neither alone nor in interaction with the other parameters therefore the parameter α l 0 is irrelevant for concentration distribution thus in this case mixing by dispersion is mainly related to transverse dispersivity the parameters α t 0 and ℓ 0 have strong influence on the concentration distribution fig 7b and 7c in the region of high variability below the landfill site significant interactions are observed between these two parameters the amount of interaction between parameters can be evaluated by computing r 1 i s i if interactions between parameters are absent then i s i 1 and r 0 fig 9 shows that interactions between α t 0 and ℓ 0 are observed in two regions located in the lower half of domain moderate interactions occur in the region between 100 m and 500 m higher interactions occur in a larger zone located downstream the deposit site between 1000 m and 1500 m the effects of dispersion parameters are investigated for the total mass in the domain and for the final concentration at the following selected points a 1 265 0 a 2 655 0 and a 3 1025 0 in table 6 the results of this table show that the concentration around a1 is first influenced by ℓ 0 s 3 0 58 and then by α t 0 s 2 0 29 the parameter α l 0 is irrelevant s t 1 0 moderate interactions occur between α l 0 and ℓ 0 i 1 3 s i 0 87 the concentration around a2 is almost equally influenced by α t 0 s 2 0 51 and ℓ 0 s 3 0 46 in this region the model is almost additive since interactions between parameters are almost absent i 1 3 s i 0 97 around a3 the parameters α t 0 and ℓ 0 have close first order sensitivity indices s 2 0 37 and s 3 0 39 and close total sensitivity indices s t 2 0 6 and s t 3 0 63 in this region strong interactions occur between these two parameters i 1 3 s i 0 76 the total mass in the system has a mean of 10 667 and a significant variance of 4 058 the parameter α l 0 has no effect s 1 0 the parameter ℓ 0 has a strong effect on the total mass value this effect s 3 0 74 is three times more important than the effect of α t 0 s 2 0 24 the effects of the two parameters are additive since interactions between them are almost absent i 1 3 s i 0 98 the marginal effects of the parameters α t 0 and ℓ 0 on the total mass are plotted in fig 10 the sensitivity of the total mass to α t 0 depicts a curve with a positive slope since the total mass increases as α t 0 increases the marginal effect of ℓ 0 is represented by a negative slope curve which is consistent with physics the leachate plume and consequently the total mass increase as dispersion increases i e ℓ 0 decreases 6 conclusions transport of pollutants in aquifers is usually modeled using the advection dispersion transport equation with constant dispersion coefficients recently laboratory and field transport observations have shown that dispersivities are distance dependent the most popular function for distance dependent dispersivity is the linear asymptotic model which assumes that the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients increase linearly with the distance from the source of contamination until some asymptotic distance ℓ 0 after which the dispersion coefficients reach asymptotic values in the literature this model has been investigated in simple configurations dealing with either one dimensional or uniform two dimensional flow fields in this work we investigate the effects of asymptotic dispersion model in the case of contaminant transport with ddf that involves complex velocity field the linear asymptotic model has been incorporated in an advanced in house ddf numerical model the new developed code was used to investigate the effect of the dispersion coefficients asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity α l 0 asymptotic transverse dipersivity α t 0 and asymptotic distance ℓ 0 on the contamination plume for two conceptual models the henry saltwater intrusion problem and a leachate transport problem from a surface deposit site the effects of dispersion parameters are evaluated using global sensitivity analysis gsa combined with the polynomial chaos expansion pce surrogate modelling to compute both first order and total sobol sensitivity indices the results for the henry problem showed that the concentration at the center bottom of the domain is mostly influenced by the asymptotic value of the transverse dispersion α t 0 whereas near the sea boundary the most influential parameter is the asymptotic distance ℓ 0 the position of the 50 isochlor is mainly controlled by the parameter α t 0 the spread of the concentration is not influenced by α t 0 but by α l 0 and ℓ 0 the total amount of mass intruded in the aquifer is influenced by ℓ 0 and then by α l 0 and interactions between them the results for the leachate transport problem show that α l 0 has no effect neither alone nor in interaction with the other parameters on the concentration distribution the parameters α t 0 and ℓ 0 have a strong influence on the concentration distribution below the landfill site strong interactions occur between these two parameters in the aquifer the total mass in the aquifer is strongly influenced by ℓ 0 the sensitivity to ℓ 0 is three times more important than to α t 0 and the effects of these two parameters on the total mass are additive interactions are insignificant this study showed that distance dependent dispersion coefficients can significantly affect contaminant distribution in aquifers in the case of density driven flow it demonstrates the advantage of using gsa with pce surrogate modeling for such investigation since it allows to determine for each parameter the regions of high influence and the regions where the effect of the parameter is insignificant it also allows to determine regions of high interactions between parameters and to explore the marginal effect of sensitive parameters on the model output the linear asymptotic model is used in this paper to simulate distance dependent dispersion coefficients several other models have been suggested on the literature the

5276,the water quality evolution of surface water and groundwater by mining activities and closed or abandoned mines is a grave public concern around the world to understand the characteristics of hydrogeochemical processes controlling the water quality evolution after the closure of mines a multi aquifer system in a closed coalfield in huainan eastern of china was investigated as an example based on the results of mineral characterizations hydrogeochemistry and stable isotopes carbonates minerals gypsum and clay minerals as well as atmosphere gases o2 co2 and h2o were recognized as major reactants and evaporation dissolution precipitation of minerals and cation exchange were potential reactions using inverse geochemical modeling three major hydrogeochemical paths in the closed mines were identified path1 shows that water in the closed mines is mainly recharged by the overlying quaternary aquifer and the underlying limestone aquifers through faults and fractures accompanied by cation exchange and sulfate reduction making the concentrations of na k and hco3 increase and the concentration of so4 2 decreases along the groundwater flow path path 2 shows that the karst groundwater flows from the shallow recharge zone to the deep circulation zone and then flows upwards to recharge the closed mine and the permian aquifer through faults and fractures along path 2 dolomite precipitates ion exchange and halite dissolution mainly take place making the concentrations of na k and cl increase and the concentration of ca2 and hco3 decrease and the water chemistry type change from ca hco3 type to na k cl type path 3 shows that waters in the mining subsidence ponds msps huai river and quaternary loose aquifer qla are connected although the major elements of water in qla still meet the drinking water guidelines of world health organization who and u s environmental protection agency usepa considering the fact that water in qla is a vital drinking water source for local communities proactive measurements should be undertaken to lower the risk of contamination of qla by msps through minimizing the hydraulic connection between them results of this study could benefit water quality prediction and management for these complex and vulnerable systems in the study area as well as other regions of the world keywords water pollution hydrogeochemistry stable isotopes inverse geochemical modeling closed mines 1 introduction contamination of surface water and groundwater by mining activities and closed or abandoned mines is a grave public concern around the world bridge 2004 chen et al 2017 dong et al 2019 gammons et al 2013 migaszewski et al 2018 park et al 2019 sun et al 2019 wolkersdorfer and bowell 2004 for example in china alone approximately 15 2 2 gm3 of surface water and 40 2 7 gm3 of groundwater have been affected by mining activities and closed or abandoned mines liang et al 2018 lu et al 2019 in recent decades with the shift of world economy and energy market and increasing environmental concern among the public coal mining activities which have been practiced for thousands of years for providing critical resources and energy for civilization bridge 2004 hartman and mutmansky 2002 have been reduced worldwide and many coal mines have been closed or abandoned hartman and mutmansky 2002 huo et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 when mines are closed the rising water from those closed mines is often mixed with native aquifer water through channels such as faults and fractures causing contamination of the otherwise contamination free native aquifer water adams and younger 2001 jeong et al 2018 tarasenko et al 2016 the rising water from the closed mines can also enter and pollute shallow quaternary aquifers and sometimes can even enter the surface water bodies to pollute rivers lakes and reservoirs cain et al 1994 dong et al 2019 feng and zhou 2012 wolkersdorfer and bowell 2004 it is therefore essential to understand how the qualities of surface and groundwater bodies evolve in closed coal mining regions before environmental protection measures can be taken because of their negative impacts on the surface water and groundwater qualities acid mine drainage amd and coal mine drainage cmd in active or abandoned mines have received extensive researches using simple scatter plots multivariate statistical analysis isotopes geochemical modeling etc dogramaci et al 2017 gammons et al 2010 2013 liu et al 2017 migaszewski et al 2018 park et al 2019 strosnider et al 2011 sun et al 2019 sun et al 2013 wolkersdorfer and bowell 2004 these researches successfully revealed the sophisticated water rock interactions and controlling hydrogeochemical evolution of different water bodies under mining operations binet et al 2016 cortes et al 2016 oiro et al 2018 qian et al 2018 sun et al 2019 sun et al 2013 wolkersdorfer and bowell 2004 however it appears to us that much less attention has been paid to investigate the hydrogeochemical processes and transport of contaminants associated with closed mines sun et al 2019 sun et al 2013 wolkersdorfer and bowell 2004 which usually have substantially different hydrodynamic conditions from those of the active mines adams and younger 2001 jeong et al 2018 tarasenko et al 2016 as the hydrogeochemical processes and chemical fate and transport are closely related to the hydrodynamic conditions it is understandable that the hydrogeochemical processes and chemical fate and transport in closed mines could be very different from those in active mines this motivates us to conduct this investigation the major ions and stable isotopes can provide geochemical information of groundwater in different aquifers dogramaci et al 2017 huang and wang 2018 malov and tokarev 2019 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b and thus enable evaluations of the hydrogeochemical processes and groundwater mobility bishop and lloyd 1990 liu et al 2017 qian et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a to identify water origins hydrogeochemical processes and chemical transport and fate several different approaches like hydrogeochemical analysis and multivariate statistics have been successfully employed to study regional and local groundwater systems before belkhiri et al 2010 cortes et al 2016 sefie et al 2018 voutsis et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a hydrogeochemical analysis methods such as graphical techniques e g piper diagrams and box plots and correlations analysis have been used widely to analyze the hydrogeochemical characteristics and sources of major ions ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b zhang et al 2019b multivariate statistical methods such as hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca have been employed successfully to identify aquifer connectivity huang and han 2017 qian et al 2016 wu et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 and hydrogeochemical processes blake et al 2016 li et al 2019 liu et al 2017 in recent years some researchers found that inverse geochemical modeling can identify the potential reactants and reactions in hydrogeochemical processes which offer possibilities to illustrate water origins from a different perspective belkhiri et al 2010 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 sharif et al 2008 trabelsi and zouari 2019 xing et al 2013 therefore application of multiple methods synchronously to maximize the strengths of those methods may provide a reasonable explanation for the hydrogeochemical evolution mechanism in this study hierarchical cluster analysis hca hydrogeochemical correlations analysis isotope analysis and inverse geochemical modeling with mineral phase were employed cohesively to identify water origins hydrogeochemical processes and transport paths in a multi aquifer system in the closed coalfield of the southeastern huainan area the selected area is a typical concealed closed coalfield in china including eight closed coal mines huai river quaternary loose aquifer and shallow limestone groundwater in this area are not only ecological resources but also the only domestic water supply sources for local residents zhang et al 2016a the primary concern of this area is that the quality of surface water and groundwater changes when the coal mines are closed prior to this work some studies have investigated the distribution characteristics of as se hg cd co cr cu fe mn pb and zn in the mining subsidence ponds and showed that some elements such as co as and cr were greater than those in who and usepa drinking water guidelines yao and gui 2008 wang et al 2012 chen et al 2019 in addition no research on water pollution and hydrogeochemical evolution has been reported in this area to identify the primary hydrogeochemical processes controlling water quality the objectives of this investigation are as follows first to identify the main sources and transport paths forming the closed mines water second to show the links between the three limestone aquifers in the study site to check the karst multi aquifer groundwater cross contamination issue third to identify the main sources and paths of waters in the mining subsidence ponds huai river and quaternary aquifer and to check whether waters in the quaternary aquifer and huai river are contaminated by the mining subsidence ponds water 2 study area the huainan eastern closed coalfield which is chosen as the study area fig 1 is located in the southeast of the huainan region in anhui province china with a total area of 15 km2 this region is subjected to a semi humid climate with seasonal monsoons with elevations varying from 17 to 22 m above mean sea level a m s l the annual average temperature is 16 5 c and the annual average precipitation is 925 27 mm and the precipitation occurs primarily in june july and august accounting for about 60 of the total annual precipitation zhang et al 2019b in the south of the closed huainan coalfield there are bagong mountain and shungeng mountain with an elevation of 120 m to 220 m a m s l and they are the recharge outcrops for the regional limestone groundwater in the north of the study area huai river which is usually used as a water divide between northern and southern china flows through the closed coalfield huai river and quaternary aquifer in this area are vital sources of drinking water supply and agricultural activity for local communities meng et al 2013 eight coal mines including liyi li er xieyi xie er xiesan wangfenggang xinzhuangzi and lizuizi coal mines as shown in fig 1 lie between huai river and the two mountains and are all closed some mining subsidence ponds msps formed by long term underground mining are distributed in the region similar to other areas in china from top to bottom the main strata in this area are quaternary permian carboniferous ordovician and cambrian and the permian stratum is the main coal bearing stratum mainly coal seam 1 in fig 2 the main aquifers from top to bottom are the quaternary loose sand aquifer qla the permian fractured sandstone aquifer pfa the carboniferous fractured karst limestone aquifer cfa the ordovician karst limestone aquifer oka and the cambrian karst limestone aquifer cka as shown in fig 2 qla is about 0 60 m thick and dominated by fine sand with 1 2 layers of calcareous clay which belongs to fluvial sediments pfa is about 500 m thick and is primarily composed of medium to fine sandstone interspersing with mudstone and sandy mudstone cfa is about 120 m thick which comprises 10 13 thin layers of limestone mudstone sandy mudstone and thin coal seams oka is about 150 m thick and is primarily composed of dolomitic and argillaceous limestone cka is more than 1000 m thick according to the cambrian strata outcrops and is primarily composed of limestone and dolomite with locally interspersed sandstone and shale in addition dissolution fissures apertures and caves are prevalent in cfa oka and cka and are usually filled or semi filled with calcite dolomite or gypsum cao et al 2017 tian 2014 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2020 the closed huainan eastern coalfield is located in a thrust nappe tectonic zone so it has been conventionally considered as a relatively independent hydrogeological unit zhang et al 2019a faults and fractures are widely developed in the closed coalfield due to multi phase tectonic movements during the indochina and yanshan periods and they could connect different aquifers according to the observations of water levels of aquifers in the study area qla pfa and cfa should be the direct and primary sources of water for the closed mines and oka and cka can recharge cfa through faults and fractures before the closure of coal mines in the study area the surface water and groundwater flowed from outcrops of both mountains to the valley fig 1 and formed a large groundwater depression cone around the faults f7 and f10 while the influence of the groundwater depression cone has gradually decreased and the groundwater levels in aquifers begin to recover after all coal mines are closed fig 2 the hydrogeological profile fig 2 selected for the study area is compatible with most other coalfields in china 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and laboratory analyses compared with surface water groundwater circulation rate is relatively slow and is mainly controlled by long term water rock interactions thus 25 water samples in this study were collected for one time after all coal mines were closed in 2016 except for one meteoric water sample that was collected in march 2019 the remaining 24 water samples were collected in december 2018 details in table 1 positions shown in figs 1 and 2 although a larger number of samples collected over a long span of time duration are always desirable the 25 water samples used in this study are the maximum possible samples we can collect given the constrains of accessibility and time duration of the project indeed lack of data replication is not uncommon in many similar field investigations such as huang and han 2017 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 qian et al 2016 and qian et al 2018 however one must be aware of the potential uncertainty inherent in unreplicated sampling and should take all the possible means to collect replicated data in the future investigations despite of all the challenges in field investigations except for some samples taken directly from the surface such as meteoric water huai river water and water from msps all other samples were obtained from water level observation wells a total of 11 parameters were measured in all samples including temperature t ph total dissolved solids tds na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 δ2h and δ18o the t and ph values were measured on site using a portable probe hi8424 ph 0 01 italy prior to sampling in the testing center in anhui university of science and technology by the authors all water samples were filtered on site through 0 45 μm membranes the 25 samples for the cation analysis were stored in 550 ml polypropylene bottles and acidified with hno3 until ph values are 2 the duplicate set of 25 samples for the anion analysis was not acidified the concentrations of major anion ions such as cl so4 2 and hco3 were analyzed via ion chromatography dionex 120 thermo fisher scientific usa and the concentrations of major cation ions such as ca2 mg2 na and k were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry thermo fisher scientific usa since the k concentrations in water samples were very low the na and k concentrations were analyzed as a sum na k major ions of all water samples were analyzed within 24 hr of collection the phreeqc 3 0 software package was used to calculate the saturation index of calcite dolomite and gypsum and the charge balance of each sample all water samples maintained perfect charge balances with error 3 table 1 the δ2h and δ18o isotopes of the water samples were analyzed at the school of earth and space sciences university of science and technology of china in hefei of china within three days of collection the δ2h isotope was measured using the zinc reaction method and the δ18o isotope was measured using the oxygen and carbon dioxide balance method with a mat252 isotope mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa the test results of the δ2h and δ18o isotopes were examined in comparison with the vienna standard mean ocean water standard with the ranges of 0 2 and 0 1 respectively in addition cores from qla pfa cfa oka and cka were collected and tested to predict the potential reactants some portions of core samples were disaggregated to pass a 0 063 mm sieve using an agate mortar and identification of mineral phases of these samples was performed on x ray diffraction xrd test using a smartlab se xrd rigaku japan the other portions of core samples were cut into pieces 8 8 2 mm3 face polished with argon ions using a cross section polisher and coated by a carbon coater these polished thin sections were analyzed by an electron microscope sem test using a flexsem1000 sem hitachi hightechnologies corp japan both xrd and sem tests were conducted at the testing center of anhui university of science and technology huainan china 3 2 analytical methods in this study hca was used to analyze the hydrogeochemical data using the spss 19 0 statistical software hca was employed to classify similar water samples into separated groups based on the consideration of various hydrogeochemical indicators e g na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl so4 2 δ2h and δ18o the same group contains water samples that are similar to each other but different from other samples in another group liu et al 2017 voutsis et al 2015 in this study the euclidean distance and the ward method were selected for the geometric distance and the linkage rules between the water samples respectively because they have been found to be applicable to hydrogeochemical studies qian et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 the δ2h and δ18o isotopes as part of water molecules can not only track regional groundwater movement but also provide a convenient way to study the hydrogeochemical formation and evolution carreira et al 2014 liu et al 2016 yeh and lee 2018 furthermore inverse geochemical modeling provides possibilities to illustrate processes in diverse terms and has been used to investigate hydrogeochemical evolution and water origins by numerous investigators before belkhiri et al 2010 carucci et al 2012 liu et al 2019 morán ramírez et al 2016 therefore the combination of stable isotopes and inverse geochemical modeling can accurately identify the water origins hydrogeochemical processes and chemical transport and fate in this study the program phreeqc 3 0 liu et al 2017 was employed to simulate the hydrogeochemical processes occurred along the flow paths 4 results and discussion 4 1 general hydrogeochemical characteristics eight types of water samples were classified from a hydrogeological perspective as shown in table 1 the two water samples w3 and w4 from msps are weakly acidic and weakly saline ph 7 and tds greater than 1 while all other water samples are weakly alkaline and fresh ph greater than 7 and tds 1 in most of these water samples the dominant cations are ca2 and mg2 and the main anion is hco3 suggesting a carbonate system liu et al 2017 and 2019 however in some water samples such as water samples w7 w8 w9 w16 w17 w23 and w24 na k are the dominant cations and cl or so4 2 is the main anion suggesting a complex water rock interaction or and local mixing process chen et al 2008 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 in addition the ph value in msps water w3 and w4 was lower than those in the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa and the tds and concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in msps water were greater than those in the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa thus they may influence the water quality of the nearby huai river and qla 4 2 hierarchical cluster analysis using the ward method and euclidean distance method qian et al 2016 hca yielded optimum distinct groups as shown in fig 3 the phenon line of 2 0 divides the 25 water samples into 9 groups from their various spatial positions fig 1 shows the general positions and fig 2 shows the aquifer layers the water samples of each group are shown in fig 3 as seen from fig 4 the water samples from groups a b e f g h are dominated by ca2 and hco3 and their chemical types are ca hco3 suggesting that these waters were formed in an environment with good recharge or discharge conditions with short groundwater residence times such conditions are usually presented in relatively permeable formations formed by enlargement of flow channels and improvement of permeability due to carbonate dissolution liu et al 2017 with the groundwater discharge conditions getting worse or groundwater residence time becomes longer the chemical compositions of groundwater gradually become more complex in which the cation ca2 is gradually replaced by na k and the anion hco3 is gradually replaced by so4 2 or cl chen et al 2008 thus the chemical types of groups c d and i are of ca so4 na k hco3 na k cl and na so4 hco3 the diversity of hydrogeochemical types again indicates that the groundwater hydrogeochemical processes in the study area are complex huang and han 2017 liu et al 2017 oiro et al 2018 qian et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 and requires appropriate methods to decipher their mechanisms from different perspectives which is precisely what we are doing in this study 4 3 evidence of major hydrogeochemical processes 4 3 1 mineral phase analysis the xrd and sem tests see figs s1 and s2 in supplementary materials show that the potential reactants for the water rock reactions include carbonate minerals e g calcite and dolomite crystal minerals e g gypsum quartz halite and feldspar clay minerals e g kaolinite and organic materials e g carbon cao et al 2017 sun et al 2019 tian 2014 xu et al 2017 the xrd and sem tests also show that pyrite may exist in pfa and cfa but it is not considered due to the fact that the amount of pyrite is below detection limit the major ion compositions in water sample indicate that there are major reactants such as calcite dolomite and gypsum along with some halite the clay layers contain the most important aquitard materials so cation exchange can also be assessed in these aquitards in addition the organic carbon is widely distributed in pfa and cfa where sulfate reduction may take place in a relatively closed and reducing environment the predicted potential minerals and reactions are listed in table 2 4 3 2 source analysis of ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 as seen in fig 5 a and 5b the water samples are not always consistent with the carbonate saturation indexes but carbonate minerals with high si are generally related to high hco3 concentration many studies have found that ca2 mg2 and hco3 in surface water and groundwater are mainly derived from carbonate mineral dissolution liu et al 2019 qian et al 2018 qian et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 as seen in fig 5c the values of ρ ca2 ρ mg2 ρ so4 2 ρ hco3 in most water samples except for the water samples from group d are all close to 1 indicating that ca2 and mg2 in groundwater are mainly derived from carbonate and sulfate dissolution chen et al 2017 the values of ρ ca2 ρ mg2 ρ so4 2 ρ hco3 in water samples form group d is 1 which may be related to cation exchange and sulfate reduction causing the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 to decrease while the concentrations of na k and hco3 to increase the molar ratio of hco3 to ca2 mainly reflects the dissolution of carbonate minerals and cation exchange and or sulfate reduction liu et al 2017 when ρ hco3 ρ ca2 2 it means that hco3 and ca2 come from the single dissolution of calcite eq 1 when ρ hco3 ρ ca2 4 it means that hco3 and ca2 come from the single dissolution of dolomite eq 2 as shown in fig 5d the lines y 2x and y 4x divide the entire area into three zones the lower zone shows an hco3 deficiency and only two samples from group c fall into this zone fig 5d which may be related to the ph values of these water samples ph 7 0 table 1 the neutralization reaction between h and hco3 in weakly acidic water reduces the hco3 concentration while increases the ca2 and mg2 concentrations the middle zone shows an hco3 concentration increase which represents a combination of calcite and dolomite dissolution or calcite dissolution and cation exchange zhang et al 2020 as shown in fig 5d most of water samples except for water samples from groups c and d fall into the middle zone confirming again that they are mainly influenced by carbonates dissolution and cation exchange combining the locations of the sampling points see figs 1 and 2 with the hydrogeological conditions it is reasonable to infer that the water samples from group a with low hco3 and ca2 concentrations represent natural water the water samples from groups b e f g h and i are characterized by high hco3 and ca2 concentrations which are mainly related to calcite dissolution and cation exchange 1 calcite cac o 3 c o 2 g h 2 o c a 2 2 hco 3 2 dolomite camg c o 3 2 2 c o 2 g 2 h 2 o c a 2 m g 2 4 hco 3 if the major origins of ca2 mg2 and hco3 are from the calcite and dolomite dissolution then the upper zone can be involved with cation exchange and or sulfate reduction resulting in an hco3 concentration greater than four times of ca2 liu et al 2017 in fig 5d the three water samples from group d are characterized by high hco3 concentrations and low ca2 concentrations which may be associated with cation exchange and sulfate reduction because mixed water group d is in a relatively closed and reducing environment and clay crystal minerals and organic carbon are widely distributed thus it is very conducive for cation exchange and sulfate reduction to take place there eq 3 3 desulfidation so 4 2 2c 2 h 2 o h 2 s 2hco 3 fig 5e provides evidence of gypsum in these water samples and gypsum has a good correlation with an increasing trend of ca2 and so4 2 concentrations furthermore fig 5f provides further evidence for gypsum in the surface water samples from groups a b and c with correlation coefficients greater than 0 9 ca2 r2 0 901 so4 2 r2 0 915 the surface water is an open environment which is greatly affected by the atmospheric condition temperature humidity precipitation and less affected by water rock interactions liu et al 2017 therefore gypsum has a strong ability to dissolve in fig 5g the values of ρ ca2 ρ mg2 ρ so4 2 in all samples are close to 1 indicating that so4 2 in all water samples is derived primarily from gypsum dissolution eq 4 however the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in group c are much higher than those in other groups fig 5g which may be also related to the ph values of water samples the two water samples from group c show weakly acidic containing a higher concentration of h when h in water reacts with carbonate minerals it will make the ca2 and mg2 concentrations increase while make the hco3 concentration decrease thus the value of ρ so4 2 ρ hco3 increases accordingly as shown in fig 5h only the value of ρ so4 2 ρ hco3 in group c is more than 0 5 thus group c can be easily distinguished from other groups 4 gypsum cas o 4 2 h 2 o c a 2 so 4 2 2 h 2 o 4 3 3 source analysis of na k and cl in general the concentrations of na k and cl are relatively stable in water thus ρ na k ρ cl is often used to explain the source of na k when ρ na k ρ cl 1 it means that the na k and cl in water are derived from halite dissolution chen et al 2017 as seen in fig 6 a the values in these water samples show that ρ na k ρ cl greater than 1 indicating that in addition to halite dissolution eq 5 cation exchange should take place as well group d shows high na k concentrations and low cl concentration fig 6a indicating that the cation exchange in group d may be the strongest 5 halite n a k cl n a k c l if mineral dissolution is the major origins of ca2 mg2 and na k then the ratio of ρ ca mg so4 hco3 ρ na k cl in mol l will be at 1 1 chen et al 2017 the scatter distribution in fig 6b in the lower left zone confirms that cation exchange eq 6 occurs in these water samples voutsis et al 2015 group d shows the high value of ρ na k cl and the low value of ρ ca mg so4 hco3 suggesting that group d has the strongest cation exchange causing the na k concentration to increase while the ca2 and mg2 concentrations to decrease 6 n a k rock c a 2 m g 2 water n a k water c a 2 m g 2 rock 4 4 hydrogeochemical paths analysis 4 4 1 isotope analysis the δ2h and δ18o isotopes can be used to trace regional groundwater movement and to study the nature of correlations between surface water and groundwater as well as the characteristics of groundwater circulation carreira et al 2014 chen et al 2008 zhan et al 2016 accordingly this study used the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 7 9 δ18o 8 2 zheng et al 1983 and local evaporation line lel δ2h 5 9 δ18o 7 8 ge et al 2014 as the baselines to study groundwater movement and aquifer hydraulic connection as seen in fig 7 all water samples fall into the lower right of the gmwl lmwl and lel indicating that meteoric water is the main source of the local surface water and groundwater huang and han 2017 as the depth of groundwater increases the values of δ2h and δ18o gradually decrease pang et al 2017 therefore the direction of groundwater flow is basically along lel from the upper right to the lower left as shown in fig 7 the water samples from the surface water groups a and b and the qla water group c fall into the upper right of the lower part of lel fig 7 showing that δ2h and δ18o in the water samples drift slightly in relative to those of the meteoric water this indicates that surface water and qla water are mainly influenced by meteoric water and evaporation while weakly influenced by water rock interactions huang and han 2017 as shown in fig 7 the water samples w10 w21 and w25 in the carbonate outcrop see fig 2 show slight δ2h and δ18o drifts suggesting that these water samples are affected not only by meteoric water and evaporation but also likely by complex water rock interactions such as carbonate and gypsum dissolution and cation exchange liu et al 2016 the water samples from group d fig 7 have seen a δ2h isotope drift suggesting that these waters were formed in a relatively closed environment which is prone for sulfate reduction to take place pang et al 2017 the values of δ2h and δ18o isotopes at the intersection of the δ2h drift line of group d water samples δ2h 42 634 δ18o 281 42 r2 0 689 and lmwl are smaller than those of the surface water and shallow groundwater in the study area indicating that water samples in group d must come from a deep groundwater system chen et al 2008 however the water samples from group e mainly exhibit a δ18o isotope drift and the δ2h drift line δ2h 6 241 δ18o 12 293 r2 0 875 is almost parallel to lel indicating that the groundwater flow in cfa is relatively uniform and the minerals dissolution and cation exchange may both take place chen et al 2008 as seen in fig 7 the water samples from groups h and i are distributed between the water samples from group e suggesting that they may have been mixed with cfa water huang and han 2017 pang et al 2017 4 4 2 inverse geochemical modeling in this study we focused on the major ions e g na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 and stable isotopes e g δ2h and δ18o for inverse modeling and select water samples representing initial and final water samples along the potential flow paths in the modeling exercises the reactants and reactions involved in this hydrogeochemical process are shown in table 3 based on the results of previous analysis 4 4 2 1 origins of water in the closed mines when all coal mines in the study area were closed the water level of the closed mines began to rise based on the time series monitoring of the surface water and groundwater levels it is inferred that the water sources of the closed mines may primarily come from qla and cfa besides pfa taking w7 as the final water and w5 w10 and w15 as the initial waters we found 2 models models a and b with uncertainty 0 05 after exercising the geochemical model of phreeqc 3 0 as seen from table 4 both model a and model b show that water in the closed mines mainly comes from cfa and a small amount comes from qla as seen in table 4 models a and b both include cation exchange and sulfate reduction which is consistent with the results of previous analysis these two models can reasonably explain the high concentrations of na k and hco3 and low concentration of so4 2 in closed mines water the difference is that model a has dolomite dissolution while model b has calcite dissolution but both with lower dissolved molarity co2 is consumed in both models a and b due to carbonate dissolution 4 4 2 2 connection of limestone aquifers water in limestone is not only the main source of water in the closed mines but is also an important groundwater resource in the study area thus two cases of connections of limestone aquifers in shallow recharge and deep circulation zones were considered in the following analysis case a connection of limestone aquifers in shallow recharge zone from a perspective of the spatial distribution of water samples and hca result w23 may be a mixture of water coming from locations of w10 w21 and w25 in the carbonate outcrops phreeqc 3 0 found two models with uncertainty 0 06 and table 5 shows the connection between cfa oka and cka in the shallow recharge zone it is worth noting that model a explains that water contained in w23 is mainly associated with w10 and w21 while model b explains that water of w23 is associated with w10 w21 and w25 the total summation of fractions of initial water samples w10 and w21 in model a is 1 suggesting that w23 may contain another water source beside w10 and w21 however the total summation of fractions of initial water samples w10 w21 and w25 in model b is exactly 1 0 combined with the spatial distribution of these water samples w23 is most likely associated exclusively with w10 w21 and w25 in other words there are strong connections between the three limestone aquifers in the shallow recharge zone regardless of model a or model b its hydrogeochemical process includes halite dissolution cation exchange and dolomite precipitation table 5 which explains why the concentrations of na k and cl increase while the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 decrease in w23 in relative to w10 w21 and w25 as the depth of deep groundwater circulation increases dolomite may precipitate releasing co2 and h2o case b connection of limestone aquifers in deep circulation zone the water sample w16 from cfa and two water samples w23 and w24 from oka are combined into group i according to the hca result suggesting that water from these two aquifers may be mixed in the deep circulation zone therefore along the groundwater flow taking w16 as the final water and w14 and w23 as the initial waters then only one model was obtained by applying phreeqc 3 0 table 6 shows a perfect connection between cfa and oka in the deep circulation zone i e the total summation of fractions of the initial water w14 and w23 is 1 11 and the uncertainty is 0 03 as groundwater flows co2 is consumed continuously to dissolve calcite and gypsum providing elevated concentrations of ca2 and so4 2 in w16 while dolomite precipitation causes the concentration of mg2 to decrease halite dissolution and cation exchange also take place during this process elevating concentrations of na k and cl in w16 therefore the inverse geochemical modeling provides a clear indication that the three limestone aquifers may connect with each other through faults and fractures and the groundwater chemical type changes from ca hco3 to na k cl along with the groundwater flow 4 4 2 3 origins of surface water and shallow groundwater surface water includes water in msps and huai river shallow groundwater is water in qla some indicators such as ph tds and concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in msps water show different levels of contamination according to who and usepa drinking water guidelines it is worthwhile to note that huai river and qla are important sources of drinking water in the study area if they are contaminated by msps water they will pose a serious public health hazard to local communities thus the origins and hydrogeochemical processes of water in msps huai river and qla must be understood first case a origin of water in msps water in msps is primarily from mines and it may also contain a certain portion of water from qla and or huai river since all coal mines have been closed in the study area water in mines can only be supplied by mixed water thus taking w3 as the final water and w1 w2 w5 and w7 as the initial waters only one model was obtained by applying phreeqc 3 0 with an uncertainty of 0 04 table 7 shows that the msps water is mainly associated with mixed water and qla with a few samples are associated with meteoric water and huai river the values of δ2h and δ18o isotopes in the msps water are very close to those of the qla water table 1 and fig 7 confirming that the main source of water in msps is the qla water the water in msps is acidic which is mainly related to gangue oxidation in msps fang et al 2015 as shown in table 7 calcite dolomite and gypsum are all dissolved because water in msps is weakly acidic ph 7 0 and contains a higher concentration of h which explains the elevated species ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 in w3 co2 and h2o are consumed due to carbonate minerals gypsum and halite dissolution evaporation may also take place according to the result of the isotopic analysis which explains the elevated concentrations of na k and cl in w3 case b origin of water in huai river taking w2 as the final water andw1 w4 and w5 as the initial waters then applying phreeqc 3 0 found 2 models models a and b with an uncertainty of 0 06 for the origin of water in huai river as shown in table 8 two models both show that water in huai river is mainly from water in meteoric water and qla thus huai river is less likely to be affected by water in msps both models a and b include dolomite dissolution cation exchange and halite precipitation due to evaporation in addition model b also has calcite precipitation and gypsum dissolution case c origin of water in qla taking w5 as the final water andw1 w2 and w3 as the initial water then the application of phreeqc 3 0 also found two models models a and b with an uncertainty of 0 08 for the water origin in qla as shown in table 9 two models show that water in qla is primarily associated with water in meteoric water and qla with a few samples associated with msps water thus there is a certain degree of hydraulic connection and exchange between waters in qla and msps even though the major elements in qla waters still meet the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa it is worthwhile to point out that the hydraulic connection between qla and msps could be in a two way manner this means that flow direction can be from qla to msps or vice versa depending on the hydraulic gradient between them at the moment of concern because of such a hydraulic connection of qla and msps the threat of contamination of water in qla by msps cannot be ruled out and must be taken into consideration as qla is a primary drinking water source for local communities models a and b both include halite and dolomite dissolution and model a has a lower dissolved molarity of halite than model b while model a has a higher dissolved molarity of dolomite than model b thus the high concentration of ca2 in model a is reduced by cation exchange while the low concentration of ca2 in model b is increased by calcite dissolution 4 4 3 major transport paths in the closed mines three major hydrogeochemical processes and transport paths were identified marking with different colors as shown in fig 8 the hydrogeochemical processes not only take place in the labeled zones but also occur throughout the entire multi aquifer hydrogeological system in the closed coal mines path 1 shows the origins of water in the closed mines based on the inverse geochemical modeling the water in the closed mines probably comes from qla fraction 14 35 and cfa fraction 82 62 accompanied by cation exchange and sulfate reduction which make the concentrations of na k and hco3 increase and make the concentration of so4 2 decrease along the groundwater flow path it is worth noting that water in the closed mines may recharge qla when the water level of closed mines is above its roof which may result in pollution of qla thus the water level variations of closed mines should be closely monitored in the future and measures should be taken to prevent the pollution of qla water from rising water level in closed mines path 2 shows the connections between the three limestone aquifers whether in the shallow recharge zone or in the deep circulation zone cfa oka and cka are connected through faults and fractures according to the results of hca and the inverse geochemical modeling as the depth of karst groundwater circulation increases the karst groundwater changes from ca hco3 type to na k cl type due to dolomite precipitates ion exchange and halite dissolution the inverse geochemical modeling shows that groundwater in the three limestone aquifers flows upwards to recharge the closed mine and pfa and no cross contamination has been found between water in the closed mines and the three limestone aquifers yet however water in the closed mines may mix with water in the limestone aquifers when the closed mines are recharged to a certain amount which will lead to cross contamination of the karst multi aquifer groundwater system thus it is necessary to closely monitor the water level and water quality of the three limestone aquifers water in the closed mines and pfa and to take effective control measures in advance to prevent cross contamination path 3 shows the hydraulic link and relationships between the surface water msps and huai river and shallow groundwater qla for example the water in msps is formed by carbonates gypsum and halite dissolution and evaporation from the mixed water qla meteoric water and huai river water in huai river mainly comes from meteoric water and qla accompanied by dolomite dissolution cation exchange and evaporation while water in qla water has origins from the mixed water qla and msps accompanied by halite and dolomite dissolution cation exchange or calcite dissolution thus these three water bodies are connected and their qualities can be altered because of such hydraulic connections although the water quality of huai river and qla have not been polluted by water in msps yet according to the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa for local communities water in qla is a vital drinking water source and immediate measures should be taken to minimize the hydraulic connection of qla and msps as much as possible for examples potential measures may include the following 1 treating msps water by neutralizing and removing contaminants through a variety of chemical physical and biological methods 2 dewatering msps water and then using coarse sand and soil rich in microorganisms and sawdust as materials to build a permeable reactive barrier prb wolkersdorfer and bowell 2004 3 finally filling msps with the native soil from qla 5 conclusions a case study in the huainan eastern closed coalfield partly affected by mining activities was investigated by hydrogeochemistry stable isotopes and statistic methods to identify hydrogeochemical processes and relevant transport paths the following conclusions can be drawn from this investigation 1 the ph value in the mining subsidence ponds msps water is lower than this in the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa and the tds and concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in msps water are higher than those in the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa 2 calcite dolomite gypsum halite organic carbon as well as atmosphere gases o2 co2 and h2o are identified as major reactants in the closed mines and dissolution precipitation of minerals cation exchange sulfate reduction and evaporation are considered as major potential reactions 3 water in the closed mines is mainly recharged by the overlying quaternary loose aquifer qla and the underlying limestone aquifers through faults and fractures accompanied by cation exchange and sulfate reduction 4 groundwaters in the three karst limestone aquifers are connected and flow upwards to recharge the closed mine and the permian aquifer through faults and fractures accompanied by halite dissolution cation exchange and dolomite precipitation 5 waters in msps huai river and qla are connected but the major elements in qla waters still meet the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa however considering that water in qla is a vital drinking water source for local communities proactive measurements should be undertaken to lower the risk of contamination of qla by msps through minimizing the hydraulic connection between them last but not least identification of the major hydrogeochemical processes provides essential insights for future groundwater management and environmental protection the proposed flow paths can be employed to predict variations related to active and inactive mines in the studied region and in other coal mining regions around the world since most of the coal mines have similar stratum structures lithological compositions fault structures and groundwater recharge and discharge conditions however due to the complexity of hydrogeological conditions in karst formations the inherent uncertainty of non repetitive sampling of this study needs to be further tested in future researches that should adopt the method of repetitive sampling to reduce the uncertainty of the results credit authorship contribution statement haitao zhang

5276,the water quality evolution of surface water and groundwater by mining activities and closed or abandoned mines is a grave public concern around the world to understand the characteristics of hydrogeochemical processes controlling the water quality evolution after the closure of mines a multi aquifer system in a closed coalfield in huainan eastern of china was investigated as an example based on the results of mineral characterizations hydrogeochemistry and stable isotopes carbonates minerals gypsum and clay minerals as well as atmosphere gases o2 co2 and h2o were recognized as major reactants and evaporation dissolution precipitation of minerals and cation exchange were potential reactions using inverse geochemical modeling three major hydrogeochemical paths in the closed mines were identified path1 shows that water in the closed mines is mainly recharged by the overlying quaternary aquifer and the underlying limestone aquifers through faults and fractures accompanied by cation exchange and sulfate reduction making the concentrations of na k and hco3 increase and the concentration of so4 2 decreases along the groundwater flow path path 2 shows that the karst groundwater flows from the shallow recharge zone to the deep circulation zone and then flows upwards to recharge the closed mine and the permian aquifer through faults and fractures along path 2 dolomite precipitates ion exchange and halite dissolution mainly take place making the concentrations of na k and cl increase and the concentration of ca2 and hco3 decrease and the water chemistry type change from ca hco3 type to na k cl type path 3 shows that waters in the mining subsidence ponds msps huai river and quaternary loose aquifer qla are connected although the major elements of water in qla still meet the drinking water guidelines of world health organization who and u s environmental protection agency usepa considering the fact that water in qla is a vital drinking water source for local communities proactive measurements should be undertaken to lower the risk of contamination of qla by msps through minimizing the hydraulic connection between them results of this study could benefit water quality prediction and management for these complex and vulnerable systems in the study area as well as other regions of the world keywords water pollution hydrogeochemistry stable isotopes inverse geochemical modeling closed mines 1 introduction contamination of surface water and groundwater by mining activities and closed or abandoned mines is a grave public concern around the world bridge 2004 chen et al 2017 dong et al 2019 gammons et al 2013 migaszewski et al 2018 park et al 2019 sun et al 2019 wolkersdorfer and bowell 2004 for example in china alone approximately 15 2 2 gm3 of surface water and 40 2 7 gm3 of groundwater have been affected by mining activities and closed or abandoned mines liang et al 2018 lu et al 2019 in recent decades with the shift of world economy and energy market and increasing environmental concern among the public coal mining activities which have been practiced for thousands of years for providing critical resources and energy for civilization bridge 2004 hartman and mutmansky 2002 have been reduced worldwide and many coal mines have been closed or abandoned hartman and mutmansky 2002 huo et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 when mines are closed the rising water from those closed mines is often mixed with native aquifer water through channels such as faults and fractures causing contamination of the otherwise contamination free native aquifer water adams and younger 2001 jeong et al 2018 tarasenko et al 2016 the rising water from the closed mines can also enter and pollute shallow quaternary aquifers and sometimes can even enter the surface water bodies to pollute rivers lakes and reservoirs cain et al 1994 dong et al 2019 feng and zhou 2012 wolkersdorfer and bowell 2004 it is therefore essential to understand how the qualities of surface and groundwater bodies evolve in closed coal mining regions before environmental protection measures can be taken because of their negative impacts on the surface water and groundwater qualities acid mine drainage amd and coal mine drainage cmd in active or abandoned mines have received extensive researches using simple scatter plots multivariate statistical analysis isotopes geochemical modeling etc dogramaci et al 2017 gammons et al 2010 2013 liu et al 2017 migaszewski et al 2018 park et al 2019 strosnider et al 2011 sun et al 2019 sun et al 2013 wolkersdorfer and bowell 2004 these researches successfully revealed the sophisticated water rock interactions and controlling hydrogeochemical evolution of different water bodies under mining operations binet et al 2016 cortes et al 2016 oiro et al 2018 qian et al 2018 sun et al 2019 sun et al 2013 wolkersdorfer and bowell 2004 however it appears to us that much less attention has been paid to investigate the hydrogeochemical processes and transport of contaminants associated with closed mines sun et al 2019 sun et al 2013 wolkersdorfer and bowell 2004 which usually have substantially different hydrodynamic conditions from those of the active mines adams and younger 2001 jeong et al 2018 tarasenko et al 2016 as the hydrogeochemical processes and chemical fate and transport are closely related to the hydrodynamic conditions it is understandable that the hydrogeochemical processes and chemical fate and transport in closed mines could be very different from those in active mines this motivates us to conduct this investigation the major ions and stable isotopes can provide geochemical information of groundwater in different aquifers dogramaci et al 2017 huang and wang 2018 malov and tokarev 2019 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b and thus enable evaluations of the hydrogeochemical processes and groundwater mobility bishop and lloyd 1990 liu et al 2017 qian et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a to identify water origins hydrogeochemical processes and chemical transport and fate several different approaches like hydrogeochemical analysis and multivariate statistics have been successfully employed to study regional and local groundwater systems before belkhiri et al 2010 cortes et al 2016 sefie et al 2018 voutsis et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a hydrogeochemical analysis methods such as graphical techniques e g piper diagrams and box plots and correlations analysis have been used widely to analyze the hydrogeochemical characteristics and sources of major ions ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b zhang et al 2019b multivariate statistical methods such as hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca have been employed successfully to identify aquifer connectivity huang and han 2017 qian et al 2016 wu et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 and hydrogeochemical processes blake et al 2016 li et al 2019 liu et al 2017 in recent years some researchers found that inverse geochemical modeling can identify the potential reactants and reactions in hydrogeochemical processes which offer possibilities to illustrate water origins from a different perspective belkhiri et al 2010 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 sharif et al 2008 trabelsi and zouari 2019 xing et al 2013 therefore application of multiple methods synchronously to maximize the strengths of those methods may provide a reasonable explanation for the hydrogeochemical evolution mechanism in this study hierarchical cluster analysis hca hydrogeochemical correlations analysis isotope analysis and inverse geochemical modeling with mineral phase were employed cohesively to identify water origins hydrogeochemical processes and transport paths in a multi aquifer system in the closed coalfield of the southeastern huainan area the selected area is a typical concealed closed coalfield in china including eight closed coal mines huai river quaternary loose aquifer and shallow limestone groundwater in this area are not only ecological resources but also the only domestic water supply sources for local residents zhang et al 2016a the primary concern of this area is that the quality of surface water and groundwater changes when the coal mines are closed prior to this work some studies have investigated the distribution characteristics of as se hg cd co cr cu fe mn pb and zn in the mining subsidence ponds and showed that some elements such as co as and cr were greater than those in who and usepa drinking water guidelines yao and gui 2008 wang et al 2012 chen et al 2019 in addition no research on water pollution and hydrogeochemical evolution has been reported in this area to identify the primary hydrogeochemical processes controlling water quality the objectives of this investigation are as follows first to identify the main sources and transport paths forming the closed mines water second to show the links between the three limestone aquifers in the study site to check the karst multi aquifer groundwater cross contamination issue third to identify the main sources and paths of waters in the mining subsidence ponds huai river and quaternary aquifer and to check whether waters in the quaternary aquifer and huai river are contaminated by the mining subsidence ponds water 2 study area the huainan eastern closed coalfield which is chosen as the study area fig 1 is located in the southeast of the huainan region in anhui province china with a total area of 15 km2 this region is subjected to a semi humid climate with seasonal monsoons with elevations varying from 17 to 22 m above mean sea level a m s l the annual average temperature is 16 5 c and the annual average precipitation is 925 27 mm and the precipitation occurs primarily in june july and august accounting for about 60 of the total annual precipitation zhang et al 2019b in the south of the closed huainan coalfield there are bagong mountain and shungeng mountain with an elevation of 120 m to 220 m a m s l and they are the recharge outcrops for the regional limestone groundwater in the north of the study area huai river which is usually used as a water divide between northern and southern china flows through the closed coalfield huai river and quaternary aquifer in this area are vital sources of drinking water supply and agricultural activity for local communities meng et al 2013 eight coal mines including liyi li er xieyi xie er xiesan wangfenggang xinzhuangzi and lizuizi coal mines as shown in fig 1 lie between huai river and the two mountains and are all closed some mining subsidence ponds msps formed by long term underground mining are distributed in the region similar to other areas in china from top to bottom the main strata in this area are quaternary permian carboniferous ordovician and cambrian and the permian stratum is the main coal bearing stratum mainly coal seam 1 in fig 2 the main aquifers from top to bottom are the quaternary loose sand aquifer qla the permian fractured sandstone aquifer pfa the carboniferous fractured karst limestone aquifer cfa the ordovician karst limestone aquifer oka and the cambrian karst limestone aquifer cka as shown in fig 2 qla is about 0 60 m thick and dominated by fine sand with 1 2 layers of calcareous clay which belongs to fluvial sediments pfa is about 500 m thick and is primarily composed of medium to fine sandstone interspersing with mudstone and sandy mudstone cfa is about 120 m thick which comprises 10 13 thin layers of limestone mudstone sandy mudstone and thin coal seams oka is about 150 m thick and is primarily composed of dolomitic and argillaceous limestone cka is more than 1000 m thick according to the cambrian strata outcrops and is primarily composed of limestone and dolomite with locally interspersed sandstone and shale in addition dissolution fissures apertures and caves are prevalent in cfa oka and cka and are usually filled or semi filled with calcite dolomite or gypsum cao et al 2017 tian 2014 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2020 the closed huainan eastern coalfield is located in a thrust nappe tectonic zone so it has been conventionally considered as a relatively independent hydrogeological unit zhang et al 2019a faults and fractures are widely developed in the closed coalfield due to multi phase tectonic movements during the indochina and yanshan periods and they could connect different aquifers according to the observations of water levels of aquifers in the study area qla pfa and cfa should be the direct and primary sources of water for the closed mines and oka and cka can recharge cfa through faults and fractures before the closure of coal mines in the study area the surface water and groundwater flowed from outcrops of both mountains to the valley fig 1 and formed a large groundwater depression cone around the faults f7 and f10 while the influence of the groundwater depression cone has gradually decreased and the groundwater levels in aquifers begin to recover after all coal mines are closed fig 2 the hydrogeological profile fig 2 selected for the study area is compatible with most other coalfields in china 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and laboratory analyses compared with surface water groundwater circulation rate is relatively slow and is mainly controlled by long term water rock interactions thus 25 water samples in this study were collected for one time after all coal mines were closed in 2016 except for one meteoric water sample that was collected in march 2019 the remaining 24 water samples were collected in december 2018 details in table 1 positions shown in figs 1 and 2 although a larger number of samples collected over a long span of time duration are always desirable the 25 water samples used in this study are the maximum possible samples we can collect given the constrains of accessibility and time duration of the project indeed lack of data replication is not uncommon in many similar field investigations such as huang and han 2017 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 qian et al 2016 and qian et al 2018 however one must be aware of the potential uncertainty inherent in unreplicated sampling and should take all the possible means to collect replicated data in the future investigations despite of all the challenges in field investigations except for some samples taken directly from the surface such as meteoric water huai river water and water from msps all other samples were obtained from water level observation wells a total of 11 parameters were measured in all samples including temperature t ph total dissolved solids tds na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 δ2h and δ18o the t and ph values were measured on site using a portable probe hi8424 ph 0 01 italy prior to sampling in the testing center in anhui university of science and technology by the authors all water samples were filtered on site through 0 45 μm membranes the 25 samples for the cation analysis were stored in 550 ml polypropylene bottles and acidified with hno3 until ph values are 2 the duplicate set of 25 samples for the anion analysis was not acidified the concentrations of major anion ions such as cl so4 2 and hco3 were analyzed via ion chromatography dionex 120 thermo fisher scientific usa and the concentrations of major cation ions such as ca2 mg2 na and k were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry thermo fisher scientific usa since the k concentrations in water samples were very low the na and k concentrations were analyzed as a sum na k major ions of all water samples were analyzed within 24 hr of collection the phreeqc 3 0 software package was used to calculate the saturation index of calcite dolomite and gypsum and the charge balance of each sample all water samples maintained perfect charge balances with error 3 table 1 the δ2h and δ18o isotopes of the water samples were analyzed at the school of earth and space sciences university of science and technology of china in hefei of china within three days of collection the δ2h isotope was measured using the zinc reaction method and the δ18o isotope was measured using the oxygen and carbon dioxide balance method with a mat252 isotope mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa the test results of the δ2h and δ18o isotopes were examined in comparison with the vienna standard mean ocean water standard with the ranges of 0 2 and 0 1 respectively in addition cores from qla pfa cfa oka and cka were collected and tested to predict the potential reactants some portions of core samples were disaggregated to pass a 0 063 mm sieve using an agate mortar and identification of mineral phases of these samples was performed on x ray diffraction xrd test using a smartlab se xrd rigaku japan the other portions of core samples were cut into pieces 8 8 2 mm3 face polished with argon ions using a cross section polisher and coated by a carbon coater these polished thin sections were analyzed by an electron microscope sem test using a flexsem1000 sem hitachi hightechnologies corp japan both xrd and sem tests were conducted at the testing center of anhui university of science and technology huainan china 3 2 analytical methods in this study hca was used to analyze the hydrogeochemical data using the spss 19 0 statistical software hca was employed to classify similar water samples into separated groups based on the consideration of various hydrogeochemical indicators e g na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl so4 2 δ2h and δ18o the same group contains water samples that are similar to each other but different from other samples in another group liu et al 2017 voutsis et al 2015 in this study the euclidean distance and the ward method were selected for the geometric distance and the linkage rules between the water samples respectively because they have been found to be applicable to hydrogeochemical studies qian et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 the δ2h and δ18o isotopes as part of water molecules can not only track regional groundwater movement but also provide a convenient way to study the hydrogeochemical formation and evolution carreira et al 2014 liu et al 2016 yeh and lee 2018 furthermore inverse geochemical modeling provides possibilities to illustrate processes in diverse terms and has been used to investigate hydrogeochemical evolution and water origins by numerous investigators before belkhiri et al 2010 carucci et al 2012 liu et al 2019 morán ramírez et al 2016 therefore the combination of stable isotopes and inverse geochemical modeling can accurately identify the water origins hydrogeochemical processes and chemical transport and fate in this study the program phreeqc 3 0 liu et al 2017 was employed to simulate the hydrogeochemical processes occurred along the flow paths 4 results and discussion 4 1 general hydrogeochemical characteristics eight types of water samples were classified from a hydrogeological perspective as shown in table 1 the two water samples w3 and w4 from msps are weakly acidic and weakly saline ph 7 and tds greater than 1 while all other water samples are weakly alkaline and fresh ph greater than 7 and tds 1 in most of these water samples the dominant cations are ca2 and mg2 and the main anion is hco3 suggesting a carbonate system liu et al 2017 and 2019 however in some water samples such as water samples w7 w8 w9 w16 w17 w23 and w24 na k are the dominant cations and cl or so4 2 is the main anion suggesting a complex water rock interaction or and local mixing process chen et al 2008 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 in addition the ph value in msps water w3 and w4 was lower than those in the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa and the tds and concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in msps water were greater than those in the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa thus they may influence the water quality of the nearby huai river and qla 4 2 hierarchical cluster analysis using the ward method and euclidean distance method qian et al 2016 hca yielded optimum distinct groups as shown in fig 3 the phenon line of 2 0 divides the 25 water samples into 9 groups from their various spatial positions fig 1 shows the general positions and fig 2 shows the aquifer layers the water samples of each group are shown in fig 3 as seen from fig 4 the water samples from groups a b e f g h are dominated by ca2 and hco3 and their chemical types are ca hco3 suggesting that these waters were formed in an environment with good recharge or discharge conditions with short groundwater residence times such conditions are usually presented in relatively permeable formations formed by enlargement of flow channels and improvement of permeability due to carbonate dissolution liu et al 2017 with the groundwater discharge conditions getting worse or groundwater residence time becomes longer the chemical compositions of groundwater gradually become more complex in which the cation ca2 is gradually replaced by na k and the anion hco3 is gradually replaced by so4 2 or cl chen et al 2008 thus the chemical types of groups c d and i are of ca so4 na k hco3 na k cl and na so4 hco3 the diversity of hydrogeochemical types again indicates that the groundwater hydrogeochemical processes in the study area are complex huang and han 2017 liu et al 2017 oiro et al 2018 qian et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 and requires appropriate methods to decipher their mechanisms from different perspectives which is precisely what we are doing in this study 4 3 evidence of major hydrogeochemical processes 4 3 1 mineral phase analysis the xrd and sem tests see figs s1 and s2 in supplementary materials show that the potential reactants for the water rock reactions include carbonate minerals e g calcite and dolomite crystal minerals e g gypsum quartz halite and feldspar clay minerals e g kaolinite and organic materials e g carbon cao et al 2017 sun et al 2019 tian 2014 xu et al 2017 the xrd and sem tests also show that pyrite may exist in pfa and cfa but it is not considered due to the fact that the amount of pyrite is below detection limit the major ion compositions in water sample indicate that there are major reactants such as calcite dolomite and gypsum along with some halite the clay layers contain the most important aquitard materials so cation exchange can also be assessed in these aquitards in addition the organic carbon is widely distributed in pfa and cfa where sulfate reduction may take place in a relatively closed and reducing environment the predicted potential minerals and reactions are listed in table 2 4 3 2 source analysis of ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 as seen in fig 5 a and 5b the water samples are not always consistent with the carbonate saturation indexes but carbonate minerals with high si are generally related to high hco3 concentration many studies have found that ca2 mg2 and hco3 in surface water and groundwater are mainly derived from carbonate mineral dissolution liu et al 2019 qian et al 2018 qian et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 as seen in fig 5c the values of ρ ca2 ρ mg2 ρ so4 2 ρ hco3 in most water samples except for the water samples from group d are all close to 1 indicating that ca2 and mg2 in groundwater are mainly derived from carbonate and sulfate dissolution chen et al 2017 the values of ρ ca2 ρ mg2 ρ so4 2 ρ hco3 in water samples form group d is 1 which may be related to cation exchange and sulfate reduction causing the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 to decrease while the concentrations of na k and hco3 to increase the molar ratio of hco3 to ca2 mainly reflects the dissolution of carbonate minerals and cation exchange and or sulfate reduction liu et al 2017 when ρ hco3 ρ ca2 2 it means that hco3 and ca2 come from the single dissolution of calcite eq 1 when ρ hco3 ρ ca2 4 it means that hco3 and ca2 come from the single dissolution of dolomite eq 2 as shown in fig 5d the lines y 2x and y 4x divide the entire area into three zones the lower zone shows an hco3 deficiency and only two samples from group c fall into this zone fig 5d which may be related to the ph values of these water samples ph 7 0 table 1 the neutralization reaction between h and hco3 in weakly acidic water reduces the hco3 concentration while increases the ca2 and mg2 concentrations the middle zone shows an hco3 concentration increase which represents a combination of calcite and dolomite dissolution or calcite dissolution and cation exchange zhang et al 2020 as shown in fig 5d most of water samples except for water samples from groups c and d fall into the middle zone confirming again that they are mainly influenced by carbonates dissolution and cation exchange combining the locations of the sampling points see figs 1 and 2 with the hydrogeological conditions it is reasonable to infer that the water samples from group a with low hco3 and ca2 concentrations represent natural water the water samples from groups b e f g h and i are characterized by high hco3 and ca2 concentrations which are mainly related to calcite dissolution and cation exchange 1 calcite cac o 3 c o 2 g h 2 o c a 2 2 hco 3 2 dolomite camg c o 3 2 2 c o 2 g 2 h 2 o c a 2 m g 2 4 hco 3 if the major origins of ca2 mg2 and hco3 are from the calcite and dolomite dissolution then the upper zone can be involved with cation exchange and or sulfate reduction resulting in an hco3 concentration greater than four times of ca2 liu et al 2017 in fig 5d the three water samples from group d are characterized by high hco3 concentrations and low ca2 concentrations which may be associated with cation exchange and sulfate reduction because mixed water group d is in a relatively closed and reducing environment and clay crystal minerals and organic carbon are widely distributed thus it is very conducive for cation exchange and sulfate reduction to take place there eq 3 3 desulfidation so 4 2 2c 2 h 2 o h 2 s 2hco 3 fig 5e provides evidence of gypsum in these water samples and gypsum has a good correlation with an increasing trend of ca2 and so4 2 concentrations furthermore fig 5f provides further evidence for gypsum in the surface water samples from groups a b and c with correlation coefficients greater than 0 9 ca2 r2 0 901 so4 2 r2 0 915 the surface water is an open environment which is greatly affected by the atmospheric condition temperature humidity precipitation and less affected by water rock interactions liu et al 2017 therefore gypsum has a strong ability to dissolve in fig 5g the values of ρ ca2 ρ mg2 ρ so4 2 in all samples are close to 1 indicating that so4 2 in all water samples is derived primarily from gypsum dissolution eq 4 however the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in group c are much higher than those in other groups fig 5g which may be also related to the ph values of water samples the two water samples from group c show weakly acidic containing a higher concentration of h when h in water reacts with carbonate minerals it will make the ca2 and mg2 concentrations increase while make the hco3 concentration decrease thus the value of ρ so4 2 ρ hco3 increases accordingly as shown in fig 5h only the value of ρ so4 2 ρ hco3 in group c is more than 0 5 thus group c can be easily distinguished from other groups 4 gypsum cas o 4 2 h 2 o c a 2 so 4 2 2 h 2 o 4 3 3 source analysis of na k and cl in general the concentrations of na k and cl are relatively stable in water thus ρ na k ρ cl is often used to explain the source of na k when ρ na k ρ cl 1 it means that the na k and cl in water are derived from halite dissolution chen et al 2017 as seen in fig 6 a the values in these water samples show that ρ na k ρ cl greater than 1 indicating that in addition to halite dissolution eq 5 cation exchange should take place as well group d shows high na k concentrations and low cl concentration fig 6a indicating that the cation exchange in group d may be the strongest 5 halite n a k cl n a k c l if mineral dissolution is the major origins of ca2 mg2 and na k then the ratio of ρ ca mg so4 hco3 ρ na k cl in mol l will be at 1 1 chen et al 2017 the scatter distribution in fig 6b in the lower left zone confirms that cation exchange eq 6 occurs in these water samples voutsis et al 2015 group d shows the high value of ρ na k cl and the low value of ρ ca mg so4 hco3 suggesting that group d has the strongest cation exchange causing the na k concentration to increase while the ca2 and mg2 concentrations to decrease 6 n a k rock c a 2 m g 2 water n a k water c a 2 m g 2 rock 4 4 hydrogeochemical paths analysis 4 4 1 isotope analysis the δ2h and δ18o isotopes can be used to trace regional groundwater movement and to study the nature of correlations between surface water and groundwater as well as the characteristics of groundwater circulation carreira et al 2014 chen et al 2008 zhan et al 2016 accordingly this study used the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 7 9 δ18o 8 2 zheng et al 1983 and local evaporation line lel δ2h 5 9 δ18o 7 8 ge et al 2014 as the baselines to study groundwater movement and aquifer hydraulic connection as seen in fig 7 all water samples fall into the lower right of the gmwl lmwl and lel indicating that meteoric water is the main source of the local surface water and groundwater huang and han 2017 as the depth of groundwater increases the values of δ2h and δ18o gradually decrease pang et al 2017 therefore the direction of groundwater flow is basically along lel from the upper right to the lower left as shown in fig 7 the water samples from the surface water groups a and b and the qla water group c fall into the upper right of the lower part of lel fig 7 showing that δ2h and δ18o in the water samples drift slightly in relative to those of the meteoric water this indicates that surface water and qla water are mainly influenced by meteoric water and evaporation while weakly influenced by water rock interactions huang and han 2017 as shown in fig 7 the water samples w10 w21 and w25 in the carbonate outcrop see fig 2 show slight δ2h and δ18o drifts suggesting that these water samples are affected not only by meteoric water and evaporation but also likely by complex water rock interactions such as carbonate and gypsum dissolution and cation exchange liu et al 2016 the water samples from group d fig 7 have seen a δ2h isotope drift suggesting that these waters were formed in a relatively closed environment which is prone for sulfate reduction to take place pang et al 2017 the values of δ2h and δ18o isotopes at the intersection of the δ2h drift line of group d water samples δ2h 42 634 δ18o 281 42 r2 0 689 and lmwl are smaller than those of the surface water and shallow groundwater in the study area indicating that water samples in group d must come from a deep groundwater system chen et al 2008 however the water samples from group e mainly exhibit a δ18o isotope drift and the δ2h drift line δ2h 6 241 δ18o 12 293 r2 0 875 is almost parallel to lel indicating that the groundwater flow in cfa is relatively uniform and the minerals dissolution and cation exchange may both take place chen et al 2008 as seen in fig 7 the water samples from groups h and i are distributed between the water samples from group e suggesting that they may have been mixed with cfa water huang and han 2017 pang et al 2017 4 4 2 inverse geochemical modeling in this study we focused on the major ions e g na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 and stable isotopes e g δ2h and δ18o for inverse modeling and select water samples representing initial and final water samples along the potential flow paths in the modeling exercises the reactants and reactions involved in this hydrogeochemical process are shown in table 3 based on the results of previous analysis 4 4 2 1 origins of water in the closed mines when all coal mines in the study area were closed the water level of the closed mines began to rise based on the time series monitoring of the surface water and groundwater levels it is inferred that the water sources of the closed mines may primarily come from qla and cfa besides pfa taking w7 as the final water and w5 w10 and w15 as the initial waters we found 2 models models a and b with uncertainty 0 05 after exercising the geochemical model of phreeqc 3 0 as seen from table 4 both model a and model b show that water in the closed mines mainly comes from cfa and a small amount comes from qla as seen in table 4 models a and b both include cation exchange and sulfate reduction which is consistent with the results of previous analysis these two models can reasonably explain the high concentrations of na k and hco3 and low concentration of so4 2 in closed mines water the difference is that model a has dolomite dissolution while model b has calcite dissolution but both with lower dissolved molarity co2 is consumed in both models a and b due to carbonate dissolution 4 4 2 2 connection of limestone aquifers water in limestone is not only the main source of water in the closed mines but is also an important groundwater resource in the study area thus two cases of connections of limestone aquifers in shallow recharge and deep circulation zones were considered in the following analysis case a connection of limestone aquifers in shallow recharge zone from a perspective of the spatial distribution of water samples and hca result w23 may be a mixture of water coming from locations of w10 w21 and w25 in the carbonate outcrops phreeqc 3 0 found two models with uncertainty 0 06 and table 5 shows the connection between cfa oka and cka in the shallow recharge zone it is worth noting that model a explains that water contained in w23 is mainly associated with w10 and w21 while model b explains that water of w23 is associated with w10 w21 and w25 the total summation of fractions of initial water samples w10 and w21 in model a is 1 suggesting that w23 may contain another water source beside w10 and w21 however the total summation of fractions of initial water samples w10 w21 and w25 in model b is exactly 1 0 combined with the spatial distribution of these water samples w23 is most likely associated exclusively with w10 w21 and w25 in other words there are strong connections between the three limestone aquifers in the shallow recharge zone regardless of model a or model b its hydrogeochemical process includes halite dissolution cation exchange and dolomite precipitation table 5 which explains why the concentrations of na k and cl increase while the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 decrease in w23 in relative to w10 w21 and w25 as the depth of deep groundwater circulation increases dolomite may precipitate releasing co2 and h2o case b connection of limestone aquifers in deep circulation zone the water sample w16 from cfa and two water samples w23 and w24 from oka are combined into group i according to the hca result suggesting that water from these two aquifers may be mixed in the deep circulation zone therefore along the groundwater flow taking w16 as the final water and w14 and w23 as the initial waters then only one model was obtained by applying phreeqc 3 0 table 6 shows a perfect connection between cfa and oka in the deep circulation zone i e the total summation of fractions of the initial water w14 and w23 is 1 11 and the uncertainty is 0 03 as groundwater flows co2 is consumed continuously to dissolve calcite and gypsum providing elevated concentrations of ca2 and so4 2 in w16 while dolomite precipitation causes the concentration of mg2 to decrease halite dissolution and cation exchange also take place during this process elevating concentrations of na k and cl in w16 therefore the inverse geochemical modeling provides a clear indication that the three limestone aquifers may connect with each other through faults and fractures and the groundwater chemical type changes from ca hco3 to na k cl along with the groundwater flow 4 4 2 3 origins of surface water and shallow groundwater surface water includes water in msps and huai river shallow groundwater is water in qla some indicators such as ph tds and concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in msps water show different levels of contamination according to who and usepa drinking water guidelines it is worthwhile to note that huai river and qla are important sources of drinking water in the study area if they are contaminated by msps water they will pose a serious public health hazard to local communities thus the origins and hydrogeochemical processes of water in msps huai river and qla must be understood first case a origin of water in msps water in msps is primarily from mines and it may also contain a certain portion of water from qla and or huai river since all coal mines have been closed in the study area water in mines can only be supplied by mixed water thus taking w3 as the final water and w1 w2 w5 and w7 as the initial waters only one model was obtained by applying phreeqc 3 0 with an uncertainty of 0 04 table 7 shows that the msps water is mainly associated with mixed water and qla with a few samples are associated with meteoric water and huai river the values of δ2h and δ18o isotopes in the msps water are very close to those of the qla water table 1 and fig 7 confirming that the main source of water in msps is the qla water the water in msps is acidic which is mainly related to gangue oxidation in msps fang et al 2015 as shown in table 7 calcite dolomite and gypsum are all dissolved because water in msps is weakly acidic ph 7 0 and contains a higher concentration of h which explains the elevated species ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 in w3 co2 and h2o are consumed due to carbonate minerals gypsum and halite dissolution evaporation may also take place according to the result of the isotopic analysis which explains the elevated concentrations of na k and cl in w3 case b origin of water in huai river taking w2 as the final water andw1 w4 and w5 as the initial waters then applying phreeqc 3 0 found 2 models models a and b with an uncertainty of 0 06 for the origin of water in huai river as shown in table 8 two models both show that water in huai river is mainly from water in meteoric water and qla thus huai river is less likely to be affected by water in msps both models a and b include dolomite dissolution cation exchange and halite precipitation due to evaporation in addition model b also has calcite precipitation and gypsum dissolution case c origin of water in qla taking w5 as the final water andw1 w2 and w3 as the initial water then the application of phreeqc 3 0 also found two models models a and b with an uncertainty of 0 08 for the water origin in qla as shown in table 9 two models show that water in qla is primarily associated with water in meteoric water and qla with a few samples associated with msps water thus there is a certain degree of hydraulic connection and exchange between waters in qla and msps even though the major elements in qla waters still meet the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa it is worthwhile to point out that the hydraulic connection between qla and msps could be in a two way manner this means that flow direction can be from qla to msps or vice versa depending on the hydraulic gradient between them at the moment of concern because of such a hydraulic connection of qla and msps the threat of contamination of water in qla by msps cannot be ruled out and must be taken into consideration as qla is a primary drinking water source for local communities models a and b both include halite and dolomite dissolution and model a has a lower dissolved molarity of halite than model b while model a has a higher dissolved molarity of dolomite than model b thus the high concentration of ca2 in model a is reduced by cation exchange while the low concentration of ca2 in model b is increased by calcite dissolution 4 4 3 major transport paths in the closed mines three major hydrogeochemical processes and transport paths were identified marking with different colors as shown in fig 8 the hydrogeochemical processes not only take place in the labeled zones but also occur throughout the entire multi aquifer hydrogeological system in the closed coal mines path 1 shows the origins of water in the closed mines based on the inverse geochemical modeling the water in the closed mines probably comes from qla fraction 14 35 and cfa fraction 82 62 accompanied by cation exchange and sulfate reduction which make the concentrations of na k and hco3 increase and make the concentration of so4 2 decrease along the groundwater flow path it is worth noting that water in the closed mines may recharge qla when the water level of closed mines is above its roof which may result in pollution of qla thus the water level variations of closed mines should be closely monitored in the future and measures should be taken to prevent the pollution of qla water from rising water level in closed mines path 2 shows the connections between the three limestone aquifers whether in the shallow recharge zone or in the deep circulation zone cfa oka and cka are connected through faults and fractures according to the results of hca and the inverse geochemical modeling as the depth of karst groundwater circulation increases the karst groundwater changes from ca hco3 type to na k cl type due to dolomite precipitates ion exchange and halite dissolution the inverse geochemical modeling shows that groundwater in the three limestone aquifers flows upwards to recharge the closed mine and pfa and no cross contamination has been found between water in the closed mines and the three limestone aquifers yet however water in the closed mines may mix with water in the limestone aquifers when the closed mines are recharged to a certain amount which will lead to cross contamination of the karst multi aquifer groundwater system thus it is necessary to closely monitor the water level and water quality of the three limestone aquifers water in the closed mines and pfa and to take effective control measures in advance to prevent cross contamination path 3 shows the hydraulic link and relationships between the surface water msps and huai river and shallow groundwater qla for example the water in msps is formed by carbonates gypsum and halite dissolution and evaporation from the mixed water qla meteoric water and huai river water in huai river mainly comes from meteoric water and qla accompanied by dolomite dissolution cation exchange and evaporation while water in qla water has origins from the mixed water qla and msps accompanied by halite and dolomite dissolution cation exchange or calcite dissolution thus these three water bodies are connected and their qualities can be altered because of such hydraulic connections although the water quality of huai river and qla have not been polluted by water in msps yet according to the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa for local communities water in qla is a vital drinking water source and immediate measures should be taken to minimize the hydraulic connection of qla and msps as much as possible for examples potential measures may include the following 1 treating msps water by neutralizing and removing contaminants through a variety of chemical physical and biological methods 2 dewatering msps water and then using coarse sand and soil rich in microorganisms and sawdust as materials to build a permeable reactive barrier prb wolkersdorfer and bowell 2004 3 finally filling msps with the native soil from qla 5 conclusions a case study in the huainan eastern closed coalfield partly affected by mining activities was investigated by hydrogeochemistry stable isotopes and statistic methods to identify hydrogeochemical processes and relevant transport paths the following conclusions can be drawn from this investigation 1 the ph value in the mining subsidence ponds msps water is lower than this in the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa and the tds and concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in msps water are higher than those in the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa 2 calcite dolomite gypsum halite organic carbon as well as atmosphere gases o2 co2 and h2o are identified as major reactants in the closed mines and dissolution precipitation of minerals cation exchange sulfate reduction and evaporation are considered as major potential reactions 3 water in the closed mines is mainly recharged by the overlying quaternary loose aquifer qla and the underlying limestone aquifers through faults and fractures accompanied by cation exchange and sulfate reduction 4 groundwaters in the three karst limestone aquifers are connected and flow upwards to recharge the closed mine and the permian aquifer through faults and fractures accompanied by halite dissolution cation exchange and dolomite precipitation 5 waters in msps huai river and qla are connected but the major elements in qla waters still meet the drinking water guidelines of who and usepa however considering that water in qla is a vital drinking water source for local communities proactive measurements should be undertaken to lower the risk of contamination of qla by msps through minimizing the hydraulic connection between them last but not least identification of the major hydrogeochemical processes provides essential insights for future groundwater management and environmental protection the proposed flow paths can be employed to predict variations related to active and inactive mines in the studied region and in other coal mining regions around the world since most of the coal mines have similar stratum structures lithological compositions fault structures and groundwater recharge and discharge conditions however due to the complexity of hydrogeological conditions in karst formations the inherent uncertainty of non repetitive sampling of this study needs to be further tested in future researches that should adopt the method of repetitive sampling to reduce the uncertainty of the results credit authorship contribution statement haitao zhang

5277,the accurate identification of groundwater pollution sources is the key to site remediation and management which directly relates to the cost and effect of remediation during later periods studying the identification of some small area site pollution sources by using a small amount of groundwater monitoring data is difficult and is currently a hot topic in the field of groundwater management in this study a method combining the advection dispersion equation ade of contaminants in groundwater with genetic algorithm ga was proposed to identify groundwater pollution sources that is the location of the pollution source the time of pollution release and the intensity of pollution release a sandbox experiment for the migration and transformation of deterministic petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater is designed to verify the method the results show that the method code program has basically the same identification parameters as the deterministic experimental pollution source parameters the ade ga method was applied to an actual site polluted by a gas station in beijing china the parameters of the pollution source obtained from the detailed site investigation are basically consistent with the calculated values therefore the source code established in this work is a reliable tool for identifying the parameters of groundwater pollution sources in small areas keywords advection dispersion equation ade genetic algorithm ga source identification sandbox experiment site application investigation data 1 introduction pollution source identification is the key to controlling and remediating groundwater pollution xu and gómez hernández 2016 therefore it is very important to identify the source of pollution for previously polluted groundwater i e identify the location time and amount of the pollution source release ayvaz 2010 through the inverse problem solving method based on data of the position and concentration of the pollutants when monitored downstream of the groundwater sun et al 2006 yeh et al 2007 xia et al 2019 the inversion methods of pollutant transport bagtzoglou and atmadja 2005 to solve the inverse problem of pollution source identification mainly include the direct method stochastic method and optimization method sun et al 2006 atmadja and bagtzoglou 2001 the geochemical footprint method is commonly used in the direct method the principle of the geochemical footprint method is to obtain the source parameters by using isotope and geochemical fingerprint methods kohl et al 1971 liu et al 2006 bronders et al 2012 aeppli et al 2013 chen et al 2017 miglietta et al 2017 shakya et al 2019 however the application of the geochemical footprint method to the analysis of soil and groundwater pollution sources is immature in addition when there are multiple pollution sources uncertainty assessments are lacking and the quantization accuracy is limited stout et al 1998 in the stochastic statistical method the parameters for groundwater pollution sources are considered as random variables this method uses a certain mathematical method to find the probability of each parameter within a certain range and finally generates the parameter as the result snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 butera and tanda 2003 michalak and kitanidis 2004 boano et al 2005 sun 2007 butera et al 2013 venkatramanan et al 2016 long et al 2018 unfortunately the stochastic statistical method considers less relevant parameters such as the actual site hydrogeological conditions in addition the stochastic statistical method only involves a large amount of data processing so it cannot truly represent the actual situation moreover there are more unknowns and higher spatial dimensions during the calculation process which results in a larger calculation load the basic principle of the optimization method is to establish the corresponding solute model the simulation results were compared with the observed values and the process was continuously optimized to obtain the pollution source parameters singh and datta 2006 optimization methods include classical methods containing gradient calculations and non classical methods containing non gradient calculations gandhi et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 identified the mass loading rate of unknown pollution sources by using the classical optimization method of linear programming in matlab software gandhi et al 2016 used a non classical optimization method of direct search in matlab software to identify the characteristics of virus sources in groundwater in recent years as a heuristic search algorithm with global convergence yeh et al 2007 and another non classical optimization method gandhi et al 2016 genetic algorithm has attracted increasing attention singh et al 2008 jin et al 2009 ayvaz 2016 genetic algorithms are widely used in the research of optimization problems because of their advantages such as easy convergence and high accuracy ayaz 2017 moreover non gradient search is the characteristic of genetic algorithm which can find the global optimal solution well thus the disadvantages of gradient based search method can be overcome ayaz 2017 the research shows that this method can still achieve accurate identification with multiple unknown sources of pollution singh and datta 2006 mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 used the real encoded genetic algorithm rga and the binary encoded genetic algorithm bga in matlab software to combine with several different local search methods so as to realize the identification of the location and release intensity of the assumed two dimensional pollution site the genetic algorithm is combined with a groundwater simulation model to form a new method that identifies the groundwater pollution sources the results show that the initial estimate of the source parameters will not affect the final identification result aral et al 2001 ayaz 2017 combined the pollutant transport model with the optimization simulation model based on genetic algorithm in matlab software to identify the groundwater pollution source of the hypothetical site when the population size of the genetic algorithm was relatively small and obtained very good results sophia and bhattacharjya 2020 combined modflow and mt3dms models with genetic algorithm to identify pollution sources in a hypothetical study area with homogeneous and isotropic aquifers xia et al 2019 used the hyper parameters obtained based on the taguchi experimental design tuning method to optimize the genetic algorithm so as to perform more effective pollution source identification on the hypothetical site of irregular geometry and non uniform media all the works mentioned above were tested in hypothetical cases table 1 currently only a small amount of literature on the application of other source identification methods in the laboratory can be found cupola et al 2015 designed a sandbox experiment to verify the performance of the simultaneous release function and source location identification srsi and backward probability model based on adjoint state method bpm asm in the identification of pollution source location and release time chen et al 2018 verified the ability of restart ensemble kalman filter r enkf to identify pollution source and geometry of aquifer by designing a sandbox experiment zanini and woodbury 2016 used the empirical bayes method combined with akaike s bayes information standard abic to deduce the release history of groundwater pollutants using the data obtained through the sandbox experiment the filling medium and tracer used in the above sandbox experiments are glass beads and sodium fluorescein respectively and the influence of the natural attenuation of pollutants on the concentration is not considered the purpose of this paper is to establish a genetic algorithm calculation program which is based on the solute transport governing equation in groundwater ade ga and to improve the genetic algorithm population size in matlab software simultaneously a sandbox experiment considering the natural attenuation of pollutants is designed to verify the proposed improved method so as to use it to identify groundwater pollution sources of actual contaminated site this is the first time that the improved population size genetic algorithm in matlab software has been verified in a sandbox experiment considering natural attenuation and then applied to a small scale actual site we hope that it can solve the problems of method validity verification and actual site application in the previous research and provide a strong basis for the future application of ade ga to the actual site the paper is organized as follows first the governing equation of solute transport in groundwater the basic principle of the genetic algorithm and the calculation steps in the identification process of groundwater pollution sources will be reviewed then the migration and transformation of the petroleum contaminants in the sandbox experiment is described the purposes were i to obtain the relevant parameters in the process of ade ga identification and ii to analyze the migration and transformation rules of petroleum pollutants entering the groundwater the above experimental purposes can verify the accuracy of the ade ga during the identification of groundwater pollution sources subsequently the validated method is applied to field site with unclear information and relatively small scope based on the analysis of the collected data the reliability of the groundwater pollution source identification results produced by the method is verified finally some conclusions are provided 2 methods and materials 2 1 groundwater flow and transport equation the solute transport process in sandbox groundwater is simplified into a one dimensional solute transport model with plane instantaneous point source leakage it is assumed that there is a uniform flow field in the semi infinite aquifer the direction of flow along the groundwater is in the positive direction of x then according to the two dimensional aquifer flow equation pinder and bredehoeft 1968 singh and datta 2006 xia et al 2019 the equation of groundwater flow in this aquifer is 1 x k h x w 0 where k is the hydraulic coefficient of aquifer medium m d 1 h is hydraulic head m w is the amount of water flowing into or out of the aquifer per unit area in vertical direction per unit time positive for inflow and negative for outflow m d 1 from studies of man made releases of pollutants into groundwater pollutants can quickly be transported downstream in groundwater due to advection and dispersion under steady state flow ayvaz 2016 it is assumed that the emission quality of the pollutant is m before the pollutant is released the initial concentration of the pollutant is zero initial condition and the concentration of the pollutant at infinity is zero boundary condition assuming that the transport of pollutants in groundwater is mainly controlled by advection and dispersion then the solution formulas of the pollutant concentration at different locations are given bear 1979 2 c x t m s 2 n π d l t exp x u t 2 4 d l t where c x t is the concentration of contaminant at x for time t g l 1 d l is the longitudinal diffusion coefficient m2 d 1 u is the darcy velocity m d 1 n is the effective porosity s is cross sectional area m2 and m is the mass of the pollutant kg 2 2 basic principles of genetic algorithm the genetic algorithm ga is a global optimization algorithm giacobbo et al 2002 based on natural selection and genetic laws in the biological world goldberg 1989 it has been widely used in the research of groundwater management and multitarget groundwater pollution kalayci et al 2016 mitra et al 1998 the basic principle is to convert the relevant parameters of groundwater pollution source identification into the initial population in the ga then the ga imitates the process of biological evolution mainly by employing three operators selection operator mutation operator and crossover operator to generate a new generation this is to reduce the difference between the pollutant concentration of groundwater numerically simulated with the newly generated identification parameters and the concentration detected by the monitoring well downstream of the groundwater thereby eliminating the results with lower fitness function values finally through the number of predefined iterations or the range of set fitness functions bastani et al 2010 the calculation is terminated to minimize the difference between simulated and monitored pollutant concentrations so as to obtain the most suitable environment therefore the problem of minimizing the difference between the source identification results and the real situation is solved this is the optimal solution of the parameters of groundwater pollution source to be solved 2 3 steps for identifying groundwater pollution sources by genetic algorithm the genetic algorithm can be used to identify the problem of groundwater pollution source identification in the following four steps and the technical roadmap is shown in fig 1 a coding and generating initial populations the characteristic parameters of the groundwater pollution source including the location release intensity and time of the pollution source ayvaz 2010 are encoded by using a binary coding method the relevant parameters of the identified pollution source are used as decision variables and then converted into genotype structure string data in the genetic algorithm the genotype structure string form chromosome string so the initial chromosome population is generated according to the pollution source parameters the three parameters of the location release intensity and time of the pollution source determine the number of chromosome genes in the genetic algorithm and the accuracy of solving the three parameters determines the length of the chromosome on the basis of fully investigating and understanding the hydrogeological conditions and other relevant information of the site the range of the relevant parameters of the pollution source is initially given as the range of the initial population in the genetic algorithm in this way the algorithm can be quickly converged in the calculation process which is conducive to the later calculation b fitness function evaluation the selection of the fitness function is the key to the algorithm and it directly determines the convergence speed and the accuracy of the solution through the input of the relevant hydrogeological parameters the groundwater solute transport model is used to calculate the concentration of pollutants at different times and locations the fitness function is defined as the difference between the measured value and the simulated value of the concentration at each observation point jin et al 2009 within the study area therefore the fitness of the different individuals is evaluated the essence of the pollution source inversion identification problem is to find an appropriate set of m t 0 and x 0 parameters to minimize the difference between the simulated calculated value and the measured value therefore the fitness function is defined as 3 z min i 1 n c x 0 m t 0 c x t 2 in the above equation c x 0 m t 0 is the simulated value of the pollutant concentration at x 0 for time t 0 which can be calculated according to eq 3 c x t is the concentration measured at different times in the monitoring well location where x 0 is the distance between the observation point and the pollution source m is the quality of pollutant leakage t 0 is the time between the first detection time and the leakage of the pollution source x is the distance between the monitoring well location and the pollution source t is the detection time of monitoring well c population evolution in the calculation process the individuals with the best fitness values are first selected and directly entered into the calculation of the next generation population for individuals with poor adaptability crossovers operator are applied to generate individuals with relatively good adaptability before entering the next generation of calculation under the condition that neither of the previous two calculation processes can be satisfied the mutation operator is used to make individuals generate the next generation through mutation ayaz 2017 the process of pollution source identification is to use the initially defined source parameter variables as the initial population the source parameters are used to simulate and generate the simulated concentration of monitoring well position which is compared with the monitoring concentration to generate the fitness value when the fitness value is small the source parameters can be directly selected into the calculation of the next generation otherwise the calculation of crossover and mutation operators will be carried out to generate new individuals that can satisfy relatively good fitness function values and enter the next generation of calculation according to the set conditions all calculation processes are completed automatically d termination condition judgment the condition can be terminated by an algorithm such as setting the maximum number of iterations or setting the range of fitness functions bastani et al 2010 after the algorithm has evolved through multiple iterations the optimal individual is produced as the result 2 4 laboratory sandbox experiment according to the calculation steps of the genetic algorithm in the above section it can be seen that the solute transport governing equation in groundwater is necessary to identify groundwater pollution sources by using the genetic algorithm simultaneously obtaining the parameters of the solute transport equation is the key to the whole calculation process in addition the study of the solute migration and transformation law in groundwater can verify the accuracy of the genetic algorithm output results which is also an important part of the research on employing the genetic algorithm to identify pollution sources the laboratory sandbox experiment chen et al 2018 can solve the above problems which is the content described in this section 2 4 1 experimental reagents and instruments the investigation results of the study area show that 0 diesel oil is the main pollutant in the contaminated site in order to keep the sandbox experiment consistent with the pollutants in the field 0 diesel oil was selected as the specific pollutant in the experiment the other reagents required for the experiment include carbon tetrachloride specifically used for the infrared oil meter and anhydrous sodium sulfate the basic properties of the 0 diesel oil are as follows melting point is 29 56 c boiling point is 282 370 c and its relative density is 0 83 0 855 g cm3 1 the main instruments required for the experiment are the infrared oil detector ultrasonic cleaner peristaltic pump and magnetic stirrer 2 4 2 experimental device the experimental device is a sandbox with a size of 160 cm 30 cm 80 cm and the material is transparent plexiglass fig 2 the left and right sides of the sandbox are the groundwater inlet and outlet zones respectively their lengths are all 10 cm which was selected to allow for adjustments in the groundwater level differences a total of 4 5 20 sampling holes were established in front of the sandbox and constructed via a soil solution sampler terracotta head a total of four rows a b c d are set in the longitudinal direction of the water intake hole and there are five water intake holes in each row arranged horizontally the main sampling holes of this experiment are b1 b5 there are also three layers of thirty mesh stainless steel mesh on both sides of the migration area the steel mesh has thirty meshes within a length of 25 4 mm of which the mesh wire diameter is 0 33 mm and the mesh diameter is 0 52 mm in the gb t 5330 2003 2003 of china this ensures that the soil medium does not leak and has a hydraulic connection so that the hydraulic gradient can remain stable 2 4 3 experimental steps the experimental steps include preparing the pollutants loading the experimental media establishing the water level releasing the pollutants sampling and testing the experimental process is shown in fig 3 first groundwater was added into the 50 l vat and then an excessive volume of the 0 diesel oil was added to it until it was saturated stirring the groundwater solution continued for 12 h at a speed of 500 r min 1 to homogenize and dissolve the solution and to obtain the contaminated liquid second the vadose zone medium was slowly filled into the plexiglass sandbox and the filling height was fifty five centimeters to ensure the uniformity of the medium in the sandbox during the filling process the medium should be continuously compacted to avoid the occurrence of voids and cracks that can cause a dominant flow channel after loading the two peristaltic pumps are used to allow water to inflow from the left side and outflow from the right side of the sandbox respectively the filled medium is filled with water several times through this process to ensure sufficient exhaust in the medium subsequently by repeatedly adjusting the inflow and outflow flow rates of the peristaltic pumps on the left and right sides to ensure that the upstream and downstream areas can evenly enter and exit the water and make the inlet water level on the left side greater than the right side which can control the groundwater level on both sides of the sandbox finally a stable hydraulic gradient is formed after the groundwater flow rate in the plexiglas sandbox is stabilized the groundwater still keeps flowing in and out from the inlet and outlet respectively then the previously prepared pollutant liquid can be injected into the sandbox citarella et al 2015 finally the total petroleum hydrocarbon tph content was measured by an infrared oil meter 2 5 study area the study area is located in the miyun district of beijing china where the yanshan mountains meet the north china plain and where the interaction of the piedmont alluvial fans in the upper reaches of the chaobai river occurs there is a gas station in the study area that was abandoned in the 1970 s however due to the unreasonable structure of this old gas station and the oxidation effect over the years the underground storage tank including 6 diesel tanks and 4 gasoline tanks has been corroded as a result leakage occurs that contaminates the surrounding soil and groundwater the contaminated site is in the shape of an inverted trapezoid fig 4 with an area of approximately 8700 m2 the terrain is flat with an average elevation of 56 57 m and slopes from north to south the groundwater flow is approximately the same as the topographical change flowing from north to south the oil hydrocarbon content of the soil in the study area was within the range of 3 17 16 47 mg kg 1 which showed an overall trend of first increasing and then decreasing the oil hydrocarbon concentration reached a maximum at 10 m below the surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 sandbox experimental results and discussion monitoring wells were used to measure the total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations ph values and concentrations of conventional ions such as no3 and so4 2 in the groundwater thus the migration and transformation rules of petroleum pollutants in the groundwater were analyzed and the change in the petroleum pollutants in the groundwater were studied more intuitively this process can be used to verify the accuracy of the identification results of groundwater pollution sources using a genetic algorithm under experimental conditions and to provide a reliable basis for the application of this method at engineering sites 3 1 1 variation in petroleum hydrocarbon concentration at different locations the test results of the total petroleum hydrocarbons in the water samples at the four sampling holes b2 b5 0 15 0 45 0 75 1 05 m respectively from the pollution sources were selected and the concentration curves were plotted for the different positions fig 5 once the pollutants enter the aquifer they will continue to spread under advection and dispersion chen et al 2018 resulting in higher concentrations of pollutants then the pollutants migrate downstream in a concentration gradient as seen from fig 5 the initial concentration of pollutants at b2 is the largest which is the hole closest to the source of pollution the maximum initial concentration of pollutants at this point is approximately 11 0 mg l 1 indicating that there is some stagnation and accumulation occurring near the source of pollution after the pollutants enter the aquifer with the passage of time the concentration of pollutants shows a gradual decline which is mainly caused by the instantaneous leakage of pollution sources and the downstream migration of pollutants under the action of groundwater however in places far from the pollution sources such as 1 05 m away the concentration of pollutants first increases and then decreases this trend is observed because the pollutants have not yet reached this point during the initial stage affected by convection and diffusion qian et al 2018 the concentration of pollutants is only 1 4 mg l 1 at this location when the experiment is conducted for 0 2 days however at this time the pollutant concentrations of 0 15 m 0 45 m and 0 75 m away from the pollution source location are 11 0 10 0 and 4 0 mg l 1 respectively it takes one day for the location to reach the peak concentration of 5 0 mg l 1 subsequently as with other locations the concentration gradually decreases due to the effects of natural degradation atlas 1991 from the inlet section to the outlet section the b2 b3 b4 and b5 monitoring holes sequentially showed the maximum concentration of pollutants reaching 11 0 10 0 6 5 and 5 0 mg l 1 respectively these concentrations are 91 83 54 and 42 of the initial concentrations respectively due to the natural attenuation of petroleum pollutants in aquifers such as degradation atlas 1991 the peak concentration of pollutants in the sandbox gradually decreases with the extension of the pollutant migration distance in addition it can be seen from fig 5 that the concentration value at each point after ten days is approximately 2 0 mg l 1 3 1 2 variation in ph value the diagram showing the variation in ph value with time was drawn fig 6 by testing and analyzing the ph value of the water samples at three locations b5 c5 d5 near the outlet as seen from fig 6 there is a certain fluctuation in ph value at each location however the overall trend in ph value is to first decrease and then increase the reason for this phenomenon is mainly related to the activities of microorganisms atlas 1991 on the one hand microorganisms in this process consume oxygen from the water for respiration and produce a certain amount of co2 which is slightly dissolved in water and turns into h2co3 bellagamba et al 2016 on the other hand microorganisms use a variety of organic compounds in petroleum contaminants as carbon sources for their own growth to perform a series of complex redox reactions lari et al 2019 during this process petroleum hydrocarbons are first oxidized to alcohols subsequently alcohols continue to be oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde under the action of alcohol dehydrogenase finally aldehydes continue to be oxidized to fatty acids in the presence of aldehyde dehydrogenase borden et al 1995 gieg and suflita 2002 these processes can be expressed as follows r ch2 ch3 o2 r ch2 ch2 oh r ch2 cho r r ch2 cooh the formation of acid in groundwater is an important reason for the decrease in the ph value of the solution van stempvoort et al 2007 once the contaminants are degraded to a certain degree the degradation of microorganisms will be abated the medium used in the experiment is mainly aquifer medium obtained from the study area such as gravel coarse and medium sand affected by the interaction of water and aquifer medium the environment of groundwater will change resulting in the increase of ph value however hco3 has little change in this process qian et al 2018 in addition the magnitude of change at b5 and c5 is significantly stronger than that at d5 the main reason for this phenomenon is that the location of pollutant leakage occurs between the lines of the b and c holes and microorganisms play a more pronounced role in the flow direction of groundwater the density of petroleum contaminants is smaller than that of water and its concentration in the lower layer is low resulting in weaker microbial effects therefore the change in ph value at point d5 is relatively small in general regardless of the ph value the changes in ph value are very small because of the low concentration of petroleum pollutants in groundwater and relatively weak microbial action 3 1 3 variation regular ions 3 1 3 1 changes in no3 content fig 7 shows that the no3 content at the monitoring location first decreases and then increases among the locations the b1 b2 and b3 locations increase considerably in no3 content during the later stage while that of b4 increases relatively little except for the b1 monitoring location the initial concentration of no3 at the remaining locations was 35 0 mg l 1 as the reaction progressed the no3 concentration at each location began to decrease reaching a minimum value at approximately 20 h and presenting a reduction of approximately 50 the concentration at each monitoring location then increases rapidly in particular the no3 content at the b1 and b2 locations were as high as 32 0 mg l 1 at 100 h however since b3 and b4 are relatively far away from the pollution source the increase of no3 concentration is small moreover no2 was detected in some samples which may be caused by the denitrification of microorganisms kuhn et al 1988 hutchins et al 1991 the reason for the decrease in no3 content is that microorganisms require certain carbon sources energy and electron acceptors during the whole reaction process kuhn et al 1988 hutchins et al 1991 the carbon source is organic matter in petroleum pollutants while the electron acceptor may be dissolved oxygen do nitrate no3 ferric iron fe3 and sulfate so4 2 in water qian et al 2018 the order in which the above electron acceptors are utilized is do no3 fe3 so4 2 borden et al 1995 choi and lee 2011 guo et al 2020 that is microorganisms prioritize the use of do as an electron acceptor and only use no3 when the do is insufficient anderson and lovley 1997 the biological reaction of no3 as an electron acceptor is as follows ch2o 2no3 h2o co2 2no2 3 1 3 2 changes in so4 2 content from fig 8 compared to no3 the change in so4 2 concentration over time is relatively small during the whole reaction process the content fluctuation range of so4 2 at the b1 b4 monitoring locations was very small remaining between 35 0 and 42 0 mg l 1 and the change was only approximately 10 the reason for this result can be attributed to the order in which so4 2 is used as an electron acceptor guo et al 2020 as mentioned above the use of so4 2 lags behind that of no3 when no3 ions are still present in the groundwater environment so4 2 does not participate in the reaction anderson and lovley 1997 guo et al 2020 so its concentration varies within a small range in summary microbial degradation occurs during groundwater flow batlle aguilar et al 2009 kao et al 2010 it has been reported that a considerable number of microorganisms including bacteria and fungi anderson and lovley 1997 are capable of degrading petroleum hydrocarbons in the aeration zone medium and the groundwater environment kwon et al 2018 microorganisms use petroleum pollutants as a carbon source to carry out their own growth and metabolism anderson and lovley 1997 the essence of this process is that microorganisms participate in the corresponding redox reaction to convert toxic and harmful substances into n2 h2o and other nontoxic substances guo et al 2020 after oxygen is consumed rapidly microorganisms mainly undergo anaerobic degradation chiu et al 2017 according to the thermodynamic principle the ability of an electron acceptor to compete for electrons is inversely proportional to its free energy that is the smaller the free energy is the easier the electron acceptor is to react so dissolved oxygen is utilized in preference to nitrates and sulfates maric et al 2019 however in the actual groundwater environment especially in mountainous areas with large burial depths dissolved oxygen is easily consumed but difficult to replenish anderson and lovley 1997 therefore the groundwater system is mostly in a hypoxic environment and nitrate is first involved in redox reactions as an electron acceptor kuhn et al 1988 hutchins et al 1991 borden et al 1995 when groundwater is polluted a transformation process from an oxidizing environment to a reducing environment will take place wilson et al 1986 anderson and lovley 1997 through the above analysis it can be seen that after petroleum hydrocarbon enters groundwater it has the effects of convection diffusion and biodegradation chiu et al 2013 under these effects the migration range of pollutants in groundwater and the concentration in downstream monitoring wells will change accordingly these changes will affect the selection of monitoring well locations and the determination of specific contaminants respectively these two factors are the key links for identifying the location and release intensity of groundwater pollution sources using ga in addition the study on the migration and transformation of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants in sandbox experiment can help to determine the relevant parameters required by the method 3 1 4 parameter acquisition according to the migration rules of petroleum pollutants in the sandbox groundwater and relevant literature review the following parameters can be obtained porosity with reference to empirical values in the literature qin et al 2013 cao et al 2017 the porosity of the sand is between 0 25 and 0 5 combined with the loading medium in the experiment the porosity n is equal to 0 3 hydraulic conductivity and groundwater velocity during the experiment when the groundwater level on both sides was stable the groundwater flow was found to be 18 18 ml min 1 the hydraulic gradient of groundwater is 2 19 according to q kia bear 1979 it is known that the hydraulic conductivity k is equal to 9 78 m d 1 the above results are combined with the groundwater flow continuity equation 1 so the groundwater velocity u is equal to 0 2139 m d 1 longitudinal diffusion coefficient diffusion is an important measure of the dispersion characteristics of porous media and it is usually obtained by field experiments however the cost of field experiments is relatively high and diffusion data is difficult to obtain thus diffusion data is generally obtained by the corresponding empirical formula gelhar et al 1992 neuman and zhang 1990 xu and eckstein 1995 in this experiment the value of a l is 2 34 m which is based on the diffusion coefficient dl a l u 0 5 m2 d 1 chen et al 2018 3 1 5 ade ga identifies the source of pollution under experimental conditions the genetic algorithm toolbox based on matlab software mathworks 2010 and the parameters used in the genetic algorithm calculation process under experimental conditions were used to invert the pollution source parameters at the x 1 05 m section the relevant parameters of the genetic algorithm are set as follows table 2 the number of chromosomes that is the population size is 100 the termination evolutionary number is 120 generations and the crossover and mutation probabilities use the system default values of 0 8 and 0 05 respectively bastani et al 2010 the result is shown in fig 9 fig 9a shows the changes in fitness function values under different biological generations the ordinate is on a logarithmic scale during each generation the black dots represent the best fitness function values and the blue dots represent the average fitness values fig 9b shows the pollution source related parameter outputs by the system after multiple optimization iterations fig 9a shows that the optimal fitness function value and average value of the x 1 05 m section are 0 20 and 0 32 respectively the results of the pollution source parameters obtained by the genetic algorithm are shown in table 3 in conclusion the results of the genetic algorithm are very close to the true value of the released pollution source in the experiment it has the characteristics of high accuracy and fast convergence in addition the accuracy of the genetic algorithm is confirmed by analyzing the migration law of the petroleum pollutants in the sandbox therefore a genetic algorithm can be applied to the inverse problem of groundwater pollution sources 3 2 site application results and discussion 3 2 1 site parameter determination according to the parameters used in the calculation of the genetic algorithm the site parameters are determined as follows the medium of the aquifer in the site is large gravel with some coarse sand thus its hydraulic conductivity is 45 m d 1 and the porosity n is 0 25 based on field tests the average hydraulic gradient of the site is 1 and the darcy velocity u is equal to bear 1979 0 045 m d 1 the dispersion a l value of the site is 5 3 m and its dispersion coefficient d l is 0 2385 m2 d 1 the average thickness of the aquifer is 3 m and the width is approximately 40 m thus its cross sectional area s is equal to 120 m2 3 2 2 site specific pollutant toluene is the main component in diesel kao et al 2010 lin et al 2012 chiu et al 2013 the toluene content in the study area is still very high so selecting the toluene in aquifer as the site specific pollutant from july 2017 to september 2018 the 3 well in the study area was continuously monitored every two months the test results are shown in fig 10 3 2 3 identification of pollution sources the research site was analyzed according to the ade ga and verified under the experimental conditions the main parameters of the genetic algorithm are set as follows table 2 the maximum number is 100 generations and the population size is 80 the system default values are 0 05 and 0 8 for mutation and crossover probability respectively bastani et al 2010 the results of the genetic algorithm are shown in fig 11 the research shows that the algorithm converges at the 81st generation and then the program ends the optimal fitness function value was 0 1056 according to the results of the genetic algorithm the pollution source parameters are shown in table 4 3 2 4 verification and discussion the identification results of pollution sources can be validated and analyzed by using the data collected during the earlier period and from on site investigations the calculation result of the source location x 0 is 37 2 m that is the source location is 37 2 m upstream of the no 3 observation well by using the groundwater flow as the x direction it can be found that 37 2 m upstream is located in the gasoline irrigation area fig 12 which is consistent with the actual position of the site second the calculated result of the pollutant leakage time t 0 is 4269 d that is the interval between pollutant leakage time and the first sampling test july 2017 is 4269 d which is approximately 12 years the initial estimate is that the leakage approximately occurred in 2005 according to preliminary data the gas station was abandoned in the 1970 s the old fashioned underground storage tanks in china mainly used steel storage tanks with a steel plate thickness of 6 mm due to its long term contact with air and moisture the corrosion caused the thickness of the steel sheet to become thinner eventually oil contaminants leaked under the influence of corrosion the damage to the storage tank takes 15 years more than 70 of underground storage tanks leak if they are older than 15 years therefore the site of the study area experienced corrosion damage from 1970 to 1985 the tanks continued to leak for 20 years between 1985 and 2005 after the pollutants in the oil storage tank stopped leaking in 2005 the pollutants were transported downstream under the action of groundwater the entire pollution history process is shown in fig 13 finally the quantity of the identified pollutants is analyzed the calculated result of m was 9 2 kg that is a total of 9 2 kg of toluene entered the aquifer then the leakage strength of toluene can be calculated to be 1 33 g d 1 therefore when the steel plate of the storage tank is not completely corroded the pollutant leakage intensity was zero after the pollutants in the oil storage tank stopped leaking in 2005 the pollution source intensity was also zero in the above process the whole historical process of pollution is deduced and verified based on the data collected from field exploration and the early stage the results of the genetic algorithm are in line with the real results in the field this work shows that the genetic algorithm can be applied to the solution of pollution sources at the field scale 4 conclusions in this paper a genetic algorithm combined with the advection dispersion equation are applied to the identification of groundwater pollution sources at the experimental scale and site scale the monitoring results of the physical experiment obtained by using the sandbox suggest that the identification result is reliable analysis of the field data shows that the ade ga is also reliable for identifying groundwater pollution sources at the site scale among the results the sandbox test also obtains the regularity of pollutant migration in groundwater and microbial degradation is accompanied by the migration of pollutants in groundwater which plays an important role in the rational interpretation of the pollutant source identification at both the experimental scale and site scale the application of this method to the identification of groundwater pollution sources can not only solve the problem of minimizing the difference between the identification results and the true value but also provide a reliable reference for the control and efficient

5277,the accurate identification of groundwater pollution sources is the key to site remediation and management which directly relates to the cost and effect of remediation during later periods studying the identification of some small area site pollution sources by using a small amount of groundwater monitoring data is difficult and is currently a hot topic in the field of groundwater management in this study a method combining the advection dispersion equation ade of contaminants in groundwater with genetic algorithm ga was proposed to identify groundwater pollution sources that is the location of the pollution source the time of pollution release and the intensity of pollution release a sandbox experiment for the migration and transformation of deterministic petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater is designed to verify the method the results show that the method code program has basically the same identification parameters as the deterministic experimental pollution source parameters the ade ga method was applied to an actual site polluted by a gas station in beijing china the parameters of the pollution source obtained from the detailed site investigation are basically consistent with the calculated values therefore the source code established in this work is a reliable tool for identifying the parameters of groundwater pollution sources in small areas keywords advection dispersion equation ade genetic algorithm ga source identification sandbox experiment site application investigation data 1 introduction pollution source identification is the key to controlling and remediating groundwater pollution xu and gómez hernández 2016 therefore it is very important to identify the source of pollution for previously polluted groundwater i e identify the location time and amount of the pollution source release ayvaz 2010 through the inverse problem solving method based on data of the position and concentration of the pollutants when monitored downstream of the groundwater sun et al 2006 yeh et al 2007 xia et al 2019 the inversion methods of pollutant transport bagtzoglou and atmadja 2005 to solve the inverse problem of pollution source identification mainly include the direct method stochastic method and optimization method sun et al 2006 atmadja and bagtzoglou 2001 the geochemical footprint method is commonly used in the direct method the principle of the geochemical footprint method is to obtain the source parameters by using isotope and geochemical fingerprint methods kohl et al 1971 liu et al 2006 bronders et al 2012 aeppli et al 2013 chen et al 2017 miglietta et al 2017 shakya et al 2019 however the application of the geochemical footprint method to the analysis of soil and groundwater pollution sources is immature in addition when there are multiple pollution sources uncertainty assessments are lacking and the quantization accuracy is limited stout et al 1998 in the stochastic statistical method the parameters for groundwater pollution sources are considered as random variables this method uses a certain mathematical method to find the probability of each parameter within a certain range and finally generates the parameter as the result snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 butera and tanda 2003 michalak and kitanidis 2004 boano et al 2005 sun 2007 butera et al 2013 venkatramanan et al 2016 long et al 2018 unfortunately the stochastic statistical method considers less relevant parameters such as the actual site hydrogeological conditions in addition the stochastic statistical method only involves a large amount of data processing so it cannot truly represent the actual situation moreover there are more unknowns and higher spatial dimensions during the calculation process which results in a larger calculation load the basic principle of the optimization method is to establish the corresponding solute model the simulation results were compared with the observed values and the process was continuously optimized to obtain the pollution source parameters singh and datta 2006 optimization methods include classical methods containing gradient calculations and non classical methods containing non gradient calculations gandhi et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 identified the mass loading rate of unknown pollution sources by using the classical optimization method of linear programming in matlab software gandhi et al 2016 used a non classical optimization method of direct search in matlab software to identify the characteristics of virus sources in groundwater in recent years as a heuristic search algorithm with global convergence yeh et al 2007 and another non classical optimization method gandhi et al 2016 genetic algorithm has attracted increasing attention singh et al 2008 jin et al 2009 ayvaz 2016 genetic algorithms are widely used in the research of optimization problems because of their advantages such as easy convergence and high accuracy ayaz 2017 moreover non gradient search is the characteristic of genetic algorithm which can find the global optimal solution well thus the disadvantages of gradient based search method can be overcome ayaz 2017 the research shows that this method can still achieve accurate identification with multiple unknown sources of pollution singh and datta 2006 mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 used the real encoded genetic algorithm rga and the binary encoded genetic algorithm bga in matlab software to combine with several different local search methods so as to realize the identification of the location and release intensity of the assumed two dimensional pollution site the genetic algorithm is combined with a groundwater simulation model to form a new method that identifies the groundwater pollution sources the results show that the initial estimate of the source parameters will not affect the final identification result aral et al 2001 ayaz 2017 combined the pollutant transport model with the optimization simulation model based on genetic algorithm in matlab software to identify the groundwater pollution source of the hypothetical site when the population size of the genetic algorithm was relatively small and obtained very good results sophia and bhattacharjya 2020 combined modflow and mt3dms models with genetic algorithm to identify pollution sources in a hypothetical study area with homogeneous and isotropic aquifers xia et al 2019 used the hyper parameters obtained based on the taguchi experimental design tuning method to optimize the genetic algorithm so as to perform more effective pollution source identification on the hypothetical site of irregular geometry and non uniform media all the works mentioned above were tested in hypothetical cases table 1 currently only a small amount of literature on the application of other source identification methods in the laboratory can be found cupola et al 2015 designed a sandbox experiment to verify the performance of the simultaneous release function and source location identification srsi and backward probability model based on adjoint state method bpm asm in the identification of pollution source location and release time chen et al 2018 verified the ability of restart ensemble kalman filter r enkf to identify pollution source and geometry of aquifer by designing a sandbox experiment zanini and woodbury 2016 used the empirical bayes method combined with akaike s bayes information standard abic to deduce the release history of groundwater pollutants using the data obtained through the sandbox experiment the filling medium and tracer used in the above sandbox experiments are glass beads and sodium fluorescein respectively and the influence of the natural attenuation of pollutants on the concentration is not considered the purpose of this paper is to establish a genetic algorithm calculation program which is based on the solute transport governing equation in groundwater ade ga and to improve the genetic algorithm population size in matlab software simultaneously a sandbox experiment considering the natural attenuation of pollutants is designed to verify the proposed improved method so as to use it to identify groundwater pollution sources of actual contaminated site this is the first time that the improved population size genetic algorithm in matlab software has been verified in a sandbox experiment considering natural attenuation and then applied to a small scale actual site we hope that it can solve the problems of method validity verification and actual site application in the previous research and provide a strong basis for the future application of ade ga to the actual site the paper is organized as follows first the governing equation of solute transport in groundwater the basic principle of the genetic algorithm and the calculation steps in the identification process of groundwater pollution sources will be reviewed then the migration and transformation of the petroleum contaminants in the sandbox experiment is described the purposes were i to obtain the relevant parameters in the process of ade ga identification and ii to analyze the migration and transformation rules of petroleum pollutants entering the groundwater the above experimental purposes can verify the accuracy of the ade ga during the identification of groundwater pollution sources subsequently the validated method is applied to field site with unclear information and relatively small scope based on the analysis of the collected data the reliability of the groundwater pollution source identification results produced by the method is verified finally some conclusions are provided 2 methods and materials 2 1 groundwater flow and transport equation the solute transport process in sandbox groundwater is simplified into a one dimensional solute transport model with plane instantaneous point source leakage it is assumed that there is a uniform flow field in the semi infinite aquifer the direction of flow along the groundwater is in the positive direction of x then according to the two dimensional aquifer flow equation pinder and bredehoeft 1968 singh and datta 2006 xia et al 2019 the equation of groundwater flow in this aquifer is 1 x k h x w 0 where k is the hydraulic coefficient of aquifer medium m d 1 h is hydraulic head m w is the amount of water flowing into or out of the aquifer per unit area in vertical direction per unit time positive for inflow and negative for outflow m d 1 from studies of man made releases of pollutants into groundwater pollutants can quickly be transported downstream in groundwater due to advection and dispersion under steady state flow ayvaz 2016 it is assumed that the emission quality of the pollutant is m before the pollutant is released the initial concentration of the pollutant is zero initial condition and the concentration of the pollutant at infinity is zero boundary condition assuming that the transport of pollutants in groundwater is mainly controlled by advection and dispersion then the solution formulas of the pollutant concentration at different locations are given bear 1979 2 c x t m s 2 n π d l t exp x u t 2

sectional area m2 and m is the mass of the pollutant kg 2 2 basic principles of genetic algorithm the genetic algorithm ga is a global optimization algorithm giacobbo et al 2002 based on natural selection and genetic laws in the biological world goldberg 1989 it has been widely used in the research of groundwater management and multitarget groundwater pollution kalayci et al 2016 mitra et al 1998 the basic principle is to convert the relevant parameters of groundwater pollution source identification into the initial population in the ga then the ga imitates the process of biological evolution mainly by employing three operators selection operator mutation operator and crossover operator to generate a new generation this is to reduce the difference between the pollutant concentration of groundwater numerically simulated with the newly generated identification parameters and the concentration detected by the monitoring well downstream of the groundwater thereby eliminating the results with lower fitness function values finally through the number of predefined iterations or the range of set fitness functions bastani et al 2010 the calculation is terminated to minimize the difference between simulated and monitored pollutant concentrations so as to obtain the most suitable environment therefore the problem of minimizing the difference between the source identification results and the real situation is solved this is the optimal solution of the parameters of groundwater pollution source to be solved 2 3 steps for identifying groundwater pollution sources by genetic algorithm the genetic algorithm can be used to identify the problem of groundwater pollution source identification in the following four steps and the technical roadmap is shown in fig 1 a coding and generating initial populations the characteristic parameters of the groundwater pollution source including the location release intensity and time of the pollution source ayvaz 2010 are encoded by using a binary coding method the relevant parameters of the identified pollution source are used as decision variables and then converted into genotype structure string data in the genetic algorithm the genotype structure string form chromosome string so the initial chromosome population is generated according to the pollution source parameters the three parameters of the location release intensity and time of the pollution source determine the number of chromosome genes in the genetic algorithm and the accuracy of solving the three parameters determines the length of the chromosome on the basis of fully investigating and understanding the hydrogeological conditions and other relevant information of the site the range of the relevant parameters of the pollution source is initially given as the range of the initial population in the genetic algorithm in this way the algorithm can be quickly converged in the calculation process which is conducive to the later calculation b fitness function evaluation the selection of the fitness function is the key to the algorithm and it directly determines the convergence speed and the accuracy of the solution through the input of the relevant hydrogeological parameters the groundwater solute transport model is used to calculate the concentration of pollutants at different times and locations the fitness function is defined as the difference between the measured value and the simulated value of the concentration at each observation point jin et al 2009 within the study area therefore the fitness of the different individuals is evaluated the essence of the pollution source inversion identification problem is to find an appropriate set of m t 0 and x 0 parameters to minimize the difference between the simulated calculated value and the measured value therefore the fitness function is defined as 3 z min i 1 n c x 0 m t 0 c x t 2 in the above equation c x 0 m t 0 is the simulated value of the pollutant concentration at x 0 for time t 0 which can be calculated according to eq 3 c x t is the concentration measured at different times in the monitoring well location where x 0 is the distance between the observation point and the pollution source m is the quality of pollutant leakage t 0 is the time between the first detection time and the leakage of the pollution source x is the distance between the monitoring well location and the pollution source t is the detection time of monitoring well c population evolution in the calculation process the individuals with the best fitness values are first selected and directly entered into the calculation of the next generation population for individuals with poor adaptability crossovers operator are applied to generate individuals with relatively good adaptability before entering the next generation of calculation under the condition that neither of the previous two calculation processes can be satisfied the mutation operator is used to make individuals generate the next generation through mutation ayaz 2017 the process of pollution source identification is to use the initially defined source parameter variables as the initial population the source parameters are used to simulate and generate the simulated concentration of monitoring well position which is compared with the monitoring concentration to generate the fitness value when the fitness value is small the source parameters can be directly selected into the calculation of the next generation otherwise the calculation of crossover and mutation operators will be carried out to generate new individuals that can satisfy relatively good fitness function values and enter the next generation of calculation according to the set conditions all calculation processes are completed automatically d termination condition judgment the condition can be terminated by an algorithm such as setting the maximum number of iterations or setting the range of fitness functions bastani et al 2010 after the algorithm has evolved through multiple iterations the optimal individual is produced as the result 2 4 laboratory sandbox experiment according to the calculation steps of the genetic algorithm in the above section it can be seen that the solute transport governing equation in groundwater is necessary to identify groundwater pollution sources by using the genetic algorithm simultaneously obtaining the parameters of the solute transport equation is the key to the whole calculation process in addition the study of the solute migration and transformation law in groundwater can verify the accuracy of the genetic algorithm output results which is also an important part of the research on employing the genetic algorithm to identify pollution sources the laboratory sandbox experiment chen et al 2018 can solve the above problems which is the content described in this section 2 4 1 experimental reagents and instruments the investigation results of the study area show that 0 diesel oil is the main pollutant in the contaminated site in order to keep the sandbox experiment consistent with the pollutants in the field 0 diesel oil was selected as the specific pollutant in the experiment the other reagents required for the experiment include carbon tetrachloride specifically used for the infrared oil meter and anhydrous sodium sulfate the basic properties of the 0 diesel oil are as follows melting point is 29 56 c boiling point is 282 370 c and its relative density is 0 83 0 855 g cm3 1 the main instruments required for the experiment are the infrared oil detector ultrasonic cleaner peristaltic pump and magnetic stirrer 2 4 2 experimental device the experimental device is a sandbox with a size of 160 cm 30 cm 80 cm and the material is transparent plexiglass fig 2 the left and right sides of the sandbox are the groundwater inlet and outlet zones respectively their lengths are all 10 cm which was selected to allow for adjustments in the groundwater level differences a total of 4 5 20 sampling holes were established in front of the sandbox and constructed via a soil solution sampler terracotta head a total of four rows a b c d are set in the longitudinal direction of the water intake hole and there are five water intake holes in each row arranged horizontally the main sampling holes of this experiment are b1 b5 there are also three layers of thirty mesh stainless steel mesh on both sides of the migration area the steel mesh has thirty meshes within a length of 25 4 mm of which the mesh wire diameter is 0 33 mm and the mesh diameter is 0 52 mm in the gb t 5330 2003 2003 of china this ensures that the soil medium does not leak and has a hydraulic connection so that the hydraulic gradient can remain stable 2 4 3 experimental steps the experimental steps include preparing the pollutants loading the experimental media establishing the water level releasing the pollutants sampling and testing the experimental process is shown in fig 3 first groundwater was added into the 50 l vat and then an excessive volume of the 0 diesel oil was added to it until it was saturated stirring the groundwater solution continued for 12 h at a speed of 500 r min 1 to homogenize and dissolve the solution and to obtain the contaminated liquid second the vadose zone medium was slowly filled into the plexiglass sandbox and the filling height was fifty five centimeters to ensure the uniformity of the medium in the sandbox during the filling process the medium should be continuously compacted to avoid the occurrence of voids and cracks that can cause a dominant flow channel after loading the two peristaltic pumps are used to allow water to inflow from the left side and outflow from the right side of the sandbox respectively the filled medium is filled with water several times through this process to ensure sufficient exhaust in the medium subsequently by repeatedly adjusting the inflow and outflow flow rates of the peristaltic pumps on the left and right sides to ensure that the upstream and downstream areas can evenly enter and exit the water and make the inlet water level on the left side greater than the right side which can control the groundwater level on both sides of the sandbox finally a stable hydraulic gradient is formed after the groundwater flow rate in the plexiglas sandbox is stabilized the groundwater still keeps flowing in and out from the inlet and outlet respectively then the previously prepared pollutant liquid can be injected into the sandbox citarella et al 2015 finally the total petroleum hydrocarbon tph content was measured by an infrared oil meter 2 5 study area the study area is located in the miyun district of beijing china where the yanshan mountains meet the north china plain and where the interaction of the piedmont alluvial fans in the upper reaches of the chaobai river occurs there is a gas station in the study area that was abandoned in the 1970 s however due to the unreasonable structure of this old gas station and the oxidation effect over the years the underground storage tank including 6 diesel tanks and 4 gasoline tanks has been corroded as a result leakage occurs that contaminates the surrounding soil and groundwater the contaminated site is in the shape of an inverted trapezoid fig 4 with an area of approximately 8700 m2 the terrain is flat with an average elevation of 56 57 m and slopes from north to south the groundwater flow is approximately the same as the topographical change flowing from north to south the oil hydrocarbon content of the soil in the study area was within the range of 3 17 16 47 mg kg 1 which showed an overall trend of first increasing and then decreasing the oil hydrocarbon concentration reached a maximum at 10 m below the surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 sandbox experimental results and discussion monitoring wells were used to measure the total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations ph values and concentrations of conventional ions such as no3 and so4 2 in the groundwater thus the migration and transformation rules of petroleum pollutants in the groundwater were analyzed and the change in the petroleum pollutants in the groundwater were studied more intuitively this process can be used to verify the accuracy of the identification results of groundwater pollution sources using a genetic algorithm under experimental conditions and to provide a reliable basis for the application of this method at engineering sites 3 1 1 variation in petroleum hydrocarbon concentration at different locations the test results of the total petroleum hydrocarbons in the water samples at the four sampling holes b2 b5 0 15 0 45 0 75 1 05 m respectively from the pollution sources were selected and the concentration curves were plotted for the different positions fig 5 once the pollutants enter the aquifer they will continue to spread under advection and dispersion chen et al 2018 resulting in higher concentrations of pollutants then the pollutants migrate downstream in a concentration gradient as seen from fig 5 the initial concentration of pollutants at b2 is the largest which is the hole closest to the source of pollution the maximum initial concentration of pollutants at this point is approximately 11 0 mg l 1 indicating that there is some stagnation and accumulation occurring near the source of pollution after the pollutants enter the aquifer with the passage of time the concentration of pollutants shows a gradual decline which is mainly caused by the instantaneous leakage of pollution sources and the downstream migration of pollutants under the action of groundwater however in places far from the pollution sources such as 1 05 m away the concentration of pollutants first increases and then decreases this trend is observed because the pollutants have not yet reached this point during the initial stage affected by convection and diffusion qian et al 2018 the concentration of pollutants is only 1 4 mg l 1 at this location when the experiment is conducted for 0 2 days however at this time the pollutant concentrations of 0 15 m 0 45 m and 0 75 m away from the pollution source location are 11 0 10 0 and 4 0 mg l 1 respectively it takes one day for the location to reach the peak concentration of 5 0 mg l 1 subsequently as with other locations the concentration gradually decreases due to the effects of natural degradation atlas 1991 from the inlet section to the outlet section the b2 b3 b4 and b5 monitoring holes sequentially showed the maximum concentration of pollutants reaching 11 0 10 0 6 5 and 5 0 mg l 1 respectively these concentrations are 91 83 54 and 42 of the initial concentrations respectively due to the natural attenuation of petroleum pollutants in aquifers such as degradation atlas 1991 the peak concentration of pollutants in the sandbox gradually decreases with the extension of the pollutant migration distance in addition it can be seen from fig 5 that the concentration value at each point after ten days is approximately 2 0 mg l 1 3 1 2 variation in ph value the diagram showing the variation in ph value with time was drawn fig 6 by testing and analyzing the ph value of the water samples at three locations b5 c5 d5 near the outlet as seen from fig 6 there is a certain fluctuation in ph value at each location however the overall trend in ph value is to first decrease and then increase the reason for this phenomenon is mainly related to the activities of microorganisms atlas 1991 on the one hand microorganisms in this process consume oxygen from the water for respiration and produce a certain amount of co2 which is slightly dissolved in water and turns into h2co3 bellagamba et al 2016 on the other hand microorganisms use a variety of organic compounds in petroleum contaminants as carbon sources for their own growth to perform a series of complex redox reactions lari et al 2019 during this process petroleum hydrocarbons are first oxidized to alcohols subsequently alcohols continue to be oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde under the action of alcohol dehydrogenase finally aldehydes continue to be oxidized to fatty acids in the presence of aldehyde dehydrogenase borden et al 1995 gieg and suflita 2002 these processes can be expressed as follows r ch2 ch3 o2 r ch2 ch2 oh r ch2 cho r r ch2 cooh the formation of acid in groundwater is an important reason for the decrease in the ph value of the solution van stempvoort et al 2007 once the contaminants are degraded to a certain degree the degradation of microorganisms will be abated the medium used in the experiment is mainly aquifer medium obtained from the study area such as gravel coarse and medium sand affected by the interaction of water and aquifer medium the environment of groundwater will change resulting in the increase of ph value however hco3 has little change in this process qian et al 2018 in addition the magnitude of change at b5 and c5 is significantly stronger than that at d5 the main reason for this phenomenon is that the location of pollutant leakage occurs between the lines of the b and c holes and microorganisms play a more pronounced role in the flow direction of groundwater the density of petroleum contaminants is smaller than that of water and its concentration in the lower layer is low resulting in weaker microbial effects therefore the change in ph value at point d5 is relatively small in general regardless of the ph value the changes in ph value are very small because of the low concentration of petroleum pollutants in groundwater and relatively weak microbial action 3 1 3 variation regular ions 3 1 3 1 changes in no3 content fig 7 shows that the no3 content at the monitoring location first decreases and then increases among the locations the b1 b2 and b3 locations increase considerably in no3 content during the later stage while that of b4 increases relatively little except for the b1 monitoring location the initial concentration of no3 at the remaining locations was 35 0 mg l 1 as the reaction progressed the no3 concentration at each location began to decrease reaching a minimum value at approximately 20 h and presenting a reduction of approximately 50 the concentration at each monitoring location then increases rapidly in particular the no3 content at the b1 and b2 locations were as high as 32 0 mg l 1 at 100 h however since b3 and b4 are relatively far away from the pollution source the increase of no3 concentration is small moreover no2 was detected in some samples which may be caused by the denitrification of microorganisms kuhn et al 1988 hutchins et al 1991 the reason for the decrease in no3 content is that microorganisms require certain carbon sources energy and electron acceptors during the whole reaction process kuhn et al 1988 hutchins et al 1991 the carbon source is organic matter in petroleum pollutants while the electron acceptor may be dissolved oxygen do nitrate no3 ferric iron fe3 and sulfate so4 2 in water qian et al 2018 the order in which the above electron acceptors are utilized is do no3 fe3 so4 2 borden et al 1995 choi and lee 2011 guo et al 2020 that is microorganisms prioritize the use of do as an electron acceptor and only use no3 when the do is insufficient anderson and lovley 1997 the biological reaction of no3 as an electron acceptor is as follows ch2o 2no3 h2o co2 2no2 3 1 3 2 changes in so4 2 content from fig 8 compared to no3 the change in so4 2 concentration over time is relatively small during the whole reaction process the content fluctuation range of so4 2 at the b1 b4 monitoring locations was very small remaining between 35 0 and 42 0 mg l 1 and the change was only approximately 10 the reason for this result can be attributed to the order in which so4 2 is used as an electron acceptor guo et al 2020 as mentioned above the use of so4 2 lags behind that of no3 when no3 ions are still present in the groundwater environment so4 2 does not participate in the reaction anderson and lovley 1997 guo et al 2020 so its concentration varies within a small range in summary microbial degradation occurs during groundwater flow batlle aguilar et al 2009 kao et al 2010 it has been reported that a considerable number of microorganisms including bacteria and fungi anderson and lovley 1997 are capable of degrading petroleum hydrocarbons in the aeration zone medium and the groundwater environment kwon et al 2018 microorganisms use petroleum pollutants as a carbon source to carry out their own growth and metabolism anderson and lovley 1997 the essence of this process is that microorganisms participate in the corresponding redox reaction to convert toxic and harmful substances into n2 h2o and other nontoxic substances guo et al 2020 after oxygen is consumed rapidly microorganisms mainly undergo anaerobic degradation chiu et al 2017 according to the thermodynamic principle the ability of an electron acceptor to compete for electrons is inversely proportional to its free energy that is the smaller the free energy is the easier the electron acceptor is to react so dissolved oxygen is utilized in preference to nitrates and sulfates maric et al 2019 however in the actual groundwater environment especially in mountainous areas with large burial depths dissolved oxygen is easily consumed but difficult to replenish anderson and lovley 1997 therefore the groundwater system is mostly in a hypoxic environment and nitrate is first involved in redox reactions as an electron acceptor kuhn et al 1988 hutchins et al 1991 borden et al 1995 when groundwater is polluted a transformation process from an oxidizing environment to a reducing environment will take place wilson et al 1986 anderson and lovley 1997 through the above analysis it can be seen that after petroleum hydrocarbon enters groundwater it has the effects of convection diffusion and biodegradation chiu et al 2013 under these effects the migration range of pollutants in groundwater and the concentration in downstream monitoring wells will change accordingly these changes will affect the selection of monitoring well locations and the determination of specific contaminants respectively these two factors are the key links for identifying the location and release intensity of groundwater pollution sources using ga in addition the study on the migration and transformation of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants in sandbox experiment can help to determine the relevant parameters required by the method 3 1 4 parameter acquisition according to the migration rules of petroleum pollutants in the sandbox groundwater and relevant literature review the following parameters can be obtained porosity with reference to empirical values in the literature qin et al 2013 cao et al 2017 the porosity of the sand is between 0 25 and 0 5 combined with the loading medium in the experiment the porosity n is equal to 0 3 hydraulic conductivity and groundwater velocity during the experiment when the groundwater level on both sides was stable the groundwater flow was found to be 18 18 ml min 1 the hydraulic gradient of groundwater is 2 19 according to q kia bear 1979 it is known that the hydraulic conductivity k is equal to 9 78 m d 1 the above results are combined with the groundwater flow continuity equation 1 so the groundwater velocity u is equal to 0 2139 m d 1 longitudinal diffusion coefficient diffusion is an important measure of the dispersion characteristics of porous media and it is usually obtained by field experiments however the cost of field experiments is relatively high and diffusion data is difficult to obtain thus diffusion data is generally obtained by the corresponding empirical formula gelhar et al 1992 neuman and zhang 1990 xu and eckstein 1995 in this experiment the value of a l is 2 34 m which is based on the diffusion coefficient dl a l u 0 5 m2 d 1 chen et al 2018 3 1 5 ade ga identifies the source of pollution under experimental conditions the genetic algorithm toolbox based on matlab software mathworks 2010 and the parameters used in the genetic algorithm calculation process under experimental conditions were used to invert the pollution source parameters at the x 1 05 m section the relevant parameters of the genetic algorithm are set as follows table 2 the number of chromosomes that is the population size is 100 the termination evolutionary number is 120 generations and the crossover and mutation probabilities use the system default values of 0 8 and 0 05 respectively bastani et al 2010 the result is shown in fig 9 fig 9a shows the changes in fitness function values under different biological generations the ordinate is on a logarithmic scale during each generation the black dots represent the best fitness function values and the blue dots represent the average fitness values fig 9b shows the pollution source related parameter outputs by the system after multiple optimization iterations fig 9a shows that the optimal fitness function value and average value of the x 1 05 m section are 0 20 and 0 32 respectively the results of the pollution source parameters obtained by the genetic algorithm are shown in table 3 in conclusion the results of the genetic algorithm are very close to the true value of the released pollution source in the experiment it has the characteristics of high accuracy and fast convergence in addition the accuracy of the genetic algorithm is confirmed by analyzing the migration law of the petroleum pollutants in the sandbox therefore a genetic algorithm can be applied to the inverse problem of groundwater pollution sources 3 2 site application results and discussion 3 2 1 site parameter determination according to the parameters used in the calculation of the genetic algorithm the site parameters are determined as follows the medium of the aquifer in the site is large gravel with some coarse sand thus its hydraulic conductivity is 45 m d 1 and the porosity n is 0 25 based on field tests the average hydraulic gradient of the site is 1 and the darcy velocity u is equal to bear 1979 0 045 m d 1 the dispersion a l value of the site is 5 3 m and its dispersion coefficient d l is 0 2385 m2 d 1 the average thickness of the aquifer is 3 m and the width is approximately 40 m thus its cross sectional area s is equal to 120 m2 3 2 2 site specific pollutant toluene is the main component in diesel kao et al 2010 lin et al 2012 chiu et al 2013 the toluene content in the study area is still very high so selecting the toluene in aquifer as the site specific pollutant from july 2017 to september 2018 the 3 well in the study area was continuously monitored every two months the test results are shown in fig 10 3 2 3 identification of pollution sources the research site was analyzed according to the ade ga and verified under the experimental conditions the main parameters of the genetic algorithm are set as follows table 2 the maximum number is 100 generations and the population size is 80 the system default values are 0 05 and 0 8 for mutation and crossover probability respectively bastani et al 2010 the results of the genetic algorithm are shown in fig 11 the research shows that the algorithm converges at the 81st generation and then the program ends the optimal fitness function value was 0 1056 according to the results of the genetic algorithm the pollution source parameters are shown in table 4 3 2 4 verification and discussion the identification results of pollution sources can be validated and analyzed by using the data collected during the earlier period and from on site investigations the calculation result of the source location x 0 is 37 2 m that is the source location is 37 2 m upstream of the no 3 observation well by using the groundwater flow as the x direction it can be found that 37 2 m upstream is located in the gasoline irrigation area fig 12 which is consistent with the actual position of the site second the calculated result of the pollutant leakage time t 0 is 4269 d that is the interval between pollutant leakage time and the first sampling test july 2017 is 4269 d which is approximately 12 years the initial estimate is that the leakage approximately occurred in 2005 according to preliminary data the gas station was abandoned in the 1970 s the old fashioned underground storage tanks in china mainly used steel storage tanks with a steel plate thickness of 6 mm due to its long term contact with air and moisture the corrosion caused the thickness of the steel sheet to become thinner eventually oil contaminants leaked under the influence of corrosion the damage to the storage tank takes 15 years more than 70 of underground storage tanks leak if they are older than 15 years therefore the site of the study area experienced corrosion damage from 1970 to 1985 the tanks continued to leak for 20 years between 1985 and 2005 after the pollutants in the oil storage tank stopped leaking in 2005 the pollutants were transported downstream under the action of groundwater the entire pollution history process is shown in fig 13 finally the quantity of the identified pollutants is analyzed the calculated result of m was 9 2 kg that is a total of 9 2 kg of toluene entered the aquifer then the leakage strength of toluene can be calculated to be 1 33 g d 1 therefore when the steel plate of the storage tank is not completely corroded the pollutant leakage intensity was zero after the pollutants in the oil storage tank stopped leaking in 2005 the pollution source intensity was also zero in the above process the whole historical process of pollution is deduced and verified based on the data collected from field exploration and the early stage the results of the genetic algorithm are in line with the real results in the field this work shows that the genetic algorithm can be applied to the solution of pollution sources at the field scale 4 conclusions in this paper a genetic algorithm combined with the advection dispersion equation are applied to the identification of groundwater pollution sources at the experimental scale and site scale the monitoring results of the physical experiment obtained by using the sandbox suggest that the identification result is reliable analysis of the field data shows that the ade ga is also reliable for identifying groundwater pollution sources at the site scale among the results the sandbox test also obtains the regularity of pollutant migration in groundwater and microbial degradation is accompanied by the migration of pollutants in groundwater which plays an important role in the rational interpretation of the pollutant source identification at both the experimental scale and site scale the application of this method to the identification of groundwater pollution sources can not only solve the problem of minimizing the difference between the identification results and the true value but also provide a reliable reference for the control and efficient

chief with the assistance of uwe haberlandt associate editor stochastic rainfall models have been widely used for hydrological modelling and climate change impact studies the accuracy of which can substantially affect the reliability of water resources planning hydraulic structure design and flood and drought risk assessment the primary objective of this study is to develop a stochastic daily rainfall model through coupling a markov chain model with a rainfall event model sdrm mcrem to simultaneously preserve the statistical properties of rainfall time series and rainfall events the newly developed model is applied to the qu river basin east china and its performance is evaluated at catchment scale results demonstrate that sdrm mcrem shows a good performance in reproducing most of the rainfall time series statistics i e rainfall percentiles average monthly and annual rainfall inter monthly rainfall variability and extreme rainfall and rainfall event characteristics i e distributions of wet and dry spells occurrence frequency of different rainfall event classes temporal rainfall patterns and their occurrence frequency in different rainfall event classes the statistics of average runoff and extreme runoff are also well preserved by using the sdrm mcrem simulations as input of hydrological modelling except that the interannual variability of rainfall and runoff is slightly underestimated moreover sdrm mcrem shows a great potential to be used for flood and drought risk assessment in reproducing the exceedance probabilities of high flows e g annual

patterns copula high and low flows 1 introduction rainfall is a key component of the water cycle and has significant impacts on water resources planning agricultural production and human society breinl et al 2017 ye et al 2018 it is always used as input to hydrological models for flood and drought risk assessment infrastructure design and water resources management particularly when the observed streamflow series are not long enough kim et al 2016 however in some cases observed rainfall records are too short or lacking and naturally provide only one single realization then the direct use of these data in agricultural and hydrological analysis may not provide the necessary reliability in flood and drought risk assessment chowdhury et al 2017 tian et al 2017 for this reason stochastic rainfall models srms have frequently been used as tools to produce long series of rainfall data with no limited length that have statistical properties comparable to observed time series chen and brissette 2014 srms are also used to produce multiple climate realizations for vulnerability assessment and even to generate rainfall series for ungauged stations through interpolating model parameters from adjacent gauged sites chen et al 2019 in addition srms have been widely used as tools to downscale projections of global and regional climate models for climate change impact studies zhuang et al 2015 therefore the accuracy of srms in reproducing rainfall statistics is significantly important over the past few decades a number of srms have been proposed many of these models were developed based on markov chain models such as wgen richardson 1981 cligen nicks and gander 1994 climgen stöckle et al 1999 and weagets chen et al 2010 which are all based on a two step simulation scheme in the first step the time series of rainfall occurrence i e a wet day or a dry day is generated by a markov chain which has become the most popular approach due to its simplicity and effectiveness in preserving wet and dry spells costa and fernandes 2017 in the second step the rainfall amount on a wet day is usually estimated through a parametric probability distribution which is employed because it can be used for extrapolation of non observed extreme values compared to non parametric or semi parametric approaches gao et al 2018 in recent years efforts were still mainly devoted to improving the performance of these models for example the impacts of the order of markov chains deni et al 2008 and types of probability distributions of rainfall amount li et al 2013 on representations of rainfall behavior have been explored by many studies evin et al 2018 chen et al 2012b srikanthan and pegram 2009 higher order markov chains such as third order and fourth order are gradually adopted to improve the dependence structure of wet and dry spells especially for long dry spells srikanthan and pegram 2009 mixed or hybrid probability distributions like the mixed exponential distribution double gamma distribution or the extended gp type iii distribution are suggested for use to reproduce the whole range of rainfall amounts including the most extreme rainfall naveau et al 2016 although the performance of markov chain models has been essentially improved through above mentioned methods some limitations still exist the distribution and dependence structure of daily rainfall amounts in a wet spell also known as temporal rainfall patterns and the relationship between total rainfall amount and the wet spell are not taken into account these are characteristics of rainfall events and are generally neglected in markov chain based stochastic rainfall models rainfall event characteristics including rainfall duration wet spell rainfall depth total rainfall amount in one rainfall event temporal rainfall pattern and their correlation structure have essential influences on runoff processes and flood modelling hettiarachchi et al 2018 mohamadi and kavian 2015 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2018 pointed out that multi day rainfall events particularly extreme rainfall events can trigger more extreme flooding due to cumulative runoff generation compared to daily extreme rainfall in this process rainfall depth and duration to some extent directly determine the generation of the flood volume and flood duration and their dependence structure has a significant effect on storm surface runoff zhang and singh 2007 córdova and rodríguez iturbe 1985 in addition the temporal rainfall patterns greatly affect the severity of flood events guan et al 2015 and wang et al 2016 both reported that storms with rainfall peaks occurring at the late stage of storms yield higher runoff peaks and induce more serious floods than those with earlier rainfall peaks hettiarachchi et al 2018 also demonstrated that the impacts of rainfall volumes and storm temporal patterns on flood risk evaluation are both significant and should be given full consideration therefore these rainfall event characteristics should also be incorporated in stochastic rainfall models rainfall event models also known as event based rainfall models are developed to reproduce rainfall event characteristics vandenberghe et al 2010 gao et al 2018 wu et al 2006 wu et al 2006 presented a monte carlo based stochastic rainstorm event model considering correlated rainstorm duration and depth as well as various temporal rainfall patterns but the procedure of the monte carlo method in simulating correlated variables was complicated vandenberghe et al 2010 constructed a stochastic design storm generator by using a simple copula function for joint simulation of rainfall depth and duration and a uniform random sampling method for generating the specific percentile curves i e 10 50 and 90 of rainfall patterns the limitation of this model is that only the specific percentiles of rainfall patterns are simulated and the randomness of rainfall patterns in reality cannot be fully reflected gao et al 2018 synthesized the strengths of these two models to construct a new stochastic rainfall event model by utilizing the copulas like vandenberghe et al 2010 to jointly simulate rainfall depth and duration and the approach of wu et al 2006 to stochastically simulate various temporal rainfall patterns and then extended the simulation scope of extreme rainfall events to all kinds of events ranging from low moderate to extreme events however the common problem of rainfall event models is that the output is a sequence of rainfall events and can only be used as input to event based hydrological models this greatly limits the application of rainfall event simulation data to the commonly used continuous hydrological models that require rainfall time series motivated by the above limitations this study aims to develop a stochastic rainfall model by coupling a markov chain model with the stochastic rainfall event model developed by gao et al 2018 named as sdrm mcrem in order to generate rainfall time series while simultaneously preserving characteristics of rainfall events more specifically a markov chain model is firstly used to generate time series of rainfall occurrence including wet and dry spells and then the rainfall event model is applied to stochastically simulate the sequence of rainfall events that correspond to the wet spells extracted from the above generated rainfall occurrence series compared to the currently existing stochastic rainfall models that just consider part of the above described rainfall simulation procedures this proposed sdrm mcrem is expected to be a comprehensive novel stochastic rainfall model that not only considers the statistical properties of rainfall time series but also takes into account the rainfall event characteristics including the correlation between rainfall depth and rainfall duration the occurrence frequency of different rainfall event classes various temporal rainfall patterns and their occurrence frequency in different rainfall event classes the sdrm mcrem is designed to preserve these important statistical properties of rainfall as much as possible the ability of sdrm mcrem to simulate rainfall time series statistics and rainfall event characteristics will be simultaneously evaluated for the first time then its suitability for hydrological modelling will be examined this paper is organized as follows the study area and data are briefly introduced in section 2 the detailed framework of sdrm mcrem its application in hydrological modelling and performance evaluation approaches are described in section 3 section 4 and 5 respectively present the evaluation results of sdrm mcrem in reproducing rainfall statistics and its reliability of being used as input of hydrological modelling followed by a discussion in section 6 and conclusions in section 7 2 study area and data in this study the development of sdrm mcrem and its application to hydrological modelling are conducted for the qu river basin which is shown in fig 1 the qu river basin 28 29 30 n 118 119 e is situated in the west of zhejiang province east china and is the southern source of qiantang river the longest and largest river in zhejiang province the qu river basin drains an area of about 5536 km2 and has an average elevation of 351 m with high areas in the south and north low in the middle high in the west and low in the east due to the large influence of the asian subtropical monsoon climate 50 of the rainfall occurs between april and july gao et al 2018 the annual average rainfall is 1800 mm the potential evapotranspiration is approximately 1200 mm and the average temperature is around 15 18 tian et al 2013 under global warming the occurrence probability of extreme climate conditions such as storms and droughts is likely to increase in the qu river basin gao et al 2020a 2020b the observed daily rainfall data from 14 rainfall stations daily minimum and maximum temperatures from three meteorological stations and daily runoff data from the quzhou hydrological station from the historical period 1970 2000 are used in this study the temperature data is provided by the national climate center of china meteorological administration and rainfall and runoff data are provided by zhejiang bureau of hydrology the whole analysis is carried out at the catchment scale and the areal average rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet are calculated by the thiessen polygon method thiessen 1911 pet at each station is estimated using the hargreaves method hargreaves and zohrab 1985 based on the minimum and maximum temperatures 3 methodology this section describes the procedure of developing the new stochastic rainfall model sdrm mcrem the flowchart of this model is shown in fig 2 and is composed of three main modules the first module generates the time series of rainfall occurrence the second module extracts rainfall events based on the definition of rainfall events and determines rainfall duration for each rainfall event the third module simulates characteristics of rainfall events including rainfall depth and temporal rainfall pattern for each rainfall event conditional on its rainfall duration according to the statistics derived from observed rainfall events in addition the conceptual hydrological model gr4j modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier perrin et al 2003 that is used to evaluate the ability of sdrm mcrem to generate hydrological modelling input and the hydrometeorological evaluation approaches are also presented in this section 3 1 stochastic rainfall model coupling markov chain model with rainfall event model sdrm mcrem 3 1 1 third order markov chain model for rainfall occurrence a markov chain model is a widespread approach for stochastic generation of rainfall occurrence that is able to reproduce the temporal persistence of wet and dry spells wilks 1998 keller et al 2015 therefore the markov chain model is also applied in this study to generate the time series of rainfall occurrence expressed as x t the probability of having a wet day on day t is given in eq 1 1 p i k i 2 i 1 1 p x t 1 x t 1 i 1 x t 2 i 2 x t k i k i 1 i 2 i k 0 o r 1 that is the transition probability of a wet day on day t depends on the states of the previous k days the probability of a dry day corresponds to p i k i 2 i 1 0 1 p i k i 2 i 1 1 a wet day is defined as a day having rainfall 0 1 mm breinl 2016 mukundan et al 2019 li et al 2013 when it is a wet day the state is expressed with the value 1 otherwise 0 the markov chain can be characterized by a transition matrix with a dimension of 2 k 1 the parameters of the transition probability matrix are estimated on a monthly basis 12 estimations throughout the calendar year based on the observed rainfall time series to determine the right order of the markov chain model for daily rainfall occurrence two commonly used criteria i e the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic were used to choose among the first order second order and third order markov chains on a monthly and annual basis detailed information about the aic and bic criteria can be found in cazacioc and cipu 2005 and schoof and pryor 2008 the corresponding results can be found in table s1 in addition since the dry spells and wet spells are the basis of rainfall event simulation in the developed sdrm mcrem we also compared the occurrence frequency of wet and dry spells with different lengths between observations and simulations for these different orders of the markov chain model in the qu river basin and the results can be found in fig s1 from table s1 and fig s1 it can be seen that the third order markov chain is the best to maintain the transition probability of rainfall occurrence both on the monthly and annual scales and can also well reproduce observed wet and dry spells thus the third order markov chain was eventually chosen in this study based on eq 1 n year time series of rainfall occurrence can be generated 3 1 2 extraction of rainfall events and determination of rainfall duration in this study independent rainfall events are defined as continuous wet days separated by one or more consecutive dry days gao et al 2018 2020a given the generated time series of rainfall occurrence simulated rainfall events can be extracted according to the definition of rainfall events and the rainfall duration i e wet spell of each simulated rainfall event can be determined similarly observed rainfall events were also derived from the observed rainfall time series in the 1971 2000 period using the definition of rainfall events subsequently the observed rainfall event characteristics i e rainfall duration the lasting period of one rainfall event rainfall depth the total amount of rainfall in one rainfall event inter event time iet also called dry spell the period between two adjacent rainfall events and temporal rainfall pattern the temporal distribution of rainfall within one rainfall event can be obtained observed rainfall event characteristics are the major foundation of building the sdrm mcrem to incorporate the simulation of different rainfall event classes and different types of temporal rainfall patterns in the construction of sdrm mcrem rainfall events are classified into different event classes based on rainfall depth rainfall duration and iet respectively the detailed classification method designed by gao et al 2020a for the qu river basin is shown in table 1 the temporal rainfall patterns are grouped into three common rainfall types based on the position of rainfall peaks which are the advanced type type a central peaked type type c and delayed type type d that represent rainfall peaks occurring at the beginning middle and end stages of rainfall events respectively subsequently the occurrence frequency of different rainfall types in different rainfall event classes can be calculated the detailed algorithm can be found in gao et al 2020a on the basis of the above described observed rainfall event characteristics the rainfall depth and temporal rainfall pattern corresponding to the rainfall duration for each simulated rainfall event can be conditionally generated in the subsequent sections 3 1 3 stochastic simulation of rainfall depth conditional on rainfall duration rainfall characteristics e g rainfall depth and rainfall duration are often dependent and can have a significant effect on hydrological design and flood management zhang and singh 2007 candela et al 2014 consequently these variables need to be jointly simulated through bivariate or even multivariate models copula functions are a popular and flexible tool to construct the joint distribution function of multiple random variables due to its advantage that no assumption is needed for the variables to be independent or having the same type of marginal distribution in this study the copula method is thus adopted to construct the joint probability distribution of rainfall duration and rainfall depth which mainly comprises two steps 1 determination of marginal distributions of rainfall duration and rainfall depth 2 determination of the dependence structure between rainfall duration and rainfall depth to incorporate the seasonal variability of rainfall event characteristics the application of the copula method is carried out on a monthly basis keeping consistent with the procedure of rainfall occurrence in section 3 1 1 nine probability distributions are examined to select the best fitted distributions for rainfall depth and rainfall duration as their marginal distributions including the gamma distribution exponential distribution lognormal distribution normal distribution double gamma distribution generalized extreme value distribution pearson type iii distribution three parameter lognormal distribution and generalized pareto distribution all parameters of these distributions are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method akaike s information criterion aic bozdogan 1987 is adopted to choose the best fitted distributions for rainfall duration and rainfall depth shown in eq 2 2 aic n log mse 2 k where n is the sample size mse represents the mean squared error between the empirical and theoretical probability and k is the number of fitted parameters the smaller the aic value is the better the distribution fits three archimedean copulas i e gumbel hougard clayton and frank are used to build the dependence structure between rainfall duration and rainfall depth as they are commonly used and proven to be efficient in hydrological applications in many studies candela et al 2014 zhang and singh 2007 rauf and zeephongsekul 2013 the two dimensional copula functions and the relationship between copula parameters and kendall s rank correlation coefficient are given in table 2 the best fitted copula function is selected using aic with the best fitted marginal distributions of observed rainfall duration and depth and their best fitted dependence structure the joint distribution of rainfall duration and depth is constructed given rainfall durations of simulated rainfall events described in section 3 1 2 the corresponding rainfall depths can be stochastically generated by the following steps i determine the month that one rainfall event occurs based on the date of the first day of this rainfall event and use the corresponding monthly marginal distribution of rainfall duration to determine the cumulative probability of rainfall duration ii stochastically generate a joint cumulative probability of rainfall duration and rainfall depth and determine the cumulative probability of rainfall depth according to the inverse function of the conditional copula function given the cumulative probability of rainfall duration iii determine rainfall depth according to the cumulative probability of rainfall depth using the corresponding monthly inverse marginal distribution of rainfall depth repeat step 1 3 until rainfall depths of all rainfall events are generated it should be noted that rainfall depths of observed rainfall events are not smaller than 0 1 mm and thus generated rainfall depths should also meet this condition for this purpose the marginal distribution of rainfall depth is fitted using the original values reduced by 0 1 mm and then 0 1 mm is added back after simulated rainfall depths are generated in this study the exponential distribution and double gamma distribution were eventually selected as the marginal distributions of rainfall duration and rainfall depth see table s2 for each month respectively for the monthly dependence structure of rainfall duration and rainfall depth table s3 shows that the frank copula is the best in most months and the gumbel copula is the second but there is no much difference between the aic values for the frank and gumbel copulas considering that the gumbel copula is asymmetric and sensitive to the upper tail and the frank copula is symmetrical in the whole distribution lee et al 2013 gumbel is more suitable according to the observed dependence structure in january august and frank is more similar to the observed dependence structure in september december see fig s2 therefore the gumbel copula was finally selected for january august and the frank copula for september december note that the double gamma distribution adopted in this study is shown in eq 3 which is different from the double gamma distribution described in räty et al 2014 and gao et al 2020a those studies artificially divide rainfall into low and high rainfall segments based on a specific percentile e g 90 or 95 quantile and fit separate distributions to each segment the double gamma distribution we adopted also represents two rainfall states but an objective automatic partitioning approach is used and it is a complete distribution rather than two separate distributions which is more suitable to be utilized in copula functions teng et al 2015 3 f p λ β 1 α 1 p α 1 1 e β 1 p γ α 1 1 λ β 2 α 2 p α 2 1 e β 2 p γ α 2 where p is rainfall duration or depth the parameter λ 0 λ 1 is the weight of the low or high rainfall states the single gamma distribution represents rainfall occurring in high or low rainfall states and α and β are the parameters of the gamma distribution 3 1 4 stochastic simulation of a rainfall type and its temporal pattern given rainfall duration and rainfall depth after determination of rainfall durations section 3 1 2 and rainfall depths section 3 1 3 for simulated rainfall events the event class that each pair of rainfall duration and rainfall depth belongs to can be further determined according to the classification shown in table 1 the subsequent step is to stochastically generate a rainfall type for each rainfall event and then generate a corresponding temporal rainfall pattern for this rainfall type to form one complete rainfall event a specific rainfall type i e type a type c or type d is randomly generated based on the occurrence probability of each rainfall type under different rainfall event classes section 3 1 2 which is expressed as eq 4 4 p k i j n k i j k 1 3 n k i j k 1 2 3 i j 1 2 3 4 where n k i j and p k i j are respectively the occurrence number and occurrence probability of the k th rainfall type for the i th depth based rainfall event class and j th duration based rainfall event class rainfall types a c and d are numbered as 1 2 and 3 respectively and the orders of the depth based and duration based rainfall event classes are numbered as 1 4 from light class to extreme class the contingency table of the occurrence probability of different rainfall types under different rainfall event classes can be seen in table s4 when the rainfall type of one rainfall event is specified the corresponding temporal rainfall pattern can be stochastically simulated according to the statistics of this rainfall type the detailed generation procedure of temporal rainfall patterns for a specific rainfall type can be found in gao et al 2018 and only a brief description is given as follows 1 firstly gather all the temporal rainfall patterns of a specific rainfall type and normalize the rainfall durations and rainfall depths to obtain dimensionless rainfall patterns 2 secondly divide all dimensionless rainfall durations into k equal intervals so that k sets of dimensionless rainfall increases corresponding to the k intervals can be obtained 3 lastly fit each set of dimensionless rainfall increase to different distributions and use the fitted appropriate distribution to stochastically simulate the rainfall increase simultaneously the correlation structure of the k sets of rainfall increases should be retained and the constrained condition that the sum of the k dimensionless rainfall increases for each rainfall pattern equals to one should be guaranteed 3 1 5 coupling time series of rainfall occurrence with rainfall events simulation with the generated results as obtained in section 3 1 2 3 1 4 the depth and duration of each rainfall event can be allocated according to its temporal pattern to form a complete simulated rainfall event subsequently the simulated complete rainfall events in chronological order are inserted to the time series of rainfall occurrence from section 3 1 1 to form the complete simulated rainfall time series at this stage the sdrm mcrem has been built in this study 1000 realizations of simulated rainfall with the same length as the observed rainfall i e 30 years are generated so that the performance of sdrm mcrem can be compared with observations 3 2 hydrological model gr4j gr4j is a four parameter lumped rainfall runoff model developed by perrin et al 2003 based on the gr3j model it is one of the simplest and most widely used hydrological models in the world and performs reasonably well in daily streamflow simulation in general van esse et al 2013 and monsoon climate watersheds in particular tian et al 2018 gao et al 2020b zhang et al 2015 the structure of gr4j is composed of a production store a routing store and two unit hydrographs zhang et al 2015 the drainage area areal average rainfall and areal average pet of the study area are required as the input data monte carlo simulation mcs with latin hypercube sampling is carried out to generate 30 000 parameter sets to calibrate the gr4j model tian et al 2013 in this study the areal average rainfall and pet in the year 1970 are used for warming up and the 30 year data of the period 1971 2000 are used for calibration and validation the split sample cross validation procedure similar to gao et al 2020a is applied i e the first 20 years 1971 1990 used for calibration and the last 10 years for validation and vice versa the last 20 years 1981 2000 for calibration and the first 10 years for validation to select the optimum parameter set using the objective function y as shown in eq 5 the y index is a comprehensive evaluation index that combines the nash sutcliffe ns coefficient eq 6 and the relative volume error rve eq 7 for model calibration and evaluation akhtar et al 2009 when the average y value of a parameter set in the two calibration periods obtains its maximum value we consider the parameter set as the optimum one 5 y ns 1 rve 6 ns 1 i 1 n q m i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 7 rve 100 i 1 n q m i q o i i 1 n q o i where i is the daily time step n is the length of the time series q o and q m are the observed and modelled runoff with the selected optimum parameter set and the inputs of the gr4j model i e the 1000 realizations of rainfall time series of 30 years simulated by sdrm mcrem and pet of 30 years calculated using observed temperature data 1000 sets of runoff time series of 30 years can be correspondingly obtained 3 3 assessment approaches of sdrm mcrem performance the meteorological performance of the proposed sdrm mcrem is assessed for two aspects statistical properties of rainfall time series and rainfall event characteristics to evaluate the ability of sdrm mcrem in simulating rainfall time series several general statistics such as the percentiles 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th and 99th of the rainfall distribution mean rainfall standard deviation and the probability of wet days are compared with the observed counterparts for each month li et al 2015 moreover some annual extreme indices including r1d r3d r5d r7d r90ptot r95ptot r99ptot cdd and cwd please see their definitions in table 3 and their inter annual variabilities are also considered to investigate whether this model can adequately reproduce extreme events these indices are recommended by the expert team on climate change detection monitoring and indices etccdmi of the climate variability and predictability clivar project alexander et al 2006 rainfall event characteristics like i the occurrence frequency of different depth based duration based and iet based rainfall event classes ii the temporal patterns of different rainfall types iii the occurrence frequency of different rainfall types in different rainfall event classes and iv the cumulative distributions of dry and wet spells are for the first time evaluated for stochastic rainfall models it is assumed that a stochastic rainfall model which preserves the time series statistics as well as the rainfall event characteristics can provide better inputs to hydrological models to reproduce flow properties that can be effectively used for flood and drought assessment froidevaux et al 2015 the suitability of sdrm mcrem in hydrological application is assessed based on the general flow statistics and low and high flow indices general statistics consisting of different percentiles of the flow distribution mean and standard deviation for each month are used to evaluate the simulated flows the exceedance probabilities of high flow indices i e annual maximum 1 3 and 5 day mean flow and low flow indices i e annual minimum 7 30 and 90 day mean flow olden and poff 2003 are further compared to determine the capacity of sdrm mcrem in simulating high and low flow hydrology pan et al 2017 to offer a consistent way to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of sdrm mcrem based on the performance metrics an evaluation approach similar to the evaluation framework proposed by bennett et al 2018 is adopted this approach categorizes the performance of sdrm mcrem for each metric into three categories good fair and poor according to the agreement between the observed metrics and the simulated metrics of the 1000 realizations generated by sdrm mcrem a good performance is defined when the observed metric falls within the 80 i e 10th 90th quantile confidence interval ci of the 1000 simulated metrics when the observed metric is outside the 80 ci but inside the minimum and maximum range of the 1000 simulated metrics a fair performance is assigned otherwise we consider the performance as poor indicating that sdrm mcrem fails to reproduce the particular statistic properly compared to the evaluation framework of bennett et al 2018 that adopted a 90 ci to evaluate the performance of models we use an 80 ci which is relatively more rigorous 4 evaluation of sdrm mcrem performance 4 1 reproduction of rainfall time series statistics fig 3 shows the observed seven rainfall percentiles 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th 99th monthly rainfall standard deviation std probability of wet days and average rainfall amount of wet days versus the generated counterparts by sdrm mcrem on monthly scales in the qu river basin generally sdrm mcrem presents a good performance for the majority of these time series statistics indicating that the observed metric is well reproduced by this model with values falling within the 80 ci particularly for the 95th and 99th rainfall percentiles monthly mean rainfall and the probability and mean of wet days this sdrm mcrem performs quite well illustrated by the medians of the simulated metrics which are very close to the observed metrics and the small uncertainty ranges however in the monsoon season mainly april june this model displays a fair performance for the 75th and 90th rainfall percentiles and the standard deviation of monthly rainfall i e inter monthly variability with the 80 ci slightly lower than the observations and a fair or poor performance for the low percentiles 10th and 25th with some overestimation in addition the uncertainty of the simulated low rainfall percentiles from 10th to 50th in the monsoon season are always larger than for the other months the behavior of sdrm mcrem in simulating annual rainfall and extreme indicators and their corresponding inter annual variabilities i e standard deviation compared to those of observations is shown in table 3 from table 3 it can be observed that sdrm mcrem shows a fair performance in simulating average annual rainfall but a poor performance for its inter annual variability with some underestimation for extreme statistical indicators sdrm mcrem reproduces the r3d r5d cdd and cwd values very well even their inter annual variabilities as there are no obvious differences between the observations and the simulated medians the r1d r7d r99ptot and their variabilities are fairly reproduced with the mean and variability of r1d and mean r99ptot being slightly overestimated but the mean r7d and the inter annual variability of r7d and p99ptot being slightly underestimated in addition sdrm mcrem presents a good performance in reproducing mean values of r90ptot and r95ptot but a fair performance in their variabilities overall sdrm mcrem in most cases can very well i e good performance or reasonably well i e fair performance reproduce the time series statistics particularly for the monthly extreme rainfall and the long duration annual rainfall data that are essential for hydrological analysis 4 2 reproduction of rainfall event characteristics the total number of rainfall events and the occurrence frequency of different duration based and iet based rainfall event classes are quite well reproduced by sdrm mcrem compared to the observed counterparts see fig 4 as shown by the simulated medians almost overlapping the observations and the uncertainty of the 1000 realizations being small a similarly good performance can be seen in fig 5 showing the cumulative probability distributions of wet and dry spells these good performances are all due to the adoption of the third order markov chain model that can provide a more accurate representation of wet and dry spells however concerning the occurrence frequency of depth based rainfall event classes sdrm mcrem shows a good performance for heavy and extreme events that are relatively more important for flood management and a poor performance for light and moderate rainfall events the frequency of light rainfall events is underestimated while that of moderate events is overestimated and this seems to be caused by the overestimation of rainfall in the low percentiles such as 10th and 25th that can be seen in fig 3 fig 6 displays the uncertainty of the mass curves of the simulated three rainfall types advanced type a central peaked type c and delayed type d and the observed counterparts the mass curves refer to the cumulative rainfall temporal patterns meaning that the y axis and x axis represent the cumulative dimensionless rainfall depth and duration respectively and the total rainfall duration is equally divided into three equal intervals as in gao et al 2020a note that in this part of analysis only rainfall events with a duration of three or more days are considered when analyzing rainfall temporal patterns because it is regarded as meaningless to analyze the temporal patterns of 1 day and 2 day rainfall events gao et al 2020a the occurrence frequency of different depth based rainfall event classes that are classified based on rainfall events with a duration of three or more days and the occurrence frequency of the three rainfall types in these different event classes are presented in fig 7 for light rainfall events sdrm mcrem shows a large uncertainty in simulating rainfall patterns of the three rainfall types this is not surprising as the occurrence frequency of light rainfall events is the smallest fig 7 a it is also expected that the performance of sdrm mcrem is relatively poor in simulating the occurrence frequency of different rainfall types for light rainfall events and the uncertainty is relatively large fig 7 b for other rainfall events the temporal rainfall patterns and occurrence frequency of the three rainfall types are well reproduced particularly for heavy and extreme rainfall events in which the related occurrence frequency is quite well reproduced furthermore the simulated uncertainty is directly associated with the occurrence frequency of different rainfall event classes when the occurrence frequency of one rainfall event class is small the uncertainty of temporal patterns of different rainfall types in this rainfall event class is relatively large and vice versa overall the rainfall event characteristics are mostly well reproduced this can be expected because sdrm mcrem was developed with these properties being taken into account 5 application of sdrm mcrem to hydrological modelling 5 1 gr4j model calibration and validation results employing the split sample cross validation method described in section 3 2 the optimum parameter set was selected in the first round the objective function y ns and rve values in the calibration 1971 1990 and validation 1991 2000 periods are 0 90 0 91 and 0 54 and 0 92 0 93 and 1 02 respectively in the second round the corresponding results in the calibration 1981 2000 and validation 1971 1980 are 0 93 0 94 and 1 06 and 0 89 0 91 and 3 15 respectively with the chosen optimum parameter set the simulated runoff versus the observed runoff in the whole historical period is shown in fig 8 including the worst and best performance year it can be seen that the major pattern of the hydrograph and most high and low flows are well captured with overall values of y and ns respectively being 0 92 and 0 93 and rve being smaller than 1 72 which is very satisfying the values of y in each year ranges from 0 66 to 0 96 ns from 0 69 to 0 97 and rve from 14 8 to 2 6 although some peaks are underestimated in the worst performance year it is still acceptable compared to other studies zhang et al 2014 gao et al 2019 5 2 reproduction of general runoff statistics in fig 9 the simulated percentiles monthly mean and inter monthly variability standard deviation of runoff are compared to the observed counterparts to demonstrate the performance of sdrm mcrem as input for hydrological modelling the black red and blue lines with dots correspond to the observed runoff the simulated runoff using observed rainfall data and the median of simulated runoff using sdrm mcrem generated rainfall data respectively thus the bias between the red and black lines the blue and red lines and the blue and black lines are respectively caused by gr4j sdrm mcrem and the combination of gr4j and sdrm mcrem in most cases the red and black lines fall within the 80 ci of simulated runoff using sdrm mcrem generated data and are very close to the blue lines indicating that the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j successfully reproduced the observed runoff statistics for each calendar month and performed very well for these runoff properties even taking into account the hydrological modelling error of gr4j the low percentiles 10th and 25th of runoff in may august are fairly simulated with slight overestimation when comparing the medians of sdrm mcrem simulations with the observations this can be attributed to sdrm mcrem rainfall overestimation in april june see fig 3 and gr4j overestimation in all these months in which the gr4j model plays a major role however the high percentiles 90th and 95th of runoff in june are underestimated to some extent mainly due to the slight underestimation of simulated large rainfall by sdrm mcrem when comparing the medians of sdrm mcrem simulations with the observations see fig 3 even so the observed runoff can still be covered in the range of the simulated minimum and maximum runoff and the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j shows a fair performance in these situations furthermore the monthly mean 99th percentile and inter monthly variability of runoff are also quite well reproduced except slight underestimation of 99th percentile runoff and inter monthly variability in july by the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j which is similar to that of the simulated rainfall at the annual scale the capability of the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j in reproducing annual mean runoff and its inter annual variability and low flow and baseflow is shown in table 4 as expected the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j shows a fair performance in simulating these annual runoff values even though there is a slight underestimation of annual mean runoff and overestimation of low flow and baseflow and a relative poor performance in the inter annual variability of annual runoff same as the inter annual variability of rainfall the inter annual variability of runoff is moderately underestimated as well and the extent of underestimation is a bit larger 5 3 reproduction of high and low flows the frequency distributions of high and low flows simulated using sdrm mcrem generated data are compared to the observed counterparts and the simulated ones obtained using observed data fig 10 in order to provide an overview of sdrm mcrem s capacity of being used for flood and drought assessment for high flows the observed and simulated annual maximum 1 day and 3 day mean runoff are well reproduced particularly for the annual maximum 1 day runoff as illustrated by nearly no differences between the three colored points and all observations falling within the 80 ci of simulations using sdrm mcrem generated data however the annual maximum 5 day runoff at large return periods i e exceedance probability between 6 and 30 is fairly reproduced by sdrm mcrem simulations with relatively large underestimation this is mainly caused by the underestimated 90th and 95th percentile runoff in fig 9 because the multiple day runoff would contain these underestimated large runoffs the uncertainty of simulated high flows using sdrm mcrem generated data becomes larger with increasing return period the gr4j model performs very well in simulating high flows and results in very small differences between observations and simulations obtained from observed data for low flows the annual minimum 7 day mean flow is well simulated by the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j even though it is slightly underestimated when the exceedance probability is between 30 and 65 however if we look at the annual minimum 30 day and 90 day mean runoff we note that the low flows are consistently underestimated and this is more pronounced for the longer duration low runoff this is mainly due to gr4j rather than sdrm mcrem because the low flows simulated using observed data and sdrm mcrem data are almost identical the smaller the runoff is the smaller the uncertainty of sdrm mcrem and gr4j jointly simulated low flows which is similar to that of high flows overall the observed high and low flows are all located between the maximum and minimum of the sdrm mcrem and gr4j joint simulations suggesting that the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j has a fair performance in high and low flow simulations 6 discussion 6 1 comparison with another single site stochastic rainfall model the performance of sdrm mcrem in simulating general rainfall statistics and extreme rainfall at the monthly and annual scales and its potential use for hydrological applications was compared to that of weagets weagets is a well known and widely used weather generator developed by chen et al 2012a based on a markov chain model and has shown a better performance in simulating rainfall than the typical weather generators wgen and cligen chen et al 2012b 2010 in the weagets simulation the same third order markov chain procedure as in sdrm mcrem was adopted to generate rainfall occurrence time series and then the gamma distribution was used to produce rainfall amounts for each wet day the results simulated by weagets are presented in figs s3 s6 and tables s5 s6 in the supplementary material the results in fig s3 demonstrate that weagets presents a similar performance with sdrm mcrem in reproducing the general rainfall statistics but with a bit smaller uncertainty and it performs slightly better in terms of annual mean rainfall and annual maximum 1 day rainfall table s5 however weagets shows a worse performance in reproducing other rainfall extremes particularly for the annual maximum consecutive multiple day rainfall like 3 5 and 7 day rainfall and the inter annual variability of all the extreme rainfall indices in addition weagets also performs worse than sdrm mcrem in rainfall event characteristics fig s4 general runoff statistics fig s5 and extreme runoff table s6 which further results in a poor reproduction of the frequency distributions of high flows e g annual maximum 3 day and 5 day mean runoff and low flows annual minimum 7 day 30 day and 90 day mean runoff in fig s6 that are essential for flood and drought risk assessment the above phenomena are mainly because weagets considers each single wet day as an independent event and does not take the correlation of rainfall amounts in consecutive wet days i e wet spell or rainfall duration into account moreover weagets fails to reproduce the occurrence frequency of different rainfall patterns in different rainfall event classes in the whole time series see fig s4 because these rainfall event characteristics are not taken into account the unexpected phenomenon that a good reproduction of general rainfall statistics leads to a poor performance in simulating runoff statistics fig s5 in weagets could be largely attributed to the neglection of influences of temporal rainfall patterns on runoff hettiarachchi et al 2018 this indicates the great necessity of incorporating rainfall temporal patterns and their occurrence frequency in stochastic rainfall models compared to weagets sdrm mcrem proposed in this study overcomes the above weaknesses by adopting a copula function to preserve the relationship of rainfall depth and rainfall duration and simultaneously coupling different temporal rainfall patterns and their corresponding occurrence frequency into rainfall events simulation sdrm mcrem performs well not only in reproducing rainfall time series properties but also in rainfall event characteristics and has strengths in simulating extreme high and low flows 6 2 comparison with a multi site stochastic rainfall model with the coupled application of stochastic rainfall models or weather generators with hydrological models in hydrological impact assessment the influence of rainfall input from a stochastic rainfall model on hydrological model output has also been concerned in recent years in view of the lumped hydrological model gr4j adopted in this study we mainly focus on comparing results of a lumped hydrological model driven by rainfall time series from single site and multi site stochastic rainfall models this issue has also been posed and investigated by breinl 2016 to achieve this purpose the simulated results in this study using the single site sdrm mcrem were compared to those of the multi site weather generator mulgets where the synthetic rainfall was firstly simulated at multiple sites and subsequently lumped mulgets is an extended version of weagets which generates rainfall occurrence at multiple sites using a first order markov chain and rainfall amounts using the gamma distribution on a monthly scale chen et al 2014 the simulated results of mulgets are shown in figs s7 s15 and tables s7 s8 from figs s7 s8 it can be seen that the simulated inter site correlations i e the pearson correlation coefficient and spearman rank correlation coefficient and also the spatial correlograms of the 14 rainfall sites in the qu river basin are almost the same as the observed ones this indicates that the spatial correlation is very well maintained by mulgets however after averaging at the basin scale the mulgets simulations present worse performances than sdrm mcrem and even worse than weagets for both meteorological and hydrological modelling aspects although mulgets can generally reproduce rainfall time series statistics and show smaller uncertainty it cannot well retain the annual distribution of rainfall particularly during march june fig s9 the rainfall extremes and the inter annual variability are largely underestimated table s7 in addition except different rainfall patterns mulgets also cannot well reproduce the important rainfall event characteristics particularly the distributions of wet and dry spells figs s10 s13 furthermore the poor performance of mulgets in representing rainfall characteristics leads to a poor reproduction of general runoff statistics and high and low flows figs s14 s15 and table s8 the extreme runoff in june the inter annual variability of runoff and high flows are heavily underestimated with mulgets simulations while the lows are overestimated there are three possible reasons for the poor hydrometeorological performance of mulgets firstly the lower order markov chain used in mulgets cannot well reproduce the wet and dry spells compared to the higher order markov chain adopted in sdrm mcrem secondly the right skewed single gamma distribution cannot well simulate upper tailed extreme rainfall serinaldi and kilsby 2014 which results in the worse reproduction of rainfall characteristics at each station and further extends to the areally averaged rainfall characteristics particularly for extreme rainfall thirdly the lumped hydrological model cannot fully reflect the advantage of mulgets i e the spatial rainfall characteristics the findings in this study support the conclusions of some previous studies for example chen et al 2016 found that there are no obvious differences between the performance of mulgets applied to a distributed hydrological model and that of weagets lumped data applied to a lumped hydrological model for hydrological modelling they pointed out that a single site weather generator combined with a lumped hydrological model is sufficient for accurate hydrological modelling even for a large basin müller thomy and sikorska senoner 2019 also concluded that the stochastic simulation of areally averaged versus station rainfall time series resulted in similar results and the stochastic simulation of rainfall can be conducted before or after the spatial averaging of records shrestha et al 2006 even pointed out that when conducting hydrological probability analysis conceptual and lumped models may be preferred to distributed models as lumped models are considerably faster and allow multiple runs and uncertainty analysis at low computational costs overall in our opinion the newly developed sdrm mcrem combined with a lumped hydrological model can be regarded as a good choice for hydrological modelling and flood and drought risk assessment 6 3 long term variability of sdrm mcrem although sdrm mcrem presents a good performance in simulating rainfall time series statistics rainfall event characteristics general runoff statistics and extreme runoff on the whole the long term variability i e inter annual variabilities of these statistics are underestimated for seasonal variability sdrm mcrem shows a good performance in reproducing the inter monthly variability see fig 3 because the copula simulation is conducted with monthly varying parameters underestimating the long term variability in stochastic rainfall models has been a common problem because of the stationarity assumption dubrovský et al 2004 wang and nathan 2007 chen et al 2019 and in recent years several approaches have been proposed to resolve this issue mainly including 1 higher order markov chain models for rainfall occurrence 2 mixed distributions for rainfall amounts 3 nesting type models and 4 models incorporating large scale climate indices chowdhury et al 2017 the first two methods have been tried in sdrm mcrem namely the third order markov chain and the double gamma distribution that combines small and extreme rainfall but their effectiveness in improving the underestimation of long term variability is limited chen et al 2019 used a nesting type model to couple the monthly and annual scale first order autoregressive mode ar1 model into the daily weather generator weagets and the low frequency variability was successfully preserved by adjusting the daily rainfall amount using the monthly and annual rainfall time series however this method is not suitable for sdrm mcrem because sdrm mcrem is built based on rainfall events simulation and the simulation of rainfall event characteristics is expected to deteriorate using this method especially for rainfall patterns chowdhury et al 2017 demonstrated that constructing a markov chain model using randomly sampled parameters each year from the parameter fitted distributions of rainfall occurrence probability and rainfall amount is very effective in preserving long term variability incorporating large scale climate indices such as enso and ipo for the distribution of rainfall amount is also an effective method verdon et al 2004 based on these ideas we may possibly include a time varying copula in sdrm mcrem using stochastic parameters of the marginal distributions of rainfall depth and duration or alternatively incorporating large scale climate indices into the distribution parameters of rainfall depth in order to solve the underestimation problem of the inter annual variability in future work 7 conclusions the developed sdrm mcrem in this study combined the advantages of a higher order markov chain model and a rainfall event model as it simultaneously incorporated properties of rainfall time series and rainfall events into the simulation procedure its performance in reproducing rainfall statistics and generating input for hydrological processes simulation including extreme values that are important for risk assessment was evaluated at the catchment scale for the qu river basin east china the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 for rainfall time series statistics sdrm mcrem presents a good performance in reproducing monthly average rainfall various percentiles and the inter monthly variability except for a slight overestimation of low percentiles in the monsoon season in addition the annual mean rainfall is fairly simulated but the inter annual variability is underestimated compared with the observed counterpart this is reasonable because the inter annual variability has not been specifically taken into account in sdrm mcrem for extreme rainfall sdrm mcrem shows a good performance in reproducing the r3d r5d cdd and cwd indices and even their inter annual variabilities and a fair performance in the r1d r7d and r99ptot indices and their inter annual variabilities the r90ptot and r95ptot indices are well reproduced but their inter annual variabilities are fairly reproduced 2 for rainfall event characteristics sdrm mcrem quite well reproduces the occurrence frequency of different rainfall event classes that are respectively classified for rainfall depth rainfall duration and inter event time and the latter two categories reflect the strong ability of sdrm mcrem in reproducing the distributions of wet and dry spells more importantly the temporal patterns of different rainfall types and their occurrence frequency in different rainfall event classes are also well simulated by sdrm mcrem which are all important properties for rainfall and runoff processes but generally neglected in stochastic rainfall simulation 3 with the good or fair performance in simulating rainfall statistics the observed general runoff statistics are similarly reproduced by the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j that is monthly runoff percentiles monthly mean runoff and the inter monthly variability are quite well simulated the annual mean runoff and low flows are fairly simulated but the inter annual variability of annual runoff is underestimated 4 the exceedance probabilities of high flows i e annual maximum 1 3 and 5 day mean runoff and low flows i e annual minimum 7 30 and 90 day mean runoff are also well reproduced except for a slight overestimation of annual maximum 5 day runoff at high return periods overall sdrm mcrem can not only preserve the rainfall time series statistics but also rainfall event characteristics and can be further used for hydrological modelling and risk analysis moreover the embedded marginal distributions of rainfall duration and depth and copula functions can be conveniently changed to improve the model performance and meet user requirements finally sdrm mcrem has a strong potential to assess the impacts of rainfall amounts and temporal rainfall patterns on extreme runoff under climate change

chief with the assistance of uwe haberlandt associate editor stochastic rainfall models have been widely used for hydrological modelling and climate change impact studies the accuracy of which can substantially affect the reliability of water resources planning hydraulic structure design and flood and drought risk assessment the primary objective of this study is to develop a stochastic daily rainfall model through coupling a markov chain model with a rainfall event model sdrm mcrem to simultaneously preserve the statistical properties of rainfall time series and rainfall events the newly developed model is applied to the qu river basin east china and its performance is evaluated at catchment scale results demonstrate that sdrm mcrem shows a good performance in reproducing most of the rainfall time series statistics i e rainfall percentiles average monthly and annual rainfall inter monthly rainfall variability and extreme rainfall and rainfall event characteristics i e distributions of wet and dry spells occurrence frequency of different rainfall event classes temporal rainfall patterns and their occurrence frequency in different rainfall event classes the statistics of average runoff and extreme runoff are also well preserved by using the sdrm mcrem simulations as input of hydrological modelling except that the interannual variability of rainfall and runoff is slightly underestimated moreover sdrm mcrem shows a great potential to be used for flood and drought risk assessment in reproducing the exceedance probabilities of high flows e g annual

patterns copula high and low flows 1 introduction rainfall is a key component of the water cycle and has significant impacts on water resources planning agricultural production and human society breinl et al 2017 ye et al 2018 it is always used as input to hydrological models for flood and drought risk assessment infrastructure design and water resources management particularly when the observed streamflow series are not long enough kim et al 2016 however in some cases observed rainfall records are too short or lacking and naturally provide only one single realization then the direct use of these data in agricultural and hydrological analysis may not provide the necessary reliability in flood and drought risk assessment chowdhury et al 2017 tian et al 2017 for this reason stochastic rainfall models srms have frequently been used as tools to produce long series of rainfall data with no limited length that have statistical properties comparable to observed time series chen and brissette 2014 srms are also used to produce multiple climate realizations for vulnerability assessment and even to generate rainfall series for ungauged stations through interpolating model parameters from adjacent gauged sites chen et al 2019 in addition srms have been widely used as tools to downscale projections of global and regional climate models for climate change impact studies zhuang et al 2015 therefore the accuracy of srms in reproducing rainfall statistics is significantly important over the past few decades a number of srms have been proposed many of these models were developed based on markov chain models such as wgen richardson 1981 cligen nicks and gander 1994 climgen stöckle et al 1999 and weagets chen et al 2010 which are all based on a two step simulation scheme in the first step the time series of rainfall occurrence i e a wet day or a dry day is generated by a markov chain which has become the most popular approach due to its simplicity and effectiveness in preserving wet and dry spells costa and fernandes 2017 in the second step the rainfall amount on a wet day is usually estimated through a parametric probability distribution which is employed because it can be used for extrapolation of non observed extreme values compared to non parametric or semi parametric approaches gao et al 2018 in recent years efforts were still mainly devoted to improving the performance of these models for example the impacts of the order of markov chains deni et al 2008 and types of probability distributions of rainfall amount li et al 2013 on representations of rainfall behavior have been explored by many studies evin et al 2018 chen et al 2012b srikanthan and pegram 2009 higher order markov chains such as third order and fourth order are gradually adopted to improve the dependence structure of wet and dry spells especially for long dry spells srikanthan and pegram 2009 mixed or hybrid probability distributions like the mixed exponential distribution double gamma distribution or the extended gp type iii distribution are suggested for use to reproduce the whole range of rainfall amounts including the most extreme rainfall naveau et al 2016 although the performance of markov chain models has been essentially improved through above mentioned methods some limitations still exist the distribution and dependence structure of daily rainfall amounts in a wet spell also known as temporal rainfall patterns and the relationship between total rainfall amount and the wet spell are not taken into account these are characteristics of rainfall events and are generally neglected in markov chain based stochastic rainfall models rainfall event characteristics including rainfall duration wet spell rainfall depth total rainfall amount in one rainfall event temporal rainfall pattern and their correlation structure have essential influences on runoff processes and flood modelling hettiarachchi et al 2018 mohamadi and kavian 2015 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2018 pointed out that multi day rainfall events particularly extreme rainfall events can trigger more extreme flooding due to cumulative runoff generation compared to daily extreme rainfall in this process rainfall depth and duration to some extent directly determine the generation of the flood volume and flood duration and their dependence structure has a significant effect on storm surface runoff zhang and singh 2007 córdova and rodríguez iturbe 1985 in addition the temporal rainfall patterns greatly affect the severity of flood events guan et al 2015 and wang et al 2016 both reported that storms with rainfall peaks occurring at the late stage of storms yield higher runoff peaks and induce more serious floods than those with earlier rainfall peaks hettiarachchi et al 2018 also demonstrated that the impacts of rainfall volumes and storm temporal patterns on flood risk evaluation are both significant and should be given full consideration therefore these rainfall event characteristics should also be incorporated in stochastic rainfall models rainfall event models also known as event based rainfall models are developed to reproduce rainfall event characteristics vandenberghe et al 2010 gao et al 2018 wu et al 2006 wu et al 2006 presented a monte carlo based stochastic rainstorm event model considering correlated rainstorm duration and depth as well as various temporal rainfall patterns but the procedure of the monte carlo method in simulating correlated variables was complicated vandenberghe et al 2010 constructed a stochastic design storm generator by using a simple copula function for joint simulation of rainfall depth and duration and a uniform random sampling method for generating the specific percentile curves i e 10 50 and 90 of rainfall patterns the limitation of this model is that only the specific percentiles of rainfall patterns are simulated and the randomness of rainfall patterns in reality cannot be fully reflected gao et al 2018 synthesized the strengths of these two models to construct a new stochastic rainfall event model by utilizing the copulas like vandenberghe et al 2010 to jointly simulate rainfall depth and duration and the approach of wu et al 2006 to stochastically simulate various temporal rainfall patterns and then extended the simulation scope of extreme rainfall events to all kinds of events ranging from low moderate to extreme events however the common problem of rainfall event models is that the output is a sequence of rainfall events and can only be used as input to event based hydrological models this greatly limits the application of rainfall event simulation data to the commonly used continuous hydrological models that require rainfall time series motivated by the above limitations this study aims to develop a stochastic rainfall model by coupling a markov chain model with the stochastic rainfall event model developed by gao et al 2018 named as sdrm mcrem in order to generate rainfall time series while simultaneously preserving characteristics of rainfall events more specifically a markov chain model is firstly used to generate time series of rainfall occurrence including wet and dry spells and then the rainfall event model is applied to stochastically simulate the sequence of rainfall events that correspond to the wet spells extracted from the above generated rainfall occurrence series compared to the currently existing stochastic rainfall models that just consider part of the above described rainfall simulation procedures this proposed sdrm mcrem is expected to be a comprehensive novel stochastic rainfall model that not only considers the statistical properties of rainfall time series but also takes into account the rainfall event characteristics including the correlation between rainfall depth and rainfall duration the occurrence frequency of different rainfall event classes various temporal rainfall patterns and their occurrence frequency in different rainfall event classes the sdrm mcrem is designed to preserve these important statistical properties of rainfall as much as possible the ability of sdrm mcrem to simulate rainfall time series statistics and rainfall event characteristics will be simultaneously evaluated for the first time then its suitability for hydrological modelling will be examined this paper is organized as follows the study area and data are briefly introduced in section 2 the detailed framework of sdrm mcrem its application in hydrological modelling and performance evaluation approaches are described in section 3 section 4 and 5 respectively present the evaluation results of sdrm mcrem in reproducing rainfall statistics and its reliability of being used as input of hydrological modelling followed by a discussion in section 6 and conclusions in section 7 2 study area and data in this study the development of sdrm mcrem and its application to hydrological modelling are conducted for the qu river basin which is shown in fig 1 the qu river basin 28 29 30 n 118 119 e is situated in the west of zhejiang province east china and is the southern source of qiantang river the longest and largest river in zhejiang province the qu river basin drains an area of about 5536 km2 and has an average elevation of 351 m with high areas in the south and north low in the middle high in the west and low in the east due to the large influence of the asian subtropical monsoon climate 50 of the rainfall occurs between april and july gao et al 2018 the annual average rainfall is 1800 mm the potential evapotranspiration is approximately 1200 mm and the average temperature is around 15 18 tian et al 2013 under global warming the occurrence probability of extreme climate conditions such as storms and droughts is likely to increase in the qu river basin gao et al 2020a 2020b the observed daily rainfall data from 14 rainfall stations daily minimum and maximum temperatures from three meteorological stations and daily runoff data from the quzhou hydrological station from the historical period 1970 2000 are used in this study the temperature data is provided by the national climate center of china meteorological administration and rainfall and runoff data are provided by zhejiang bureau of hydrology the whole analysis is carried out at the catchment scale and the areal average rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet are calculated by the thiessen polygon method thiessen 1911 pet at each station is estimated using the hargreaves method hargreaves and zohrab 1985 based on the minimum and maximum temperatures 3 methodology this section describes the procedure of developing the new stochastic rainfall model sdrm mcrem the flowchart of this model is shown in fig 2 and is composed of three main modules the first module generates the time series of rainfall occurrence the second module extracts rainfall events based on the definition of rainfall events and determines rainfall duration for each rainfall event the third module simulates characteristics of rainfall events including rainfall depth and temporal rainfall pattern for each rainfall event conditional on its rainfall duration according to the statistics derived from observed rainfall events in addition the conceptual hydrological model gr4j modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier perrin et al 2003 that is used to evaluate the ability of sdrm mcrem to generate hydrological modelling input and the hydrometeorological evaluation approaches are also presented in this section 3 1 stochastic rainfall model coupling markov chain model with rainfall event model sdrm mcrem 3 1 1 third order markov chain model for rainfall occurrence a markov chain model is a widespread approach for stochastic generation of rainfall occurrence that is able to reproduce the temporal persistence of wet and dry spells wilks 1998 keller et al 2015 therefore the markov chain model is also applied in this study to generate the time series of rainfall occurrence expressed as x t the probability of having a wet day on day t is given in eq 1 1 p i k i 2 i 1 1 p x t 1 x t 1 i 1 x t 2 i 2 x t k i k i 1 i 2 i k 0 o r 1 that is the transition probability of a wet day on day t depends on the states of the previous k days the probability of a dry day corresponds to p i k i 2 i 1 0 1 p i k i 2 i 1 1 a wet day is defined as a day having rainfall 0 1 mm breinl 2016 mukundan et al 2019 li et al 2013 when it is a wet day the state is expressed with the value 1 otherwise 0 the markov chain can be characterized by a transition matrix with a dimension of 2 k 1 the parameters of the transition probability matrix are estimated on a monthly basis 12 estimations throughout the calendar year based on the observed rainfall time series to determine the right order of the markov chain model for daily rainfall occurrence two commonly used criteria i e the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic were used to choose among the first order second order and third order markov chains on a monthly and annual basis detailed information about the aic and bic criteria can be found in cazacioc and cipu 2005 and schoof and pryor 2008 the corresponding results can be found in table s1 in addition since the dry spells and wet spells are the basis of rainfall event simulation in the developed sdrm mcrem we also compared the occurrence frequency of wet and dry spells with different lengths between observations and simulations for these different orders of the markov chain model in the qu river basin and the results can be found in fig s1 from table s1 and fig s1 it can be seen that the third order markov chain is the best to maintain the transition probability of rainfall occurrence both on the monthly and annual scales and can also well reproduce observed wet and dry spells thus the third order markov chain was eventually chosen in this study based on eq 1 n year time series of rainfall occurrence can be generated 3 1 2 extraction of rainfall events and determination of rainfall duration in this study independent rainfall events are defined as continuous wet days separated by one or more consecutive dry days gao et al 2018 2020a given the generated time series of rainfall occurrence simulated rainfall events can be extracted according to the definition of rainfall events and the rainfall duration i e wet spell of each simulated rainfall event can be determined similarly observed rainfall events were also derived from the observed rainfall time series in the 1971 2000 period using the definition of rainfall events subsequently the observed rainfall event characteristics i e rainfall duration the lasting period of one rainfall event rainfall depth the total amount of rainfall in one rainfall event inter event time iet also called dry spell the period between two adjacent rainfall events and temporal rainfall pattern the temporal distribution of rainfall within one rainfall event can be obtained observed rainfall event characteristics are the major foundation of building the sdrm mcrem to incorporate the simulation of different rainfall event classes and different types of temporal rainfall patterns in the construction of sdrm mcrem rainfall events are classified into different event classes based on rainfall depth rainfall duration and iet respectively the detailed classification method designed by gao et al 2020a for the qu river basin is shown in table 1 the temporal rainfall patterns are grouped into three common rainfall types based on the position of rainfall peaks which are the advanced type type a central peaked type type c and delayed type type d that represent rainfall peaks occurring at the beginning middle and end stages of rainfall events respectively subsequently the occurrence frequency of different rainfall types in different rainfall event classes can be calculated the detailed algorithm can be found in gao et al 2020a on the basis of the above described observed rainfall event characteristics the rainfall depth and temporal rainfall pattern corresponding to the rainfall duration for each simulated rainfall event can be conditionally generated in the subsequent sections 3 1 3 stochastic simulation of rainfall depth conditional on rainfall duration rainfall characteristics e g rainfall depth and rainfall duration are often dependent and can have a significant effect on hydrological design and flood management zhang and singh 2007 candela et al 2014 consequently these variables need to be jointly simulated through bivariate or even multivariate models copula functions are a popular and flexible tool to construct the joint distribution function of multiple random variables due to its advantage that no assumption is needed for the variables to be independent or having the same type of marginal distribution in this study the copula method is thus adopted to construct the joint probability distribution of rainfall duration and rainfall depth which mainly comprises two steps 1 determination of marginal distributions of rainfall duration and rainfall depth 2 determination of the dependence structure between rainfall duration and rainfall depth to incorporate the seasonal variability of rainfall event characteristics the application of the copula method is carried out on a monthly basis keeping consistent with the procedure of rainfall occurrence in section 3 1 1 nine probability distributions are examined to select the best fitted distributions for rainfall depth and rainfall duration as their marginal distributions including the gamma distribution exponential distribution lognormal distribution normal distribution double gamma distribution generalized extreme value distribution pearson type iii distribution three parameter lognormal distribution and generalized pareto distribution all parameters of these distributions are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method akaike s information criterion aic bozdogan 1987 is adopted to choose the best fitted distributions for rainfall duration and rainfall depth shown in eq 2 2 aic n log mse 2 k where n is the sample size mse represents the mean squared error between the empirical and theoretical probability and k is the number of fitted parameters the smaller the aic value is the better the distribution fits three archimedean copulas i e gumbel hougard clayton and frank are used to build the dependence structure between rainfall duration and rainfall depth as they are commonly used and proven to be efficient in hydrological applications in many studies candela et al 2014 zhang and singh 2007 rauf and zeephongsekul 2013 the two dimensional copula functions and the relationship between copula parameters and kendall s rank correlation coefficient are given in table 2 the best fitted copula function is selected using aic with the best fitted marginal distributions of observed rainfall duration and depth and their best fitted dependence structure the joint distribution of rainfall duration and depth is constructed given rainfall durations of simulated rainfall events described in section 3 1 2 the corresponding rainfall depths can be stochastically generated by the following steps i determine the month that one rainfall event occurs based on the date of the first day of this rainfall event and use the corresponding monthly marginal distribution of rainfall duration to determine the cumulative probability of rainfall duration ii stochastically generate a joint cumulative probability of rainfall duration and rainfall depth and determine the cumulative probability of rainfall depth according to the inverse function of the conditional copula function given the cumulative probability of rainfall duration iii determine rainfall depth according to the cumulative probability of rainfall depth using the corresponding monthly inverse marginal distribution of rainfall depth repeat step 1 3 until rainfall depths of all rainfall events are generated it should be noted that rainfall depths of observed rainfall events are not smaller than 0 1 mm and thus generated rainfall depths should also meet this condition for this purpose the marginal distribution of rainfall depth is fitted using the original values reduced by 0 1 mm and then 0 1 mm is added back after simulated rainfall depths are generated in this study the exponential distribution and double gamma distribution were eventually selected as the marginal distributions of rainfall duration and rainfall depth see table s2 for each month respectively for the monthly dependence structure of rainfall duration and rainfall depth table s3 shows that the frank copula is the best in most months and the gumbel copula is the second but there is no much difference between the aic values for the frank and gumbel copulas considering that the gumbel copula is asymmetric and sensitive to the upper tail and the frank copula is symmetrical in the whole distribution lee et al 2013 gumbel is more suitable according to the observed dependence structure in january august and frank is more similar to the observed dependence structure in september december see fig s2 therefore the gumbel copula was finally selected for january august and the frank copula for september december note that the double gamma distribution adopted in this study is shown in eq 3 which is different from the double gamma distribution described in räty et al 2014 and gao et al 2020a those studies artificially divide rainfall into low and high rainfall segments based on a specific percentile e g 90 or 95 quantile and fit separate distributions to each segment the double gamma distribution we adopted also represents two rainfall states but an objective automatic partitioning approach is used and it is a complete distribution rather than two separate distributions which is more suitable to be utilized in copula functions teng et al 2015 3 f p λ β 1 α 1 p α 1 1 e β 1 p γ α 1 1 λ β 2 α 2 p α 2 1 e β 2 p γ α 2 where p is rainfall duration or depth the parameter λ 0 λ 1 is the weight of the low or high rainfall states the single gamma distribution represents rainfall occurring in high or low rainfall states and α and β are the parameters of the gamma distribution 3 1 4 stochastic simulation of a rainfall type and its temporal pattern given rainfall duration and rainfall depth after determination of rainfall durations section 3 1 2 and rainfall depths section 3 1 3 for simulated rainfall events the event class that each pair of rainfall duration and rainfall depth belongs to can be further determined according to the classification shown in table 1 the subsequent step is to stochastically generate a rainfall type for each rainfall event and then generate a corresponding temporal rainfall pattern for this rainfall type to form one complete rainfall event a specific rainfall type i e type a type c or type d is randomly generated based on the occurrence probability of each rainfall type under different rainfall event classes section 3 1 2 which is expressed as eq 4 4 p k i j n k i j k 1 3 n k i j k 1 2 3 i j 1 2 3 4 where n k i j and p k i j are respectively the occurrence number and occurrence probability of the k th rainfall type for the i th depth based rainfall event class and j th duration based rainfall event class rainfall types a c and d are numbered as 1 2 and 3 respectively and the orders of the depth based and duration based rainfall event classes are numbered as 1 4 from light class to extreme class the contingency table of the occurrence probability of different rainfall types under different rainfall event classes can be seen in table s4 when the rainfall type of one rainfall event is specified the corresponding temporal rainfall pattern can be stochastically simulated according to the statistics of this rainfall type the detailed generation procedure of temporal rainfall patterns for a specific rainfall type can be found in gao et al 2018 and only a brief description is given as follows 1 firstly gather all the temporal rainfall patterns of a specific rainfall type and normalize the rainfall durations and rainfall depths to obtain dimensionless rainfall patterns 2 secondly divide all dimensionless rainfall durations into k equal intervals so that k sets of dimensionless rainfall increases corresponding to the k intervals can be obtained 3 lastly fit each set of dimensionless rainfall increase to different distributions and use the fitted appropriate distribution to stochastically simulate the rainfall increase simultaneously the correlation structure of the k sets of rainfall increases should be retained and the constrained condition that the sum of the k dimensionless rainfall increases for each rainfall pattern equals to one should be guaranteed 3 1 5 coupling time series of rainfall occurrence with rainfall events simulation with the generated results as obtained in section 3 1 2 3 1 4 the depth and duration of each rainfall event can be allocated according to its temporal pattern to form a complete simulated rainfall event subsequently the simulated complete rainfall events in chronological order are inserted to the time series of rainfall occurrence from section 3 1 1 to form the complete simulated rainfall time series at this stage the sdrm mcrem has been built in this study 1000 realizations of simulated rainfall with the same length as the observed rainfall i e 30 years are generated so that the performance of sdrm mcrem can be compared with observations 3 2 hydrological model gr4j gr4j is a four parameter lumped rainfall runoff model developed by perrin et al 2003 based on the gr3j model it is one of the simplest and most widely used hydrological models in the world and performs reasonably well in daily streamflow simulation in general van esse et al 2013 and monsoon climate watersheds in particular tian et al 2018 gao et al 2020b zhang et al 2015 the structure of gr4j is composed of a production store a routing store and two unit hydrographs zhang et al 2015 the drainage area areal average rainfall and areal average pet of the study area are required as the input data monte carlo simulation mcs with latin hypercube sampling is carried out to generate 30 000 parameter sets to calibrate the gr4j model tian et al 2013 in this study the areal average rainfall and pet in the year 1970 are used for warming up and the 30 year data of the period 1971 2000 are used for calibration and validation the split sample cross validation procedure similar to gao et al 2020a is applied i e the first 20 years 1971 1990 used for calibration and the last 10 years for validation and vice versa the last 20 years 1981 2000 for calibration and the first 10 years for validation to select the optimum parameter set using the objective function y as shown in eq 5 the y index is a comprehensive evaluation index that combines the nash sutcliffe ns coefficient eq 6 and the relative volume error rve eq 7 for model calibration and evaluation akhtar et al 2009 when the average y value of a parameter set in the two calibration periods obtains its maximum value we consider the parameter set as the optimum one 5 y ns 1 rve 6 ns 1 i 1 n q m i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 7 rve 100 i 1 n q m i q o i i 1 n q o i where i is the daily time step n is the length of the time series q o and q m are the observed and modelled runoff with the selected optimum parameter set and the inputs of the gr4j model i e the 1000 realizations of rainfall time series of 30 years simulated by sdrm mcrem and pet of 30 years calculated using observed temperature data 1000 sets of runoff time series of 30 years can be correspondingly obtained 3 3 assessment approaches of sdrm mcrem performance the meteorological performance of the proposed sdrm mcrem is assessed for two aspects statistical properties of rainfall time series and rainfall event characteristics to evaluate the ability of sdrm mcrem in simulating rainfall time series several general statistics such as the percentiles 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th and 99th of the rainfall distribution mean rainfall standard deviation and the probability of wet days are compared with the observed counterparts for each month li et al 2015 moreover some annual extreme indices including r1d r3d r5d r7d r90ptot r95ptot r99ptot cdd and cwd please see their definitions in table 3 and their inter annual variabilities are also considered to investigate whether this model can adequately reproduce extreme events these indices are recommended by the expert team on climate change detection monitoring and indices etccdmi of the climate variability and predictability clivar project alexander et al 2006 rainfall event characteristics like i the occurrence frequency of different depth based duration based and iet based rainfall event classes ii the temporal patterns of different rainfall types iii the occurrence frequency of different rainfall types in different rainfall event classes and iv the cumulative distributions of dry and wet spells are for the first time evaluated for stochastic rainfall models it is assumed that a stochastic rainfall model which preserves the time series statistics as well as the rainfall event characteristics can provide better inputs to hydrological models to reproduce flow properties that can be effectively used for flood and drought assessment froidevaux et al 2015 the suitability of sdrm mcrem in hydrological application is assessed based on the general flow statistics and low and high flow indices general statistics consisting of different percentiles of the flow distribution mean and standard deviation for each month are used to evaluate the simulated flows the exceedance probabilities of high flow indices i e annual maximum 1 3 and 5 day mean flow and low flow indices i e annual minimum 7 30 and 90 day mean flow olden and poff 2003 are further compared to determine the capacity of sdrm mcrem in simulating high and low flow hydrology pan et al 2017 to offer a consistent way to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of sdrm mcrem based on the performance metrics an evaluation approach similar to the evaluation framework proposed by bennett et al 2018 is adopted this approach categorizes the performance of sdrm mcrem for each metric into three categories good fair and poor according to the agreement between the observed metrics and the simulated metrics of the 1000 realizations generated by sdrm mcrem a good performance is defined when the observed metric falls within the 80 i e 10th 90th quantile confidence interval ci of the 1000 simulated metrics when the observed metric is outside the 80 ci but inside the minimum and maximum range of the 1000 simulated metrics a fair performance is assigned otherwise we consider the performance as poor indicating that sdrm mcrem fails to reproduce the particular statistic properly compared to the evaluation framework of bennett et al 2018 that adopted a 90 ci to evaluate the performance of models we use an 80 ci which is relatively more rigorous 4 evaluation of sdrm mcrem performance 4 1 reproduction of rainfall time series statistics fig 3 shows the observed seven rainfall percentiles 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th 99th monthly rainfall standard deviation std probability of wet days and average rainfall amount of wet days versus the generated counterparts by sdrm mcrem on monthly scales in the qu river basin generally sdrm mcrem presents a good performance for the majority of these time series statistics indicating that the observed metric is well reproduced by this model with values falling within the 80 ci particularly for the 95th and 99th rainfall percentiles monthly mean rainfall and the probability and mean of wet days this sdrm mcrem performs quite well illustrated by the medians of the simulated metrics which are very close to the observed metrics and the small uncertainty ranges however in the monsoon season mainly april june this model displays a fair performance for the 75th and 90th rainfall percentiles and the standard deviation of monthly rainfall i e inter monthly variability with the 80 ci slightly lower than the observations and a fair or poor performance for the low percentiles 10th and 25th with some overestimation in addition the uncertainty of the simulated low rainfall percentiles from 10th to 50th in the monsoon season are always larger than for the other months the behavior of sdrm mcrem in simulating annual rainfall and extreme indicators and their corresponding inter annual variabilities i e standard deviation compared to those of observations is shown in table 3 from table 3 it can be observed that sdrm mcrem shows a fair performance in simulating average annual rainfall but a poor performance for its inter annual variability with some underestimation for extreme statistical indicators sdrm mcrem reproduces the r3d r5d cdd and cwd values very well even their inter annual variabilities as there are no obvious differences between the observations and the simulated medians the r1d r7d r99ptot and their variabilities are fairly reproduced with the mean and variability of r1d and mean r99ptot being slightly overestimated but the mean r7d and the inter annual variability of r7d and p99ptot being slightly underestimated in addition sdrm mcrem presents a good performance in reproducing mean values of r90ptot and r95ptot but a fair performance in their variabilities overall sdrm mcrem in most cases can very well i e good performance or reasonably well i e fair performance reproduce the time series statistics particularly for the monthly extreme rainfall and the long duration annual rainfall data that are essential for hydrological analysis 4 2 reproduction of rainfall event characteristics the total number of rainfall events and the occurrence frequency of different duration based and iet based rainfall event classes are quite well reproduced by sdrm mcrem compared to the observed counterparts see fig 4 as shown by the simulated medians almost overlapping the observations and the uncertainty of the 1000 realizations being small a similarly good performance can be seen in fig 5 showing the cumulative probability distributions of wet and dry spells these good performances are all due to the adoption of the third order markov chain model that can provide a more accurate representation of wet and dry spells however concerning the occurrence frequency of depth based rainfall event classes sdrm mcrem shows a good performance for heavy and extreme events that are relatively more important for flood management and a poor performance for light and moderate rainfall events the frequency of light rainfall events is underestimated while that of moderate events is overestimated and this seems to be caused by the overestimation of rainfall in the low percentiles such as 10th and 25th that can be seen in fig 3 fig 6 displays the uncertainty of the mass curves of the simulated three rainfall types advanced type a central peaked type c and delayed type d and the observed counterparts the mass curves refer to the cumulative rainfall temporal patterns meaning that the y axis and x axis represent the cumulative dimensionless rainfall depth and duration respectively and the total rainfall duration is equally divided into three equal intervals as in gao et al 2020a note that in this part of analysis only rainfall events with a duration of three or more days are considered when analyzing rainfall temporal patterns because it is regarded as meaningless to analyze the temporal patterns of 1 day and 2 day rainfall events gao et al 2020a the occurrence frequency of different depth based rainfall event classes that are classified based on rainfall events with a duration of three or more days and the occurrence frequency of the three rainfall types in these different event classes are presented in fig 7 for light rainfall events sdrm mcrem shows a large uncertainty in simulating rainfall patterns of the three rainfall types this is not surprising as the occurrence frequency of light rainfall events is the smallest fig 7 a it is also expected that the performance of sdrm mcrem is relatively poor in simulating the occurrence frequency of different rainfall types for light rainfall events and the uncertainty is relatively large fig 7 b for other rainfall events the temporal rainfall patterns and occurrence frequency of the three rainfall types are well reproduced particularly for heavy and extreme rainfall events in which the related occurrence frequency is quite well reproduced furthermore the simulated uncertainty is directly associated with the occurrence frequency of different rainfall event classes when the occurrence frequency of one rainfall event class is small the uncertainty of temporal patterns of different rainfall types in this rainfall event class is relatively large and vice versa overall the rainfall event characteristics are mostly well reproduced this can be expected because sdrm mcrem was developed with these properties being taken into account 5 application of sdrm mcrem to hydrological modelling 5 1 gr4j model calibration and validation results employing the split sample cross validation method described in section 3 2 the optimum parameter set was selected in the first round the objective function y ns and rve values in the calibration 1971 1990 and validation 1991 2000 periods are 0 90 0 91 and 0 54 and 0 92 0 93 and 1 02 respectively in the second round the corresponding results in the calibration 1981 2000 and validation 1971 1980 are 0 93 0 94 and 1 06 and 0 89 0 91 and 3 15 respectively with the chosen optimum parameter set the simulated runoff versus the observed runoff in the whole historical period is shown in fig 8 including the worst and best performance year it can be seen that the major pattern of the hydrograph and most high and low flows are well captured with overall values of y and ns respectively being 0 92 and 0 93 and rve being smaller than 1 72 which is very satisfying the values of y in each year ranges from 0 66 to 0 96 ns from 0 69 to 0 97 and rve from 14 8 to 2 6 although some peaks are underestimated in the worst performance year it is still acceptable compared to other studies zhang et al 2014 gao et al 2019 5 2 reproduction of general runoff statistics in fig 9 the simulated percentiles monthly mean and inter monthly variability standard deviation of runoff are compared to the observed counterparts to demonstrate the performance of sdrm mcrem as input for hydrological modelling the black red and blue lines with dots correspond to the observed runoff the simulated runoff using observed rainfall data and the median of simulated runoff using sdrm mcrem generated rainfall data respectively thus the bias between the red and black lines the blue and red lines and the blue and black lines are respectively caused by gr4j sdrm mcrem and the combination of gr4j and sdrm mcrem in most cases the red and black lines fall within the 80 ci of simulated runoff using sdrm mcrem generated data and are very close to the blue lines indicating that the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j successfully reproduced the observed runoff statistics for each calendar month and performed very well for these runoff properties even taking into account the hydrological modelling error of gr4j the low percentiles 10th and 25th of runoff in may august are fairly simulated with slight overestimation when comparing the medians of sdrm mcrem simulations with the observations this can be attributed to sdrm mcrem rainfall overestimation in april june see fig 3 and gr4j overestimation in all these months in which the gr4j model plays a major role however the high percentiles 90th and 95th of runoff in june are underestimated to some extent mainly due to the slight underestimation of simulated large rainfall by sdrm mcrem when comparing the medians of sdrm mcrem simulations with the observations see fig 3 even so the observed runoff can still be covered in the range of the simulated minimum and maximum runoff and the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j shows a fair performance in these situations furthermore the monthly mean 99th percentile and inter monthly variability of runoff are also quite well reproduced except slight underestimation of 99th percentile runoff and inter monthly variability in july by the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j which is similar to that of the simulated rainfall at the annual scale the capability of the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j in reproducing annual mean runoff and its inter annual variability and low flow and baseflow is shown in table 4 as expected the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j shows a fair performance in simulating these annual runoff values even though there is a slight underestimation of annual mean runoff and overestimation of low flow and baseflow and a relative poor performance in the inter annual variability of annual runoff same as the inter annual variability of rainfall the inter annual variability of runoff is moderately underestimated as well and the extent of underestimation is a bit larger 5 3 reproduction of high and low flows the frequency distributions of high and low flows simulated using sdrm mcrem generated data are compared to the observed counterparts and the simulated ones obtained using observed data fig 10 in order to provide an overview of sdrm mcrem s capacity of being used for flood and drought assessment for high flows the observed and simulated annual maximum 1 day and 3 day mean runoff are well reproduced particularly for the annual maximum 1 day runoff as illustrated by nearly no differences between the three colored points and all observations falling within the 80 ci of simulations using sdrm mcrem generated data however the annual maximum 5 day runoff at large return periods i e exceedance probability between 6 and 30 is fairly reproduced by sdrm mcrem simulations with relatively large underestimation this is mainly caused by the underestimated 90th and 95th percentile runoff in fig 9 because the multiple day runoff would contain these underestimated large runoffs the uncertainty of simulated high flows using sdrm mcrem generated data becomes larger with increasing return period the gr4j model performs very well in simulating high flows and results in very small differences between observations and simulations obtained from observed data for low flows the annual minimum 7 day mean flow is well simulated by the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j even though it is slightly underestimated when the exceedance probability is between 30 and 65 however if we look at the annual minimum 30 day and 90 day mean runoff we note that the low flows are consistently underestimated and this is more pronounced for the longer duration low runoff this is mainly due to gr4j rather than sdrm mcrem because the low flows simulated using observed data and sdrm mcrem data are almost identical the smaller the runoff is the smaller the uncertainty of sdrm mcrem and gr4j jointly simulated low flows which is similar to that of high flows overall the observed high and low flows are all located between the maximum and minimum of the sdrm mcrem and gr4j joint simulations suggesting that the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j has a fair performance in high and low flow simulations 6 discussion 6 1 comparison with another single site stochastic rainfall model the performance of sdrm mcrem in simulating general rainfall statistics and extreme rainfall at the monthly and annual scales and its potential use for hydrological applications was compared to that of weagets weagets is a well known and widely used weather generator developed by chen et al 2012a based on a markov chain model and has shown a better performance in simulating rainfall than the typical weather generators wgen and cligen chen et al 2012b 2010 in the weagets simulation the same third order markov chain procedure as in sdrm mcrem was adopted to generate rainfall occurrence time series and then the gamma distribution was used to produce rainfall amounts for each wet day the results simulated by weagets are presented in figs s3 s6 and tables s5 s6 in the supplementary material the results in fig s3 demonstrate that weagets presents a similar performance with sdrm mcrem in reproducing the general rainfall statistics but with a bit smaller uncertainty and it performs slightly better in terms of annual mean rainfall and annual maximum 1 day rainfall table s5 however weagets shows a worse performance in reproducing other rainfall extremes particularly for the annual maximum consecutive multiple day rainfall like 3 5 and 7 day rainfall and the inter annual variability of all the extreme rainfall indices in addition weagets also performs worse than sdrm mcrem in rainfall event characteristics fig s4 general runoff statistics fig s5 and extreme runoff table s6 which further results in a poor reproduction of the frequency distributions of high flows e g annual maximum 3 day and 5 day mean runoff and low flows annual minimum 7 day 30 day and 90 day mean runoff in fig s6 that are essential for flood and drought risk assessment the above phenomena are mainly because weagets considers each single wet day as an independent event and does not take the correlation of rainfall amounts in consecutive wet days i e wet spell or rainfall duration into account moreover weagets fails to reproduce the occurrence frequency of different rainfall patterns in different rainfall event classes in the whole time series see fig s4 because these rainfall event characteristics are not taken into account the unexpected phenomenon that a good reproduction of general rainfall statistics leads to a poor performance in simulating runoff statistics fig s5 in weagets could be largely attributed to the neglection of influences of temporal rainfall patterns on runoff hettiarachchi et al 2018 this indicates the great necessity of incorporating rainfall temporal patterns and their occurrence frequency in stochastic rainfall models compared to weagets sdrm mcrem proposed in this study overcomes the above weaknesses by adopting a copula function to preserve the relationship of rainfall depth and rainfall duration and simultaneously coupling different temporal rainfall patterns and their corresponding occurrence frequency into rainfall events simulation sdrm mcrem performs well not only in reproducing rainfall time series properties but also in rainfall event characteristics and has strengths in simulating extreme high and low flows 6 2 comparison with a multi site stochastic rainfall model with the coupled application of stochastic rainfall models or weather generators with hydrological models in hydrological impact assessment the influence of rainfall input from a stochastic rainfall model on hydrological model output has also been concerned in recent years in view of the lumped hydrological model gr4j adopted in this study we mainly focus on comparing results of a lumped hydrological model driven by rainfall time series from single site and multi site stochastic rainfall models this issue has also been posed and investigated by breinl 2016 to achieve this purpose the simulated results in this study using the single site sdrm mcrem were compared to those of the multi site weather generator mulgets where the synthetic rainfall was firstly simulated at multiple sites and subsequently lumped mulgets is an extended version of weagets which generates rainfall occurrence at multiple sites using a first order markov chain and rainfall amounts using the gamma distribution on a monthly scale chen et al 2014 the simulated results of mulgets are shown in figs s7 s15 and tables s7 s8 from figs s7 s8 it can be seen that the simulated inter site correlations i e the pearson correlation coefficient and spearman rank correlation coefficient and also the spatial correlograms of the 14 rainfall sites in the qu river basin are almost the same as the observed ones this indicates that the spatial correlation is very well maintained by mulgets however after averaging at the basin scale the mulgets simulations present worse performances than sdrm mcrem and even worse than weagets for both meteorological and hydrological modelling aspects although mulgets can generally reproduce rainfall time series statistics and show smaller uncertainty it cannot well retain the annual distribution of rainfall particularly during march june fig s9 the rainfall extremes and the inter annual variability are largely underestimated table s7 in addition except different rainfall patterns mulgets also cannot well reproduce the important rainfall event characteristics particularly the distributions of wet and dry spells figs s10 s13 furthermore the poor performance of mulgets in representing rainfall characteristics leads to a poor reproduction of general runoff statistics and high and low flows figs s14 s15 and table s8 the extreme runoff in june the inter annual variability of runoff and high flows are heavily underestimated with mulgets simulations while the lows are overestimated there are three possible reasons for the poor hydrometeorological performance of mulgets firstly the lower order markov chain used in mulgets cannot well reproduce the wet and dry spells compared to the higher order markov chain adopted in sdrm mcrem secondly the right skewed single gamma distribution cannot well simulate upper tailed extreme rainfall serinaldi and kilsby 2014 which results in the worse reproduction of rainfall characteristics at each station and further extends to the areally averaged rainfall characteristics particularly for extreme rainfall thirdly the lumped hydrological model cannot fully reflect the advantage of mulgets i e the spatial rainfall characteristics the findings in this study support the conclusions of some previous studies for example chen et al 2016 found that there are no obvious differences between the performance of mulgets applied to a distributed hydrological model and that of weagets lumped data applied to a lumped hydrological model for hydrological modelling they pointed out that a single site weather generator combined with a lumped hydrological model is sufficient for accurate hydrological modelling even for a large basin müller thomy and sikorska senoner 2019 also concluded that the stochastic simulation of areally averaged versus station rainfall time series resulted in similar results and the stochastic simulation of rainfall can be conducted before or after the spatial averaging of records shrestha et al 2006 even pointed out that when conducting hydrological probability analysis conceptual and lumped models may be preferred to distributed models as lumped models are considerably faster and allow multiple runs and uncertainty analysis at low computational costs overall in our opinion the newly developed sdrm mcrem combined with a lumped hydrological model can be regarded as a good choice for hydrological modelling and flood and drought risk assessment 6 3 long term variability of sdrm mcrem although sdrm mcrem presents a good performance in simulating rainfall time series statistics rainfall event characteristics general runoff statistics and extreme runoff on the whole the long term variability i e inter annual variabilities of these statistics are underestimated for seasonal variability sdrm mcrem shows a good performance in reproducing the inter monthly variability see fig 3 because the copula simulation is conducted with monthly varying parameters underestimating the long term variability in stochastic rainfall models has been a common problem because of the stationarity assumption dubrovský et al 2004 wang and nathan 2007 chen et al 2019 and in recent years several approaches have been proposed to resolve this issue mainly including 1 higher order markov chain models for rainfall occurrence 2 mixed distributions for rainfall amounts 3 nesting type models and 4 models incorporating large scale climate indices chowdhury et al 2017 the first two methods have been tried in sdrm mcrem namely the third order markov chain and the double gamma distribution that combines small and extreme rainfall but their effectiveness in improving the underestimation of long term variability is limited chen et al 2019 used a nesting type model to couple the monthly and annual scale first order autoregressive mode ar1 model into the daily weather generator weagets and the low frequency variability was successfully preserved by adjusting the daily rainfall amount using the monthly and annual rainfall time series however this method is not suitable for sdrm mcrem because sdrm mcrem is built based on rainfall events simulation and the simulation of rainfall event characteristics is expected to deteriorate using this method especially for rainfall patterns chowdhury et al 2017 demonstrated that constructing a markov chain model using randomly sampled parameters each year from the parameter fitted distributions of rainfall occurrence probability and rainfall amount is very effective in preserving long term variability incorporating large scale climate indices such as enso and ipo for the distribution of rainfall amount is also an effective method verdon et al 2004 based on these ideas we may possibly include a time varying copula in sdrm mcrem using stochastic parameters of the marginal distributions of rainfall depth and duration or alternatively incorporating large scale climate indices into the distribution parameters of rainfall depth in order to solve the underestimation problem of the inter annual variability in future work 7 conclusions the developed sdrm mcrem in this study combined the advantages of a higher order markov chain model and a rainfall event model as it simultaneously incorporated properties of rainfall time series and rainfall events into the simulation procedure its performance in reproducing rainfall statistics and generating input for hydrological processes simulation including extreme values that are important for risk assessment was evaluated at the catchment scale for the qu river basin east china the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 for rainfall time series statistics sdrm mcrem presents a good performance in reproducing monthly average rainfall various percentiles and the inter monthly variability except for a slight overestimation of low percentiles in the monsoon season in addition the annual mean rainfall is fairly simulated but the inter annual variability is underestimated compared with the observed counterpart this is reasonable because the inter annual variability has not been specifically taken into account in sdrm mcrem for extreme rainfall sdrm mcrem shows a good performance in reproducing the r3d r5d cdd and cwd indices and even their inter annual variabilities and a fair performance in the r1d r7d and r99ptot indices and their inter annual variabilities the r90ptot and r95ptot indices are well reproduced but their inter annual variabilities are fairly reproduced 2 for rainfall event characteristics sdrm mcrem quite well reproduces the occurrence frequency of different rainfall event classes that are respectively classified for rainfall depth rainfall duration and inter event time and the latter two categories reflect the strong ability of sdrm mcrem in reproducing the distributions of wet and dry spells more importantly the temporal patterns of different rainfall types and their occurrence frequency in different rainfall event classes are also well simulated by sdrm mcrem which are all important properties for rainfall and runoff processes but generally neglected in stochastic rainfall simulation 3 with the good or fair performance in simulating rainfall statistics the observed general runoff statistics are similarly reproduced by the combination of sdrm mcrem and gr4j that is monthly runoff percentiles monthly mean runoff and the inter monthly variability are quite well simulated the annual mean runoff and low flows are fairly simulated but the inter annual variability of annual runoff is underestimated 4 the exceedance probabilities of high flows i e annual maximum 1 3 and 5 day mean runoff and low flows i e annual minimum 7 30 and 90 day mean runoff are also well reproduced except for a slight overestimation of annual maximum 5 day runoff at high return periods overall sdrm mcrem can not only preserve the rainfall time series statistics but also rainfall event characteristics and can be further used for hydrological modelling and risk analysis moreover the embedded marginal distributions of rainfall duration and depth and copula functions can be conveniently changed to improve the model performance and meet user requirements finally sdrm mcrem has a strong potential to assess the impacts of rainfall amounts and temporal rainfall patterns on extreme runoff under climate change

5279,delineating the hyporheic zone where groundwater and surface water mix is of great importance for managing groundwater contamination introduced through surface water a prior study proposed a method for estimating the hyporheic zone s depth using heat transfer analysis this approach s high sensitivity compared with conventional tracer tests made it more appropriate for delineate the hyporheic zone depth however that method treated all related parameters as deterministic values while real world parameters are not fixed but vary widely around their means in this study we improved on this approach by converting it into a probabilistic method in which the principal parameters in the governing equation were considered random values and were sampled using monte carlo simulation we conducted repeated heat transfer analyses for each case and collected the resulting hyporheic zone depths as probabilistic distributions this allowed us to calculate the distribution of the hyporheic zone and its mean value more accurately and time efficiently keywords hyporheic zone depth delineation heat transfer analysis probabilistic method monte carlo simulation 1 introduction stream water and groundwater interact through mixing and exchange in the hyporheic zone where large chemical and hydraulic gradients can improve or degrade water quality brunke gonser 1997 conant 2004 findlay 1995 greenberg et al 2002 kim et al 2009 krause et al 2007 2011 smith 2004 soulsby et al 2005 trauth and fleckenstein 2017 the widespread contamination of surface water frequently results in the overloading of groundwater with organic matter and nutritive substances boyer et al 2000 kim and lee 2019 krause et al 2009 2013 schiff et al 1990 sebestyen et al 2008 as remediating such contaminated groundwater requires significant energy and cost in part due to the complexity and diversity of underground media increasing attention is being focused on more efficient and cost effective methods fleckenstein et al 2010 hynes 1960 johnson et al 1997 parker et al 2000 townsend et al 1997 the hyporheic zone in particular can be utilized as a sensitive indicator for studying changes in the water environment in response to climate change kim and lee 2018 although the hyporheic zone serves as a specific area connecting adjacent groundwater and stream water systems its feedback to climate changes has rarely been investigated knowledge on this however would provide theoretical support relevant to water resource management and the restoration of polluted water in a changing climate the hyporheic zone refers to the area where groundwater and surface water interchange and mix the unique hydraulic properties of this zone play vital roles in the reduction of pollutants due to indigenous microbes and the provision of ecological functions serving as a diverse wildlife habitat in water ecosystems kim et al 2018a for example natural attenuation by controlling environmental factors has received much attention babiker et al 2004 beller et al 2004 fustec et al 1991 harman et al 1996 hyun et al 2011 kim et al 2013 mengis et al 1999 shomar et al 2008 wakida and lerner 2005 existing methods for assessing the hyporheic zone include the installation of seepage meters langhoff et al 2001 murdoch kelly 2003 rosenberry morin 2004 rosenberry 2008 taniguchi fukou 1993 or piezometers carver 2001 hatch et al 2006a b kim et al 2009 kim et al 2013 kim et al 2018a surridge et al 2005 gauging differential discharge essaid et al 2008 lowry et al 2007 and trace injection tests bencala et al 1990 castro hornberger 1991 hoehn cirpka 2006 triska et al 1993 errors can be introduced by improper seepage meter installation or deployment rosenberry pitlick 2009 while piezometer installation requires intensive labor and provides limited point measurements hatch et al 2006a b rosenberry et al 2012 differential discharge gauging is also labor intensive and difficult when flows are low or turbulent lastly tracer injection tests cannot distinguish subsurface flow from loss and may be affected by tracer adsorption chen et al 2007 isiorho et al 2005 kim et al 2013 ruehl et al 2006 but are nevertheless widely used for hyporheic zone delineation triska et al 1993 compared with such high cost physical methods or chemical injection methods that usually cause secondary contamination estimating the depth of the contaminated region based on temperature changes in the hyporheic zone should be much more cost effective anderson 2005 keery et al 2007a b stonestrom and constantz 2003 given that streambed temperature is influenced by hyporheic flux constantz et al 1994 constantz 2008 constantz thomas 1996 hyun et al 2011 kim et al 2011 lapham 1989 stonestrom and constantz 2004 taniguchi et al 2003 a method has been proposed for estimating the depth of the hyporheic zone based on analyzing heat transfer through the streambed considering conduction advection and dispersion anderson 2005 constantz 2008 kim et al 2018b silliman and booth 1993 in this approach the calculated temperature distribution that shows the best fit to a measured temperature distribution is determined from heat transfer analysis by changing the hyporheic flux this has a clear advantage over previous methods as it requires only the measurement of a single parameter temperature distribution from which further determinations are directly made using conduction advection dispersion analysis cad analysis previous assessments of this method have considered the parameters of the governing equation to be deterministic values in nature however these material properties variable rather than fixed supplementary tables s1 s8 list parameter values previously reported in the literature these vary widely depending on research conditions in this study we extended the previous deterministic method to a probabilistic approach in which the principal parameters in the governing equation are treated as random values and sampled using monte carlo simulations by this we aim to propose the best fit probability distribution function for the hyporheic zone depth a simple and frequent repetition of the previous deterministic calculation would make a probabilistic calculation impractical due to the long calculation time to improve this we have adopted a new minimum search algorithm in the analysis based on this algorithm we conducted repeated heat transfer analyses drastically reducing the time consumed for each set of parameter combinations to produce probabilistic distributions of the hyporheic zone depth moreover we attempted to describe and delineate the hyporheic zone by expressing its depth in terms of probability distribution functions this approach provides insights into the spatial distribution of the hyporheic zone which would be impossible when utilizing the previous deterministic approach 2 modeling of hyporheic zone depth and the governing equation heat transfer in the streambed can be described by the following differential equation for one dimensional conduction advection dispersion cad carslaw and jaeger 1959 goto et al 2005 kim et al 2018b kim et al 2019 stallman 1965 1 ρ c t t λ e 2 t z 2 n ρ f c f ν f t z where ρ is grain density kg m3 c is soil specific heat capacity j k c t is temperature c λ e is λ 0 ρ c β ν f effective

s the hyporheic flux and the corresponding hyporheic zone depth can be determined by the following step by step procedures see fig 1 1 determination of the field temperature distribution collected over several depths and time periods 2 extraction of an initial condition and two boundary conditions from field measurements the first temperatures along the depth are set to be the initial condition the top and bottom temperatures during the field work are the boundary conditions 3 repeated cad analysis and calculation of the sum of squares error between the measured and the calculated temperature profiles 4 determination of the hyporheic zone depth by minimizing the sum of squares error with a change in the hyporheic flux hyporheic flux consists of two parameters size and shape the former is composed of a set of hyporheic zone depths and their magnitudes in the vertical direction although the latter has seldom been reported in the literature it is reasonable for a hyporheic flux to have a shape in which its magnitude decreases with increasing depth fig 2 kim et al 2014 defined hyporheic flux shapes including spandrel triangle cosine and quarter ellipse fig 3 the magnitude of hyporheic flux is comprised of the maximum flux velocity at the streambed level vf max and the hyporheic zone depth dh 3 sensitivity analysis we assessed the sensitivity of parameters used in the governing equation to determine their relative importance based on the factors defined in fig 4 some of the factors may not have crucial impacts but we first examined the degree of influence of each factor the means for each parameter table 1 were used for the deterministic cad analysis the parameters varied between 85 and 115 around their means the results of the hyporheic zone depth sensitivity analysis are shown in table 2 and fig 5 the sensitivity analysis only considered the quarter elliptical hyporheic flux shape from fig 3 with factors 1 3 and 4 having major effects on the hyporheic zone depth as a reference the optimum hyporheic zone depth was updated from 9 2 cm in kim et al 2014 to 9 6 cm here due to finer division of the hyporheic flux shape if the streambed heat capacity factor 1 deviated by 10 from a reference value the optimum depth changed to 6 8 cm 4 improvement of minimum ssd search algorithm before engaging in the probabilistic approach the calculation time required for solving the finite element equations needs be reduced because the cad analysis requires repeated alternation of the magnitude and depth of the hyporheic flux shape fig 6 shows an idealized ssd value surface used for finding the optimal hyporheic flux shape with minimum error i e the sum of the squared difference if the search region is divided into nx and ny divisions we need nx ny calculations to determine the shape of minimum ssd location the green point in fig 6 thus extensive calculations and thus time consuming numerical analyses are required for the probabilistic approach instead we compared the ssds of adjacent grid points and moved the grid set to the minimum gradient direction saving significant time due to fewer calculations fig 7 for example the calculation time for the reference case sensitivity analysis described previously was reduced from 1 h to 1 min 5 probabilistic approach for the probabilistic approach the main parameters were selected based on the sensitivity analysis grain density x1 specific heat capacity x2 grain thermal conductivity x3 and porosity x4 the latin hypercube sampling method was adopted for the small number of calculations with the well distributed sample combination of x1 x2 x3 and x4 in the range between 0 and 1 well distributed parameter values were acquired by mapping these values to physical parameters fig 8 fig 9 shows the histograms of results from the repeated cad analyses along with the fitting of the following four probability distributions models to the data series 1 the histogram has an almost symmetrical shape thus we first fit a normal distribution to the result data 2 the physical quantity hyporheic zone depth in this case has a positive depth value thus we fit a lognormal distribution to the result data 3 careful examination of the histogram shows that it has a higher frequency for the left side and a lower frequency for the right side moreover the histogram looks like it may have a longer tail on the right side thus we chose a skew distribution as the fit firstly the extreme value type 1 distribution also known as the gumbel distribution and secondly a more general type of skew distribution i e generalized extreme value distribution were selected 2 f 1 x 1 2 π σ 2 e x μ 2 2 σ 2 where f 1 is the probability density of the normal distribution μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation 3 f 2 x 1 x 1 σ 2 π e l n x μ 2 2 σ 2 where f 2 is the probability density of the lognormal distribution μ is the mean of the variable s natural logarithm and σ is the standard deviation of the variable s natural logarithm 4 f 3 x 1 β e z e z w h e r e z x μ β where f 3 is the probability density of the gumbel distribution μ is the location parameter and β is the scale parameter 0 and 5 f 4 x 1 σ t x ξ 1 e t x where x 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ i f ξ 0 e x μ σ i f ξ 0 f 4 is the probability density of the generalized extreme value distribution μ is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter 0 and ξ is the shape parameter parametric values resulting in the best fit models for each types of probability distributions are shown in figs 9 and 10 with test results given in table 3 all probability density models except the log normal distribution were proper for this ideal case as the aim of this study is to identify the probability distribution of the hyporheic zone depth a selection of reasonable and best fit distributions is required out of the possible distributions in table 3 the normal distribution was most suitable with the largest p value and the smallest k s test statistics from the deterministic estimation of the hyporheic zone depth at 9 6 cm the probabilistic approach adopted in this paper extends our knowledge of its distribution along the depth of the streambed with only a small variability of the parameters appearing in the governing equation e g a 5 coefficient of variation for the normal distributions as shown in fig 8 the resulting hyporheic zone depth can be in a wide range from 2 to 25 cm for this case see fig 9 this implies that the depth of the hyporheic zone is highly variable and may be better described in a probabilistic manner 6 conclusions in this study we tested four probabilistic distributions normal lognormal gumbel and generalized extreme value distributions to estimate the depth of the hyporheic zone using heat transfer analysis building on a previously developed deterministic approach by accounting for the natural scatter of physical properties our method uses repeated cad analysis with a combination of parameters generated from latin hypercube sampling modifying the minimum search algorithm drastically reduced the required calculation time making the method far more time efficient from a sensitivity analysis for parameters used in the governing equation main parameters having a significant influence on the hyporheic zone depth were found to be grain density soil specific heat capacity grain thermal conductivity and porosity probabilistic delineation method let us know how wide the hyporheic zone depths spreads along the depth giving its scattering feature from a fixed value of 9 6 cm to a range of 2 cm to 25 cm with proper types of probability distribution of normal gumbel and generalized extreme value distributions for the exemplary case the probability method ventured in this study could be a sophisticated way to delineate the hyporheic zone depth credit authorship contribution statement heejung kim conceptualization methodology data curation formal analysis investigation

5279,delineating the hyporheic zone where groundwater and surface water mix is of great importance for managing groundwater contamination introduced through surface water a prior study proposed a method for estimating the hyporheic zone s depth using heat transfer analysis this approach s high sensitivity compared with conventional tracer tests made it more appropriate for delineate the hyporheic zone depth however that method treated all related parameters as deterministic values while real world parameters are not fixed but vary widely around their means in this study we improved on this approach by converting it into a probabilistic method in which the principal parameters in the governing equation were considered random values and were sampled using monte carlo simulation we conducted repeated heat transfer analyses for each case and collected the resulting hyporheic zone depths as probabilistic distributions this allowed us to calculate the distribution of the hyporheic zone and its mean value more accurately and time efficiently keywords hyporheic zone depth delineation heat transfer analysis probabilistic method monte carlo simulation 1 introduction stream water and groundwater interact through mixing and exchange in the hyporheic zone where large chemical and hydraulic gradients can improve or degrade water quality brunke gonser 1997 conant 2004 findlay 1995

overloading of groundwater with organic matter and nutritive substances boyer et al 2000 kim and lee 2019 krause et al 2009 2013 schiff et al 1990 sebestyen et al 2008 as remediating such contaminated groundwater requires significant energy and cost in part due to the complexity and diversity of underground media increasing attention is being focused on more efficient and cost effective methods fleckenstein et al 2010 hynes 1960 johnson et al 1997 parker et al 2000 townsend et al 1997 the hyporheic zone in particular can be utilized as a sensitive indicator for studying changes in the water environment in response to climate change kim and lee 2018 although the hyporheic zone serves as a specific area connecting adjacent groundwater and stream water systems its feedback to climate changes has rarely been investigated knowledge on this however would provide theoretical support relevant to water resource management and the restoration of polluted water in a changing climate the hyporheic zone refers to the area where groundwater and surface water interchange and mix the unique hydraulic properties of this zone play vital roles in the reduction of pollutants due to indigenous microbes and the provision of ecological functions serving as a diverse wildlife habitat in water ecosystems kim et al 2018a for example natural attenuation by controlling environmental factors has

al 1990 castro hornberger 1991 hoehn cirpka 2006 triska et al 1993 errors can be introduced by improper seepage meter installation or deployment rosenberry pitlick 2009 while piezometer installation requires intensive labor and provides limited point measurements hatch et al 2006a b rosenberry et al 2012 differential discharge gauging is also labor intensive and difficult when flows are low or turbulent lastly tracer injection tests cannot distinguish subsurface flow from loss and may be affected by tracer adsorption chen et al 2007 isiorho et al 2005 kim et al 2013 ruehl et al 2006 but are nevertheless widely used for hyporheic zone delineation triska et al 1993 compared with such high cost physical methods or chemical injection methods that usually cause secondary contamination estimating the depth of the contaminated region based on temperature changes in the hyporheic zone should be much more cost effective anderson 2005 keery et al 2007a b stonestrom and constantz 2003 given that streambed temperature is influenced by hyporheic flux constantz et al 1994 constantz 2008 constantz thomas 1996 hyun et al 2011 kim et al 2011 lapham 1989 stonestrom and constantz 2004 taniguchi et al 2003 a method has been proposed for estimating the depth of the hyporheic zone based on analyzing heat transfer through the streambed considering conduction advection and dispersion anderson 2005 constantz 2008 kim et al 2018b silliman and booth 1993 in this approach the calculated temperature distribution that shows the best fit to a measured temperature distribution is determined from heat transfer analysis by changing the hyporheic flux this has a clear advantage over previous methods as it requires only the measurement of a single parameter temperature distribution from which further determinations are directly made using conduction advection dispersion analysis cad analysis previous assessments of this method have considered the parameters of the governing equation to be deterministic values in nature however these material properties variable rather than fixed supplementary tables s1 s8 list parameter values previously reported in the literature these vary widely depending on research conditions in this study we extended the previous deterministic method to a probabilistic approach in which the principal parameters in the governing equation are treated as random values and sampled using monte carlo simulations by this we aim to propose the best fit probability distribution function for the hyporheic zone depth a simple and frequent repetition of the previous deterministic calculation would make a probabilistic calculation impractical due to the long calculation time to improve this we have adopted a new minimum search algorithm in the analysis based on this algorithm we conducted repeated heat transfer analyses drastically reducing the time consumed for each set of parameter combinations to produce probabilistic distributions of the hyporheic zone depth moreover we attempted to describe and delineate the hyporheic zone by expressing its depth in terms of probability distribution functions this approach provides insights into the spatial distribution of the hyporheic zone which would be impossible when utilizing the previous deterministic approach 2 modeling of hyporheic zone depth and the governing equation heat transfer in the streambed can be described by the following differential equation for one dimensional conduction advection dispersion cad carslaw and jaeger 1959 goto et al 2005 kim et al 2018b kim et al 2019 stallman 1965 1 ρ c t t λ e 2 t z 2 n ρ f c f ν f t z where ρ is grain density kg m3 c is soil specific heat capacity j k c t is temperature c λ e is λ 0 ρ c β ν f effective

s the hyporheic flux and the corresponding hyporheic zone depth can be determined by the following step by step procedures see fig 1 1 determination of the field temperature distribution collected over several depths and time periods 2 extraction of an initial condition and two boundary conditions from field measurements the first temperatures along the depth are set to be the initial condition the top and bottom temperatures during the field work are the boundary conditions 3 repeated cad analysis and calculation of the sum of squares error between the measured and the calculated temperature profiles 4 determination of the hyporheic zone depth by minimizing the sum of squares error with a change in the hyporheic flux hyporheic flux consists of two parameters size and shape the former is composed of a set of hyporheic zone depths and their magnitudes in the vertical direction although the latter has seldom been reported in the literature it is reasonable for a hyporheic flux to have a shape in which its magnitude decreases with increasing depth fig 2 kim et al 2014 defined hyporheic flux shapes including spandrel triangle cosine and quarter ellipse fig 3 the magnitude of hyporheic flux is comprised of the maximum flux velocity at the streambed level vf max and the hyporheic zone depth dh 3 sensitivity analysis we assessed the sensitivity of parameters used in the governing equation to determine their relative importance based on the factors defined in fig 4 some of the factors may not have crucial impacts but we first examined the degree of influence of each factor the means for each parameter table 1 were used for the deterministic cad analysis the parameters varied between 85 and 115 around their means the results of the hyporheic zone depth sensitivity analysis are shown in table 2 and fig 5 the sensitivity analysis only considered the quarter elliptical hyporheic flux shape from fig 3 with factors 1 3 and 4 having major effects on the hyporheic zone depth as a reference the optimum hyporheic zone depth was updated from 9 2 cm in kim et al 2014 to 9 6 cm here due to finer division of the hyporheic flux shape if the streambed heat capacity factor 1 deviated by 10 from a reference value the optimum depth changed to 6 8 cm 4 improvement of minimum ssd search algorithm before engaging in the probabilistic approach the calculation time required for solving the finite element equations needs be reduced because the cad analysis requires repeated alternation of the magnitude and depth of the hyporheic flux shape fig 6 shows an idealized ssd value surface used for finding the optimal hyporheic flux shape with minimum error i e the sum of the squared difference if the search region is divided into nx and ny divisions we need nx ny calculations to determine the shape of minimum ssd location the green point in fig 6 thus extensive calculations and thus time consuming numerical analyses are required for the probabilistic approach instead we compared the ssds of adjacent grid points and moved the grid set to the minimum gradient direction saving significant time due to fewer calculations fig 7 for example the calculation time for the reference case sensitivity analysis described previously was reduced from 1 h to 1 min 5 probabilistic approach for the probabilistic approach the main parameters were selected based on the sensitivity analysis grain density x1 specific heat capacity x2 grain thermal conductivity x3 and porosity x4 the latin hypercube sampling method was adopted for the small number of calculations with the well distributed sample combination of x1 x2 x3 and x4 in the range between 0 and 1 well distributed parameter values were acquired by mapping these values to physical parameters fig 8 fig 9 shows the histograms of results from the repeated cad analyses along with the fitting of the following four probability distributions models to the data series 1 the histogram has an almost symmetrical shape thus we first fit a normal distribution to the result data 2 the physical quantity hyporheic zone depth in this case has a positive depth value thus we fit a lognormal distribution to the result data 3 careful examination of the histogram shows that it has a higher frequency for the left side and a lower frequency for the right side moreover the histogram looks like it may have a longer tail on the right side thus we chose a skew distribution as the fit firstly the extreme value type 1 distribution also known as the gumbel distribution and secondly a more general

in table 3 all probability density models except the log normal distribution were proper for this ideal case as the aim of this study is to identify the probability distribution of the hyporheic zone depth a selection of reasonable and best fit distributions is required out of the possible distributions in table 3 the normal distribution was most suitable with the largest p value and the smallest k s test statistics from the deterministic estimation of the hyporheic zone depth at 9 6 cm the probabilistic approach adopted in this paper extends our knowledge of its distribution along the depth of the streambed with only a small variability of the parameters appearing in the governing equation e g a 5 coefficient of variation for the normal distributions as shown in fig 8 the resulting hyporheic zone depth can be in a wide range from 2 to 25 cm for this case see fig 9 this implies that the depth of the hyporheic zone is highly variable and may be better described in a probabilistic manner 6 conclusions in this study we tested four probabilistic distributions normal lognormal gumbel and generalized extreme value distributions to estimate the depth of the hyporheic zone using heat transfer analysis building on a previously developed deterministic approach by accounting for the natural scatter of physical properties our method uses repeated cad analysis with a combination of parameters generated from latin hypercube sampling modifying the minimum search algorithm drastically reduced the required calculation time making the method far more time efficient from a sensitivity analysis for parameters used in the governing equation main parameters having a significant influence on the hyporheic zone depth were found to be grain density soil specific heat capacity grain thermal conductivity and porosity probabilistic delineation method let us know how wide the hyporheic zone depths spreads along the depth giving its scattering feature from a fixed value of 9 6 cm to a range of 2 cm to 25 cm with proper types of probability distribution of normal gumbel and generalized extreme value distributions for the exemplary case the probability method ventured in this study could be a sophisticated way to delineate the hyporheic zone depth credit authorship contribution statement heejung kim conceptualization methodology data curation formal analysis investigation
