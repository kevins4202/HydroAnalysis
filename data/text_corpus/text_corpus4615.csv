23075,in assessment of the response of floating wind turbines under extreme wave conditions structure stability and survivability is of utmost importance in the design and implementation the experimental upwind horizontal axis floating wind turbine on a tension leg platform tlp setup was validated with the strongly coupled partitioned six degree of freedom rigid body motion solver chow and ng 2016 after tuning of the unknown variables such as the tendon stiffness and damping coefficients with the decay tests the system ran with the coupled fluid motion numerical solver resulted in accurate estimations of the natural frequencies and damping ratios together with a modified restrain system to model the tendons the response of the floating wind turbine under regular and focused waves simulations were found to be well predicted a stability analysis was performed to determine the iterations that should be ran every time step the median of the time steps converged within 8 7 iterations keywords computational fluid dynamics openfoam floating wind turbines tension leg platform strongly coupled motion response 1 introduction over the years the wind power industry has witnessed the transition from fixed to floating foundations with the increasing demand for higher capacity generators there is a trend for wind turbines in general to be situated further offshore with the prevalence of stronger winds roland berger 2013 shifting further offshore brings along challenges to develop structures with higher stiffness to withstand the environmental loads this becomes more apparent as the natural frequency of the fixed structure approaches the wave frequencies resulting in a drop in cost effectiveness beyond a depth of 60 m butterfield et al 2006 it is thus not surprising for the industry to focus the research on floating foundations for wind turbines based on studies on the levelised cost of energy lcoe of different types of offshore floating wind turbines it can be expected that for deeper waters corresponding to about 100 km offshore the increase in lcoe is lesser than their fixed foundation counterparts myhr et al 2014 it is clear that the major challenges lie in the design and safety assessments in the construction of such structures other than experimental tests it is always useful to have a validated numerical tool to extend to the cases that are too expensive to run physical experiments on in recent years with improved scaling and reduced cost of computational power numerical analysis of floating structures has gained popularity in order to achieve a safe but cost effective foundation for offshore floating wind turbines it is important to have a model that can predict wave loads and responses under overturning waves splash and extreme run up other common phenomena such as water on deck and slamming are problems faced by the implementations as well while highly computationally demanding a fully non linear navier stokes n s solver is often required in order to resolve the flow solution in detail current n s based coupled fluid motion solver described in chow and ng 2016 ensures stability of the stiff fluid structure interaction fsi problem and yet optimises the rate of convergence the analysis in this study focuses on wave structure interactions and omits the effects of the wind which can include wind wave wind structure or wind wave structure interactions the scope of the study lies on the response of the floating wind turbine restrained by tendons which includes decay tests and rigid body motion under different wave conditions 2 experimental setup the experimental prototype by laugesen and hansen 2015 is a tlp restrained 1 60 froude scaled 10 mw floating wind turbine mounted on geometrically simple foundations shown in fig 1 the floating foundation is made up of a partially submerged cylindrical transition piece tp 150 mm in diameter and 533 mm in height at the top supporting the rotor the submergence of the transition piece is 200 mm the transition piece is supported by a floater f 300 mm in diameter and 417 mm in height for additional buoyancy attached to the floater are slender spokes s 535 mm in length with attachment points that connect to the bottom of the wave basin by kevlar ropes the full model with four spokes has a total mass of 18 54 kg with a vertical centre of gravity located 321 mm above the mean water level mwl at z 0 the mass moments of inertia i xx and i yy are 22 70 kgm2 the scaled wave climate or sea states used in the experiments were based on measurements of significant wave heights and peak periods fitted to 26 years of measurements in the northern north sea johannessen et al 2002 10 different environmental conditions ecs were selected with their wave heights h s and peak periods t p based on past similar experiments with the maximum corresponding to a 50 year sea state the wave heights and periods of the generated regular waves used in the experiments were based on the significant wave heights and peak periods for the corresponding environmental conditions the waves were generated by a custom software input file which controls the single degree of freedom motion of the paddles the raw experimental data recorded from the system were expected to include high frequency components that do not necessarily describe the physics based on the scale of the experiments this was more evident in the milder sea states relating to the lower numbered environmental conditions in such cases a lowpass butterworth infinite impulse response iir filter was applied to the data when compared to the simulations the highcut frequency of 20 hz expected to be well balanced between smoothing out the noises and still allow capturing of the higher order motion response of the system was filtered in the forward and reverse direction to eliminate any phase distortion 3 simulation setup 3 1 geometry and mesh creation since the study only focus on the rigid body motion of the floating wind turbine the geometry recreated from the experiment can be simplified by omitting the model above the transition piece a rectangular domain was formed 7 m in length 3 m in width and 4 m in height the horizontal coordinates of the geometric centre and or centre of gravity of the floater was located at 0 0 for the convenience of the six degree of freedom motion tracking in the analysis the model of the floating foundation consisting of two connected cylinders were removed from the volume of the domain fig 2 the spokes of the floating foundation were omitted due to the large differences in the length scales which would require highly refined cells surrounding the area for the simple geometry a structured mesh is preferred the vertices were joined with straight lines or circular arcs on the curved surfaces with specification of an additional interpolation point the zones are then divided into blocks of almost the same cell size with careful calculations a cell grading ratio of 3 2 or 2 3 was used for the cells very close towards the foundation walls to allow sufficient resolution in the region of interest the final mesh before any further refinement consists of around 6 69 million hexahedra cells the cells have a maximum aspect ratio of 5 77 and a maximum skewness of 0 581 the mesh was also found to be refined enough having undergone through mesh dependence studies to ensure convergence with further refinements 3 2 boundary conditions the volume of fluid vof solver is used where the multidimensional universal limiter with explicit solution mules algebraic scheme is employed for the advection of a sharp interface deshpande et al 2012 the faces made of four vertices each were grouped together to form the boundaries west east south north bottom top and body the west boundary represents the wave generator and the east boundary represents the active wave absorption mechanism active wave absorption higuera et al 2013a 2013b boundary condition implemented in ihfoam reduces the reflection of waves by applying the correct boundary condition in the form of a velocity profile approaching the outlet boundary the absorption system dynamically takes inputs from the measured feedback and modifies the wave maker movements pre emptively to eliminate the reflection of waves for the decay tests the wave generator and absorption boundaries were represented by no slip walls like the rest of the concrete walls in the wave basin similarly the phase fraction was set to take information from the wave generator only when wave generation was required and set to zero gradient otherwise no slip walls were used for the other stationary walls and moving walls of the floating body a special built in boundary condition was used for the top patch which represents the atmosphere by switching between velocity and pressure between a constant specified value and zero gradient depending on the velocity directions the fixed atmospheric pressure was first manually specified for the case of inflow of air into the domain the velocity was obtained from the normal component of the patch face a zero gradient condition will be specified when air flows out of the domain a fixed flux pressure analogous to buoyant pressure is specified for all the other walls except the top patch the k epsilon turbulence closure with wall functions was used in the walls for most of the cases except for some decay tests where laminar flow was required note that the k omega turbulence model might be a better option due to its reputation in better resolving wake region and flow separation however in this case there is a need to resolve wave generation wave absorption and the domain as well it is well understood that the generation and absorption model developed by ihfoam works very well with the k epsilon model a further investigation can be done separately to look at the near field around the the structures with k omega sst models and perhaps look into a hybrid model here we did not encouter issues with high unstable values for the k and epilon and eddy viscosity values in the flow field and at the air water interface the boundary conditions of this test setup are shown in table 1 3 3 solver properties the motion solver used in the simulations was based on the six dof rigid body motion solver formulated in chow and ng 2016 m and i refers to the mass and moment of inertia of the floating body in kg and kg m2 respectively f e x t m g s p n τ d s f m e x t s r p n τ d s i ω ω i ω the mesh was set to move only in the regions between 0 25 m and 0 5 m away from the surface of the floating body these values were estimated to prevent over skewed cells too close to the boundaries and around the floating body based on the experimental setup the centre of mass was set at the origin horizontally and 3 321 m from the bottom wall of the domain the mass of the structure was set to 18 54 kg as measured in the experiments the moments of inertia i xx and i yy were determined in the experiments laugesen and hansen 2015 based on the lengths of the spokes the positions of the anchor and attachment points shown in fig 3 were determined with trigonometry to correctly represent the four connected tendons the simulations utilised the custom non linear variable stiffness model in the experiments the tendon stiffness was tested by subjecting the tendon to known masses with increments and measuring the elongation the loading and unloading axial strains were found to be different from each other signifying a deviation from hooke s law it was decided to determine the modulus with a linear fit to the loading and unloading plots with the y intercept moved to zero the ea value of the model was estimated to be around 80000 n which corresponds to a fixed stiffness k of 35556 n m taking into account the length of the tendons this value was used in the analysis in wamit but was concluded to be way over predicted in laugesen and hansen 2015 a value of 6667 n m was proposed in their study which allowed better fit of the experimental tests fig 4 the rest lengths of the tendons were estimated based on hydrostatic force conservation laws the weight of the floating body was deducted from the buoyancy calculated from the submerged volume resulting in the total tension of the four tendons depending on the stiffness the rest length x r can be obtained eq 1 the number of tendons n and distance between the anchor and attachment point x d are known constants here with values of 4 and 2 2500 respectively the calculated rest lengths are 2 2490 m for the tendon stiffness of 35556 n m and 2 2447 m for 6667 n m 1 ρ g v m g n k x d x r the restrain system in the motion solver was also modified to take into account the δx of the tendons falling below zero the modification also allows for variable stiffness by a custom input file of the force δx relationship traditionally when modelling the restrains as linear springs the force of the tendons acting on the floating body will fall below zero this might be negligible in the motion of the floating body under wave loads where the tendons are usually in tension but could affect the results for some of the modes in the decay tests the modification here sets the force to be zero whenever δx is negative at every iteration the motion is solved δx is obtained from the subtracting the rest length from the change in position of the attachment and the anchor point δx is used to lookup the corresponding force from the custom input file and multiplying the force with a unit vector pointing from the attachment to the anchor point additionally the tendons have some damping property independent of the viscous damping of the floating body which is not always easy to estimate and requires tuning from the decay tests the acceleration relaxation factor was set to 0 5 for the first time step and allowed to vary from 0 1 to 1 0 for the subsequent steps based on aitken s dynamic under relaxation the coupled solver controlled by the main fluid solver ran with a time step size of 10 4 subjected to vary based on the courant controls the maximum courant numbers and maximum time step size were both capped at 0 1 3 4 decay tests model decay tests were performed in the experiments laugesen and hansen 2015 to determine the natural frequencies and damping ratios of the system a small displacement corresponding to each degree of freedom was introduced and the displacements or rotations of the floating system were plotted against time an intuitive method to obtain the natural frequencies would be to simply determine the time periods between the peaks and taking the inverse for the damping ratios the logarithmic decrement between subsequent peaks defined by eq 2 was first obtained over the first few peaks the mean of the logarithmic decrement was used to determine the damping ratio ζ shown in eq 3 inman 2009 2 δ ln x i x i 1 3 ζ δ 4 π 2 δ 2 for each of the modes a certain displacement was applied to the floating body and it was left to move freely in the experiments a fishing line was attached to the location of the centre of gravity to displace it 0 11 m in the x direction for the surge mode in the simulations the displacement can be easily represented by moving the anchor points by the same distance instead for the pitch the floating body was rotated by applying forces at the top and bottom ends in different directions the floating body was rotated to an orientation approximately 1 1 5 from equilibrium the forces were released simultaneously and the floating body was left to move freely in the simulations the exact same initial displacement method was applied here where additional restrains were applied at the top and bottom of the floating body for the first 2 s of the simulations until it is at the correct orientation the restrains were released thereafter continuing on with the simulation the yaw decay tests were performed in a similar manner in the experiments forces were applied at opposite ends to rotate the floating body in the z axis by approximately 10 15 3 4 1 surge from the surge response the periods and decrements of peaks can be obtained the damped natural frequency from the simulation was relatively easy to obtain and was found to be very close to the experimental value of 0 19 hz for the cases of different stiffness tested based on the methods described in the main section a damping ratio to represent each of the response can be used as comparison fig 5 in the plot all the cases were assumed to start from an initial displacement of exactly 0 11 m as done in the experiments and follow an exponential decay trend thereafter a constant stiffness of 6667 n m was used the results from the simulations showed a decent match with the experiments as long as turbulence was turned off in the fluid solver the damping coefficient of the tendons did not have a significant effect on the decay curve such that the value could be tuned with this mode from the experiments it was found that the damping of the system is one of the most difficult parameter to estimate and thus damping ratios were assumed accurate to only one significant digit in such case there would be no significant differences in damping ratios between the cases when different damping coefficients were used in this test the default laminar flow did not include any damping 0 n s m in the tendons and the laminar damped run used a fixed damping coefficient of 35 n s m in fig 5 in the simulation cases where the geometry only consists of the floater the sway is expected and assumed to have the same natural frequency and damping ratios as the surge mode 3 4 2 yaw the yaw motion was expected to be dependent on the moment of inertia of the vertical axis i zz which was unfortunately not measured in the experiments laugesen and hansen 2015 from several tests it was found that the natural frequency varies with different values of i zz and a value of 1 1 kg m2 corresponds to the natural frequency of exactly 0 63 hz on the other hand the damping ratio was found to be unaffected by any of the other unknown variables the damping ratio obtained in the simulations was way under predicted one possible reason for the low damping ratio was thought to be due to the absence of spokes in the geometry which could have contributed to significant damping in the yaw decay despite being slender to test the hypothesis by including the spokes in the geometry a huge refinement in mesh would be required around the spokes the hypothesis was thus untested in this study 3 4 3 pitch the pitch motion was the most difficult to perform decay test experiments on due to the short period of times where the floating body was unrestrained and free floating during the rotation decay in the simulations of this study unrestrained floating bodies are more prone to instabilities and would thus require a much reduced courant number and time step size for convergence adding to that the lack of knowledge of the damping coefficient in the tendons would mean that some sort of trial and error and tuning was required from the simulated response of the pitch it can be confirmed that using the measured stiffness of 35556 n m resulted in an over predicted natural frequency of 4 4 hz as expected when a reduced stiffness of 6667 n m was used for the simulated decay tests a frequency of 2 0 hz was obtained much closer to the experimental results of 1 9 hz the natural frequency varied slightly between 1 8 hz and 2 0 hz when different damping coefficients were used for the tendons but the differences were also not large enough for tuning the damping ratio on the other hand increased almost linearly with the damping coefficient of the tendons which allowed for easy tuning of the parameter based on the plots of damping ratio vs the damping coefficients fig 6 it was found that the experimental damping ratio of 0 04 would require a tendon damping coefficient of around 35 n s m for a stiffness of 6667 n m and 33 n s m for a stiffness of 35556 n m based on linear correlations on another plot of the decay curves fig 7 it can be observed that a better fit was obtained with a damping coefficient of 25 n s m this was attributed to the slight over prediction in the natural frequency of 2 0 hz since the constant decay rate used in the plots consist of both the damping ratio and the damped natural frequency the differences between the two damping coefficients would however result in insignificant deviations when the damping ratio is compared to the experiments and no differences when rounded to one significant figure 3 4 4 finalised parameters most of the natural frequencies and damping ratios matched the experimental values with the exception of the damping ratio in the yaw mode some of the unknown parameters have been tuned in the tests based on the experimental results the reduced stiffness of 6667 n m was deemed to be more correct due to the natural frequency obtained in the pitch the moment of inertial i zz was set to 1 1 kg m2 to obtain the experimental natural frequency in the yaw mode the pitch response provided with sufficient information to determine the damping in the tendons to be 35 n s m in the next section these finalised parameters were fed into the solver for subsequent simulations in the response of the floating structure under wave loads 3 5 floating structure under regular waves the response of the floating structure under wave loads in a coupled navier stokes based solver requires a functioning dynamic wave generation absorption boundary condition the ihfoam wave generation and absorption boundary conditions higuera et al 2013a 2013b were used in the setup on the west and east boundaries respectively to replace the no slip walls in the decay tests in general it was expected for more severe wave conditions in experiments to have a better fit with simulated data due to the larger wave periods and wave heights it was thus decided to compare the response of the structure under regular waves based on the wave periods and heights of ec08 h s 0 167 m t p 1 58 s and ec10 h s 0 239 m t p 1 99 s the simulations were ran for 20 s under the generated waves which would provide sufficient results for comparisons both in the time and frequency domain the simulations were ran by the new intel xeon processor 5500 series 32 cores at ntu hpc the simulations took 28 5 h to complete in the comparison with the experiments a certain time lag was introduced to the experimental values to match the steady regular peaks and troughs for the six degree of freedom responses of the floating structure the mean of the simulated response were deducted from the experimental response to take into account the small differences in the zero level 3 5 1 motion response the translational modes of interest for uni directional wave loads of heading θ 0 would be the surge and the heave with the sway at an insignificant magnitude from the industrial viewpoint the surge response of the floating wind turbine is of utmost importance in the design parameterisation of the tendons stiffness rest length and maximum surge displacement under a certain wave load the heave on the other hand is expected to be small and usually damped and thus less of a concern using the tuned parameters in the decay tests it was found that the surge response in the simulations matched the experimental results very well once a steady response was obtained fig 8 from the fast fourier transform fft analysis of the first 20 s it can be seen that the main wave frequency near 0 5 hz was obtained which corresponds to the generated waves with a period of 1 99 s the findings were evident in the sea states with greater wave heights and periods such as ec8 and ec10 figs 8 and 9 a case was ran with generated regular waves of 30 heading to show the significant amount of sway response of the floating structure for simplicity the floating system in the simulation was rotated 30 clockwise to mimic a counter clockwise domain rotation as seen in fig 10 physically only the anchor and attachment points were rotated with the origin at the centre of the floating wind turbine the six degree of freedom responses obtained were mapped back into the original orientation from fig 11 it was found that both the surge and sway simulated responses fit the measurements very well after 10 s of simulation as the directional waves approaches steady state a main wave frequency of 0 5 hz was obtained in the frequency plots as well the simulated heave responses were expected to not fit the experimental results as well as surge due to the much smaller magnitude the heave mode is also has more noise before the start of the simulation when there are no loads the results were surprisingly satisfactory in such a highly dynamic case where the fft plots showed that the both the peaks at 0 5 hz and about 1 25 hz were captured in wave condition ec10 fig 12 the amplitude of the peak at 0 5 hz was found to be under predicted which was not evident in ec08 fig 13 where a much better fit was observed for both major frequencies it is interesting to note that despite having a noisier measured data for ec08 the simulation produced a better match capturing more of the lower frequency peak at 0 5 hz in a similar manner for the responses under regular waves of 30 heading fig 14 the double peaks in the measured and simulated data were prominent just like the cases with generated waves of 0 heading the results are comparable to the case of the same sea state of ec10 but not as good as ec08 the rotational mode yaw is negligible in the cases here and not compared with the experiments simulation results of the pitch mode compared decently well with the measurements for both ec08 and ec10 under zero heading figs 15 and 16 in the fft plots for the cases the peaks were located at 0 5 hz which corresponds to the generated wave period of 1 99 s the peaks were slightly under predicted from the measurements for both cases the pitch and roll responses for the generated regular waves of 30 heading were determined as well fig 17 the simulated pitch response similarly matched with the measurements with slightly under predicted peaks and troughs the experimental roll responses were found to be more susceptible to some fluctuations occurring at around 1 hz which was not picked up in the solver 3 5 2 forces on the restrains other than the six degree of freedom response of the floating structure the parameterisation in design lies on the rest length and material stiffness required for the tendons connecting the wind turbine to the bottom of the wave basin from the tests the range of tension experienced by the tendons under different wave conditions will be vital note that the time lag introduced in this case were the same as the value introduced in the surge and heave responses to fit the experimental and simulated curves from the comparisons of the experimental and simulated tension some slight discrepancies were detected figs 18 and 19 the results showed small differences in the maximum and minimum values between the upstream tendons 1 and 2 and also between the downstream tendons 3 and 4 from fig 18 there are clear differences between the experimental measured tensions between the two upstream tendons unlike the simulated results showing consistency in symmetry it is unclear with the available results the reason for the differences one possibility would be the additional tendon length between the anchor points and the control points which may have affected the recorded tensions in the z gauges the z gauges weigh about 250 g each and could have an effect on the measurements too the tension of the downstream tendons has fewer errors in measurements between the tendons fig 19 and thus produced a better fit with the simulated data 3 5 3 solver stability the strongly coupled motion solver with aitken s dynamic under relaxation was designed to ensure stability in the iterations leading to the end of the time step once the motion solution converges stability is achieved by the solver dynamically reducing the weightage of the calculated acceleration in the new iteration with aitken s under relaxation however it was discovered from the simulations that if the fluid solver did not have a sufficiently small time step size several time steps may struggle with motion convergence reaching the maximum stipulated iterations per time step of 100 with relative errors still larger than 10 3 it was realised that when the courant numbers controlling the fluid solver time steps were reduced the relative errors in the motion solver decreased faster and thus achieved convergence within lesser number of iterations this is of course under the assumption that the fluid solver achieved convergence before the motion solver this phenomenon is not surprising and is a direct consequence of the decoupled time step controls in the fluid and motion solvers in most dynamic runs a courant number of 0 1 would be sufficiently small to ensure the motion do not face difficulties with convergence all the cases ran had less than 0 1 of the time steps that had to proceed to the next time step without converging after reaching the maximum of 100 for example from an analysis of the simulation log for ec08 fig 20 it can be clearly seen that the cumulative plot is skewed towards the time steps converging with fewer than 20 iterations with only 0 7 of the time steps requiring more the plot beyond is not shown to prevent clutter though it is useful to note that eventually 0 6 of the time steps still did not manage to converge beyond 100 iterations the median time steps require around 8 7 iterations for convergence with an interquartile range of around 2 iterations the results showed that even in real world simulations the coupled motion solver with aitkens dynamic under relaxation did not have any problems with convergence most of the time as such it is clear that setting the maximum number of allowed iterations to 100 had been over conservative for the current case which was only chosen to check if convergence was possible with further iterations from the results above even setting the maximum to 20 is possible since it seems that most of the time steps that did not converge in 20 iterations would not converge in 100 iterations as well however a safer value of 50 is recommended for future runs since only rarely would that number of iterations would be required and will not drastically increase the total simulation time 4 conclusions from the experimental results obtained for the floating wind turbine setup on a tensioned leg platform laugesen and hansen 2015 a validation study was performed to test out the coupled 6 dof rigid body motion solver implemented in chow and ng 2016 the developed solver was brought into test with an experimental floating wind turbine setup on a tensioned leg platform some of the unknown parameters were tuned with decay tests on the surge pitch and yaw modes with the finalised parameters a very good match of the damping ratio and natural frequency was obtained a modified restrain system was implemented to model the tendons with custom force displacement functions and also apply zero force when the ropes are slack the simulation of the floating system under regular and focused waves were ran and it has been shown with reasonable validations that the coupled 6 dof rigid body motion solver was able to capture the wave loads on the floating wind turbine and determine its response these wave impact forces produced from non linear wave interaction also includes complex interactions between the restrain tendons and the floating structure beyond the current validation study the simulations could be adapted to allow testing out of different setup configurations for design optimisation of the restrains and allowable maximum displacements reducing the need to perform many different physical experiments in the wave basin 4 1 recommendations and future works in the validation tests with experimental data several problems were encountered firstly the wave generation boundary conditions from the ihfoam libraries were not able to generate a good representation of less severe sea states i e ec05 this may not be a problem in the current study due to the preferences for validating more severe sea states running the cases with smaller wave heights and periods may however provide useful insight on specific cases secondly the lack of a good representation of focused waves in the simulations comparable to the experiments has prevented comparison of the results for the cases an alternative wave generation absorption

witnessed the transition from fixed to floating foundations with the increasing demand for higher capacity generators there is a trend for wind turbines in general to be situated further offshore with the prevalence of stronger winds roland berger 2013 shifting further offshore brings along challenges to develop structures with higher stiffness to withstand the environmental loads this becomes more apparent as the natural frequency of the fixed structure approaches the wave frequencies resulting in a drop in cost effectiveness beyond a depth of 60 m butterfield et al 2006 it is thus not surprising for the industry to focus the research on floating foundations for wind turbines based on studies on the levelised cost of energy lcoe of different types of offshore floating wind turbines it can be expected that for deeper waters corresponding to about 100 km offshore the increase in lcoe is lesser than their fixed foundation counterparts myhr et al 2014 it is clear that the major challenges lie in the design and safety assessments in the construction of such structures other than experimental tests it is always useful to have a validated numerical tool to extend to the cases that are too expensive to run physical experiments on in recent years with improved scaling and reduced cost of computational power numerical analysis of floating structures has gained popularity in order to achieve a safe but cost effective foundation for offshore floating wind turbines it is important to have a model that can predict wave loads and responses under overturning waves splash and extreme run up other common phenomena such as water on deck and slamming are problems faced by the implementations as well while highly computationally demanding a fully non linear navier stokes n s solver is often required in order to resolve the flow solution in detail current n s based coupled fluid motion solver described in chow and ng 2016 ensures stability of the stiff fluid structure interaction fsi problem and yet optimises the rate of convergence the analysis in this study focuses on wave structure interactions and omits the effects of the wind which can include wind wave wind structure or wind wave structure interactions the scope of the study lies on the response of the floating wind turbine restrained by tendons which includes decay tests and rigid body motion under different wave conditions 2 experimental setup the experimental prototype by laugesen and hansen 2015 is a tlp restrained 1 60 froude scaled 10 mw floating wind turbine mounted on geometrically simple foundations shown in fig 1 the floating foundation is made up of a partially submerged cylindrical transition piece tp 150 mm in diameter and 533 mm in height at the top supporting the rotor the submergence of the transition piece is 200 mm the transition piece is supported by a floater f 300 mm in diameter and 417 mm in height for additional buoyancy attached to the floater are slender spokes s 535 mm in length with attachment points that connect to the bottom of the wave basin by kevlar ropes the full model with four spokes has a total mass of 18 54 kg with a vertical centre of gravity located 321 mm above the mean water level mwl at z 0 the mass moments of inertia i xx and i yy are 22 70 kgm2 the scaled wave climate or sea states used in the experiments were based on measurements of significant wave heights and peak periods fitted to 26 years of measurements in the northern north sea johannessen et al 2002 10 different environmental conditions ecs were selected with their wave heights h s and peak periods t p based on past similar experiments with the maximum corresponding to a 50 year sea state the wave heights and periods of the generated regular waves used in the experiments were based on the significant wave heights and peak periods for the corresponding environmental conditions the waves were generated by a custom software input file which controls the single degree of freedom motion of the paddles the raw experimental data recorded from the system were expected to include high frequency components that do not necessarily describe the physics based on the scale of the experiments this was more evident in the milder sea states relating to the lower numbered environmental conditions in such cases a lowpass butterworth infinite impulse response iir filter was applied to the data when compared to the simulations the highcut frequency of 20 hz expected to be well balanced between smoothing out the noises and still allow capturing of the higher order motion response of the system was filtered in the forward and reverse direction to eliminate any phase distortion 3 simulation setup 3 1 geometry and mesh creation since the study only focus on the rigid body motion of the floating wind turbine the geometry recreated from the experiment can be simplified by omitting the model above the transition piece a rectangular domain was formed 7 m in length 3 m in width and 4 m in height the horizontal coordinates of the geometric centre and or centre of gravity of the floater was located at 0 0 for the convenience of the six degree of freedom motion tracking in the analysis the model of the floating foundation consisting of two connected cylinders were removed from the volume of the domain fig 2 the spokes of the floating foundation were omitted due to the large differences in the length scales which would require highly refined cells surrounding the area for the simple geometry a structured mesh is preferred the vertices were joined with straight lines or circular arcs on the curved surfaces with specification of an additional interpolation point the zones are then divided into blocks of almost the same cell size with careful calculations a cell grading ratio of 3 2 or 2 3 was used for the cells very close towards the foundation walls to allow sufficient resolution in the region of interest the final mesh before any further refinement consists of around 6 69 million hexahedra cells the cells have a maximum aspect ratio of 5 77 and a maximum skewness of 0 581 the mesh was also found to be refined enough having undergone through mesh dependence studies to ensure convergence with further refinements 3 2 boundary conditions the volume of fluid vof solver is used where the multidimensional universal limiter with explicit solution mules algebraic scheme is employed for the advection of a sharp interface deshpande et al 2012 the faces made of four vertices each were grouped together to form the boundaries west east south north bottom top and body the west boundary represents the wave generator and the east boundary represents the active wave absorption mechanism active wave absorption higuera et al 2013a 2013b boundary condition implemented in ihfoam reduces the reflection of waves by applying the correct boundary condition in the form of a velocity profile approaching the outlet boundary the absorption system dynamically takes inputs from the measured feedback and modifies the wave maker movements pre emptively to eliminate the reflection of waves for the decay tests the wave generator and absorption boundaries were represented by no slip walls like the rest of the concrete walls in the wave basin similarly the phase fraction was set to take information from the wave generator only when wave generation was required and set to zero gradient otherwise no slip walls were used for the other stationary walls and moving walls of the floating body a special built in boundary condition was used for the top patch which represents the atmosphere by switching between velocity and pressure between a constant specified value and zero gradient depending on the velocity directions the fixed atmospheric pressure was first manually specified for the case of inflow of air into the domain the velocity was obtained from the normal component of the patch face a zero gradient condition will be specified when air flows out of the domain a fixed flux pressure analogous to buoyant pressure is specified for all the other walls except the top patch the k epsilon turbulence closure with wall functions was used in the walls for most of the cases except for some decay tests where laminar flow was required note that the k omega turbulence model might be a better option due to its reputation in better resolving wake region and flow separation however in this case there is a need to resolve wave generation wave absorption and the domain as well it is well understood that the generation and absorption model developed by ihfoam works very well with the k epsilon model a further investigation can be done separately to look at the near field around the the structures with k omega sst models and perhaps look into a hybrid model here we did not encouter issues with high unstable values for the k and epilon and eddy viscosity values in the flow field and at the air water interface the boundary conditions of this test setup are shown in table 1 3 3 solver properties the motion solver used in the simulations was based on the six dof rigid body motion solver formulated in chow and ng 2016 m and i refers to the mass and moment of inertia of the floating body in kg and kg m2 respectively f e x t m g s p n τ d s f m e x t s r p n τ d s i ω ω i ω the mesh was set to move only in the regions between 0 25 m and 0 5 m away from the surface of the floating body these values were estimated to prevent over skewed cells too close to the boundaries and around the floating body based on the experimental setup the centre of mass was set at the origin horizontally and 3 321 m from the bottom wall of the domain the mass of the structure was set to 18 54 kg as measured in the experiments the moments of inertia i xx and i yy were determined in the experiments laugesen and hansen 2015 based on the lengths of the spokes the positions of the anchor and attachment points shown in fig 3 were determined with trigonometry to correctly represent the four connected tendons the simulations utilised the custom non linear variable stiffness model in the experiments the tendon stiffness was tested by subjecting the tendon to known masses with increments and measuring the elongation the loading and unloading axial strains were found to be different from each other signifying a deviation from hooke s law it was decided to determine the modulus with a linear fit to the loading and unloading plots with the y intercept moved to zero the ea value of the model was estimated to be around 80000 n which corresponds to a fixed stiffness k of 35556 n m taking into account the length of the tendons this value was used in the analysis in wamit but was concluded to be way over predicted in laugesen and hansen 2015 a value of 6667 n m was proposed in their study which allowed better fit of the experimental tests fig 4 the rest lengths of the tendons were estimated based on hydrostatic force conservation laws the weight of the floating body was deducted from the buoyancy calculated from the submerged volume resulting in the total tension of the four tendons depending on the stiffness the rest length x r can be obtained eq 1 the number of tendons n and distance between the anchor and attachment point x d are known constants here with values of 4 and 2 2500 respectively the calculated rest lengths are 2 2490 m for the tendon stiffness of 35556 n m and 2 2447 m for 6667 n m 1 ρ g v m g n k x d x r the restrain system in the motion solver was also modified to take into account the δx of the tendons falling below zero the modification also allows for variable stiffness by a custom input file of the force δx relationship traditionally when modelling the restrains as linear springs the force of the tendons acting on the floating body will fall below zero this might be negligible in the motion of the floating body under wave loads where the tendons are usually in tension but could affect the results for some of the modes in the decay tests the modification here sets the force to be zero whenever δx is negative at every iteration the motion is solved δx is obtained from the subtracting the rest length from the change in position of the attachment and the anchor point δx is used to lookup the corresponding force from the custom input file and multiplying the force with a unit vector pointing from the attachment to the anchor point additionally the tendons have some damping property independent of the viscous damping of the floating body which is not always easy to estimate and requires tuning from the decay tests the acceleration relaxation factor was set to 0 5 for the first time step and allowed to vary from 0 1 to 1 0 for the subsequent steps based on aitken s dynamic under relaxation the coupled solver controlled by the main fluid solver ran with a time step size of 10 4 subjected to vary based on the courant controls the maximum courant numbers and maximum time step size were both capped at 0 1 3 4 decay tests model decay tests were performed in the experiments laugesen and hansen 2015 to determine the natural frequencies and damping ratios of the system a small displacement corresponding to each degree of freedom was introduced and the displacements or rotations of the floating system were plotted against time an intuitive method to obtain the natural frequencies would be to simply determine the time periods between the peaks and taking the inverse for the damping ratios the logarithmic decrement between subsequent peaks defined by eq 2 was first obtained over the first few peaks the mean of the logarithmic decrement was used to determine the damping ratio ζ shown in eq 3 inman 2009 2 δ ln x i x i 1 3 ζ δ 4 π 2 δ 2 for each of the modes a certain displacement was applied to the floating body and it was left to move freely in the experiments a fishing line was attached to the location of the centre of gravity to displace it 0 11 m in the x direction for the surge mode in the simulations the displacement can be easily represented by moving the anchor points by the same distance instead for the pitch the floating body was rotated by applying forces at the top and bottom ends in different directions the floating body was rotated to an orientation approximately 1 1 5 from equilibrium the forces were released simultaneously and the floating body was left to move freely in the simulations the exact same initial displacement method was applied here where additional restrains were applied at the top and bottom of the floating body for the first 2 s of the simulations until it is at the correct orientation the restrains were released thereafter continuing on with the simulation the yaw decay tests were performed in a similar manner in the experiments forces were applied at opposite ends to rotate the floating body in the z axis by approximately 10 15 3 4 1 surge from the surge response the periods and decrements of peaks can be obtained the damped natural frequency from the simulation was relatively easy to obtain and was found to be very close to the experimental value of 0 19 hz for the cases of different stiffness tested based on the methods described in the main section a damping ratio to represent each of the response can be used as comparison fig 5 in the plot all the cases were assumed to start from an initial displacement of exactly 0 11 m as done in the experiments and follow an exponential decay trend thereafter a constant stiffness of 6667 n m was used the results from the simulations showed a decent match with the experiments as long as turbulence was turned off in the fluid solver the damping coefficient of the tendons did not have a significant effect on the decay curve such that the value could be tuned with this mode from the experiments it was found that the damping of the system is one of the most difficult parameter to estimate and thus damping ratios were assumed accurate to only one significant digit in such case there would be no significant differences in damping ratios between the cases when different damping coefficients were used in this test the default laminar flow did not include any damping 0 n s m in the tendons and the laminar damped run used a fixed damping coefficient of 35 n s m in fig 5 in the simulation cases where the geometry only consists of the floater the sway is expected and assumed to have the same natural frequency and damping ratios as the surge mode 3 4 2 yaw the yaw motion was expected to be dependent on the moment of inertia of the vertical axis i zz which was unfortunately not measured in the experiments laugesen and hansen 2015 from several tests it was found that the natural frequency varies with different values of i zz and a value of 1 1 kg m2 corresponds to the natural frequency of exactly 0 63 hz on the other hand the damping ratio was found to be unaffected by any of the other unknown variables the damping ratio obtained in the simulations was way under predicted one possible reason for the low damping ratio was thought to be due to the absence of spokes in the geometry which could have contributed to significant damping in the yaw decay despite being slender to test the hypothesis by including the spokes in the geometry a huge refinement in mesh would be required around the spokes the hypothesis was thus untested in this study 3 4 3 pitch the pitch motion was the most difficult to perform decay test experiments on due to the short period of times where the floating body was unrestrained and free floating during the rotation decay in the simulations of this study unrestrained floating bodies are more prone to instabilities and would thus require a much reduced courant number and time step size for convergence adding to that the lack of knowledge of the damping coefficient in the tendons would mean that some sort of trial and error and tuning was required from the simulated response of the pitch it can be confirmed that using the measured stiffness of 35556 n m resulted in an over predicted natural frequency of 4 4 hz as expected when a reduced stiffness of 6667 n m was used for the simulated decay tests a frequency of 2 0 hz was obtained much closer to the experimental results of 1 9 hz the natural frequency varied slightly between 1 8 hz and 2 0 hz when different damping coefficients were used for the tendons but the differences were also not large enough for tuning the damping ratio on the other hand increased almost linearly with the damping coefficient of the tendons which allowed for easy tuning of the parameter based on the plots of damping ratio vs the damping coefficients fig 6 it was found that the experimental damping ratio of 0 04 would require a tendon damping coefficient of around 35 n s m for a stiffness of 6667 n m and 33 n s m for a stiffness of 35556 n m based on linear correlations on another plot of the decay curves fig 7 it can be observed that a better fit was obtained with a damping coefficient of 25 n s m this was attributed to the slight over prediction in the natural frequency of 2 0 hz since the constant decay rate used in the plots consist of both the damping ratio and the damped natural frequency the differences between the two damping coefficients would however result in insignificant deviations when the damping ratio is compared to the experiments and no differences when rounded to one significant figure 3 4 4 finalised parameters most of the natural frequencies and damping ratios matched the experimental values with the exception of the damping ratio in the yaw mode some of the unknown parameters have been tuned in the tests based on the experimental results the reduced stiffness of 6667 n m was deemed to be more correct due to the natural frequency obtained in the pitch the moment of inertial i zz was set to 1 1 kg m2 to obtain the experimental natural frequency in the yaw mode the pitch response provided with sufficient information to determine the damping in the tendons to be 35 n s m in the next section these finalised parameters were fed into the solver for subsequent simulations in the response of the floating structure under wave loads 3 5 floating structure under regular waves the response of the floating structure under wave loads in a coupled navier stokes based solver requires a functioning dynamic wave generation absorption boundary condition the ihfoam wave generation and absorption boundary conditions higuera et al 2013a 2013b were used in the setup on the west and east boundaries respectively to replace the no slip walls in the decay tests in general it was expected for more severe wave conditions in experiments to have a better fit with simulated data due to the larger wave periods and wave heights it was thus decided to compare the response of the structure under regular waves based on the wave periods and heights of ec08 h s 0 167 m t p 1 58 s and ec10 h s 0 239 m t p 1 99 s the simulations were ran for 20 s under the generated waves which would provide sufficient results for comparisons both in the time and frequency domain the simulations were ran by the new intel xeon processor 5500 series 32 cores at ntu hpc the simulations took 28 5 h to complete in the comparison with the experiments a certain time lag was introduced to the experimental values to match the steady regular peaks and troughs for the six degree of freedom responses of the floating structure the mean of the simulated response were deducted from the experimental response to take into account the small differences in the zero level 3 5 1 motion response the translational modes of interest for uni directional wave loads of heading θ 0 would be the surge and the heave with the sway at an insignificant magnitude from the industrial viewpoint the surge response of the floating wind turbine is of utmost importance in the design parameterisation of the tendons stiffness rest length and maximum surge displacement under a certain wave load the heave on the other hand is expected to be small and usually damped and thus less of a concern using the tuned parameters in the decay tests it was found that the surge response in the simulations matched the experimental results very well once a steady response was obtained fig 8 from the fast fourier transform fft analysis of the first 20 s it can be seen that the main wave frequency near 0 5 hz was obtained which corresponds to the generated waves with a period of 1 99 s the findings were evident in the sea states with greater wave heights and periods such as ec8 and ec10 figs 8 and 9 a case was ran with generated regular waves of 30 heading to show the significant amount of sway response of the floating structure for simplicity the floating system in the simulation was rotated 30 clockwise to mimic a counter clockwise domain rotation as seen in fig 10 physically only the anchor and attachment points were rotated with the origin at the centre of the floating wind turbine the six degree of freedom responses obtained were mapped back into the original orientation from fig 11 it was found that both the surge and sway simulated responses fit the measurements very well after 10 s of simulation as the directional waves approaches steady state a main wave frequency of 0 5 hz was obtained in the frequency plots as well the simulated heave responses were expected to not fit the experimental results as well as surge due to the much smaller magnitude the heave mode is also has more noise before the start of the simulation when there are no loads the results were surprisingly satisfactory in such a highly dynamic case where the fft plots showed that the both the peaks at 0 5 hz and about 1 25 hz were captured in wave condition ec10 fig 12 the amplitude of the peak at 0 5 hz was found to be under predicted which was not evident in ec08 fig 13 where a much better fit was observed for both major frequencies it is interesting to note that despite having a noisier measured data for ec08 the simulation produced a better match capturing more of the lower frequency peak at 0 5 hz in a similar manner for the responses under regular waves of 30 heading fig 14 the double peaks in the measured and simulated data were prominent just like the cases with generated waves of 0 heading the results are comparable to the case of the same sea state of ec10 but not as good as ec08 the rotational mode yaw is negligible in the cases here and not compared with the experiments simulation results of the pitch mode compared decently well with the measurements for both ec08 and ec10 under zero heading figs 15 and 16 in the fft plots for the cases the peaks were located at 0 5 hz which corresponds to the generated wave period of 1 99 s the peaks were slightly under predicted from the measurements for both cases the pitch and roll responses for the generated regular waves of 30 heading were determined as well fig 17 the simulated pitch response similarly matched with the measurements with slightly under predicted peaks and troughs the experimental roll responses were found to be more susceptible to some fluctuations occurring at around 1 hz which was not picked up in the solver 3 5 2 forces on the restrains other than the six degree of freedom response of the floating structure the parameterisation in design lies on the rest length and material stiffness required for the tendons connecting the wind turbine to the bottom of the wave basin from the tests the range of tension experienced by the tendons under different wave conditions will be vital note that the time lag introduced in this case were the same as the value introduced in the surge and heave responses to fit the experimental and simulated curves from the comparisons of the experimental and simulated tension some slight discrepancies were detected figs 18 and 19 the results showed small differences in the maximum and minimum values between the upstream tendons 1 and 2 and also between the downstream tendons 3 and 4 from fig 18 there are clear differences between the experimental measured tensions between the two upstream tendons unlike the simulated results showing consistency in symmetry it is unclear with the available results the reason for the differences one possibility would be the additional tendon length between the anchor points and the control points which may have affected the recorded tensions in the z gauges the z gauges weigh about 250 g each and could have an effect on the measurements too the tension of the downstream tendons has fewer errors in measurements between the tendons fig 19 and thus produced a better fit with the simulated data 3 5 3 solver stability the strongly coupled motion solver with aitken s dynamic under relaxation was designed to ensure stability in the iterations leading to the end of the time step once the motion solution converges stability is achieved by the solver dynamically reducing the weightage of the calculated acceleration in the new iteration with aitken s under relaxation however it was discovered from the simulations that if the fluid solver did not have a sufficiently small time step size several time steps may struggle with motion convergence reaching the maximum stipulated iterations per time step of 100 with relative errors still larger than 10 3 it was realised that when the courant numbers controlling the fluid solver time steps were reduced the relative errors in the motion solver decreased faster and thus achieved convergence within lesser number of iterations this is of course under the assumption that the fluid solver achieved convergence before the motion solver this phenomenon is not surprising and is a direct consequence of the decoupled time step controls in the fluid and motion solvers in most dynamic runs a courant number of 0 1 would be sufficiently small to ensure the motion do not face difficulties with convergence all the cases ran had less than 0 1 of the time steps that had to proceed to the next time step without converging after reaching the maximum of 100 for example from an analysis of the simulation log for ec08 fig 20 it can be clearly seen that the cumulative plot is skewed towards the time steps converging with fewer than 20 iterations with only 0 7 of the time steps requiring more the plot beyond is not shown to prevent clutter though it is useful to note that eventually 0 6 of the time steps still did not manage to converge beyond 100 iterations the median time steps require around 8 7 iterations for convergence with an interquartile range of around 2 iterations the results showed that even in real world simulations the coupled motion solver with aitkens dynamic under relaxation did not have any problems with convergence most of the time as such it is clear that setting the maximum number of allowed iterations to 100 had been over conservative for the current case which was only chosen to check if convergence was possible with further iterations from the results above even setting the maximum to 20 is possible since it seems that most of the time steps that did not converge in 20 iterations would not converge in 100 iterations as well however a safer value of 50 is recommended for future runs since only rarely would that number of iterations would be required and will not drastically increase the total simulation time 4 conclusions from the experimental results obtained for the floating wind turbine setup on a tensioned leg platform laugesen and hansen 2015 a validation study was performed to test out the coupled 6 dof rigid body motion solver implemented in chow and ng 2016 the developed solver was brought into test with an experimental floating wind turbine setup on a tensioned leg platform some of the unknown parameters were tuned with decay tests on the surge pitch and yaw modes with the finalised parameters a very good match of the damping ratio and natural frequency was obtained a modified restrain system was implemented to model the tendons with custom force displacement functions and also apply zero force when the ropes are slack the simulation of the floating system under regular and focused waves were ran and it has been shown with reasonable validations that the coupled 6 dof rigid body motion solver was able to capture the wave loads on the floating wind turbine and determine its response these wave impact forces produced from non linear wave interaction also includes complex interactions between the restrain tendons and the floating structure beyond the current validation study the simulations could be adapted to allow testing out of different setup configurations for design optimisation of the restrains and allowable maximum displacements reducing the need to perform many different physical experiments in the wave basin 4 1 recommendations and future works in the validation tests with experimental data several problems were encountered firstly the wave generation boundary conditions from the ihfoam libraries were not able to generate a good representation of less severe sea states i e ec05 this may not be a problem in the current study due to the preferences for validating more severe sea states running the cases with smaller wave heights and periods may however provide useful insight on specific cases secondly the lack of a good representation of focused waves in the simulations comparable to the experiments has prevented comparison of the results for the cases an alternative wave generation absorption package waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 could be a good option for application to the current cases or reference to improve the present implementation acknowledgements the first author would like to

23076,this study utilizes the life cycle assessment method to compare the environmental impacts of two design concepts of a panamax bulk carrier lighter and heavier lightship weights the lighter

applications of lca in the shipping sector lca method which is defined in iso 14040 is the compilation and evaluation of the inputs outputs and potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle iso 2006 the framework of lca includes four steps as shown in fig 2 according to curran 2017 the first step goal and scope definition should be defined at the beginning of the study the information of materials energy and emissions in the system is collected in the inventory analysis step the environmental impacts are clarified in the impact assessment step and finally

cycle cost of ships although lca and some tools have been used fet et al 2013 pointed out that there is not a holistic approach to assess the environmental effect in the ship design stage in the last

some important lca studies on maritime power systems were carried out by ling chin and roskilly 2016a ling chin et al 2016d ling chin and roskilly 2016b and ling chin and roskilly 2016c there are some valuable contributions of these studies that are worthy of mentioning here first an in depth review of lca development and an lca framework for marine power systems were presented in ling chin et al 2016d second the lca of a power system plant on board a cargo ship was evaluated ling chin and roskilly 2016c the environmental impacts of a new build hybrid marine system were estimated ling chin and roskilly 2016b finally these impacts were compared with new build systems and conventional marine systems ling chin and roskilly 2016a in these studies the information of materials energy and emissions was considered adequately especially in eol phase all the results above were presented in j ling chin s doctoral thesis ling chin 2016 several studies have been carried out to compare the environmental impacts of different technologies by using the lca method blanco davis et al 2014 compared gwp global warming potential of the conventional antifouling and the alternative application the gwp categories of ultraviolet irradiation cavitation and de oxygenation ballast water treatment technologies on a ship were analyzed by blanco davis and zhou 2014 to show the influence of material on the co2 emissions in the shipbuilding industry gilbert et al 2017 pointed out that 100 and 50 hull reuse reduce 29 and 10 emissions respectively the emissions of alternative fuels in shipping transportation were also examined in bengtsson et al 2011a 2011b 2012 bicer and dincer 2017 gilbert et al 2018 hua et al 2017 winebrake et al 2012 due to the negative effects of ship dismantling activities on the environment and human health arguello moncayo 2016 chang et al 2010 rahman et al 2016 applied the lca method to evaluate the environmental impacts in the ship s eol phase they evaluated the energy consumption and emissions when dismantling the retired ships and recycling materials in chittagong and dhaka bangladesh a dismantling plan was also developed to protect humans from the environmental impacts in this phase hiremath et al 2016 ko et al 2015 and ko and gantner 2016 showed considerable imbalance between the economic benefits and environmental impacts in each life cycle phase of ships these researchers indicated that the european owners gain most of the economic benefits whereas shipbuilders and dismantlers in asia have to suffer higher environmental impacts 1 3 purpose of the study in the shipping sector a plausible explanation is that a lighter hull ship could generate more economic benefits as it could reduce the initial capital for materials to build the ship and increase cargo capacity however gratsos and zachariadis 2005 indicated that the ship built with higher ldt has a lower life cycle cost per year than the ship has minimum ldt in addition by reducing material consumption and cutting down emissions emitted from sbd and mtn gratsos et al 2010 supposed that the heavier hull solution could cut down grams of co2 per ton kilometer from a life cycle perspective while co2 emissions contribute more towards climate change than the other emissions estimating only co2 emissions is not enough because it does not depict a holistic perspective of the impact of a ship on the environment ling chin and roskilly 2016b this study attempts to compare the environmental performance of a panamax bulk carrier with two different design concepts as presented in gratsos et al 2010 in more details not limited to co2 as in gratsos et al 2010 regarding the requirements given in annex vi of marpol two types of fuels hfo and lshfo are used in this study hfo is used for global shipping transportation whereas lshfo is used for the ship operating in secas an attributional lca approach is applied in this study this type of lca method focuses on clarifying the environmental performance of the activities that specifically participate to a product s property prox and curran 2017 the objectives of the research are to i review recent applications of the lca method in the shipping sector ii gather the inputs and outputs data in the ship s life cycle phases and iii evaluate the life cycle emissions and environmental impacts of the panamax bulk carrier with p20 and p30 solutions the main novelty is the comparison between the environmental performances of two different ship design concepts from a life cycle perspective moreover this study is an evidence of the advantages of the lca method in the shipping sector this study is divided into four main sections after a brief overview in this section section 2 presents the lca method the findings are reported in section 3 and some conclusions are drawn in the final section 2 the lca method 2 1 goal and scope definition as presented above the reason for carrying out this study is to compare the environmental impacts of two ship design concepts with different corrosion margins by using the lca method the applications are to provide information to the research community and assist naval architects to make decisions in the ship design stage moreover this study is an example of the advantages of lca while the applications of this method in the maritime industry are still limited wang et al 2018a maritime stakeholders naval architects ship owners and the public are the intended audience of the study the reference ship is a panamax bulk carrier which is taken from gratsos et al 2010 this ship is designed with different design concepts namely p20 and p30 p20 represents for the concept of carry cargo not steel this solution is in accordance with iacs s new common structural rules which has lighter ldt in order to increase the cargo capacity and reduce the initial cost on the other hand p30 is designed to reduce environmental pollution and save the world s resources gratsos et al 2010 p30 solution is identified from p20 but it has higher ldt by increasing the thickness of the ship s components and steel plates fig 3 these two ships have different lifespans i e 20 years for p20 and 30 years for p30 and were clearly depicted in gratsos et al 2010 gratsos and zachariadis 2005 during the lifetime the ship s structure is affected by various factors including corrosion and fatigue these two factors lead to some reductions in the thickness of the ship s parts and components and lessens the strength of the ship dong and frangopol 2015 therefore specific periodic mtn inspection is required for each type of ships to find out and replace or repair the parts that do not meet the requirements det norske veritas 2003 as p30 has higher the corrosion allowance margins and is more robust than p20 after 15 years of operation only 20 ton of steel is replaced for p30 on the other hand at the age of 10 p20 consumes 150 ton of steel for the replacement table 1 in the life cycle 1700 and 900 ton of steel are consumed in mtn for p20 and p30 respectively the average steel weight rate of 7 ton per day is assumed for repairing bulk carriers in china shipyards gratsos et al 2010 thus p30 could reduce time in mtn phase in comparison with p20 since the main function of cargo ships is to transport good the functional unit is defined as the transport of one ton of bulk cargo unpacked cargo over a distance of one kilometer by sea during t years of service t 20 for p20 and t 30 for p30 life cycle emissions and environmental impacts will be calculated per one functional unit in order to compare the environmental performances of two design solutions fig 4 illustrates the diagram of system boundary with energy materials and emissions flows f r sbd op mtn trans and ship s eol are considered in this study meanwhile human factor is excluded the information of material energy consumption and emissions is presented in section 2 2 it is worth mentioning that although these two ships have different ldt they have the same hull form displacement dimensions speed except fuel consumption and payload ldt is considered to be the steel weight while the other materials are ignored in this study fuel consumption is constant in the ship s lifetime regardless of the effect of weather added resistance etc the scope is presented throughout section 2 table 2 presents the processes that are considered in the ship s life cycle phases some typical emissions in the ship s life cycle i e co2 co sox so2 nox n2o ch4 voc nmvoc and pm will be evaluated a mid point lcia methodology cml2001 is chosen for calculating lcia results in this study this methodology is developed by the institute of environmental sciences leiden university thinkstep 1992 2016 the environmental indicators of cml2001 are chosen to investigate the environmental impacts table 3 gwp and htp are two emblematic environmental impacts which could summarize the global environmental problem these two indicators could give a broad impact on climate change and human health ko and gantner 2016 in order to compare the natural resources and energy consumptions adpe and adpf are included maetp faetp and tetp can show the potential toxicity effect of the shipping sector on the marine environment fresh water and terrestric ap ep odp and pocp are used to validate the impacts on the natural creature and the stratospheric ozone layer these 12 environmental impacts in cml are relevant to the marine context except odp is at a minimal level after the ban on halons ling chin and roskilly 2016b these indicators are also included in the gabi software weighting method which is an optional step in the lca method is used in this study this step is used to make the environmental aspects easier for decision making process itsubo 2015 2 2 life cycle inventory analysis the data in each phase of the ship s life cycle are presented in this section 2 2 1 raw material extraction and steel fabrication raw material extraction and steel fabrication stages are aggregated in one process in gabi the steel weight is calculated based on ldt with the consideration of 10 lost during sbd and mtn stages johnsen and fet 1998 for more information about the difference between ldt of ships and additional ship factors the reader should refer to gratsos et al 2010 table 4 shows the material consumption in the ship life cycle 2 2 2 processes in sbd mtn and eol phases 2 2 2 1 cutting welding processes and energy consumption in shipyards in sbd and mtn phases the initial steel weight includes ldt and the loss of steel during cutting process which is assumed 10 ldt johnsen and fet 1998 it is assumed that 95 of steel lost in the cutting process is used for recycling and 5 of steel lost is considered to be solid waste metal fume and irrevocable metal johnsen and fet 1998 in sbd phase electricity consumption is calculated according to the steel weight kameyama et al 2007 estimated that 1 7 106 kwh was used to construct a bulk carrier which has 11 000 ton of ldt equivalent to 154 55 kwh per ton of steel therefore electricity consumptions in sbd are 1 968 812 kwh for p20 and 2 074 061 kwh for p30 in mtn phase electricity consumption is also calculated according to the steel replacement weight electricity consumptions for p20 and p30 in this phase are 293 645 kwh and 139 095 kwh respectively the cutting off the old steel process from the ship used propane as cutting gas and the weight of new steel is equal to the removal steel gratsos et al 2010 estimated that 60 kg of propane is used to cut one ton of steel and the co2 emissions are three times more than propane in weight the production of propane is also considered in the ship s eol after cutting process materials will be transported to the ship recycling yards for bulk carriers 10 16 steel is considered to be lost and becomes solid waste after cutting process hess et al 2001 in this study 90 of steel weight is assumed to be recycled after dismantling therefore the recycled steel weights in this process are 10 260 and 10 980 ton for p20 and p30 respectively emissions from cutting and welding processes include metal fume and nox national pollutant inventory 1999c oecd 2010 emission factors from these processes are taken from national pollutant inventory 1999c 2 2 2 2 abrasive sandblasting in sbd phase sand consumption in sandblasting activities depends on the total surface area tsa chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2015 gilbert et al 2017 johnsen and fet 1998 the main emission in this activities is pm and its emission factors are taken from national pollutant inventory 1999b table 5 emission factors of pm in sandblasting activities depend on wind speed in this study wind speed is assumed to be 16 km h emission factor of pm is 55 kg per ton of abrasive sand since p20 has the same sand consumption as p30 due to the same tsa value these two ships have the same pm amount in sbd phase tsa is estimated based on transocean coatings 2014 in mtn phase sand consumption is not calculated according to tsa because of lack of information the sand consumption in this phase is estimated according to the percentage of steel weight replaced the percentages of steel weight replacement of p20 and p30 are 14 91 and 7 38 of steel weight in sbd respectively 2 2 2 3 painting emission factors from painting process shown in table 6 are taken from johnsen and fet 1998 similar to sandblasting process two investigated ships have the same emissions amounts from this process in sbd phase the emissions amounts are calculated based on the painting area in sbd phase a long half life organotin compound kim et al 2015 tributyltin is also considered in this research in mtn phase chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2015 estimated that voc emissions account for 74 of the total voc in the life cycle and this amount is 2 89 times more than in sbd in this study the emissions amount of painting process in mtn phase is assumed to equal to 2 89 times in sbd phase for p20 then emissions of p30 are calculated based on the ratio of replacement steel weight between p30 and p20 2 2 2 4 sea trials sea trials are carried out after completing all activities in the shipyard and before the first operation voyage of ships emissions from sea trials depend on fuel consumption fuel consumption is calculated from the duration of trials and the specification of engines chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2015 kameyama et al 2007 estimated that a panamax bulker which has an 8830 kw main engine consumes about 1 8 105 kwh bunker oil in sea trials for simplicity fuel consumption is estimated through the main engine power p20 and p30 have the same fuel consumption due to the same main engine each ship consumes 32 22 ton hfo in sea trials the emission factors of this process are the same as op phase section 2 2 4 2 2 3 material transportation information about transportation in this section is taken from gratsos et al 2010 the mean of transportation is a bulk carrier which is modeled in gabi the transportation of raw materials to mill factory is estimated from hedland port australia to busan korea with the average distance of 6452 km the amount of raw materials is estimated by 2 66 times steel weight in sbd and mtn with the consideration of 10 steel loss the residue steel in mtn sbd and the steel in eol is transported from chittagong bangladesh to dalian china with the average distance of 7760 km besides shipping transportation trucks are used to transport steel from port to the shipyard and the average distance is 100 km 2 2 4 ship operation the number of operating days per year of p20 is smaller than p30 351 and 359 days for p20 and p30 respectively this is because the time consumption in mtn of p20 is more than that of p30 as presented in section 2 1 the lighter ldt solution leads to an increase in payload of p20 in comparison with p30 information about op is shown in table 7 while emission factors of hfo and lshfo are taken from gilbert et al 2018 smith et al 2015 life cycle inventory of the study is summarized in table 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis presentation due to data uncertainty contained in this study a sensitivity analysis is carried out with 15 assumptions table 9 assumptions 1 5 relate to the weights of material in the ship s life cycle assumption 1 relates to the weight of material transported to the steel mill assumption 2 represents for the weight of material consumed in the shipyard for assumption 3 the baseline percentage of steel recovery from steel lost in the shipyard is 95 the upper limit 5 is possible for the most optimistic case nearly 100 steel lost in cutting process is recycled whereas the upper limit 30 is possible for the less optimistic case it is worth noting that the variation in the steel replacement weight could vary time consumption in mtn therefore assumption 4 will affect the number of operating days per year since the range of steel recovery rate for bulk carriers is quite narrow 84 90 hess et al 2001 the variation of assumption 5 is chosen with the range of 5 assumptions 6 11 are responsible for data uncertainty in sbd mtn and eol since the difference between the number of operating days of p20 and p30 is not significant 351 and 359 days per year for p20 and p30 respectively the chosen variation range of the operating days per year is only 2 days assumption 12 the variation in this assumption still keeps the number of operating days of p20 not exceed that of p30 as the steel replacement weight of p20 is higher than p30 assumptions 13 15 are responsible for data uncertainty in the transportation activities the arithmetic average of lower and upper limit results in each assumption is equal to the result in the baseline except for assumptions 3 4 9 and 12 the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented together with the emissions and environmental impacts through figs 5 29 and tables 10 14 3 2 emissions inventory fig 5 presents the contribution of the life cycle phases to the emissions inventory for p20 and p30 solutions with two fuel types for co2 nox n2o sox nmvoc and pm emissions fuel consumption in op is the primary contributor results in more than 90 of emissions in the life cycle especially for nox and sox with more than 99 released from op considerable amounts of co and ch4 emissions are released from f r and thanks to the steel recovery in the ship s eol these two emissions could be cut down significantly steel recovery also slightly reduces co2 n2o and pm emissions in the life cycles painting activities in sbd and mtn are major contributors to voc emissions which account for 25 71 39 52 and 60 47 74 29 of total voc respectively from a life cycle perspective p30 solution could reduce emissions from wop whilst there are increases in emissions from op in comparison with p20 solution table 10 illustrates the average grams of co2 emissions per ton km in general p30 solution could reduce co2 emissions emitted from f r sbd mtn and trans whereas this solution generates more co2 emissions than p20 in op it is worth noting that the total co2 amount of p30 is higher than p20 4 674 4 706 4 442 and 4 469 g ton km co2 for p20 hfo p30 hfo p20 lshfo and p30 lshfo respectively and this is contrary to the results in gratsos et al 2010 the reason for this contrary is that the steel recovery which could cut down co2 emissions is not covered in gratsos et al 2010 the emissions results are presented in figs 6 14 in these charts u and l e g 1 u 1 l are responsible for the upper and lower limits of each assumption range considering the type of fuels the use of lshfo could slightly reduce the emissions but the comparisons between p20 and p30 results are the same for two types of fuels regarding the baseline when p30 solution is applied considerable reductions in co ch4 and voc emissions could be achieved figs 7 9 for instance material consumption reduction in p30 solution results in 4 51 4 82 reductions in total co emissions i e 5 070e 03 4 841e 03 4 848e 03 and 4 614e 03 g ton km for p20 hfo p30 hfo p20 lshfo and p30 lshfo respectively this is due to the great amounts of co ch4 and voc emissions released from wop for ch4 fig 8 these reductions are 2 48 and 2 62 in case of hfo and lshfo respectively the reductions in material consumption and mtn activities also lead to a significant reduction of voc emissions consequently p30 provides a 56 64 reduction in voc emissions in comparison with p20 solution only 4 063e 05 g ton km voc emissions is released in p30 solution whilst the result for p20 is 9 371e 05 g ton km fig 9 as nmvoc nox n2o sox and pm are mostly released from op the reductions of these emissions from wop are not enough to reduce the life cycle emissions of p30 for example in case of hfo p30 could reduce 5 081e 05 g ton km pm in wop equivalent to 37 24 reduction in comparison with p20 but this reduction only accounts for approximately 0 55 of total pm although the emissions amounts from p20 are still lower than p30 the differences between p20 and p30 are not considerable i e p30 hfo is only 0 41 2 19 1 52 2 28 and 1 70 higher than p20 hfo solution for nmvoc nox n2o sox and pm respectively the comparison between p20 and p30 solutions is illustrated in table 11 the life cycle emissions inventory presented above leads to a worthy of note in this study p30 solutions could reduce co2 emissions as presented in gratsos et al 2010 but this is not the case when the entire life cycle including steel recovery is considered adequately furthermore it is uncertain that the other emissions could be reduced when p30 solution is applied in spite of the dominance of co2 emissions in amount the other emissions as well as environmental impacts of a ship should be considered carefully these emissions results also show the advantages of the lca method in the ship industry regarding the sensitivity analysis p30 could effectively reduce only voc emissions fig 9 meanwhile nox and sox could be effectively reduced by applying p20 solution figs 11 and 13 table 12 shows that the most influential assumptions are assumptions 4 5 8 and 12 the effects of assumptions relating to material transportation are negligible the co and voc emissions are significantly affected by the variation in the steel replacement weight and tsa of the ship s hull respectively i e the variation in co results ranges around 5 for hfo 2 for lshfo for voc this variation range is nearly 20 the steel replacement weight and the number of operation days assumptions 4 and 8 are most influential in the other emissions results with the ranges not exceeding 2 2 3 3 environmental indicators the contribution of each life cycle phase to the environmental impacts is presented in fig 15 the share of some environmental impacts of life cycle phases relatively fits with the findings in burman et al 2015 favi et al 2018a b johnsen and fet 1998 it can be seen that fuel consumption in op significantly accounts for eight categories adpf ap ep faetp gwp gwpe htp and pocp i e more than 85 of the life cycle environmental impacts especially fuel consumption in op is nearly fully accountable for ap ep and faetp indicators nevertheless wop shows a considerable contribution for adpe maetp odp and tetp adpe is fully affected by f r and eol thanks to the steel recovery the impacts of maetp and tetp are significantly reduced eol also slightly reduces the impacts of adpf gwp gwpe htp and pocp but with less important effects than maetp and tetp similar to the life cycle emissions inventory from a life cycle perspective p30 solution could reduce the environmental impacts from wop whilst this solution increases the impacts on the environment from op in comparison with p20 solution the environmental impacts of p20 and p30 solutions and the sensitivity analysis results are illustrated in figs 16 27 similar to the emissions results the impacts on the environment of using hfo are slightly higher than lshfo but the comparison results between p20 and p30 are the same for two types of fuels regarding the baseline p30 solution reduces on four categories adpe maetp odp and tetp due to the considerable contribution of wop these four indicators decline considerably when p30 solution is applied figs 16 21 22 and 24 for adpe material consumption reduction reduces from 1 936e 02 to 1 187e 02 kg antimony equiv ton km equivalent to 38 69 reduction in comparison with p20 for both types of fuels material consumption reduction results in 18 29 19 74 reduction in maetp i e the estimated results are 7 255e 02 5 928e 02 6 641e 02 and 5 330e 02 kg dichlorobenzene equiv ton km for p20 hfo p30 hfo p20 lshfo and p30 lshfo respectively p30 solution also provides a reduction in electricity consumption in sbd and mtn and therefore tetp and odp show 3 60 7 09 and 21 29 21 58 reductions respectively on the other hand p30 solution could not cut down the impacts on adpf ap ep faetp gwp gwpe htp and pocp due to the dominance of fuel consumption in so2 and nox generation in the total life cycle p30 solution could not reduce the environmental impacts of ap ep and faetp categories figs 25 27 for ap p20 hfo p30 hfo p20 lshfo and p30 lshfo account for 1 339e 04 1 367e 04 8 683e 05 and 8 857e 05 kg sulfur dioxide equiv ton km respectively these results show 2 09 and 2 00 increase of p30 in case of hfo and lshfo respectively p30 increases 2 14 2 15 ep and 1 43 faetp in comparison with p20 solution for adpf gwp gwpe htp and pocp p30 solution shows slight increases which range 0 66 0 72 0 63 0 64 0 63 0 64 0 98 1 16 and 0 60 0 99 respectively figs 17 20 and 23 this is due to the dominant contribution of op to these indicators the results of 12 indicators are presented in table 13 table 14 shows that the most influential assumptions in the environmental impacts are assumptions 4 5 and 12 adpe results are greatly affected by the weight of steel replacement and steel recovery assumption 4 and 5 with the ranges of 29 152 29 557 and 22 687 for p20 and p30 respectively assumptions 4 and 12 are highly sensitive to most indicators whereas maetp of p30 and odp of both p20 and p30 solutions are the most sensitive to assumption 5 the sensitivity analysis results illustrated in table 14 and figs 16 27 indicate that p30 could reduce effectively the impacts of tetp odp and maetp on the other hand this solution is more environmentally damaging on ep and ap than p20 solution 3 4 weighting method and final environmental scores similar to the life cycle emissions and environmental impacts results the scores of p20 are lower than p30 in op and higher than p30 in wop for both hfo and lshfo in op p20 has higher scores than the p30 0 9645 0 8773 0 9247 and 0 8366 score ton km for p20 hfo p30 hfo p20 lshfo and p30 lshfo respectively the results of environmental scores and sensitivity analysis are presented in figs 28 and 29 the environmental scores of both two models are the most sensitive to the weight of steel replacement which is affected around 2 80 for p20 and 1 00 for p30 based on the scores comparison and the sensitivity analysis results fig 29 the ship with heavier ldt has better environmental performance than the lighter one one question should be considered here is that how long should the ship s lifespan be to minimize environmental impacts as observed from the environmental scores above p30 solution could reduce the burdens on the environment in comparison with p20 but it does not necessarily mean that 30 year lifespan solution is more environmentally friendly than other lifespan solutions it is necessary to carry out a comparative research of different lifespan scenarios i e 23 25 27 year lifespans in terms of the environment in which lca could be an applicable tool to clarify this question detailed information in each scenario such as materials and energy in sbd and mtn time consumption for mtn activities cargo capacity etc should be clarified 4 conclusions by applying lca method this study compares the environmental impacts of two different design solutions p20 and p30 of a panamax bulk carrier p20 represents the lighter hull ship solution that could increase the cargo capacity of the ship while p30 is designed with heavier ldt in order to increase the corrosion margins of the ship s structure and cut down time consumption in mtn some recent applications of the lca method in the shipping sector have been reviewed necessary data in the life cycle phases of the ship have been collected and the results are calculated by using gabi software cml2001 is chosen as the methodology for impact assessment a sensitivity analysis is also conducted to show the impacts of data uncertainty on emissions and environmental impacts results from a life cycle perspective the results of this study indicate that p30 could effectively reduce voc emissions whereas this solution does not reduce nox and sox for environmental indicators p30 solution reduces impacts on three categories tetp 3 60 7 09 odp 21 29 21 58 and maetp 18 29 19 74 in comparison with p20 however the lighter ldt solution is less environmentally damaging in ap and ep categories the environmental scores results show that the more robust ship with heavier ldt has better environmental performance than the lighter one this is because the p30 solution could cut down material energy consumption and emissions from wop regarding the types of fuels hfo has slightly stronger impacts on the environment than lshfo but the comparison results between p20 and p30 remains unchanged this study also proves that the lca is an applicable and effective tool to evaluate the environmental impacts of a ship the lca should be applied in the design stage to evaluate the environmental impacts in a ship s life cycle future

23076,this study utilizes the life cycle assessment method to compare the environmental impacts of two design concepts of a panamax bulk carrier lighter and heavier lightship weights the lighter solution is designed to maximize the payload by cutting down the lightship weight on the other hand the heavier solution increases the thickness of some components of the ship to enlarge corrosion addition margins this also increases the lightship weight in comparison with the lighter solution in addition the heavier solution could cut down the steel replacement consumed for maintenance activities in its life cycle regarding the requirements for global shipping transportation and for the ships operating in sulfur emission control areas presented in the international prevention of pollution from ships heavy fuel oil and low sulfur heavy fuel oil are considered the results indicate that the heavier solution could reduce up to 4 83 carbon monoxide 2 62 methane and 56 64 volatile organic compounds in comparison with the lighter solution over their lifetimes the heavier solution reduces the environmental impacts on marine aquatic ecotoxicity ozone layer depletion and terrestric

cargo transported by ships was proposed to treble by 2030 chapman 2007 emissions from seaborne transportation accounted for only 2 1 of global co2 equiv ghg emissions in 2012 smith et al 2015 but these emissions are still significant since they are even higher than the united kingdom s emissions bodansky 2016 in the third imo ghg report by 2050 co2 emissions were forecasted to grow up to 250 compared to 2007 smith et al 2015 although maritime shipping is considered a quite clean transport mode it has been criticized for slowly reducing air emissions in order to achieve global agreements chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2015 emissions from shipping activities include ghgs co2 ch4 and n2o and some local pollutants sox nox and pm ghgs could worsen global climate change while the concentrations of local pollutants are high along the coastlines and ports liu et al 2018 the local pollutants affect human health as well as ecosystems bilgili and celebi 2018 to reduce the effects of shipping emissions in annex vi of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol imo has required sulfur content s in marine fuels is no larger than 0 5 by 2020 globally and 0 1 in sulfur emission control areas secas by 2015 fig 1 a ship goes through its life cycle including f r sbd op mtn and eol phases in each phase materials i e steel copper wood and energy i e electricity fuel oil are consumed and at the same a huge amount of emissions is generated to the environment although op accounts for the majority of life cycle emissions the other phases wop also have noticeable impacts on the environment johnsen and fet 1998 some emissions such as metal fume voc and pm are exhausted from cutting welding sandblasting and painting activities in shipyards which could affect the environment and human health oecd 2010 to access the environmental performance of a ship it is necessary to apply a holistic approach in its life cycle 1 2 applications of lca in the shipping sector lca method which is defined in iso 14040 is the compilation and evaluation of the inputs outputs and potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle iso 2006 the framework of lca includes four steps as shown in fig 2 according to curran 2017 the first step goal and scope definition should be defined at the beginning of the study the information of materials energy and emissions in the system is collected in the inventory analysis step the environmental impacts are clarified in the impact assessment step and finally the results will be clarified in the interpretation step to help decision makers reach the final decision although lca has some limitations there is a significant rise in the applications of it curran 2014 due to the complexity of the ship system few studies applying the lca method in the shipping sector have been published some first systematic studies on the lca of ships and shipping transportation were carried out by johnsen and fet 1998 fet 1998 fet and sørgård 1999 fet 1999 angelfoss et al 1999 karlsen and angelfoss 2000 johnsen 2000b johnsen 2000a fet et al 2000 and fet 2002 the importance of applying lca in the shipping sector and the detailed ship s life cycle were highlighted in shama 2005 two software applications were developed in this period such as a japanese application michihiro et al 2004 and ssd sustainable ship design tincelin et al 2010 favi et al 2018a b also suggested an lca tool which is useful for estimating the environmental impacts and life cycle cost of ships although lca and some tools have been used fet et al 2013 pointed out that there is not a holistic approach to assess the environmental effect in the ship design stage in the last few years studies on lca ship have become more available than before lca was used by mountaneas et al 2015 to evaluate the environmental impacts of a tanker bulk carrier and container ship in a detailed study chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2015 used a mathematical framework to estimate emissions of a panamax tanker from a life cycle perspective before that these authors developed a system that is suitable for the life cycle of ships chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2014a b chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2013 chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2014a b they also dedicated that researchers can make a holistic comparison among alternative designs and products to have a beneficial design for the environment chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2016 in order to estimate the total amount of some emissions co2 co nox n2o sox pm2 5 and ch4 of bulk carriers bilgili and celebi 2018 provided some equations which are based on deadweight dwt and block coefficient cb of ships favi et al 2017 suggested a flexible life cycle model which is suitable for various vessel types wang and his collaborators compared the environmental impacts and life cycle cost of a hybrid ferry with different mtn solutions jeong et al 2018 wang et al 2018a and with different power systems wang et al 2018b this research team also presented a framework for lca and life cycle cost to select optimum marine propulsion systems and applied this framework to a hybrid ferry and a tug boat jeong et al 2018 lca method has been also used for small boats in bardet 2010 burman et al 2015 cucinotta et al 2017 pommier et al 2015 in 2016 some important lca studies on maritime power systems were carried out by ling chin and roskilly 2016a ling chin et al 2016d ling chin and roskilly 2016b and ling chin and roskilly 2016c there are some valuable contributions of these studies that are worthy of mentioning here first an in depth review of lca development and an lca framework for marine power systems were presented in ling chin et al 2016d second the lca of a power system plant on board a cargo ship was evaluated ling chin and roskilly 2016c the environmental impacts of a new build hybrid marine system were estimated ling chin and roskilly 2016b finally these impacts were compared with new build systems and conventional marine systems ling chin and roskilly 2016a in these studies the information of materials energy and emissions was considered adequately especially in eol phase all the results above were presented in j ling chin s doctoral thesis ling chin 2016 several studies have been carried out to compare the environmental impacts of different technologies by using the lca method blanco davis et al 2014 compared gwp global warming potential of the conventional antifouling and the alternative application the gwp categories of ultraviolet irradiation cavitation and de oxygenation ballast water treatment technologies on a ship were analyzed by blanco davis and zhou 2014 to show the influence of material on the co2 emissions in the shipbuilding industry gilbert et al 2017 pointed out that 100 and 50 hull reuse reduce 29 and 10 emissions respectively the emissions of alternative fuels in shipping transportation were also examined in bengtsson et al 2011a 2011b 2012 bicer and dincer 2017 gilbert et al 2018 hua et al 2017 winebrake et al 2012 due to the negative effects of ship dismantling activities on the environment and human health arguello moncayo 2016 chang et al 2010 rahman et al 2016 applied the lca method to evaluate the environmental impacts in the ship s eol phase they evaluated the energy consumption and emissions when dismantling the retired ships and recycling materials in chittagong and dhaka bangladesh a dismantling plan was also developed to protect humans from the environmental impacts in this phase hiremath et al 2016 ko et al 2015 and ko and gantner 2016 showed considerable imbalance between the economic benefits and environmental impacts in each life cycle phase of ships these researchers indicated that the european owners gain most of the economic benefits whereas shipbuilders and dismantlers in asia have to suffer higher environmental impacts 1 3 purpose of the study in the shipping sector a plausible explanation is that a lighter hull ship could generate more economic benefits as it could reduce the initial capital for materials to build the ship and increase cargo capacity however gratsos and zachariadis 2005 indicated that the ship built with higher ldt has a lower life cycle cost per year than the ship has minimum ldt in addition by reducing material consumption and cutting down emissions emitted from sbd and mtn gratsos et al 2010 supposed that the heavier hull solution could cut down grams of co2 per ton kilometer from a life cycle perspective while co2 emissions contribute more towards climate change than the other emissions estimating only co2 emissions is not enough because it does not depict a holistic perspective of the impact of a ship on the environment ling chin and roskilly 2016b this study attempts to compare the environmental performance of a panamax bulk carrier with two different design concepts as presented in gratsos et al 2010 in more details not limited to co2 as in gratsos et al 2010 regarding the requirements given in annex vi of marpol two types of fuels hfo and lshfo are used in this study hfo is used for global shipping transportation whereas lshfo is used for the ship operating in secas an attributional lca approach is applied in this study this type of lca method focuses on clarifying the environmental performance of the activities that specifically participate to a product s property prox and curran 2017 the objectives of the research are to i review recent applications of the lca method in the shipping sector ii gather the inputs and outputs data in the ship s life cycle phases and iii evaluate the life cycle emissions and environmental impacts of the panamax bulk carrier with p20 and p30 solutions the main novelty is the comparison between the environmental performances of two different ship design concepts from a life cycle perspective moreover this study is an evidence of the advantages of the lca method in the shipping sector this study is divided into four main sections after a brief overview in this section section 2 presents the lca method the findings are reported in section 3 and some conclusions are drawn in the final section 2 the lca method 2 1 goal and scope definition as presented above the reason for carrying out this study is to compare the environmental impacts of two ship design concepts with different corrosion margins by using the lca method the applications are to provide information to the research community and assist naval architects to make decisions in the ship design stage moreover this study is an example of the advantages of lca while the applications of this method in the maritime industry are still limited wang et al 2018a maritime stakeholders naval architects ship owners and the public are the intended audience of the study the reference ship is a panamax bulk carrier which is taken from gratsos et al 2010 this ship is designed with different design concepts namely p20 and p30 p20 represents for the concept of carry cargo not steel this solution is in accordance with iacs s new common structural rules which has lighter ldt in order to increase the cargo capacity and reduce the initial cost on the other hand p30 is designed to reduce environmental pollution and save the world s resources gratsos et al 2010 p30 solution is identified from p20 but it has higher ldt by increasing the thickness of the ship s components and steel plates fig 3 these two ships have different lifespans i e 20 years for p20 and 30 years for p30 and were clearly depicted in gratsos et al 2010 gratsos and zachariadis 2005 during the lifetime the ship s structure is affected by various factors including corrosion and fatigue these two factors lead to some reductions in the thickness of the ship s parts and components and lessens the strength of the ship dong and frangopol 2015 therefore specific periodic mtn inspection is required for each type of ships to find out and replace or repair the parts that do not meet the requirements det norske veritas 2003 as p30 has higher the corrosion allowance margins and is more robust than p20 after 15 years of operation only 20 ton of steel is replaced for p30 on the other hand at the age of 10 p20 consumes 150 ton of steel for the replacement table 1 in the life cycle 1700 and 900 ton of steel are consumed in mtn for p20 and p30 respectively the average steel weight rate of 7 ton per day is assumed for repairing bulk carriers in china shipyards gratsos et al 2010 thus p30 could reduce time in mtn phase in comparison with p20 since the main function of cargo ships is to transport good the functional unit is defined as the transport of one ton of bulk cargo unpacked cargo over a distance of one kilometer by sea during t years of service t 20 for p20 and t 30 for p30 life cycle emissions and environmental impacts will be calculated per one functional unit in order to compare the environmental performances of two design solutions fig 4 illustrates the diagram of system boundary with energy materials and emissions flows f r sbd op mtn trans and ship s eol are considered in this study meanwhile human factor is excluded the information of material energy consumption and emissions is presented in section 2 2 it is worth mentioning that although these two ships have different ldt they have the same hull form displacement dimensions speed except fuel consumption and payload ldt is considered to be the steel weight while the other materials are ignored in this study fuel consumption is constant in the ship s lifetime regardless of the effect of weather added resistance etc the scope is presented throughout section 2 table 2 presents the processes that are considered in the ship s life cycle phases some typical emissions in the ship s life cycle i e co2 co sox so2 nox n2o ch4 voc nmvoc and pm will be evaluated a mid point lcia methodology cml2001 is chosen for calculating lcia results in this study this methodology is developed by the institute of environmental sciences leiden university thinkstep 1992 2016 the environmental indicators of cml2001 are chosen to investigate the environmental impacts table 3 gwp and htp are two emblematic environmental impacts which could summarize the global environmental problem these two indicators could give a broad impact on climate change and human health ko and gantner 2016 in order to compare the natural resources and energy consumptions adpe and adpf are included maetp faetp and tetp can show the potential toxicity effect of the shipping sector on the marine environment fresh water and terrestric ap ep odp and pocp are used to validate the impacts on the natural creature and the stratospheric ozone layer these 12 environmental impacts in cml are relevant to the marine context except odp is at a minimal level after the ban on halons ling chin and roskilly 2016b these indicators are also included in the gabi software weighting method which is an optional step in the lca method is used in this study this step is used to make the environmental aspects easier for decision making process itsubo 2015 2 2 life cycle inventory analysis the data in each phase of the ship s life cycle are presented in this section 2 2 1 raw material extraction and steel fabrication raw material extraction and steel fabrication stages are aggregated in one process in gabi the steel weight is calculated based on ldt with the consideration of 10 lost during sbd and mtn stages johnsen and fet 1998 for more information about the difference between ldt of ships and additional ship factors the reader should refer to gratsos et al 2010 table 4 shows the material consumption in the ship life cycle 2 2 2 processes in sbd mtn and eol phases 2 2 2 1 cutting welding processes and energy consumption in shipyards in sbd and mtn phases the initial steel weight includes ldt and the loss of steel during cutting process which is assumed 10 ldt johnsen and fet 1998 it is assumed that 95 of steel lost in the cutting process is used for recycling and 5 of steel lost is considered to be solid waste metal fume and irrevocable metal johnsen and fet 1998 in sbd phase electricity consumption is calculated according to the steel weight kameyama et al 2007 estimated that 1 7 106 kwh was used to construct a bulk carrier which has 11 000 ton of ldt equivalent to 154 55 kwh per ton of steel therefore electricity consumptions in sbd are 1 968 812 kwh for p20 and 2 074 061 kwh for p30 in mtn phase electricity consumption is also calculated according to the steel replacement weight electricity consumptions for p20 and p30 in this phase are 293 645 kwh and 139 095 kwh respectively the cutting off the old steel process from the ship used propane as cutting gas and the weight of new steel is equal to the removal steel gratsos et al 2010 estimated that 60 kg of propane is used to cut one ton of steel and the co2 emissions are three times more than propane in weight the production of propane is also considered in the ship s eol after cutting process materials will be transported to the ship recycling yards for bulk carriers 10 16 steel is considered to be lost and becomes solid waste after cutting process hess et al 2001 in this study 90 of steel weight is assumed to be recycled after dismantling therefore the recycled steel weights in this process are 10 260 and 10 980 ton for p20 and p30 respectively emissions from cutting and welding processes include metal fume and nox national pollutant inventory 1999c oecd 2010 emission factors from these processes are taken from national pollutant inventory 1999c 2 2 2 2 abrasive sandblasting in sbd phase sand consumption in sandblasting activities depends on the total surface area tsa chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2015 gilbert et al 2017 johnsen and fet 1998 the main emission in this activities is pm and its emission factors are taken from national pollutant inventory 1999b table 5 emission factors of pm in sandblasting activities depend on wind speed in this study wind speed is assumed to be 16 km h emission factor of pm is 55 kg per ton of abrasive sand since p20 has the same sand consumption as p30 due to the same tsa value these two ships have the same pm amount in sbd phase tsa is estimated based on transocean coatings 2014 in mtn phase sand consumption is not calculated according to tsa because of lack of information the sand consumption in this phase is estimated according to the percentage of steel weight replaced the percentages of steel weight replacement of p20 and p30 are 14 91 and 7 38 of steel weight in sbd respectively 2 2 2 3 painting emission factors from painting process shown in table 6 are taken from johnsen and fet 1998 similar to sandblasting process two investigated ships have the same emissions amounts from this process in sbd phase the emissions amounts are calculated based on the painting area in sbd phase a long half life organotin compound kim et al 2015 tributyltin is also considered in this research in mtn phase chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2015 estimated that voc emissions account for 74 of the total voc in the life cycle and this amount is 2 89 times more than in sbd in this study the emissions amount of painting process in mtn phase is assumed to equal to 2 89 times in sbd phase for p20 then emissions of p30 are calculated based on the ratio of replacement steel weight between p30 and p20 2 2 2 4 sea trials sea trials are carried out after completing all activities in the shipyard and before the first operation voyage of ships emissions from sea trials depend on fuel consumption fuel consumption is calculated from the duration of trials and the specification of engines chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2015 kameyama et al 2007 estimated that a panamax bulker which has an 8830 kw main engine consumes about 1 8 105 kwh bunker oil in sea trials for simplicity fuel consumption is estimated through the main engine power p20 and p30 have the same fuel consumption due to the same main engine each ship consumes 32 22 ton hfo in sea trials the emission factors of this process are the same as op phase section 2 2 4 2 2 3 material transportation information about transportation in this section is taken from gratsos et al 2010 the mean of transportation is a bulk carrier which is modeled in gabi the transportation of raw materials to mill factory is estimated from hedland port australia to busan korea with the average distance of 6452 km the amount of raw materials is estimated by 2 66 times steel weight in sbd and mtn with the consideration of 10 steel loss the residue steel in mtn sbd and the steel in eol is transported from chittagong bangladesh to dalian china with the average distance of 7760 km besides shipping transportation trucks are used to transport steel from port to the shipyard and the average distance is 100 km 2 2 4 ship operation the number of operating days per year of p20 is smaller than p30 351 and 359 days for p20 and p30 respectively this is because the time consumption in mtn of p20 is more than that of p30 as presented in section 2 1 the lighter ldt solution leads to an increase in payload of p20 in comparison with p30 information about op is shown in table 7 while emission factors of hfo and lshfo are taken from gilbert et al 2018 smith et al 2015 life cycle inventory of the study is summarized in table 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis presentation due to data uncertainty contained in this study a sensitivity analysis is carried out with 15 assumptions table 9 assumptions 1 5 relate to the weights of material in the ship s life cycle assumption 1 relates to the weight of material transported to the steel mill assumption 2 represents for the weight of material consumed in the shipyard for assumption 3 the baseline percentage of steel recovery from steel lost in the shipyard is 95 the upper limit 5 is possible for the most optimistic case nearly 100 steel lost in cutting process is recycled whereas the upper limit 30 is possible for the less optimistic case it is worth noting that the variation in the steel replacement weight could vary time consumption in mtn therefore assumption 4 will affect the number of operating days per year since the range of steel recovery rate for bulk carriers is quite narrow 84 90 hess et al 2001 the variation of assumption 5 is chosen with the range of 5 assumptions 6 11 are responsible for data uncertainty in sbd mtn and eol since the difference between the number of operating days of p20 and p30 is not significant 351 and 359 days per year for p20 and p30 respectively the chosen variation range of the operating days per year is only 2 days assumption 12 the variation in this assumption still keeps the number of operating days of p20 not exceed that of p30 as the steel replacement weight of p20 is higher than p30 assumptions 13 15 are responsible for data uncertainty in the transportation activities the arithmetic average of lower and upper limit results in each assumption is equal to the result in the baseline except for assumptions 3 4 9 and 12 the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented together with the emissions and environmental impacts through figs 5 29 and tables 10 14 3 2 emissions inventory fig 5 presents the contribution of the life cycle phases to the emissions inventory for p20 and p30 solutions with two fuel types for co2 nox n2o sox nmvoc and pm emissions fuel consumption in op is the primary contributor results in more than 90 of emissions in the life cycle especially for nox and sox with more than 99 released from op considerable amounts of co and ch4 emissions are released from f r and thanks to the steel recovery in the ship s eol these two emissions could be cut down significantly steel recovery also slightly reduces co2 n2o and pm emissions in the life cycles painting activities in sbd and mtn are major contributors to voc emissions which account for 25 71 39 52 and 60 47 74 29 of total voc respectively from a life cycle perspective p30 solution could reduce emissions from wop whilst there are increases in emissions from op in comparison with p20 solution table 10 illustrates the average grams of co2 emissions per ton km in general p30 solution could reduce co2 emissions emitted from f r sbd mtn and trans whereas this solution generates more co2 emissions than p20 in op it is worth noting that the total co2 amount of p30 is higher than p20 4 674 4 706 4 442 and 4 469 g ton km co2 for p20 hfo p30 hfo p20 lshfo and p30 lshfo respectively and this is contrary to the results in gratsos et al 2010 the reason for this contrary is that the steel recovery which could cut down co2 emissions is not covered in gratsos et al 2010 the emissions results are presented in figs 6 14 in these charts u and l e g 1 u 1 l are responsible for the upper and lower limits of each assumption range considering the type of fuels the use of lshfo could slightly reduce the emissions but the comparisons between p20 and p30 results are the same for two types of fuels regarding the baseline when p30 solution is applied considerable reductions in co ch4 and voc emissions could be achieved figs 7 9 for instance material consumption reduction in p30 solution results in 4 51 4 82 reductions in total co emissions i e 5 070e 03 4 841e 03 4 848e 03 and 4 614e 03 g ton km for p20 hfo p30 hfo p20 lshfo and p30 lshfo respectively this is due to the great amounts of co ch4 and voc emissions released from wop for ch4 fig 8 these reductions are 2 48 and 2 62 in case of hfo and lshfo respectively the reductions in material consumption and mtn activities also lead to a significant reduction of voc emissions consequently p30 provides a 56 64 reduction in voc emissions in comparison with p20 solution only 4 063e 05 g ton km voc emissions is released in p30 solution whilst the result for p20 is 9 371e 05 g ton km fig 9 as nmvoc nox n2o sox and pm are mostly released from op the reductions of these emissions from wop are not enough to reduce the life cycle emissions of p30 for example in case of hfo p30 could reduce 5 081e 05 g ton km pm in wop equivalent to 37 24 reduction in comparison with p20 but this reduction only accounts for approximately 0 55 of total pm although the emissions amounts from p20 are still lower than p30 the differences between p20 and p30 are not considerable i e p30 hfo is only 0 41 2 19 1 52 2 28 and 1 70 higher than p20 hfo solution for nmvoc nox n2o sox and pm respectively the comparison between p20 and p30 solutions is illustrated in table 11 the life cycle emissions inventory presented above leads to a worthy of note in this study p30 solutions could reduce co2 emissions as presented in gratsos et al 2010 but this is not the case when the entire life cycle including steel recovery is considered adequately furthermore it is uncertain that the other emissions could be reduced when p30 solution is applied in spite of the dominance of co2 emissions in amount the other emissions as well as environmental impacts of a ship should be considered carefully these emissions results also show the advantages of the lca method in the ship industry regarding the sensitivity analysis p30 could effectively reduce only voc emissions fig 9 meanwhile nox and sox could be effectively reduced by applying p20 solution figs 11 and 13 table 12 shows that the most influential assumptions are assumptions 4 5 8 and 12 the effects of assumptions relating to material transportation are negligible the co and voc emissions are significantly affected by the variation in the steel replacement weight and tsa of the ship s hull respectively i e the variation in co results ranges around 5 for hfo 2 for lshfo for voc this variation range is nearly 20 the steel replacement weight and the number of operation days assumptions 4 and 8 are most influential in the other emissions results with the ranges not exceeding 2 2 3 3 environmental indicators the contribution of each life cycle phase to the environmental impacts is presented in fig 15 the share of some environmental impacts of life cycle phases relatively fits with the findings in burman et al 2015 favi et al 2018a b johnsen and fet 1998 it can be seen that fuel consumption in op significantly accounts for eight categories adpf ap ep faetp gwp gwpe htp and pocp i e more than 85 of the life cycle environmental impacts especially fuel consumption in op is nearly fully accountable for ap ep and faetp indicators nevertheless wop shows a considerable contribution for adpe maetp odp and tetp adpe is fully affected by f r and eol thanks to the steel recovery the impacts of maetp and tetp are significantly reduced eol also slightly reduces the impacts of adpf gwp gwpe htp and pocp but with less important effects than maetp and tetp similar to the life cycle emissions inventory from a life cycle perspective p30 solution could reduce the environmental impacts from wop whilst this solution increases the impacts on the environment from op in comparison with p20 solution the environmental impacts of p20 and p30 solutions and the sensitivity analysis results are illustrated in figs 16 27 similar to the emissions results the impacts on the environment of using hfo are slightly higher than lshfo but the comparison results between p20 and p30 are the same for two types of fuels regarding the baseline p30 solution reduces on four categories adpe maetp odp and tetp due to the considerable contribution of wop these four indicators decline considerably when p30 solution is applied figs 16 21 22 and 24 for adpe material consumption reduction reduces from 1 936e 02 to 1 187e 02 kg antimony equiv ton km equivalent to 38 69 reduction in comparison with p20 for both types of fuels material consumption reduction results in 18 29 19 74 reduction in maetp i e the estimated results are 7 255e 02 5 928e 02 6 641e 02 and 5 330e 02 kg dichlorobenzene equiv ton km for p20 hfo p30 hfo p20 lshfo and p30 lshfo respectively p30 solution also provides a reduction in electricity consumption in sbd and mtn and therefore tetp and odp show 3 60 7 09 and 21 29 21 58 reductions respectively on the other hand p30 solution could not cut down the impacts on adpf ap ep faetp gwp gwpe htp and pocp due to the dominance of fuel consumption in so2 and nox generation in the total life cycle p30 solution could not reduce the environmental impacts of ap ep and faetp categories figs 25 27 for ap p20 hfo p30 hfo p20 lshfo and p30 lshfo account for 1 339e 04 1 367e 04 8 683e 05 and 8 857e 05 kg sulfur dioxide equiv ton km respectively these results show 2 09 and 2 00 increase of p30 in case of hfo and lshfo respectively p30 increases 2 14 2 15 ep and 1 43 faetp in comparison with p20 solution for adpf gwp gwpe htp and pocp p30 solution shows slight increases which range 0 66 0 72 0 63 0 64 0 63 0 64 0 98 1 16 and 0 60 0 99 respectively figs 17 20 and 23 this is due to the dominant contribution of op to these indicators the results of 12 indicators are presented in table 13 table 14 shows that the most influential assumptions in the environmental impacts are assumptions 4 5 and 12 adpe results are greatly affected by the weight of steel replacement and steel recovery assumption 4 and 5 with the ranges of 29 152 29 557 and 22 687 for p20 and p30 respectively assumptions 4 and 12 are highly sensitive to most indicators whereas maetp of p30 and odp of both p20 and p30 solutions are the most sensitive to assumption 5 the sensitivity analysis results illustrated in table 14 and figs 16 27 indicate that p30 could reduce effectively the impacts of tetp odp and maetp on the other hand this solution is more environmentally damaging on ep and ap than p20 solution 3 4 weighting method and final environmental scores similar to the life cycle emissions and environmental impacts results the scores of p20 are lower than p30 in op and higher than p30 in wop for both hfo and lshfo in op p20 has higher scores than the p30 0 9645 0 8773 0 9247 and 0 8366 score ton km for p20 hfo p30 hfo p20 lshfo and p30 lshfo respectively the results of environmental scores and sensitivity analysis are presented in figs 28 and 29 the environmental scores of both two models are the most sensitive to the weight of steel replacement which is affected around 2 80 for p20 and 1 00 for p30 based on the scores comparison and the sensitivity analysis results fig 29 the ship with heavier ldt has better environmental performance than the lighter one one question should be considered here is that how long should the ship s lifespan be to minimize environmental impacts as observed from the environmental scores above p30 solution could reduce the burdens on the environment in comparison with p20 but it does not necessarily mean that 30 year lifespan solution is more environmentally friendly than other lifespan solutions it is necessary to carry out a comparative research of different lifespan scenarios i e 23 25 27 year lifespans in terms of the environment in which lca could be an applicable tool to clarify this question detailed information in each scenario such as materials and energy in sbd and mtn time consumption for mtn activities cargo capacity etc should be clarified 4 conclusions by applying lca method this study compares the environmental impacts of two different design solutions p20 and p30 of a panamax bulk carrier p20 represents the lighter hull ship solution that could increase the cargo capacity of the ship while p30 is designed with heavier ldt in order to increase the corrosion margins of the ship s structure and cut down time consumption in mtn some recent applications of the lca method in the shipping sector have been reviewed necessary data in the life cycle phases of the ship have been collected and the results are calculated by using gabi software cml2001 is chosen as the methodology for impact assessment a sensitivity analysis is also conducted to show the impacts of data uncertainty on emissions and environmental impacts results from a life cycle perspective the results of this study indicate that p30 could effectively reduce voc emissions whereas this solution does not reduce nox and sox for environmental indicators p30 solution reduces impacts on three categories tetp 3 60 7 09 odp 21 29 21 58 and maetp 18 29 19 74 in comparison with p20 however the lighter ldt solution is less environmentally damaging in ap and ep categories the environmental scores results show that the more robust ship with heavier ldt has better environmental performance than the lighter one this is because the p30 solution could cut down material energy consumption and emissions from wop regarding the types of fuels hfo has slightly stronger impacts on the environment than lshfo but the comparison results between p20 and p30 remains unchanged this study also proves that the lca is an applicable and effective tool to evaluate the environmental impacts of a ship the lca should be applied in the design stage to evaluate the environmental impacts in a ship s life cycle future

oscillating nature of sea waves which drives a turbine generator assembly through an oscillating air column still the overall system performance is poor due to the asynchronous coupling of the system components fluctuations in the wave climate and the poor performance of each component independently from power system point of view the grid integration of a typical owc device suffers from power fluctuation synchronization issues weak ac grid with small circuit ratio and disturbances in system inertia etc a mathematical model of such a wec is necessary to study its overall performance for various sea states a wave to wire wtw model which captures dynamics of wec components helps determining the effect of each subsystem of an owc in order to develop an efficient device several works on time domain model for owc was reported in literature which concentrates mainly on hydrodynamics and aerodynamics inside the owc chamber table 1 a few works report the effect of power take off pto forces on the overall operation a review of wtw model is presented in the literatures penalba and ringwood 2016 and babarit et al 2012 shows the importance of wtw model to select an appropriate wec for a particular sea state a guideline for developing such a model for a wec with hydraulic and mechanical pto suggests to include hydrodynamic parameters control variables mooring forces and geometrical design variables nielsen et al 2014 table 2 summarizes the literature of wtw models for different wecs a few models are reported for owcs and those do not clearly capture and analyze the major system dynamics in all sea states hence an appropriate wtw model is required as wtw model can include all the dynamics involved in an owc however the order of the model becomes large and solving in time domain becomes difficult thus the model can be application specific hence for power system studies and control application the model can be a low fidelity model a reduced order model rom for an owc device sufficiently describes the dynamics involved in the transformation from wave energy to electrical energy to model a realistic design of an owc wec the pto forces are to be included along with the effect of added mass a of water inside the owc chamber the influence of differential pressure and effect of turbine damping inside the chamber a rom for point absorbers was developed by hesam 2014 to apply a feedback control law a model reduction technique called balanced proper orthogonal decomposition pod was applied to fluid structure interaction problem for point absorbers a rom of owc wecs wang and chen 2010 containing a wells turbine for stability analysis of a grid connected induction generator was developed a two inertia reduced order mass spring damper model of wells turbine was developed the turbine was coupled to the shaft of the generator and a 5th order model of the generator was developed and the system was studied for steady state operating conditions and eigen value analysis was made the above work did not report the dynamics of the chamber and its effect on the turbine performance the model of the generator was a full order model fom that makes the computation more complex a simple easy to implement and accurate rom of inflating circular diaphragm dielectric elastomer generators for wecs was developed by vertechy et al 2015 the fluid structure interaction between the ocean waves and chamber is complex and explaining it with a full order model becomes difficult the rom reduces the dimensions of the system and the state space equation describing the reduced order wtw model contains only the necessary dynamic states containing all the conversion stages involved in wtw modeling this reduction technique can be applied to owc wec with a good accuracy skvarenina and krause 1979 hence from the above discussion it is clear that the time domain models for an owc wec are available and are reported by several articles table 2 but they mainly focus on the hydrodynamics of owc system for a complete model of an owc wec it is necessary to understand the dynamics involved in each conversion stage the wtw model developed in the literature are mainly developed for energy assessment for different wave climate however those wtw model cannot be used directly for control system applications as a control oriented model should include all the dynamics in the device but a complete control oriented model is sparsely available in the works of literature hesam 2014 vertechy et al 2015 wang and chen 2010 thus the above discussion shows that the rom defined by state equation is already available for few other wecs hesam 2014 vertechy et al 2015 wang and chen 2010 such as point absorbers hyperbolic converters etc the wtw rom for owc wec is sparsely available in the literature wang and chen 2010 the present paper formulates the development of a comprehensive fully coupled and time domain wtw rom of an owc wec containing a wells turbine coupled to a doubly fed induction generator dfig the wtw rom which addresses all the dynamics involved in each stage of the conversion process of the owc device for power system studies and control applications is proposed the sections in this paper include an overview of wtw models models for capture chamber hydrodynamics thermodynamics and aerodynamics turbine aerodynamics rom of the generator and a state space formulation of owc wec for control studies the paper also reports the analyses of the results for different wave climates such as regular and irregular waves 2 wtw model a wtw model predicts the functioning of an owc wec by estimating the amount of electrical energy produced for any particular sea state the proposed wtw model has subsystems from the incident wave to the power available in the electrical grid the model includes the necessary dynamics in different stages of conversions such as hydrodynamics in the opening of the owc aerodynamics and thermodynamics inside the capture chamber the aerodynamics of the turbine and rotor dynamics involved between the turbine and generator shaft a block diagram indicates the information flow in the wtw model fig 1 the internal pressure oscillations affect the turbine dynamics and the chamber aerodynamics the rotor shaft connects the turbine generator subsystem hence its information flow through the model is needed to evaluate its effects in the system variables fig 2 shows the generalized dynamics of the owc this interpretation is analogous to a mechanical equivalent rigid body model for a particular frequency the force accelerates the mass of the water column and it has certain hydrostatic stiffness and resistance to the movement the chamber has an oscillating air pocket associated with pneumatic damping and stiffness of air these dynamics rotates the turbine generator and represents a mechanical rotational system 3 capture chamber model the owc consists of two blocks a collecting chamber and a pto system the collecting chamber takes power from waves and transfers to the air in the chamber it can be designed with a hinged deflector positioned normal to the incident wave which moves transverse direction utilizing the horizontal particle velocity of the incoming wave drew et al 2009 the chamber has an opening below the mean sea level when a wave advances the owc device water enters the air chamber and pushes the air to escape through the annuli of the turbine the owc chamber considered in this work is isolated fixed type cylindrical structure with small body assumption where the diameter of chamber is considered smaller than the wavelength this model assumes a uniform free surface pressure distribution such a rigid piston model can be used for small body approximations falcão et al 2014 henriques et al 2016b sarmento et al 1990 the capture chamber model includes calculation of wave hydrodynamics capture chamber hydrodynamics and aerodynamics these are described below 3 1 wave hydrodynamics a wave can be described by its length height and water depth the other parameters such as water particle velocity and acceleration can be derived from the above parameters water surface elevation η i t varies sinusoidally with respect to time and is a function of wave number and frequency as given in 1 η i t a i c o s ω i t ϕ i the wave motion near the shore has elliptic oscillations with a certain speed in a certain direction dean and dalrymple 1989 the water particle velocity v i t and acceleration v i t at an arbitrary depth h is described as 2 v i t a i ω i sinh k i z h sinh k i h s i n ω i t ϕ i 3 v i t a i ω i 2 sinh k i z h sinh k i h c o s ω i t ϕ i 3 2 capture chamber hydrodynamics and aerodynamics this part describes the nature of the internal water surface elevation z inside the chamber by the action of an incident wave through simulations to calculate the instantaneous value of z the volume of water contained inside the chamber is considered the equation of motion of a body floating on the water surface with respect to time is given by eq 4 cummins 1962 4 m a z t 0 t b t τ z τ d τ c z t f e x t t f h y d r o t f p t o t where a is the added mass at infinite frequency the force acting on heaving body can be broadly given by excitation force f e x t t hydrostatic force f h y d r o t and pto force f p t o t for a fixed type owc device the above equation can express for one degree of freedom representing heave displacement z t of water mass contained inside the chamber as the device is set for one degree of freedom only heave motion of water surface elevation inside the chamber is examined with newtonian formulations the water column has a specific mass m c and oscillates with certain damping b c and hydrostatic stiffness c c the added mass term of equation 4 can be simplified and is assumed that the value of m a is equal to the mass contained in the hollow cylinder having a radius equal to the chamber radius r c the added mass of water contained inside the chamber is assumed frequency independent and can be expressed as m a a thus added mass is expressed as m a 2 3 ρ s π r c 3 patel and harrison 1986 the power extracted from the owc device is a function of the dynamics of inner free surface elevation and internal chamber pressure the behavior of the pressure term depends on internal particle velocity acceleration and force excreted due to the loading of the turbine itself thus the power extraction is even possible when there is no reaction force from the turbine called as pumping action of water column equation 5 is the time domain motion of an oscillating water column gervelas et al 2011 5 m c z t b c z t c c z t f t o t t where m c ρ s π r c 2 d z b c 0 2 c c m a m c c c ρ s g π r c 2 thus b c and m c changes dynamically depending on the internal water surface displacement and geometry of the device damping inside the chamber b c also changes dynamically as it is a function of inertial component m c m a hydrostatic stiffness c c depends upon chamber radius the inertia component has two terms one is mass m c and the other one is added mass m a the force required to accelerate the air pocket inside the chamber yields this added mass 3 2 1 force calculation the hydrodynamic forces are resolved into three component the added mass force f a t f r a d t the froude krylov force techet 2005 f f k t f e x t t and the force acting on the chamber due to varying chamber air pressure f δ a i r t f p t o t as the pto force becomes nonlinear the frequency domain analysis of the system fails the other forces acting on the chamber are not included in this study thus the expression for the total force is 6 f t o t t f a t f f k t f δ a i r t the wave hydrodynamic pressure at depth d creates the added mass force because of the oscillation of water mass inside the chamber this oscillation creates a radiated wave which creates a radiation force f r a d t on the chamber the force depends on the difference between water particle velocity and acceleration the truncated fourier series approximates the velocity and gives the force value the added mass force is calculated as 7 f a t m a v z the excitation force is equivalent to froude krylov force techet 2005 if the diffraction component of the excitation force is ignored as the owc is smaller in size and does not influence the pressure field this force in the vertical direction is simplified as the linear wave theory which predicts that only the variation of η t is sufficient to describe the heave motion of internal surface elevation inside the chamber the incident wave field is assumed incompressible and irrotational the force ffk t can be expressed as 8 f f k t π r c 2 ρ s a i g cosh k i h d cosh k i h cos ω i t ϕ i the air force is calculated by 9 f δ a i r t δ p t π r c 2 a force created due to pressurization and depressurization of air pocket inside the capture chamber couples the aerodynamics and thermodynamics problems of owc wec this force in turn affects the dynamics of internal water surface elevation equation 10 shows the dynamics of chamber pressure the instantaneous value of the chamber pressure is a function of the difference between mass flow rate and change in volume of air pocket inside the chamber 10 d p c d t c s 2 v c d m d t γ p c v c d v c d t to define the differential pressure the compressibility of air is considered falcão et al 2012 the pto device inhales and exhales if the mass flow rate is positive and negative respectively the expressions are 11 d p c d t c s 2 v c d m d t c s 2 ρ a v c d v c d t 12 d ρ a d t γ c s 2 d p c d t where v c π r c 2 h a 0 z the chamber hydrodynamics and aerodynamics of an owc device are coupled with two sets of differential equations eqs 5 and 11 the first equation describes the dynamics of water surface elevation in heave motion and the second equation describes the air chamber pressure variations the air pocket or the trapped air due to its compressibility in the capture chamber plays a significant role in the thermodynamic variation in the chamber the air pocket size affects the natural frequency of the chamber and helps in reaching the resonance condition for different sea state ning et al 2016 4 aerodynamics of wells turbine 4 1 orifice model calculation of mass flow rate for small scale test models an orifice replaces the pto occasionally the orifice that blocks one end of the chamber contains a small hole of a defined diameter build up pressure difference and dissipates energy across it the orifice model is used to validate the chamber dynamics with the available literature gervelas et al 2011 the mass flow rate is calculated as 13 d m d t c d a 0 2 δ p ρ a the relationship between the pressure of the chamber and the velocity of air escaping through the duct is assumed proportional and the pneumatic damping coefficient is the proportionality constant 4 2 turbine model calculation of mass flow rate the wells turbine is a self rectifying air turbine and has the simplest design for a wec with pneumatic pto it is considered as a linear turbine as it holds a linear relationship between the pressure drop and mass flow rate the instantaneous airflow across the turbine depends on the air pressure variations with time the pneumatic power is a function of the chamber pressure and the airflow rate the operating range of the turbine depends on its geometry halder et al 2015 this turbine has a narrow operating range because of stalling in the turbine blade when flow coefficient exceeds a certain limit in this work the input variable to the turbine was an oscillating differential pressure δp across the turbine modeling of turbines was done using eqs 14 and 15 the characteristic curves used for modeling were obtained from the work of setoguchi et al 2001 14 c a δ p q t ρ a v x 2 u r 2 b t l t n t v x 2 15 c t t t ρ a v x 2 u r 2 b t l t n t r t 2 an owc wec uses the turbine generated torque to drive a generator however the limits on turbine rotation also depend on the type of generator used thus a variable speed generator is prescribed for wecs o sullivan and lewis 2011 such that the turbine rotation can be tuned to wave climate the mass flow rate across the turbine is calculated using eq 16 this relation is important in order to analyze the damping imposed by a turbine at different sea states falcão and rodrigues 2002 16 d m d t d δ p k t ω r the turbine constant kt holds the relation between the dimensionless pressure head ψ and flow rate φ of turbine which is associated with the specific turbine design when the turbine is considered to operates at a constant speed the mass flow through the turbine depends linearly on the differential pressure nunes et al 2011 k t holds the assumption of linearity of wells turbine and is independent of turbine diameter and speed for wells turbine the value of k t is approximately equal to one falcão et al 2014 17 ψ k t φ where ψ p c ρ a ω r 2 d t 2 φ v x r ω r the value of this constant can be obtained from the slope of the curve fig 3 defined by pressure coefficient ψ and flow coefficient φ this linear assumption gives the reason for stalling of wells turbine for higher blade loading and thus has a comparatively lower operating range than other wave energy turbines a wec can face several sea states and should be able to change its operation with the incident sea a properly designed wec should give higher power and should operate within certain limits such as limits for turbine speed or maximum chamber pressure freeman 2014 a matlab code written for this work follows a flow chart given in fig 4 5 modeling of dfig the basic modeling of dfig requires differential equations of the full network to define the complete behavior of system a fifth order model which is an example of a full order model fom contains four electrical and one mechanical modeling equations and considers the stator flux as a state variable the model captures the dynamics of the machine needed to study the transients of the system ekanayake et al 2003 and includes high frequency dynamics however a small integration step time is needed for simulating it in the time domain for the detailed design of dfig the generator settings are matched to the turbine torque amundarain et al 2011 the high frequency dynamics in the stator are eliminated in the large power systems study thus a rom of a dfig is sufficient to address any control problem the basic assumptions in rom are i magnetic saturation is neglected ii losses such as eddy currents and hysteresis losses are neglected iii flux distribution is sinusoidal iv stator voltage and currents vary sinusoidally at the fundamental grid frequency 5 1 rom of dfig the rom is a model reduction technique used to obtain dynamics of a machine by simplifying a set of differential equations defining the machine this type of reduction is widely used in induction machines because of its efficient computation accurate operation and simpler set of differential equations furthermore the grid transients in a network usually create high frequency terms which are not of particular interest in electromechanical transient studies the equivalent circuit of reduced order dfig erlich et al 2008 in fig 5 represents the equivalent of a simple thevenin s voltage source connected with a transient impedance making the derivative of stator flux to zero gives the rom often the stator voltage is considered as a constant independent input variable the accuracy of the rom increases with the size of the machine thus it can be used for dynamic stability studies skvarenina and krause 1979 it is expressed as a simple thevenin s equivalent voltage source otherwise called as transient voltage equation the equations below show the transient voltage for direct and quadrature axis 18 d e d d t 1 t o 1 x x s x z 2 e d s ω s t o r s x s x z 2

the dynamic equation for the turbine generator shaft is the torque balance equation given as 20 j r d 2 θ d t 2 b r d θ d t 1 c r θ t t t e this second order equation represents a simple nonlinear mass spring and damper an excitation given to the mechanical system its value is equal to the difference of turbine torque and electromagnetic torque the damping is neglected a rigid shaft with infinity stiffness is assumed and the turbine characteristics accounts for the drag thus the angular velocity ω r simplifies the dynamic equation and replaces the displacement terms a negative mechanical torque implies the generator mode of operation for a dfig the state variable for reduced order dfig is the dq axis transient voltage the input variables are stator and rotor dq voltages the

reactance to the product of stator speed and rotor resistance 6 state space formulation of owc simply connecting each subsystem a complete wtw model is described the wtw model can be expressed by a state space method the state vectors are to be checked for the feasibility of the solution to the model the state space matrices and vectors are defined by hydrodynamic aerodynamic and rotor dynamic coefficients of owc system the input power reference is selected as one of the controllable input vector which in turn implies the speed control of the turbine the flow reference is selected as the other controllable input variable which implies the airflow control of owc wec the wave elevation is considered as uncontrollable input the resulting state space model is expressed as 24 d x d t f x u η t y g x where the state input and output vectors are described as follows 25 x z δ p m ω r e d e q u p r e f q r e f y ω r p e the control system simulation is ignored as it is out of the scope of this paper this input output system gives a good approximation of the complete owc device and any linear or nonlinear control algorithm can be implemented with this formulation the conditions are the minimal approximation preservation of stability and passivity of the original system the parameters of the wtw model is represented as follows d 1 π ρ s r c 2 d d 2 π ρ s r c 2 d 3 π r c 2 d 4 π r c 2

matlab code for solving an owc subsystem in time domain was developed the differential equations were solved in the ode45 solver each trial case was simulated for a total duration of 200s with a sampling time of 5 0e 4s the total simulation time 200s was sufficient to capture both the transient and the steady state response of the system the parameters for the simulation are given in table 3 the system excitation is regular h i t i and irregular incoming waves h s t p the results fig 6 a and b of dynamics of the owc were analyzed for different wave heights and periods and were validated with the experimental test data of a similar owc wec gervelas et al 2011 where the experimental points are for various test cases of different wave height hi and period ti two data points represent two experimental cases for each wave height thus two set of experimental trials are run for each sea state total 8 cases the present work matches with the experimental results of the test setup however their simulation model over predicts the experimental test results fig 7 a shows the variation of internal water surface for different wave period at a particular wave height of 0 25 m it shows that the chamber dynamics is frequency dependent and implies that the evaluation of resonance is inevitable for a particular geometry to design an optimal owc chamber moreover evaluation of frequency dependency of the chamber for phase and other reactive control strategies is important the equilibrium state of the water surface elevation can vary in different sea states and internal chamber pressure fig 7 b shows the time series of internal surface elevation for different wave height at resonant condition the internal surface elevation reaches its maximum for its respective wave heights the incoming wave height and internal water surface elevation give a correlation to maximize the energy extraction by evaluating amplitude and phase control the phase portraits of internal water surface displacement vector and velocity vector at different time instances is plotted in fig 8 it shows the dynamical system response at different time instances the low frequency waves take longer time to attain the steady state the internal chamber dynamics with wave elevation for orifice model at different time instances are given in fig 9 from fig 8 and 9 it can be understood that altering z t changes the system response thus a control action on this variable would change the wave energy absorption such a control action can be a latching control using pressure valves henriques et al 2016a xiao et al 2017 fig 10 shows the pneumatic damping of the orifice model of owc for heave motion of waves the damping force evaluated from pneumatic damping coefficient ζ is frequency dependent the damping coefficient and the chamber dynamics change when a turbine is included the pneumatic damping is oscillatory in the air duct and affects the dynamics of the chamber to improve the energy extraction the incoming wave response can be modified to change the damping force and thus a passive loading or a change in the airflow through the duct helps the non dimensional damping coefficient gradually increases with the respective wave frequency and reaches a certain threshold value after the threshold limit the damping coefficient varies according to the heave response hence for smaller orifice and higher frequency the damping force is a linear function of heave amplitude in general kim et al 2007 the non dimensional damping coefficient decreases as the frequency increases 7 2 wtw rom model regular waves fig 11 shows the time series of internal water surface elevation z for different wave heights if the turbine is attached to the chamber the dynamics of internal displacement changes compared to the orifice model because the orifice model ignores the damping in the chamber pertaining to the turbine speed teixeira et al 2013 the variation of z in the beginning is more and reaches the maximum of the air pocket but the mean of oscillation of z shifts above the mean sea level as the turbine starts rotating again higher wave heights have larger amplitudes of sinusoidal oscillation whereas smaller heights have smaller amplitudes that are above still water level showing a quasi sinusoidal behavior the results also follow the similar trend reported in an existing article iturrioz et al 2014 which used cummins equation cummins 1962 by approximating the radiation convolution integral initially in the absence of reactive force from the turbine the internal water surface elevation z reaches to a higher value z 0 2 m which is approximately equivalent to the air column height h a0 fig 12 however when the turbine reactive force increases the internal water surface elevation decreases and attains a steady value slightly above the origin for regular waves a similar analysis was reported using only heave motion xiao et al 2017 the time progression of the pressure variations inside the owc chamber with respect to the atmospheric pressure is given in fig 13 the bidirectional airflow in the chamber creates an oscillating pressure and drives the turbine tuning the turbine speed as per the differential pressure drop δp can help getting a wider operating range to evaluate operating range and maximum power output of the turbine δp for different wave heights h i and turbine speeds is calculated for different sea states lópez et al 2014 a maximum power point tracking algorithm helps in such analysis similar results are reported by teixeira et al 2013 the torque t t or power produced by the turbine increases with wave height fig 14 and the model predicts it however higher wave heights give larger torque ripples which can be altered according to the incoming wave henriques et al 2016b with the help of an airflow control fig 15 a shows the relationship between axial velocity v x and differential pressure δp when δp 4 kpa maximum v x 12 m s this variation δp decreases with wave heights sarmento et al 1990 the variation of mass flow and differential pressure across the turbine fig 15 b clearly show the operating modes of an owc device the four quadrant operation specifies that the model absorbs energy from waves when airflow and chamber pressure are in opposite direction opposing signs if airflow and differential pressure are in the same direction same sign the system works as a compressor and the airflow acts against the differential pressure nunes et al 2011 the maximum rotor speed is same for a given wave period while it attains its peak speed at a different time as the wave height changes fig 16 the turbine starts quickly at larger wave heights and oscillates more the rotor speed amplitude is a function of incoming wave period and the turbine starting characteristics is a function of wave height this result indicates that the rotor speed is a control variable justino and de o falcã o 1999 and the control system design is not included in this work it is the future scope of this wtw model the owc efficiency depends upon the turbine generator coupling as the damping ξ is a function of geometry and the rotational speed of the turbine generator the incoming wave frequency affects the energy conversion process fig 17 shows the damping variations for different wave periods t i similar results were reported by choi et al 2004 however their work summarized the results in frequency scale this work shows the pneumatic damping in time scale this work shows that the damping of the turbine can be altered to a desired value by altering the rotational speed of the generator thereby modifying the turbine speed fig 18 a b show the time series plot of mechanical power developed across the turbine shaft for different wave heights and wave periods respectively the waves with larger wave heights and frequencies close to chamber natural frequency delivers relatively higher power the peak power reaches to 3 kw table 4 shows the mean power developed and conversion efficiency for different sea states fig 19 a b shows the time series of electromagnetic torque for h i 0 15 m and 0 1 m respectively for ti 5s a larger wave height gives a larger torque ripple corresponding to the turbine rotational speed in third order model of dfig the electromagnetic torque is a function of transient voltage and stator current the current component controls the electromagnetic torque the results in fig 20 shows the time series of transient voltages at different time instances for h i 0 5 m and t i 5s for t 0 10s the rotational speed increases linearly with time for t 10s the speed reaches to a steady state thus it affects the transient voltage which again increases with the turbine rotational speed and depends on wave heights as the reactive power for the dfig comes from the rotors the stator current eliminates high transient spikes the evolution of stator current in dq frame can be seen in fig 21 thus reduced order dfig is able to deliver the power depending on the turbine rotational speed fig 22 shows the dynamics of the transient voltages at a different instance of time the direct and quadrature axis voltage has initial transients for 5s then it gradually attains the steady state the number of points in the circular path of the transient voltage increases at the edge of the figure because of the magnetic saturation effect it is clear that the rom produces a higher degree of accuracy in transient behavior and the computation time is relatively lower than the full order model similar results were analyzed by wang et al 2014 for a full order model of dfig 7 3 wtw rom model irregular waves the owc in real sea state would experience random incoming waves thus it is necessary to analyze the performance of wtw model in irregular waves the irregular wave model can characterize real wave there are several wave model such as pierson moskowitz pm bretschneider jonswap the test wave used for simulation is based on pm spectrum for fully developed sea the pm spectrum is described by significant wave height h s and peak period t p the pm spectrum produces irregular waves which characterizes real sea waves fig 23 a shows the wave spectrum for h s 0 8 m and t p 5s which is more prominent in the east cost of india fig 23 b shows the wave surface elevation obtained with exactly the same configuration fig 24 shows the simulation results when the wtw model is subjected to irregular wave the model was simulated for the same irregular time series for t 80s fig 24 a shows the variation of wave elevation η t internal surface elevation in the chamber and velocity developed at the turbine there is approximately a phase delay of π 2 between the air velocity and other two variables the phase lag can be observed in different sea state the compressibility effect of the air pocket attributes to this delay the time progression of flow coefficient and turbine torque for irregular test wave is shown in fig 24 b c the test wave is of smaller amplitude and thus the turbine does the reach the stall threshold φ 0 3 however for larger waves the turbine is affected by aerodynamic stalling furthermore the flow coefficient should be maintained below stall limit for efficient operation of wells turbine in all sea states fig 24 d shows the angular velocity of the turbine for irregular wave it can be observed that the turbine takes a considerable time to start and reach its operational speed however the speed does not reduces drastically when a smaller wave strikes after a large wave this is the flywheel effect of the turbine generator rotor as a result some amount of energy is stored in its kinetic energy form and delivers during pneumatic power fluctuations in a cycle of operation of the wave from the above discussion it was found that the present model agrees with most of the existing models which are normally reported for independent sub system analysis the present model couples all the subsystem of the owc and predicts the power output for different sea state and defines the complete model into state space formulation which can be used to incorporate control system studies 8 conclusion a reduced order model rom for wave to wire power output prediction of an owc is presented in this study the rom reduces the dimensions of the system and extracts a dynamic model relevant to control systems the capture chamber dynamics to evaluate the pressure drop and flow velocities for different wave conditions with an orifice fitted in the outlet of the chamber were evaluated further a time domain model incorporated the wells turbine and generator model the conclusions are results of the proposed wtw reduced order model for regular and irregular incoming waves are studied and the performance of the model is reported the model gave a coherent picture of the dynamics of internal surface elevation for various wave conditions and its effect on other dynamically coupled devices when the turbine started rotating the damping associated with the coupled system changed and affected the internal dynamics of the chamber the inner free surface elevation did not oscillate at mean water level quasi steady the generator dynamics was modeled using a 3rd order model of dfig the stator flux oscillations were removed the model was adequate for transient and steady state operation the model allowed one to deal with the machine with only three differential equations in the electrical part the initial transients of the state variable of dfig were captured in this model the time domain model of owc with a state space representation can be readily used for developing its control system as a speed control can be easily achieved by selecting the rotor current controllable state as control variable the proposed wtw model is helpful to understand various design and performance issues in owc device without much modification of the actual physical system the developed wtw rom can be used for development of control strategies for owc wec to improve its overall wtw efficiency and improve the reliability of owc

23077,wave energy converters wecs face difficulties such as low operating range low power output and fluctuating power a seamless synchronization among wec components is required to get a better performance for control system studies the model should capture all the necessary dynamics involved in each conversion stages however the interlinked complexity in each subsystem increases the computation time this article presents a reduced order wave to wire wtw model of an oscillating water column owc based wec the approach involves modeling of hydrodynamic and aerodynamic coupling of the capture chamber aerodynamic and thermodynamic coupling inside the capture chamber aerodynamic and rotor dynamic coupling in air turbine and rotor dynamics and generator dynamics in the turbine generator coupling the result shows that the model retains its fundamental dynamics and reduces the number of unknowns to describe the state space the model indicates the correlation of each variable represented in the state space the model predicted power output for different sea state it also shows that the accuracy and the efficiency of the model are acceptable for owc wec control system studies the present model can be used as a time domain tool to design an effective control system for owc device for different sea states and the overall device performance can be improved significantly keywords wave energy conversion oscillating water column wave to wire model reduced order model wells turbine doubly fed induction generator 1 introduction ocean waves contain immense potential as a renewable energy source the estimated power of wave energy across the world is around 2 3 tw falnes 2007 a major part of the global energy crisis could be met by harnessing such energy among different wave energy converters wecs the oscillating water column owc wec was studied rigorously in the past few decades the owc wec has a simple design and captures the energy from the oscillating nature of sea waves which drives a turbine generator assembly through an oscillating air column still the overall system performance is poor due to the asynchronous coupling of the system components fluctuations in the wave climate and the poor performance of each component independently from power system point of view the grid integration of a typical owc device suffers from power fluctuation synchronization issues weak ac grid with small circuit ratio and disturbances in system inertia etc a mathematical model of such a wec is necessary to study its overall performance for various sea states a wave to wire wtw model which captures dynamics of wec components helps determining the effect of each subsystem of an owc in order to develop an efficient device several works on time domain model for owc was reported in literature which concentrates mainly on hydrodynamics and aerodynamics inside the owc chamber table 1 a few works report the effect of power take off pto forces on the overall operation a review of wtw model is presented in the literatures penalba and ringwood 2016 and babarit et al 2012 shows the importance of wtw model to select an appropriate wec for a particular sea state a guideline for developing such a model for a wec with hydraulic and mechanical pto suggests to include hydrodynamic parameters control variables mooring forces and geometrical design variables nielsen et al 2014 table 2 summarizes the literature of wtw models for different wecs a few models are reported for owcs and those do not clearly capture and analyze the major system dynamics in all sea states hence an appropriate wtw model is required as wtw model can include all the dynamics involved in an owc however the order of the model becomes large and solving in time domain becomes difficult thus the model can be application specific hence for power system studies and control application the model can be a low fidelity model a reduced order model rom for an owc device sufficiently describes the dynamics involved in the transformation from wave energy to electrical energy to model a realistic design of an owc wec the pto forces are to be included along with the effect of added mass a of water inside the owc chamber the influence of differential pressure and effect of turbine damping inside the chamber a rom for point absorbers was developed by hesam 2014 to apply a feedback control law a model reduction technique called balanced proper orthogonal decomposition pod was applied to fluid structure interaction problem for point absorbers a rom of owc wecs wang and chen 2010 containing a wells turbine for stability analysis of a grid connected induction generator was developed a two inertia reduced order mass spring damper model of wells turbine was developed the turbine was coupled to the shaft of the generator and a 5th order model of the generator was developed and the system was studied for steady state operating conditions and eigen value analysis was made the above work did not report the dynamics of the chamber and its effect on the turbine performance the model of the generator was a full order model fom that makes the computation more complex a simple easy to implement and accurate rom of inflating circular diaphragm dielectric elastomer generators for wecs was developed by vertechy et al 2015 the fluid structure interaction between the ocean waves and chamber is complex and explaining it with a full order model becomes difficult the rom reduces the dimensions of the system and the state space equation describing the reduced order wtw model contains only the necessary dynamic states containing all the conversion stages involved in wtw modeling this reduction technique can be applied to owc wec with a good accuracy skvarenina and krause 1979 hence from the above discussion it is clear that the time domain models for an owc wec are available and are reported by several articles table 2 but they mainly focus on the hydrodynamics of owc system for a complete model of an owc wec it is necessary to understand the dynamics involved in each conversion stage the wtw model developed in the literature are mainly developed for energy assessment for different wave climate however those wtw model cannot be used directly for control system applications as a control oriented model should include all the dynamics in the device but a complete control oriented model is sparsely available in the works of literature hesam 2014 vertechy et al 2015 wang and chen 2010 thus the above discussion shows that the rom defined by state equation is already available for few other wecs hesam 2014 vertechy et al 2015 wang and chen 2010 such as point absorbers hyperbolic converters etc the wtw rom for owc wec is sparsely available in the literature wang and chen 2010 the present paper formulates the development of a comprehensive fully coupled and time domain wtw rom of an owc wec containing a wells turbine coupled to a doubly fed induction generator dfig the wtw rom which addresses all the dynamics involved in each stage of the conversion process of the owc device for power system studies and control applications is proposed the sections in this paper include an overview of wtw models models for capture chamber hydrodynamics thermodynamics and aerodynamics turbine aerodynamics rom of the generator and a state space formulation of owc wec for control studies the paper also reports the analyses of the results for different wave climates such as regular and irregular waves 2 wtw model a wtw model predicts the functioning of an owc wec by estimating the amount of electrical energy produced for any particular sea state the proposed wtw model has subsystems from the incident wave to the power available in the electrical grid the model includes the necessary dynamics in different stages of conversions such as hydrodynamics in the opening of the owc aerodynamics and thermodynamics inside the capture chamber the aerodynamics of the turbine and rotor dynamics involved between the turbine and generator shaft a block diagram indicates the information flow in the wtw model fig 1 the internal pressure oscillations affect the turbine dynamics and the chamber aerodynamics the rotor shaft connects the turbine generator subsystem hence its information flow through the model is needed to evaluate its effects in the system variables fig 2 shows the generalized dynamics of the owc this interpretation is analogous to a mechanical equivalent rigid body model for a particular frequency the force accelerates the mass of the water column and it has certain hydrostatic stiffness and resistance to the movement the chamber has an oscillating air pocket associated with pneumatic damping and stiffness of air these dynamics rotates the turbine generator and represents a mechanical rotational system 3 capture chamber model the owc consists of two blocks a collecting chamber and a pto system the collecting chamber takes power from waves and transfers to the air in the chamber it can be designed with a hinged deflector positioned normal to the incident wave which moves transverse direction utilizing the horizontal particle velocity of the incoming wave drew et al 2009 the chamber has an opening below the mean sea level when a wave advances the owc device water enters the air chamber and pushes the air to escape through the annuli of the turbine the owc chamber considered in this work is isolated fixed type cylindrical structure with small body assumption where the diameter of chamber is considered smaller than the wavelength this model assumes a uniform free surface pressure distribution such a rigid piston model can be used for small body approximations falcão et al 2014 henriques et al 2016b sarmento et al 1990 the capture chamber model includes calculation of wave hydrodynamics capture chamber hydrodynamics and aerodynamics these are described below 3 1 wave hydrodynamics a wave can be described by its length height and water depth the other parameters such as water particle velocity and acceleration can be derived from the above parameters water surface elevation η i t varies sinusoidally with respect to time and is a function of wave number and frequency as given in 1 η i t a i c o s ω i t ϕ i the wave motion near the shore has elliptic oscillations with a certain speed in a certain direction dean and dalrymple 1989 the water particle velocity v i t and acceleration v i t at an arbitrary depth h is described as 2 v i t a i ω i sinh k i z h sinh k i h s i n ω i t ϕ i 3 v i t a i ω i 2 sinh k i z h sinh k i h c o s ω i t ϕ i 3 2 capture chamber hydrodynamics and aerodynamics this part describes the nature of the internal water surface elevation z inside the chamber by the action of an incident wave through simulations to calculate the instantaneous value of z the volume of water contained inside the chamber is considered the equation of motion of a body floating on the water surface with respect to time is given by eq 4 cummins 1962 4 m a z t 0 t b t τ z τ d τ c z t f e x t t f h y d r o t f p t o t where a is the added mass at infinite frequency the force acting on heaving body can be broadly given by excitation force f e x t t hydrostatic force f h y d r o t and pto force f p t o t for a fixed type owc device the above equation can express for one degree of freedom representing heave displacement z t of water mass contained inside the chamber as the device is set for one degree of freedom only heave motion of water surface elevation inside the chamber is examined with newtonian formulations the water column has a specific mass m c and oscillates with certain damping b c and hydrostatic stiffness c c the added mass term of equation 4 can be simplified and is assumed that the value of m a is equal to the mass contained in the hollow cylinder having a radius equal to the chamber radius r c the added mass of water contained inside the chamber is assumed frequency independent and can be expressed as m a a thus added mass is expressed as m a 2 3 ρ s π r c 3 patel and harrison 1986 the power extracted from the owc device is a function of the dynamics of inner free surface elevation and internal chamber pressure the behavior of the pressure term depends on internal particle velocity acceleration and force excreted due to the loading of the turbine itself thus the power extraction is even possible when there is no reaction force from the turbine called as pumping action of water column equation 5 is the time domain motion of an oscillating water column gervelas et al 2011 5 m c z t b c z t c c z t f t o t t where m c ρ s π r c 2 d z b c 0 2 c c m a m c c c ρ s g π r c 2 thus b c and m c changes dynamically depending on the internal water surface displacement and geometry of the device damping inside the chamber b c also changes dynamically as it is a function of inertial component m c m a hydrostatic stiffness c c depends upon chamber radius the inertia component has two terms one is mass m c and the other one is added mass m a the force required to accelerate the air pocket inside the chamber yields this added mass 3 2 1 force calculation the hydrodynamic forces are resolved into three component the added mass force f a t f r a d t the froude krylov force techet 2005 f f k t f e x t t and the force acting on the chamber due to varying chamber air pressure f δ a i r t f p t o t as the pto force becomes nonlinear the frequency domain analysis of the system fails the other forces acting on the chamber are not included in this study thus the expression for the total force is 6 f t o t t f a t f f k t f δ a i r t the wave hydrodynamic pressure at depth d creates the added mass force because of the oscillation of water mass inside the chamber this oscillation creates a radiated wave which creates a radiation force f r a d t on the chamber the force depends on the difference between water particle velocity and acceleration the truncated fourier series approximates the velocity and gives the force value the added mass force is calculated as 7 f a t m a v z the excitation force is equivalent to froude krylov force techet 2005 if the diffraction component of the excitation force is ignored as the owc is smaller in size and does not influence the pressure field this force in the vertical direction is simplified as the linear wave theory which predicts that only the variation of η t is sufficient to describe the heave motion of internal surface elevation inside the chamber the incident wave field is assumed incompressible and irrotational the force ffk t can be expressed as 8 f f k t π r c 2 ρ s a i g cosh k i h d cosh k i h cos ω i t ϕ i the air force is calculated by 9 f δ a i r t δ p t π r c 2 a force created due to pressurization and depressurization of air pocket inside the capture chamber couples the aerodynamics and thermodynamics problems of owc wec this force in turn affects the dynamics of internal water surface elevation equation 10 shows the dynamics of chamber pressure the instantaneous value of the chamber pressure is a function of the difference between mass flow rate and change in volume of air pocket inside the chamber 10 d p c d t c s 2 v c d m d t γ p c v c d v c d t to define the differential pressure the compressibility of air is considered falcão et al 2012 the pto device inhales and exhales if the mass flow rate is positive and negative respectively the expressions are 11 d p c d t c s 2 v c d m d t c s 2 ρ a v c d v c d t 12 d ρ a d t γ c s 2 d p c d t where v c π r c 2 h a 0 z the chamber hydrodynamics and aerodynamics of an owc device are coupled with two sets of differential equations eqs 5 and 11 the first equation describes the dynamics of water surface elevation in heave motion and the second equation describes the air chamber pressure variations the air pocket or the trapped air due to its compressibility in the capture chamber plays a significant role in the thermodynamic variation in the chamber the air pocket size affects the natural frequency of the chamber and helps in reaching the resonance condition for different sea state ning et al 2016 4 aerodynamics of wells turbine 4 1 orifice model calculation of mass flow rate for small scale test models an orifice replaces the pto occasionally the orifice that blocks one end of the chamber contains a small hole of a defined diameter build up pressure difference and dissipates energy across it the orifice model is used to validate the chamber dynamics with the available literature gervelas et al 2011 the mass flow rate is calculated as 13 d m d t c d a 0 2 δ p ρ a the relationship between the pressure of the chamber and the velocity of air escaping through the duct is assumed proportional and the pneumatic damping coefficient is the proportionality constant 4 2 turbine model calculation of mass flow rate the wells turbine is a self rectifying air turbine and has the simplest design for a wec with pneumatic pto it is considered as a linear turbine as it holds a linear relationship between the pressure drop and mass flow rate the instantaneous airflow across the turbine depends on the air pressure variations with time the pneumatic power is a function of the chamber pressure and the airflow rate the operating range of the turbine depends on its geometry halder et al 2015 this turbine has a narrow operating range because of stalling in the turbine blade when flow coefficient exceeds a certain limit in this work the input variable to the turbine was an oscillating differential pressure δp across the turbine modeling of turbines was done using eqs 14 and 15 the characteristic curves used for modeling were obtained from the work of setoguchi et al 2001 14 c a δ p q t ρ a v x 2 u r 2 b t l t n t v x 2 15 c t t t ρ a v x 2 u r 2 b t l t n t r t 2 an owc wec uses the turbine generated torque to drive a generator however the limits on turbine rotation also depend on the type of generator used thus a variable speed generator is prescribed for wecs o sullivan and lewis 2011 such that the turbine rotation can be tuned to wave climate the mass flow rate across the turbine is calculated using eq 16 this relation is important in order to analyze the damping imposed by a turbine at different sea states falcão and rodrigues 2002 16 d m d t d δ p k t ω r the turbine constant kt holds the relation between the dimensionless pressure head ψ and flow rate φ of turbine which is associated with the specific turbine design when the turbine is considered to operates at a constant speed the mass flow through the turbine depends linearly on the differential pressure nunes et al 2011 k t holds the assumption of linearity of wells turbine and is independent of turbine diameter and speed for wells turbine the value of k t is approximately equal to one falcão et al 2014 17 ψ k t φ where ψ p c ρ a ω r 2 d t 2 φ v x r ω r the value of this constant can be obtained from the slope of the curve fig 3 defined by pressure coefficient ψ and flow coefficient φ this linear assumption gives the reason for stalling of wells turbine for higher blade loading and thus has a comparatively lower operating range than other wave energy turbines a wec can face several sea states and should be able to change its operation with the incident sea a properly designed wec should give higher power and should operate within certain limits such as limits for turbine speed or maximum chamber pressure freeman 2014 a matlab code written for this work follows a flow chart given in fig 4 5 modeling of dfig the basic modeling of dfig requires differential equations of the full network to define the complete behavior of system a fifth order model which is an example of a full order model fom contains four electrical and one mechanical modeling equations and considers the stator flux as a state variable the model captures the dynamics of the machine needed to study the transients of the system ekanayake et al 2003 and includes high frequency dynamics however a small integration step time is needed for simulating it in the time domain for the detailed design of dfig the generator settings are matched to the turbine torque amundarain et al 2011 the high frequency dynamics in the stator are eliminated in the large power systems study thus a rom of a dfig is sufficient to address any control problem the basic assumptions in rom are i magnetic saturation is neglected ii losses such as eddy currents and hysteresis losses are neglected iii flux distribution is sinusoidal iv stator voltage and currents vary sinusoidally at the fundamental grid frequency 5 1 rom of dfig the rom is a model reduction technique used to obtain dynamics of a machine by simplifying a set of differential equations defining the machine this type of reduction is widely used in induction machines because of its efficient computation accurate operation and simpler set of differential equations furthermore the grid transients in a network usually create high frequency terms which are not of particular interest in electromechanical transient studies the equivalent circuit of reduced order dfig erlich et al 2008 in fig 5 represents the equivalent of a simple thevenin s voltage source connected with a transient impedance making the derivative of stator flux to zero gives the rom often the stator voltage is considered as a constant independent input variable the accuracy of the rom increases with the size of the machine thus it can be used for dynamic stability studies skvarenina and krause 1979 it is expressed as a simple thevenin s equivalent voltage source otherwise called as transient voltage equation the equations below show the transient voltage for direct and quadrature axis 18 d e d d t 1 t o 1 x x s x z 2 e d s ω s t o r s x s x z 2

the dynamic equation for the turbine generator shaft is the torque balance equation given as 20 j r d 2 θ d t 2 b r d θ d t 1 c r θ t t t e this second order equation represents a simple nonlinear mass spring and damper an excitation given to the mechanical system its value is equal to the difference of turbine torque and electromagnetic torque the damping is neglected a rigid shaft with infinity stiffness is assumed and the turbine characteristics accounts for the drag thus the angular velocity ω r simplifies the dynamic equation and replaces the displacement terms a negative mechanical torque implies the generator mode of operation for a dfig the state variable for reduced order dfig is the dq axis transient voltage the input variables are stator and rotor dq voltages the

reactance to the product of stator speed and rotor resistance 6 state space formulation of owc simply connecting each subsystem a complete wtw model is described the wtw model can be expressed by a state space method the state vectors are to be checked for the feasibility of the solution to the model the state space matrices and vectors are defined by hydrodynamic aerodynamic and rotor dynamic coefficients of owc system the input power reference is selected as one of the controllable input vector which in turn implies the speed control of the turbine the flow reference is selected as the other controllable input variable which implies the airflow control of owc wec the wave elevation is considered as uncontrollable input the resulting state space model is expressed as 24 d x d t f x u η t y g x where the state input and output vectors are described as follows 25 x z δ p m ω r e d e q u p r e f q r e f y ω r p e the control system simulation is ignored as it is out of the scope of this paper this input output system gives a good approximation of the complete owc device and any linear or nonlinear control algorithm can be implemented with this formulation the conditions are the minimal approximation preservation of stability and passivity of the original system the parameters of the wtw model is represented as follows d 1 π ρ s r c 2 d d 2 π ρ s r c 2 d 3 π r c 2 d 4 π r c 2

matlab code for solving an owc subsystem in time domain was developed the differential equations were solved in the ode45 solver each trial case was simulated for a total duration of 200s with a sampling time of 5 0e 4s the total simulation time 200s was sufficient to capture both the transient and the steady state response of the system the parameters for the simulation are given in table 3 the system excitation is regular h i t i and irregular incoming waves h s t p the results fig 6 a and b of dynamics of the owc were analyzed for different wave heights and periods and were validated with the experimental test data of a similar owc wec gervelas et al 2011 where the experimental points are for various test cases of different wave height hi and period ti two data points represent two experimental cases for each wave height thus two set of experimental trials are run for each sea state total 8 cases the present work matches with the experimental results of the test setup however their simulation model over predicts the experimental test results fig 7 a shows the variation of internal water surface for different wave period at a particular wave height of 0 25 m it shows that the chamber dynamics is frequency dependent and implies that the evaluation of resonance is inevitable for a particular geometry to design an optimal owc chamber moreover evaluation of frequency dependency of the chamber for phase and other reactive control strategies is important the equilibrium state of the water surface elevation can vary in different sea states and internal chamber pressure fig 7 b shows the time series of internal surface elevation for different wave height at resonant condition the internal surface elevation reaches its maximum for its respective wave heights the incoming wave height and internal water surface elevation give a correlation to maximize the energy extraction by evaluating amplitude and phase control the phase portraits of internal water surface displacement vector and velocity vector at different time instances is plotted in fig 8 it shows the dynamical system response at different time instances the low frequency waves take longer time to attain the steady state the internal chamber dynamics with wave elevation for orifice model at different time instances are given in fig 9 from fig 8 and 9 it can be understood that altering z t changes the system response thus a control action on this variable would change the wave energy absorption such a control action can be a latching control using pressure valves henriques et al 2016a xiao et al 2017 fig 10 shows the pneumatic damping of the orifice model of owc for heave motion of waves the damping force evaluated from pneumatic damping coefficient ζ is frequency dependent the damping coefficient and the chamber dynamics change when a turbine is included the pneumatic damping is oscillatory in the air duct and affects the dynamics of the chamber to improve the energy extraction the incoming wave response can be modified to change the damping force and thus a passive loading or a change in the airflow through the duct helps the non dimensional damping coefficient gradually increases with the respective wave frequency and reaches a certain threshold value after the threshold limit the damping coefficient varies according to the heave response hence for smaller orifice and higher frequency the damping force is a linear function of heave amplitude in general kim et al 2007 the non dimensional damping coefficient decreases as the frequency increases 7 2 wtw rom model regular waves fig 11 shows the time series of internal water surface elevation z for different wave heights if the turbine is attached to the chamber the dynamics of internal displacement changes compared to the orifice model because the orifice model ignores the damping in the chamber pertaining to the turbine speed teixeira et al 2013 the variation of z in the beginning is more and reaches the maximum of the air pocket but the mean of oscillation of z shifts above the mean sea level as the turbine starts rotating again higher wave heights have larger amplitudes of sinusoidal oscillation whereas smaller heights have smaller amplitudes that are above still water level showing a quasi sinusoidal behavior the results also follow the similar trend reported in an existing article iturrioz et al 2014 which used cummins equation cummins 1962 by approximating the radiation convolution integral initially in the absence of reactive force from the turbine the internal water surface elevation z reaches to a higher value z 0 2 m which is approximately equivalent to the air column height h a0 fig 12 however when the turbine reactive force increases the internal water surface elevation decreases and attains a steady value slightly above the origin for regular waves a similar analysis was reported using only heave motion xiao et al 2017 the time progression of the pressure variations inside the owc chamber with respect to the atmospheric pressure is given in fig 13 the bidirectional airflow in the chamber creates an oscillating pressure and drives the turbine tuning the turbine speed as per the differential pressure drop δp can help getting a wider operating range to evaluate operating range and maximum power output of the turbine δp for different wave heights h i and turbine speeds is calculated for different sea states lópez et al 2014 a maximum power point tracking algorithm helps in such analysis similar results are reported by teixeira et al 2013 the torque t t or power produced by the turbine increases with wave height fig 14 and the model predicts it however higher wave heights give larger torque ripples which can be altered according to the incoming wave henriques et al 2016b with the help of an airflow control fig 15 a shows the relationship between axial velocity v x and differential pressure δp when δp 4 kpa maximum v x 12 m s this variation δp decreases with wave heights sarmento et al 1990 the variation of mass flow and differential pressure across the turbine fig 15 b clearly show the operating modes of an owc device the four quadrant operation specifies that the model absorbs energy from waves when airflow and chamber pressure are in opposite direction opposing signs if airflow and differential pressure are in the same direction same sign the system works as a compressor and the airflow acts against the differential pressure nunes et al 2011 the maximum rotor speed is same for a given wave period while it attains its peak speed at a different time as the wave height changes fig 16 the turbine starts quickly at larger wave heights and oscillates more the rotor speed amplitude is a function of incoming wave period and the turbine starting characteristics is a function of wave height this result indicates that the rotor speed is a control variable justino and de o falcã o 1999 and the control system design is not included in this work it is the future scope of this wtw model the owc efficiency depends upon the turbine generator coupling as the damping ξ is a function of geometry and the rotational speed of the turbine generator the incoming wave frequency affects the energy conversion process fig 17 shows the damping variations for different wave periods t i similar results were reported by choi et al 2004 however their work summarized the results in frequency scale this work shows the pneumatic damping in time scale this work shows that the damping of the turbine can be altered to a desired value by altering the rotational speed of the generator thereby modifying the turbine speed fig 18 a b show the time series plot of mechanical power developed across the turbine shaft for different wave heights and wave periods respectively the waves with larger wave heights and frequencies close to chamber natural frequency delivers relatively higher power the peak power reaches to 3 kw table 4 shows the mean power developed and conversion efficiency for different sea states fig 19 a b shows the time series of electromagnetic torque for h i 0 15 m and 0 1 m respectively for ti 5s a larger wave height gives a larger torque ripple corresponding to the turbine rotational speed in third order model of dfig the electromagnetic torque is a function of transient voltage and stator current the current component controls the electromagnetic torque the results in fig 20 shows the time series of transient voltages at different time instances for h i 0 5 m and t i 5s for t 0 10s the rotational speed increases linearly with time for t 10s the speed reaches to a steady state thus it affects the transient voltage which again increases with the turbine rotational speed and depends on wave heights as the reactive power for the dfig comes from the rotors the stator current eliminates high transient spikes the evolution of stator current in dq frame can be seen in fig 21 thus reduced order dfig is able to deliver the power depending on the turbine rotational speed fig 22 shows the dynamics of the transient voltages at a different instance of time the direct and quadrature axis voltage has initial transients for 5s then it gradually attains the steady state the number of points in the circular path of the transient voltage increases at the edge of the figure because of the magnetic saturation effect it is clear that the rom produces a higher degree of accuracy in transient behavior and the computation time is relatively lower than the full order model similar results were analyzed by wang et al 2014 for a full order model of dfig 7 3 wtw rom model irregular waves the owc in real sea state would experience random incoming waves thus it is necessary to analyze the performance of wtw model in irregular waves the irregular wave model can characterize real wave there are several wave model such as pierson moskowitz pm bretschneider jonswap the test wave used for simulation is based on pm spectrum for fully developed sea the pm spectrum is described by significant wave height h s and peak period t p the pm spectrum produces irregular waves which characterizes real sea waves fig 23 a shows the wave spectrum for h s 0 8 m and t p 5s which is more prominent in the east cost of india fig 23 b shows the wave surface elevation obtained with exactly the same configuration fig 24 shows the simulation results when the wtw model is subjected to irregular wave the model was simulated for the same irregular time series for t 80s fig 24 a shows the variation of wave elevation η t internal surface elevation in the chamber and velocity developed at the turbine there is approximately a phase delay of π 2 between the air velocity and other two variables the phase lag can be observed in different sea state the compressibility effect of the air pocket attributes to this delay the time progression of flow coefficient and turbine torque for irregular test wave is shown in fig 24 b c the test wave is of smaller amplitude and thus the turbine does the reach the stall threshold φ 0 3 however for larger waves the turbine is affected by aerodynamic stalling furthermore the flow coefficient should be maintained below stall limit for efficient operation of wells turbine in all sea states fig 24 d shows the angular velocity of the turbine for irregular wave it can be observed that the turbine takes a considerable time to start and reach its operational speed however the speed does not reduces drastically when a smaller wave strikes after a large wave this is the flywheel effect of the turbine generator rotor as a result some amount of energy is stored in its kinetic energy form and delivers during pneumatic power fluctuations in a cycle of operation of the wave from the above discussion it was found that the present model agrees with most of the existing models which are normally reported for independent sub system analysis the present model couples all the subsystem of the owc and predicts the power output for different sea state and defines the complete model into state space formulation which can be used to incorporate control system studies 8 conclusion a reduced order model rom for wave to wire power output prediction of an owc is presented in this study the rom reduces the dimensions of the system and extracts a dynamic model relevant to control systems the capture chamber dynamics to evaluate the pressure drop and flow velocities for different wave conditions with an orifice fitted in the outlet of the chamber were evaluated further a time domain model incorporated the wells turbine and generator model the conclusions are results of the proposed wtw reduced order model for regular and irregular incoming waves are studied and the performance of the model is reported the model gave a coherent picture of the dynamics of internal surface elevation for various wave conditions and its effect on other dynamically coupled devices when the turbine started rotating the damping associated with the coupled system changed and affected the internal dynamics of the chamber the inner free surface elevation did not oscillate at mean water level quasi steady the generator dynamics was modeled using a 3rd order model of dfig the stator flux oscillations were removed the model was adequate for transient and steady state operation the model allowed one to deal with the machine with only three differential equations in the electrical part the initial transients of the state variable of dfig were captured in this model the time domain model of owc with a state space representation can be readily used for developing its control system as a speed control can be easily achieved by selecting the rotor current controllable state as control variable the proposed wtw model is helpful to understand various design and performance issues in owc device without much modification of the actual physical system the developed wtw rom can be used for development of control strategies for owc wec to improve its overall wtw efficiency and improve the reliability of owc

23078,the design of offshore support structures for wind turbines of 10 mw capacity presents a challenge due to potential resonance problems from the low rotor speeds during operation the present work delineates the optimization based design of jacket type sub structures at 50 m water depths for a 10 mw turbine by exploring the frequency constraint space of the sub structure and confirming feasibility of a cost effective design away from rotor excitation the conceptual design is made using a two level optimization framework the outer design problem i e overall jacket dimensioning is solved by a derivative free optimization method the inner problem which consists of member sizing is solved using a robust and efficient sequential quadratic programming method the objective of the optimization is innovatively chosen as to minimize the fundamental natural frequency of the structure while subject to frequency constraints tower top displacement constraints and member ultimate stress constraints the resulting design is modified during the process of verifying that all ultimate and fatigue limit states are met using fully coupled aero hydro elastic simulations the final design is a low mass four legged jacket that fully complies with offshore structural standard requirements for all design limit states while not being affected by rotor excitation thus being best suited for long operating life keywords wind energy structural optimization sensitivity analysis offshore sub structures fatigue welded joints 1 introduction towards reducing the levelized cost of energy lcoe the size of offshore wind turbines has significantly increased to 9 5 mw capacities in recent years de vries 2017 the design of sub structures for such large wind turbines is challenging since the support structure natural frequencies can be within the ranges of rotor harmonics which results in resonances von borstel 2013 this problem is the result of two critical outcomes of traditional wind turbine design firstly larger rotors for bigger capacities result in lower rotational speeds p due to tip speed constraints implying that multiples of rotor speed for a 3 bladed rotor such as 3p 3 times rotor speed and 6p 6 times rotor speed are lowered and within the range of structural natural frequencies secondly sub structures such as jackets are intrinsically stiff structures whose natural frequencies tend to lie within certain ranges and difficult to alter in the traditional design process passon 2015 of the commercially installed offshore wind turbines presently most are supported on monopile foundations whereas jackets constitute only about 5 of the population kallehave et al 2015 this is because a significant portion of the installations have been made at mean water depths less than 30 m for which monopiles are well suited to meet the european offshore wind targets of 2030 and beyond european environmental agency 2009 it is necessary to also install large number of wind turbines in deeper waters 40 m 50 m thus requiring more jacket type sub structures as suited at those depths usually such structures are based on design philosophies spin off from the oil and gas industry that has been using jackets for several decades however in the case of the wind turbine a significant part of the mechanical loads on the jacket stem from the wind turbine rotor which in turn is wind driven as differing from an oil rig where the loading is primarily wave driven the wind driven loads are due to turbulence primarily from the wakes within offshore wind farms and this can result in significant fatigue damage to jacket welded joints the structural design of jackets is usually based on iso 19902 and complimented by regional standards and certification body guidelines branner et al 2013 due to the large variability in the loads the lifetime of the jacket structure can vary greatly from welded joint to welded joint conti et al 2018 and this is based on a required annual reliability level determined from an extensive processing of load simulation results branner et al 2013 the effects of wind turbulence are amplified in the presence of support structure excitation through the rotor harmonics conti et al 2018 the excitation range of the turbine can be identified using a campbell diagram through which the rotor speed values and its multiples thereof that contribute most to fatigue damage may be determined further the fatigue damage is usually direction dependent that is based on the wind wave direction the fatigue damage incurred by different jacket members varies the american petroleum institute api api 2005 states a minimum of eight directional load analyses are required for symmetrical platforms with additional directions required for unsymmetrical structures to ensure appropriate structural integrity in the present study the design of a jacket at 50 m water depth is assisted by structural optimization techniques optimization methods have been used by others in literature for offshore structures toğan et al 2010 and integrated with wind turbine design fischer et al 2012 recently various models and methods for structural optimization of jacket support structures have been proposed in a number of articles see e g chew et al 2015 2016 oest et al 2017 2018 sandal et al 2018a 2018b and stolpe and sandal 2018 the objective is usually to minimize weight or cost and the design variables are generally dimensions of the structural members while weight is a relevant objective since the natural frequency of the structure is inversely proportional to the square root of mass minimization of the mass can imply that the jacket frequency will not be sufficiently reduced since the jacket structure is inherently very stiff minimization of mass with constraints on displacements may also increase natural frequencies for 10 mw wind turbines this implies excitation from rotor harmonics and thereby also increase in the fatigue damage due to resonance issues also the mass of the offshore support structure increases approximately quadratically with wind turbine power capacity for fixed water depth chaviaropoulos et al 2014 as the wind turbine grows from conventional 5 mw capacities jonkman et al 2009 to the 10 mw scale this implies that jacket natural frequencies are constrained by the natural scale law as not being flexible in the vertical direction thus a new approach to optimize jacket structures is needed that does not seek to minimize mass but instead seeks to avoid resonance of jacket members while satisfying all other constraints this work proposes to minimize the fundamental structural frequency of the jacket wind turbine structure and not the mass while subject to constraints on tower top displacement natural frequency ranges and member ultimate and fatigue stress limits it is proposed that the optimization will allow for reduction in jacket stiffness and not increase in mass towards the minimization of the first fundamental frequency structural optimization is a multi disciplinary and active research field covering many aspects of optimal design of load carrying mechanical structures and it is today an indispensable tool both for academia and in industrial applications see e g bendsøe and sigmund 2003 structural optimization of frame structures has received considerable attention in the literature applications include stiffness optimization in fredricson et al 2003 and fredricson 2005 crash worthiness design of cars using transient analysis in pedersen 2003 2004 and reliability based optimization in e g mogami et al 2006 structural optimization of frames has besides the mentioned literature on jacket optimization also received some attention in offshore wind energy structural optimization of towers are considered in e g negm and maalawi 2000 yoshida 2006 and uys et al 2007 reliability based design optimization of towers for mass minimization with constraint on yield stress buckling stress and natural frequencies is presented in toğan et al 2010 optimization of an offshore support structure using integrated design of controllers and dimensioning is presented in fischer et al 2012 in this article we present an approach to perform simultaneous overall dimensioning and preliminary structural optimization of jacket sub structures for offshore wind turbines the structure is described by two types of design variables allowing for both changes to the geometry as well as the dimensions of the members in the jacket the choice of design parametrization thus allows for greater design freedom than normally seen in structural optimization of jacket structures the outer variables model overall dimensions of the structure such as the jacket base and top widths and the transition piece height the outer variables also model the locations of the x and k joints in conventional jacket structures i e changes to the geometry of the structure are allowed the inner design variables represent the dimensions of the members in the ground structure representing the jacket structure i e diameters and thickness distribution of the members that constitute the x braces and legs these dimensions are not allowed to become zero since this would change the topology of the jacket although this is potentially desirable it also causes both theoretical and numerical issues and is left for future research the structural response is computed by the finite element method for linear elasticity based on timoshenko beam elements see e g cook et al 1989 the conceptual decisions on number of legs or on number of levels of x braces are not included in the optimization problem at this point but are instead taken care of by parametric studies the realistic number of combinations of legs and x braces is fairly modest and enumeration is possible the proposed problem formulation contains constraints on the member dimensions static constraints for example on displacements and local stresses and bounds on fundamental frequencies although the optimal design problems are far from containing all relevant constraints and dynamic loads the approach is sufficiently competent to find realistic structures for the conceptual design phase in a relatively short period of time and computational effort the outer problem is solved by a derivative free optimization method see e g conn et al 2008 since analytical sensitivities for the considered type of variables are difficult to derive and they are also expensive to estimate using finite differences furthermore the outer problem has a rather small number of variables and only linear constraints thus is a good candidate for derivative free methods the inner problem formulations are solved using robust and efficient modern derivative based optimization methods such as primal dual interior point methods see e g nocedal and wright 1999 or by sequential quadratic programming sqp methods see e g boggs and tolle 1995 these methods are known to provide good results and require a modest number of function evaluations on many problems these methods require accurate and efficient sensitivity analysis of the objective and constraint functions the following sections delineate the optimization framework conducive for best in class large wind turbine jacket design and its design verification 2 design methodology the design of jacket type sub structures for 10 mw wind turbines is highly complex due to the significant excitation caused by the rotor rotational harmonics von borstel 2013 while for other types of sub structures such as monopiles in shallow water depths this problem may be avoided using active turbine control these are not applicable for jackets due to the intrinsically stiff nature of the structure offshore wind turbine jacket structures are designed using a variety of standards that are applied at different stages of the design process the mechanical loads on the jacket are determined using a series of aeroelastic load simulations as obtained from a model of the offshore turbine system with wind wave inputs natarajan 2014 these load simulations follow the iec 61400 3 international 2009 design load cases and the iec 61400 1 international 2005 wind conditions the loads on the wind turbine structures including the jacket are computed as a time series as resulting from blade aerodynamics and the morison equation morison et al 1950 for wave loads these load time series from various wind wave conditions are processed to determine the 50 year extreme load at different jacket joints combined with the partial safety factors for the loads and material as given in the iec 61400 1 the stress at each member and joint of the jacket are determined using appropriate structural analysis considering also the required stress concentration factors the joints are typically divided into y k and x joints y joints are used for connections between the braces and legs of the structure but at the top or at the bottom i e with no braces further above or below respectively k joints are similar to y joints but connect the legs to in between successive braces the x joints constitute the center of braces the lifetime fatigue damage at each location of the jacket structure is calculated by aggregation of the individual fatigue damage due to each stress cycle computed from load simulations and weighted with the probability of occurrence of the generating wind wave state the aggregation is made using the palmgren miner s rule miner 1945 the above design procedure is time consuming since several turbulent wind time series each of 10 min duration have to be simulated per mean wind speed bin to achieve statistically acceptable fatigue and ultimate design load levels moreover changes in the jacket design made to satisfy stress or life criteria can result in further load simulations to re evaluate the design loads since the natural frequencies or mode shapes of the sub structure coupled to the wind turbine may have changed to be computationally efficient the design process followed herein is to assume that the tower top or rotor design loads do not change when the jacket design is altered in the optimization process and the design of the jacket is made uncoupled with the wind turbine in literature it has been shown that the uncoupled formulation results in a more conservative jacket design haselbach et al 2013 the specific steps followed are as the tower top design driving 50 year extreme thrust and side force are applied as static loads obtained from bak et al 2013 the optimization is run with tower top displacement constraints ultimate stress constraints on all jacket members and a damage equivalent stress constraint based on s n curve at the extreme load level fully coupled aeroelastic simulations with normal turbulence and normal waves is run on the optimized jacket with 10 min wind wave time series input in mean wind speed bins between 5 m s 25 m s and with changing rotor directions over 360 in steps of 22 5 based on the results of the load simulations done the fatigue lifetime and ultimate limit states are verified the jacket members are re sized at locations where the limit state assessments indicate insufficient fatigue life or insufficient margins in ultimate limit state 2 1 problem formulations the traditional iterative methods to design jackets at 10 mw would either yield very heavy structures to survive the fatigue damage for 25 years lifetime or would have fatigue failure prematurely von borstel 2013 further fatigue damage constraints on structural members during the optimization are challenging to implement or need simplified evaluations using frequency domain fatigue computations which do not capture all the load combinations shown in time domain simulations schafhirt and muskulus 2014 unlike these common structural optimization approaches which have mass minimization as the objective the objective for the present problem is to minimize the first fundamental frequency of the structure while keeping further few natural frequencies within defined bounds as a means to maintain required fatigue life the outer optimization problem determines the overall dimensions of a sub structure where the connectivity is assumed to be given the continuous outer design variables are denoted by w ℝ n o where n o is the number of outer variables they model among other things the base width the top width the positions of joints such as x and k joints in classical jacket structures the feasible set of the outer problem is assumed to be described only by linear constraints with these kind of constraints it is possible to model box bounds on the variables the outer problem is modelled as 1 minimize w ℝ n o ω 1 2 w subject to a w b where ω 1 w is the first fundamental frequency of the structure defined by the outer design variables w a is a given matrix and b is a given vector both of appropriate dimensions the outer problem is a linearly constrained nonlinear problem the objective function in 1 is obtained by attempting to solve an inner optimization problem which is a structural sizing problem note that the inner optimization problem can be in feasible if the outer design variables are inappropriately chosen the design variables in the inner problem are also continuous and model member dimensions i e wall thickness distribution and member diameters let v ℝ n i be a vector of inner design variables where n i is the number of inner design variables for each member in the jacket ground structure we assign two design variables one variable describes the wall thickness of the member while the other describes the inner radius of the cross section the members are assumed to have constant cross sections over the length the inner problem is formulated as 2 ω 1 2 w minimize v ℝ n i ω 1 2 v subject to ω k 2 ω k 2 v ω k 2 k 2 k max p l u l v p l l s σ j u l v x k σ γ m l d j j k k v w the set w contains linear constraints such as bounds involving only the design variables the generalized displacements u l v are the solution to the static equilibrium equations cf below the given parameters ω k 2 ω k 2 are lower and upper bounds on the kth fundamental eigenfrequency the inner problem 2 contains the possibility to include local displacement constraints i e constraints specific to a location or degree of freedom in the structure each row in the user supplied matrix p l can be used to define a local displacement constraint it is assumed that p l is independent of the inner and outer design variables the bounds on the displacement constraints are described by the design independent vectors p l the inner problem 2 also contains the possibility to include local strength constraints based on the von mises stress the allowed limit on the von mises stress is denoted by σ it is assumed that the same material is used for the entire structure and that the material partial safety factor γ m 1 is prescribed the index set j contains the indices of the finite elements for which the von mises stress constraints are included in the formulation and the set k contains a list of locations within the finite elements note that the inner problem 2 is a non convex optimization problem and hence it cannot be guaranteed that the method finds a minimum furthermore due to the non convexity it cannot be assured that the problem actually is infeasible in the situations that the method deems it numerically infeasible the overall structural optimization process to design the jacket is summarized in the flow chart given in fig 1 2 2 structural analysis the structural analysis is based on an in house finite element program for linear elasticity see e g cook et al 1989 the code uses tubular beam elements based on timoshenko beam theory for the legs braces and tower the code is specifically designed with structural optimization in mind i e it is designed to efficiently compute both relevant functions displacements stresses eigenfrequencies etc and their derivatives with respect to the design variables the stiffness matrix k w v ℝ d d and the mass matrix m w v ℝ d d become non linear mappings in the design variables here d is the number of non fixed degrees of freedom throughout this article we do not allow that members vanish from the original structure i e the inner design variables are not allowed to become zero thus both the stiffness and mass matrices are positive definite for all inner design variables satisfying the box constraints the notations k w v and m w v are used to emphasize that the stiffness and mass matrices are parametrized by the outer design variables w for example two different choices of outer design variables may lead to different number of degrees of freedom for the inner optimal design problem the stiffness and mass matrices are reduced in size to deal with the dirichlet boundary conditions the equilibrium equations for the static load case l are given by 3 k w v u l f l v for all l s where the index set s represents the static loads the static loads are modelled as design dependent i e f l is a function of the design variables this is used to model self weight the first m fundamental frequencies ω k 2 are determined from the generalized eigenvalue problem 4 k w v z k ω k 2 m w v z k for k 1 m where the eigenvectors are assumed to be m orthonormal i e z i t m w z k δ i k the frequencies are assumed to be ordered such that 0 ω 1 2 ω 2 2 ω d 2 due to the assumptions stated above the stiffness matrix k w v is on the form 5 k w v k 0 j k j w v where k 0 is the stiffness matrix in global coordinates for the part of the structure which is independent of the design variables e g the tower and the model of the rotor nacelle assembly the stiffness matrices k j w v can be written as 6 k j w v a j v k j a i j v k j i κ j v a j v k j κ where the matrices k j a k j i and k j κ are independent of the inner design variables here a j v is the area κ j v is the shear correction factor and i j v is the second moment of area of the j th design element respectively the matrices k j a k j i and k j κ are constructed by an assembly process over all finite elements which are related to the j th design element similarly the mass matrix m v is on the form 7 m w v m 0 j m j w v where m 0 is the mass matrix in global coordinates for the part of the structure which is independent of the design variables the element mass matrices m j w v can be written as 8 m j w v a j v m j a i j v m j i where the matrices m j a and m j i are independent of the design variables it follows that analytical sensitivities of the mass and stiffness matrices can be efficiently and accurately computed 2 3 design sensitivity analysis this section contains a presentation of the required sensitivity analysis for the considered objective and constraint functions used in the inner problem 2 design sensitivity analysis is extensively covered in e g the monographs choi and kim 2005a 2005b throughout this section the sub index l is dropped for notational simplicity 2 3 1 static response let c v denote the static constraint function c v p t u v where p ℝ d is a given design independent vector the partial derivative with respect to the i the design variable of c v is given by c v v i p t u v i p t k 1 v v i f v p t k 1 v f v v i p t k 1 v k v v i k 1 v f v p t k 1 v f v v i let η be the solution to the adjoint problem k v η p where p is normally referred to as a pseudo load then the sensitivities are given by c v v i η t k v v i u v η t f v v i where u v is the unique solution to the static equilibrium equation 3 note that this sensitivity analysis can be extended to von mises stress constraints the details are omitted the analysis outlined above requires computations of the sensitivities of the mass and stiffness matrices respectively due to the partitioning of these design element stiffness and mass matrices outlined in 5 6 and 7 8 this becomes a fairly uncomplicated operation e g k w v v i j 1 n k j w v v i with k j w v v i a j v v i k j a i j v v i k j i κ j v a j v v i k j κ for circular cross sections areas inertia and shear correction factors are given analytically and computing sensitivities of element stiffness matrices is possible similar observations also hold for the element mass matrices 2 3 2 eigenfrequencies sensitivities of fundamental eigenfrequencies ω k 2 v are problematic if they are multiple in this case the function ω k 2 v becomes non differentiable see e g seyranian et al 1994 and the references therein it is therefore assumed and the numerical experiments support this assumption that the first few fundamental frequencies are distinct the reason for this is the break of symmetry due to the inertias in the model of the rotor nacelle assembly the sensitivity of ω k 2 with respect to the design variable v i is in the case of a simple eigenfrequency given by see e g fox and kapoor 1968 and seyranian et al 1994 ω k 2 v i z k t k v v i ω k 2 m v v i z k where again the eigenvectors are assumed to be m orthonormal i e z i t m z k δ i k 3 implementation and parameters the two node finite elements are based on timoshenko beam theory and use standard shape functions and the integration of the finite element stiffness mass matrices and loads are computed using gauss quadrature the shear correction factors for the cylindrical timoshenko beams are computed using the results in hutchinson 2001 marine growth and corrosion protection allowance have not been included in the numerical experiments secondary structures such as boat landings j tubes sacrificial anodes and ladders are not included in the models the jacket structures are assumed to be fully clamped at the sea bed hence modelling of the actual soil foundation coupling is not taken into account the airgap between the mean water level and the tower bottom is 26 m the model of the tower used in the numerical experiments closely follows the model of the reference presented in bak et al 2013 the tower is partitioned into ten prismatic segments with circular cross sections each with constant wall thickness and diameter the diameter of a segment in the prismatic model is the mean of the end diameters in the corresponding conical segment the rotor nacelle assembly is modelled as a lumped mass of 676 723 kg at the tower top at height 115 63 m together with a moment of inertia about the x axis of 1 66 10 8 kgm 2 a moment of inertia about the y axis of 1 27 10 8 kgm 2 and a moment of inertia about the z axis of 1 27 10 8 kgm 2 the highest horizontal thrust force at tower top located at 115 63 m is set to 4800 kn with a simultaneous fore aft bending moment of 18000 knm bak et al 2013 both include the partial safety factor for ultimate loads a concentrated vertical load from the tower top mass is also included in the model these loads are assumed to be independent of all design variables the young s modulus and density for steel are throughout assumed to be e 210 gpa and ρ 7850 0 kg m 3 for the jacket structures for the tower the density is adjusted following bak et al 2013 to 8500 0 kg m 3 to account for the mass of secondary structures the poisson s ratio is set to ν 0 3 the outer optimization problem eqn 1 is solved by the generalized pattern search gps method implemented in the matlab routine patternsearch see e g audet and dennis 2003 and abramson et al 2009 the options for the gps method are largely set to default values we however restrict the number of gps iterations to 1000 and the number of function evaluations i e the number of inner problems solved to 500 a time limit of 24 h is also imposed the nonlinear inner optimization problems eqn 2 are solved by the robust and efficient sqp method implemented in snopt version 7 1 gill et al 2002 the solver options are to a large extent set to default values the optimality and feasibility tolerances are increased compared to the default values to reduce the number of objective and constraint function and gradient evaluations they are increased from 10 6 to 10 3 and 10 5 respectively manufacturing or design catalog requirements corrosion allowance effects of icing or add ons such as appurtenances are not considered in this process the structural analysis routines used in the optimization method have been validated by exporting the jacket structure and tower modelled as a frame structure to the commercial finite element software abaqus abaqus was used to validate the implementation by comparing global responses of the jacket and tower such as the lowest eigen frequencies and tower top displacements for some of the applied loads validation has also been done in a similar way for local stresses the analytical design sensitivity analyses implemented in the optimization framework have been compared to the results from finite differences and found to give accurate results 4 wind turbine setup the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine bak et al 2013 is utilized in the computation of the design loads on the jacket the system level properties of the dtu 10 mw turbine are given in table 1 the initial reference for the jacket of this 10 mw wind turbine is taken from the innwind eu project deliverable d4 31 von borstel 2013 which satisfies the ultimate load conditions but does not fulfill the fatigue life requirements of 25 years this is due to the significant 3p excitation of the support structure from the rotor the fully coupled design load simulations on the turbine with jacket are done using the aeroelastic software hawc2 larsen and hansen 2012 the software hawc2 utilizes a multibody formulation which couples different elastic bodies together using timoshenko beam finite elements the mann wind turbulence model mann 1994 is used in the load case simulation to represent the input wind turbulence over the rotor random gaussian 10 min turbulent wind realizations are used as input to simulate normal operation over 11 equally spaced mean wind speed bins 5 m s 25 m s in 16 equally spaced directions aligned with the rotor in each case and with 10 yaw misalignment the input ocean waves are assumed to be aligned with the wind random wave kinematics are utilized according to the linear airy model with wheeler stretching and nonlinear wave components are not considered the hydrodynamic forces on the jacket are computed using the morison equation morison et al 1950 5 conceptual design of the jacket the description of the reference turbine bak et al 2013 lists the 1p frequency range to be 0 1 0 16 hz the 3p range is thus 0 3 0 48 hz and the 6p range is 0 6 0 96 hz further the wave excitation frequency is between the frequencies 0 1 0 2 hz the natural frequencies of the support structure including jacket should thereby be in the interval 0 2 0 28 or in the interval 0 54 0 58 or above 1 0 hz for the present design case we have targeted to place the two first fundamental frequencies in the first interval the higher frequencies in the second interval or above 1 0 hz the outer variables are bounded by the values listed in table 2 the relative positions of the x and k joints are also included in the list of outer design variables the locations of the k joint are allowed to move over the length of the leg and are only constrained not to coincide the locations of the x joints are allowed to move in the middle of the plane described by the two incident legs again the included constraints prevent two joints to coincide i e joints cannot vanish from the final structure the outer problem has in total 11 continuous variables the inner variables are bounded by the values listed in table 3 furthermore we include a number of constraints linking the variables in the various members the members of the x braces all have the same dimensions in every section and the same applied for the leg members the inner problem has before reductions through variable linking 226 design variables the tower top is not allowed to displace more than 3 2 m in any direction for any load we have also included local static stress constraints the von mises stresses are constrained not to exceed 355 mpa anywhere in the jacket sub structure 5 1 optimization results the results from the optimization process are shown in table 4 and table 5 from which it can be seen that the resulting jacket has a low mass of 654 tons where most of the mass rests with the braces see table 4 as can be seen from table 4 the optimization moves towards enabling similar diameters and wall thicknesses for the braces and legs even though the legs are wider and thicker as in conventional jackets the braces are also of significant cross sectional area thus allowing for thick welded joints at the intersections since the stress hot spots are at the welded joints this optimized design enables the jacket to withstand fatigue and ultimate design stress limit while the optimizer had fixed constraints on fatigue and ultimate stresses using fixed tower top loads and assumed max load cycles in fatigue there has been no coupled iterations with an aeroelastic software to verify that the fatigue and ultimate loads are indeed within the design margins the next sections verify the found jacket design using full coupled aeroelastic simulations 6 verification of the design integrity of the optimized jacket the optimized jacket needs to be assessed using fully coupled aeroelastic simulations under normal wind turbulence and normal sea state conditions to confirm that its fatigue lifetime is satisfactory and that the ultimate loads during operation do not exceed the standstill extreme loads used as constraints in the optimization process the iec 61400 3 international 2005 recommends that load assessment is carried out considering variable wind and wave directions the primary verification concerns the ultimate limit state where the extreme stresses are checked against the allowable stress the buckling limit state where the compressive stress in the slender members are seen not to produce any instability and the fatigue limit state where the accumulated damage during the structure lifetime should not lead to fatigue failure the ultimate and fatigue limit states are based on stresses whose magnitudes are magnified at the welded joints compared to their nominal values thus it is sufficient to carry out the verification at the welded joints where failures generally occur for beam with constant section and unique material in this study the verification will be carried out at all the lowest members of the jacket and at the members near the transition piece as these are the most vulnerable locations that is at the fixed boundaries 6 1 environmental conditions and load assessment the site specific metocean conditions assumed in the load simulations during wind turbine operation are presented in table 6 several loads simulations of design load case dlc 1 2 are made using hawc2 with the input wind wave conditions shown in table 6 it is particularly important that the load simulations include the rotor facing different directions over a 360 polar so as to account for a variation in dynamic loading over the different faces of the jacket random gaussian 10 min turbulent wind realizations are used as input to simulate normal operation over 11 mean wind speed bins spanning from 5 m s 25 m s in 16 equally spaced directions collinear with the rotor in each case and with 10 degree yaw misalignment thus each mean wind speed has 3 yaw mis alignments and 16 wind directions to simulate with one random wind turbulence seed the input waves are assumed to be aligned with the wind random wave kinematics are computed according to the linear airy model with wheeler stretching the hydrodynamic forces are calculated based on the morison equation the structure is assumed to be embedded all degrees of freedom are fully restrained at the seabed implying the soil is not considered in the simulation this set of conditions provides 11 1 3 16 528 load time series of 10 min duration this provides a high fidelity set of simulations to verify the limit states on all the members of the jacket the internal loads are observed over several members of the jacket which are typically the most vulnerable von borstel 2013 each jacket leg is numbered leg 1 leg 2 leg 3 or leg 4 similarly each side is named from the boundary leg number side 1 2 side 2 3 side 3 4 or side 4 1 on a side the connections of the lowest braces to the legs at the floor just above the mud brace are also numbered 1 or 2 according to their position left or right respectively thus the hotspot appellation is formed from the side number and its position 1 2 1 1 2 2 or 2 3 1 for example based on the load time series computed from the hydro servo aero elastic simulation nominal axial stresses are calculated at a given location by taking the absolute maximum over eight angular positions at a joint as depicted in fig 4 and given by 9 σ x θ f x a m z r i sin θ m y r i cos θ where f x m z and m y are respectively the axial force in the member x direction and the two bending moments in the member about the two axes perpendicular to the axial direction the geometry parameters r a and i are the outer radius the cross section area and the cross section second moment respectively while θ is the circumferential coordinate measured from axis y along the saddle direction at the joint at welded joints the nominal axial stress σ x θ that is the stress calculated at a typical section of the beam is magnified using stress concentration factors scfs to obtain the characteristic axial stress σ k for each side brace side and chord side of the welds the stress concentration factor at the saddle for axial load scf as the stress concentration factor at the crown for axial load scf ac the stress concentration factor for in plane moment scf mip and the stress concentration factor for out of plane moment scf mop are estimated from dnv rp c203 det norske veritas dnv 2013 the characteristic stresses around the weld circumference are computed using 10 σ k θ scf as 2 θ π scf ac 1 2 θ π n a scf mip m x i r sin θ scf mop m y i r cos θ where 0 θ π 2 is the positive value of the angle between the considered point line and x axis 6 2 verification of ultimate load limit states the design stresses are checked against the steel material yield stress at the ultimate limit state the associated utilization ratio u l s γ m γ c γ l σ v f y where the partial safety factors taken from international 2005 γ m 1 30 γ c 1 10 are associated with the material properties and to the components consequence of failure respectively iec 61400 1 ed 3 international 2005 recommends that the partial safety factor related to normal conditions is γ l 1 35 corresponding to the mean of the extreme loads however since all extreme load cases have not been run here γ l is taken to be 1 50 and corresponding to the absolute maximum of the extreme loads the constant f y 355 mpa is the steel yield limit the ultimate stress over all jacket joints is determined using the load simulation results with load extremes occurring in different directions and contemporaneous loads corresponding to the extreme value the peak ultimate stresses are seen to occur at the lowest braces pf the jacket the distribution of the utilization ratio for braces is shown in table 7 wherein the utilization ratio for braces are all much lower than one a failure in ultimate strength limit state would occur only if a magnification of extreme loads by a factor of 3 occurs over what is presently seen this would be unrealistic even if all iec load case situations had been simulated in table 7 the node id corresponds to leg number brace connecting to leg number node number on that brace this 1 2 2 refers to the second node on the brace connecting leg 1 with leg 2 the optimized jacket members are furthermore verified with respect to column buckling as the members are subjected to axial force combined with bending moments eulers formula for buckling is not sufficient to assess the stability the buckling check is required det norske veritas dnv 2011 if k l c i c 2 2 5 e f y where k is the effective length factor l c is the member length i c i a is the radius of gyration and e is the material elastic modulus table 8 presents the slenderness of all members and compares with the threshold it is seen that three members require further assessment lowest part of leg 1 and x brace portions and the mud braces where σ a is the design compression stress σ m 1 is the design bending stress about the given axis f a is the design local buckling strength f k is the design column buckling strength and f e is the euler buckling strength details of the procedure can be found in det norske veritas dnv 2011 table 9 presents the utilization ratios for each of the three members whose slenderness ratios are more than the limit in table 8 the buckling utilization ratios are shown in table 9 to be significantly lower than one indicating the survival of the members with respect to the column buckling limit state based on tables 7 9 it is concluded that the optimized jacket satisfies the necessary ultimate load and buckling constraints 6 3 verification of fatigue limit state and predicted lifetime in order to assess the fatigue limit state the design axial stress σ d is computed from the simulated stress amplitudes at all mean wind speed bins across 16 equally distributed wind directions as explained in section 6 1 life computation of the structural members are based on the palmgren miner s rule using the design s n curve i e the t curve in sea water with cathodic protection as per dnv rp c203 det norske veritas dnv 2013 and using the recommended fatigue design factor fdf det norske veritas dnv 2013 of 3 as recommended for welded joints below the water level with moderate consequences of failure the critical hotspots across the optimized jacket are examined which are the welded joints between the legs and braces or between two braces the damage equivalent stress can be computed using 9 and 12 where n j is the number of design stress cycles accumulated over all the 10 min load simulation results at a particular mean wind speed i w n i is the annual expected number of 10 minute samples for that mean wind speed and n e q is the total number of stress cycles of the year 12 σ e q i 5 25 w n i j 1 n n j σ d j m n e q 1 m the stresses themselves are computed using 10 where the impact of the stress concentration factor on the total stress at a point is to be quantified the stress concentration factors at a welded joint are to be determined empirically using the relations in dnv rp c203 det norske veritas dnv 2013 which are typically a function of four sizing parameters 1 the ratio of wall thickness of the brace to the wall thickness of the leg at the joint τ 2 the ratio of the outer diameter of the leg to twice the thickness of the leg γ 3 the ratio of the outer diameter of the brace to the outer diameter of the leg β and 4 for k and y joints the ratio of the gap between the intersection of two connections to the diameter of the leg ζ the stress concentration in the axial direction on the chord side of a k joint is typically expressed as det norske veritas dnv 2013 13 scf ac τ 0 9 γ 0 5 0 67 β 2 1 16 β sin θ sin θ m a x sin θ m i n 0 3 β m a x β m i n 0 3 1 64 0 29 β 0 38 tan 1 8 ζ similar empirical equations in the bending directions as well as for other types of joints x y can be found in det norske veritas dnv 2013 table 10 provides the variation of the fatigue life over all joints on one side of the jacket where the bottom joint connecting the mud brace to the leg is modelled as a k joint and as a y joint a similar but not identical life distribution can be shown for the other jacket sides as well since the predicted life shown in table 10 does not include the fdf the required fatigue life of each joint should be at least 75 years as seen in table 10 four of the welded joints fail this criteria k joints and y joints are quite similar in classification but in the case of y joints the axial component of the brace connection is counter acted by the shear force in the chord or leg section thus the end connections of the jacket at the base should be modelled as y joint connections table 10 shows the effect of the classification on the bottom welded joint where using the scfs of a y joint results in significantly lower fatigue life than for a k joint if the four joints shown in table 10 times four sides along with the leg connection to the joints are modified to have sufficient fatigue lifetime then the jacket can be confirmed to satisfy the fatigue limit state fully the fully coupled load simulations described in section 6 1 can be re used to determine if the desired fatigue lifetime is met provided the re design does not alter the natural frequencies of the support structure the re design of the four failing joints needs to be done based on two aspects 1 the influence of the stress concentration factors and 2 the stress at the welded joints with respect to the scfs it can be readily see from eq 13 that increase in τ or γ would directly increase the scf in the axial direction however the relationship of the scf with β is less straight forward since it appears in interaction with other variables in those equations thus it can be concluded that to lower the scfs at a welded joint τ or γ would need to be as low as feasible and the influence of β needs to be investigated fig 5 shows the variation in the scf at a tubular welded joint in the different loading directions it can be readily seen that β should be high in order to reduce the scf thus the diameter of the brace should be as near to the diameter of the connecting leg as possible at the welded joint therefore increase in β is beneficial to reduce stresses while eq 13 shows that to lower scf τ or γ needs to be reduced which implies the thickness of the brace to be small in comparison to the thickness of the leg and the thickness of the leg is small in comparison to its diameter however a higher β values not only reduces the scf but also allows for a low stress state since it encourages a larger brace diameter thus the diameter of the brace at the 4 joints with insufficient life in table 10 are first increased to a level that is just short of the diameter of the leg if the fatigue life of these joints is still less than required due to high stress cycles then the thickness of the brace is moderately increased to increase section area until the desired fatigue life is obtained here it is assumed that s n curves with cathodic protection are to be used the fdf above mean sea level for the x braces was assumed to be 2 0 as allowed by the det norske veritas dnv 2013 while the fdf below mean sea level was taken as 3 0 no other partial safety factors were considered in the evaluation of fatigue life the required changed geometry of the affected joints as compared with the output from the optimization procedure is given in table 11 it can be seen that there is an increase in outer diameter of the top brace near the x joint but a significant increase in its wall thickness the corresponding k joint on leg 3 that connects to the brace below also is seen to require significant increase in its wall thickness and diameter with these changes to the optimized jacket geometry the minimum design fatigue life was determined to be 26 years at the top x joint all other hot spots in the jacket had a fatigue life greater than 26 years with the corrections described in table 11 the overall jacket mass was increased from 654 tons reported earlier to 861 tons however the first few frequencies of the support structure are reduced by less than 5 this is due to the high stiffness of the jacket and the fact that all the members changed are only localized to the four joints that had insufficient life without any change made to remaining structure or the transition piece this also shows that localize changes to the jacket structure have little affect on the overall natural frequencies of the support structure which is the essential premise for not using minimization of mass as an objective in the structural optimization of the jacket since the natural frequencies were altered by less than 5 it is assumed that the load simulations need not be repeated on the modified jacket as the underlying dynamics of the wind turbine and support structure remain the same however the sixteen wind wave directions that were used in the above verification can be further permuted to identify the variation in the fatigue damage as a function of the discretization in the number of wind wave directions the variation in fatigue life with varying wind directions is ascertained by bootstrapping that is repeated sampling of a sub set of directions from the original sixteen for example in twelve different directions using the same load time series at each mean wind speed but now sampled from each different subset of 12 wind directions over the 360 polar around the jacket the distribution of fatigue damage on the joints at the braces and legs is determined if the average damage over 26 years for such a sampling is lower than unity at the weakest joint then the jacket design can be said to be robust to variation in wind wave directional loading fig 6 depicts the damage distribution and the mean damage over eight points on the chord side and brace side on the top k joint on leg 3 which was originally the weakest joint from the optimization result the results shown consider the weibull parameters for each wind direction fig 6 shows that the re designed joint dimensions possess the mean net damage level to be below 1 for a design life of 26 years regardless of the number of load directions and regardless of symmetry of the loading directions as a comparison the jacket used in conti et al 2018 designed in the innwind eu project for the 10 mw turbine was more than 1000 tons and requires specialized post welding grinding treatment to meet 25 years fatigue lifetime at all joints thus the present re designed jacket of 861 tons for the 10 mw turbine is a low mass jacket configuration that has moved natural frequencies away from excitation and satisfies all limits states so as to obtain 25 years lifetime without post weld treatments 7 conclusions and future research it was shown that using the single objective of minimization of the fundamental frequency in the structural optimization of offshore wind turbine jackets enables the design of cost effective long life jackets this optimization objective was shown to exploit the full displacement constraints available to significantly reduce the inherent stiffness of the jacket structure to not only minimize its natural frequencies but also reduce the mass the placing of the structural frequencies away from the regions of harmonic excitation allows alleviation of the fatigue damage the resulting optimized jacket had a low fundamental frequency which was below the 3p excitation range and its first five frequencies were away from all excitations the structure further had a low mass for supporting the 10 mw wind turbine and satisfied all ultimate stress and displacement constraints further it was shown by subsequent load analysis of the jacket that there was also no buckling problems a detailed fatigue damage analysis showed that while the optimized jacket produced the required fatigue life time of 25 years or greater at most members which are typically highly stressed it did not possess satisfactory lifetime at four welded members near the transition piece and at the base these jacket members were subsequently re designed which increased the lifetime above 25 years without impacting the natural frequencies of the structure the re designed jacket mass increased by 30 over the initial optimized jacket the final solution still possessed natural frequencies away from excitation and the first fundamental frequency was less than 5 away from the result of the structural optimization thus satisfying all stated requirements future research is recommended in allowing the optimization to consider a probability of fatigue damage exceeding a threshold versus a deterministic approach so as to determine the probability that the lifetime of certain members of the jacket will be below 25 years acknowledgements the research leading

23078,the design of offshore support structures for wind turbines of 10 mw capacity presents a challenge due to potential resonance problems from the low rotor speeds during operation the present work delineates the optimization based design of jacket type sub structures at 50 m water depths for a 10 mw turbine by exploring the frequency constraint space of the sub structure and confirming feasibility of a cost effective design away from rotor excitation the conceptual design is made using a two level optimization framework the outer design problem i e overall jacket dimensioning is solved by a derivative free optimization method the inner problem which consists of member sizing is solved using a robust and efficient sequential quadratic programming method the objective of the optimization is innovatively chosen as to minimize the fundamental natural frequency of the structure while subject to frequency constraints tower top displacement constraints and member ultimate stress constraints the resulting design is modified during the process of verifying that all ultimate and fatigue limit states are met using fully coupled aero hydro elastic simulations the final design is a low mass four legged jacket that fully complies with offshore structural standard requirements for all design limit states while not being affected by rotor excitation thus being best suited for long operating life keywords wind energy structural optimization sensitivity analysis offshore sub structures fatigue welded joints 1 introduction towards reducing the levelized cost of energy lcoe the size of offshore wind turbines has significantly increased to 9 5 mw capacities in recent years de vries 2017 the design of sub structures for such large wind turbines is challenging since the support structure natural frequencies can be within the ranges of rotor harmonics which results in resonances von borstel 2013 this problem is the result of two critical outcomes of traditional wind turbine design firstly larger rotors for bigger capacities result in lower rotational speeds p due to tip speed constraints implying that multiples of rotor speed for a 3 bladed rotor such as 3p 3 times rotor speed and 6p 6 times rotor speed are lowered and within the range of structural natural frequencies secondly sub structures such as jackets are intrinsically stiff structures whose natural frequencies tend to lie within certain ranges and difficult to alter in the traditional design process passon 2015 of the commercially installed offshore wind turbines presently most are supported on monopile foundations whereas jackets constitute only about 5 of the population kallehave et al 2015 this is because a significant portion of the installations have been made at mean water depths less than 30 m for which monopiles are well suited to meet the european offshore wind targets of 2030 and beyond european environmental agency 2009 it is necessary to also install large number of wind turbines in deeper waters 40 m 50 m thus requiring more jacket type sub structures as suited at those depths usually such structures are based on design philosophies spin off from the oil and gas industry that has been using jackets for several decades however in the case of the wind turbine a significant part of the mechanical loads on the jacket stem from the wind turbine rotor which in turn is wind driven as differing from an oil rig where the loading is primarily wave driven the wind driven loads are due to turbulence primarily from the wakes within offshore wind farms and this can result in significant fatigue damage to jacket welded joints the structural design of jackets is usually based on iso 19902 and complimented by regional standards and certification body guidelines branner et al 2013 due to the large variability in the loads the lifetime of the jacket structure can vary greatly from welded joint to welded joint conti et al 2018 and this is based on a required annual reliability level determined from an extensive processing of load simulation results branner et al 2013 the effects of wind turbulence are amplified in the presence of support structure excitation through the rotor harmonics conti et al 2018 the excitation range of the turbine can be identified using a campbell diagram through which the rotor speed values and its multiples thereof that contribute most to fatigue damage may be determined further the fatigue damage is usually direction dependent that is based on the wind wave direction the fatigue damage incurred by different jacket members varies the american petroleum institute api api 2005 states a minimum of eight directional load analyses are required for symmetrical platforms with additional directions required for unsymmetrical structures to ensure appropriate structural integrity in the present study the design of a jacket at 50 m water depth is assisted by structural optimization techniques optimization methods have been used by others in literature for offshore structures toğan et al 2010 and integrated with wind turbine design fischer et al 2012 recently various models and methods for structural optimization of jacket support structures have been proposed in a number of articles see e g chew et al 2015 2016 oest et al 2017 2018 sandal et al 2018a 2018b and stolpe and sandal 2018 the objective is usually to minimize weight or cost and the design variables are generally dimensions of the structural members while weight is a relevant objective since the natural frequency of the structure is inversely proportional to the square root of mass minimization of the mass can imply that the jacket frequency will not be sufficiently reduced since the jacket structure is inherently very stiff minimization of mass with constraints on displacements may also increase natural frequencies for 10 mw wind turbines this implies excitation from rotor harmonics and thereby also increase in the fatigue damage due to resonance issues also the mass of the offshore support structure increases approximately quadratically with wind turbine power capacity for fixed water depth chaviaropoulos et al 2014 as the wind turbine grows from conventional 5 mw capacities jonkman et al 2009 to the 10 mw scale this implies that jacket natural frequencies are constrained by the natural scale law as not being flexible in the vertical direction thus a new approach to optimize jacket structures is needed that does not seek to minimize mass but instead seeks to avoid resonance of jacket members while satisfying all other constraints this work proposes to minimize the fundamental structural frequency of the jacket wind turbine structure and not the mass while subject to constraints on tower top displacement natural frequency ranges and member ultimate and fatigue stress limits it is proposed that the optimization will allow for reduction in jacket stiffness and not increase in mass towards the minimization of the first fundamental frequency structural optimization is a multi disciplinary and active research field covering many aspects of optimal design of load carrying mechanical structures and it is today an indispensable tool both for academia and in industrial applications see e g bendsøe and sigmund 2003 structural optimization of frame structures has received considerable attention in the literature applications include stiffness optimization in fredricson et al 2003 and fredricson 2005 crash worthiness design of cars using transient analysis in pedersen 2003 2004 and reliability based optimization in e g mogami et al 2006 structural optimization of frames has besides the mentioned literature on jacket optimization also received some attention in offshore wind energy structural optimization of towers are considered in e g negm and maalawi 2000 yoshida 2006 and uys et al 2007 reliability based design optimization of towers for mass minimization with constraint on yield stress buckling stress and natural frequencies is presented in toğan et al 2010 optimization of an offshore support structure using integrated design of controllers and dimensioning is presented in fischer et al 2012 in this article we present an approach to perform simultaneous overall dimensioning and preliminary structural optimization of jacket sub structures for offshore wind turbines the structure is described by two types of design variables allowing for both changes to the geometry as well as the dimensions of the members in the jacket the choice of design parametrization thus allows for greater design freedom than normally seen in structural optimization of jacket structures the outer variables model overall dimensions of the structure such as the jacket base and top widths and the transition piece height the outer variables also model the locations of the x and k joints in conventional jacket structures i e changes to the geometry of the structure are allowed the inner design variables represent the dimensions of the members in the ground structure representing the jacket structure i e diameters and thickness distribution of the members that constitute the x braces and legs these dimensions are not allowed to become zero since this would change the topology of the jacket although this is potentially desirable it also causes both theoretical and numerical issues and is left for future research the structural response is computed by the finite element method for linear elasticity based on timoshenko beam elements see e g cook et al 1989 the conceptual decisions on number of legs or on number of levels of x braces are not included in the optimization problem at this point but are instead taken care of by parametric studies the realistic number of combinations of legs and x braces is fairly modest and enumeration is possible the proposed problem formulation contains constraints on the member dimensions static constraints for example on displacements and local stresses and bounds on fundamental frequencies although the optimal design problems are far from containing all relevant constraints and dynamic loads the approach is sufficiently competent to find realistic structures for the conceptual design phase in a relatively short period of time and computational effort the outer problem is solved by a derivative free optimization method see e g conn et al 2008 since analytical sensitivities for the considered type of variables are difficult to derive and they are also expensive to estimate using finite differences furthermore the outer problem has a rather small number of variables and only linear constraints thus is a good candidate for derivative free methods the inner problem formulations are solved using robust and efficient modern derivative based optimization methods such as primal dual interior point methods see e g nocedal and wright 1999 or by sequential quadratic programming sqp methods see e g boggs and tolle 1995 these methods are known to provide good results and require a modest number of function evaluations on many problems these methods require accurate and efficient sensitivity analysis of the objective and constraint functions the following sections delineate the optimization framework conducive for best in class large wind turbine jacket design and its design verification 2 design methodology the design of jacket type sub structures for 10 mw wind turbines is highly complex due to the significant excitation caused by the rotor rotational harmonics von borstel 2013 while for other types of sub structures such as monopiles in shallow water depths this problem may be avoided using active turbine control these are not applicable for jackets due to the intrinsically stiff nature of the structure offshore wind turbine jacket structures are designed using a variety of standards that are applied at different stages of the design process the mechanical loads on the jacket are determined using a series of aeroelastic load simulations as obtained from a model of the offshore turbine system with wind wave inputs natarajan 2014 these load simulations follow the iec 61400 3 international 2009 design load cases and the iec 61400 1 international 2005 wind conditions the loads on the wind turbine structures including the jacket are computed as a time series as resulting from blade aerodynamics and the morison equation morison et al 1950 for wave loads these load time series from various wind wave conditions are processed to determine the 50 year extreme load at different jacket joints combined with the partial safety factors for the loads and material as given in the iec 61400 1 the stress at each member and joint of the jacket are determined using appropriate structural analysis considering also the required stress concentration factors the joints are typically divided into y k and x joints y joints are used for connections between the braces and legs of the structure but at the top or at the bottom i e with no braces further above or below respectively k joints are similar to y joints but connect the legs to in between successive braces the x joints constitute the center of braces the lifetime fatigue damage at each location of the jacket structure is calculated by aggregation of the individual fatigue damage due to each stress cycle computed from load simulations and weighted with the probability of occurrence of the generating wind wave state the aggregation is made using the palmgren miner s rule miner 1945 the above design procedure is time consuming since several turbulent wind time series each of 10 min duration have to be simulated per mean wind speed bin to achieve statistically acceptable fatigue and ultimate design load levels moreover changes in the jacket design made to satisfy stress or life criteria can result in further load simulations to re evaluate the design loads since the natural frequencies or mode shapes of the sub structure coupled to the wind turbine may have changed to be computationally efficient the design process followed herein is to assume that the tower top or rotor design loads do not change when the jacket design is altered in the optimization process and the design of the jacket is made uncoupled with the wind turbine in literature it has been shown that the uncoupled formulation results in a more conservative jacket design haselbach et al 2013 the specific steps followed are as the tower top design driving 50 year extreme thrust and side force are applied as static loads obtained from bak et al 2013 the optimization is run with tower top displacement constraints ultimate stress constraints on all jacket members and a damage equivalent stress constraint based on s n curve at the extreme load level fully coupled aeroelastic simulations with normal turbulence and normal waves is run on the optimized jacket with 10 min wind wave time series input in mean wind speed bins between 5 m s 25 m s and with changing rotor directions over 360 in steps of 22 5 based on the results of the load simulations done the fatigue lifetime and ultimate limit states are verified the jacket members are re sized at locations where the limit state assessments indicate insufficient fatigue life or insufficient margins in ultimate limit state 2 1 problem formulations the traditional iterative methods to design jackets at 10 mw would either yield very heavy structures to survive the fatigue damage for 25 years lifetime or would have fatigue failure prematurely von borstel 2013 further fatigue damage constraints on structural members during the optimization are challenging to implement or need simplified evaluations using frequency domain fatigue computations which do not capture all the load combinations shown in time domain simulations schafhirt and muskulus 2014 unlike these common structural optimization approaches which have mass minimization as the objective the objective for the present problem is to minimize the first fundamental frequency of the structure while keeping further few natural frequencies within defined bounds as a means to maintain required fatigue life the outer optimization problem determines the overall dimensions of a sub structure where the connectivity is assumed to be given the continuous outer design variables are denoted by w ℝ n o where n o is the number of outer variables they model among other things the base width the top width the positions of joints such as x and k joints in classical jacket structures the feasible set of the outer problem is assumed to be described only by linear constraints with these kind of constraints it is possible to model box bounds on the variables the outer problem is modelled as 1 minimize w ℝ n o ω 1 2 w subject to a w b where ω 1 w is the first fundamental frequency of the structure defined by the outer design variables w a is a given matrix and b is a given vector both of appropriate dimensions the outer problem is a linearly constrained nonlinear problem the objective function in 1 is obtained by attempting to solve an inner optimization problem which is a structural sizing problem note that the inner optimization problem can be in feasible if the outer design variables are inappropriately chosen the design variables in the inner problem are also continuous and model member dimensions i e wall thickness distribution and member diameters let v ℝ n i be a vector of inner design variables where n i is the number of inner design variables for each member in the jacket ground structure we assign two design variables one variable describes the wall thickness of the member while the other describes the inner radius of the cross section the members are assumed to have constant cross sections over the length the inner problem is formulated as 2 ω 1 2 w minimize v ℝ n i ω 1 2 v subject to ω k 2 ω k 2 v ω k 2 k 2 k max p l u l v p l l s σ j u l v x k σ γ m l d j j k k v w the set w contains linear constraints such as bounds involving only the design variables the generalized displacements u l v are the solution to the static equilibrium equations cf below the given parameters ω k 2 ω k 2 are lower and upper bounds on the kth fundamental eigenfrequency the inner problem 2 contains the possibility to include local displacement constraints i e constraints specific to a location or degree of freedom in the structure each row in the user supplied matrix p l can be used to define a local displacement constraint it is assumed that p l is independent of the inner and outer design variables the bounds on the displacement constraints are described by the design independent vectors p l the inner problem 2 also contains the possibility to include local strength constraints based on the von mises stress the allowed limit on the von mises stress is denoted by σ it is assumed that the same material is used for the entire structure and that the material partial safety factor γ m 1 is prescribed the index set j contains the indices of the finite elements for which the von mises stress constraints are included in the formulation and the set k contains a list of locations within the finite elements note that the inner problem 2 is a non convex optimization problem and hence it cannot be guaranteed that the method finds a minimum furthermore due to the non convexity it cannot be assured that the problem actually is infeasible in the situations that the method deems it numerically infeasible the overall structural optimization process to design the jacket is summarized in the flow chart given in fig 1 2 2 structural analysis the structural analysis is based on an in house finite element program for linear elasticity see e g cook et al 1989 the code uses tubular beam elements based on timoshenko beam theory for the legs braces and tower the code is specifically designed with structural optimization in mind i e it is designed to efficiently compute both relevant functions displacements stresses eigenfrequencies etc and their derivatives with respect to the design variables the stiffness matrix k w v ℝ d d and the mass matrix m w v ℝ d d become non linear mappings in the design variables here d is the number of non fixed degrees of freedom throughout this article we do not allow that members vanish from the original structure i e the inner design variables are not allowed to become zero thus both the stiffness and mass matrices are positive definite for all inner design variables satisfying the box constraints the notations k w v and m w v are used to emphasize that the stiffness and mass matrices are parametrized by the outer design variables w for example two different choices of outer design variables may lead to different number of degrees of freedom for the inner optimal design problem the stiffness and mass matrices are reduced in size to deal with the dirichlet boundary conditions the equilibrium equations for the static load case l are given by 3 k w v u l f l v for all l s where the index set s represents the static loads the static loads are modelled as design dependent i e f l is a function of the design variables this is used to model self weight the first m fundamental frequencies ω k 2 are determined from the generalized eigenvalue problem 4 k w v z k ω k 2 m w v z k for k 1 m where the eigenvectors are assumed to be m orthonormal i e z i t m w z k δ i k the frequencies are assumed to be ordered such that 0 ω 1 2 ω 2 2 ω d 2 due to the assumptions stated above the stiffness matrix k w v is on the form 5 k w v k 0 j k j w v where k 0 is the stiffness matrix in global coordinates for the part of the structure which is independent of the design variables e g the tower and the model of the rotor nacelle assembly the stiffness matrices k j w v can be written as 6 k j w v a j v k j a i j v k j i κ j v a j v k j κ where the matrices k j a k j i and k j κ are independent of the inner design variables here a j v is the area κ j v is the shear correction factor and i j v is the second moment of area of the j th design element respectively the matrices k j a k j i and k j κ are constructed by an assembly process over all finite elements which are related to the j th design element similarly the mass matrix m v is on the form 7 m w v m 0 j m j w v where m 0 is the mass matrix in global coordinates for the part of the structure which is independent of the design variables the element mass matrices m j w v can be written as 8 m j w v a j v m j a i j v m j i where the matrices m j a and m j i are independent of the design variables it follows that analytical sensitivities of the mass and stiffness matrices can be efficiently and accurately computed 2 3 design sensitivity analysis this section contains a presentation of the required sensitivity analysis for the considered objective and constraint functions used in the inner problem 2 design sensitivity analysis is extensively covered in e g the monographs choi and kim 2005a 2005b throughout this section the sub index l is dropped for notational simplicity 2 3 1 static response let c v denote the static constraint function c v p t u v where p ℝ d is a given design independent vector the partial derivative with respect to the i the design variable of c v is given by c v v i p t u v i p t k 1 v v i f v p t k 1 v f v v i p t k 1 v k v v i k 1 v f v p t k 1 v f v v i let η be the solution to the adjoint problem k v η p where p is normally referred to as a pseudo load then the sensitivities are given by c v v i η t k v v i u v η t f v v i where u v is the unique solution to the static equilibrium equation 3 note that this sensitivity analysis can be extended to von mises stress constraints the details are omitted the analysis outlined above requires computations of the sensitivities of the mass and stiffness matrices respectively due to the partitioning of these design element stiffness and mass matrices outlined in 5 6 and 7 8 this becomes a fairly uncomplicated operation e g k w v v i j 1 n k j w v v i with k j w v v i a j v v i k j a i j v v i k j i κ j v a j v v i k j κ for circular cross sections areas inertia and shear correction factors are given analytically and computing sensitivities of element stiffness matrices is possible similar observations also hold for the element mass matrices 2 3 2 eigenfrequencies sensitivities of fundamental eigenfrequencies ω k 2 v are problematic if they are multiple in this case the function ω k 2 v becomes non differentiable see e g seyranian et al 1994 and the references therein it is therefore assumed and the numerical experiments support this assumption that the first few fundamental frequencies are distinct the reason for this is the break of symmetry due to the inertias in the model of the rotor nacelle assembly the sensitivity of ω k 2 with respect to the design variable v i is in the case of a simple eigenfrequency given by see e g fox and kapoor 1968 and seyranian et al 1994 ω k 2 v i z k t k v v i ω k 2 m v v i z k where again the eigenvectors are assumed to be m orthonormal i e z i t m z k δ i k 3 implementation and parameters the two node finite elements are based on timoshenko beam theory and use standard shape functions and the integration of the finite element stiffness mass matrices and loads are computed using gauss quadrature the shear correction factors for the cylindrical timoshenko beams are computed using the results in hutchinson 2001 marine growth and corrosion protection allowance have not been included in the numerical experiments secondary structures such as boat landings j tubes sacrificial anodes and ladders are not included in the models the jacket structures are assumed to be fully clamped at the sea bed hence modelling of the actual soil foundation coupling is not taken into account the airgap between the mean water level and the tower bottom is 26 m the model of the tower used in the numerical experiments closely follows the model of the reference presented in bak et al 2013 the tower is partitioned into ten prismatic segments with circular cross sections each with constant wall thickness and diameter the diameter of a segment in the prismatic model is the mean of the end diameters in the corresponding conical segment the rotor nacelle assembly is modelled as a lumped mass of 676 723 kg at the tower top at height 115 63 m together with a moment of inertia about the x axis of 1 66 10 8 kgm 2 a moment of inertia about the y axis of 1 27 10 8 kgm 2 and a moment of inertia about the z axis of 1 27 10 8 kgm 2 the highest horizontal thrust force at tower top located at 115 63 m is set to 4800 kn with a simultaneous fore aft bending moment of 18000 knm bak et al 2013 both include the partial safety factor for ultimate loads a concentrated vertical load from the tower top mass is also included in the model these loads are assumed to be independent of all design variables the young s modulus and density for steel are throughout assumed to be e 210 gpa and ρ 7850 0 kg m 3 for the jacket structures for the tower the density is adjusted following bak et al 2013 to 8500 0 kg m 3 to account for the mass of secondary structures the poisson s ratio is set to ν 0 3 the outer optimization problem eqn 1 is solved by the generalized pattern search gps method implemented in the matlab routine patternsearch see e g audet and dennis 2003 and abramson et al 2009 the options for the gps method are largely set to default values we however restrict the number of gps iterations to 1000 and the number of function evaluations i e the number of inner problems solved to 500 a time limit of 24 h is also imposed the nonlinear inner optimization problems eqn 2 are solved by the robust and efficient sqp method implemented in snopt version 7 1 gill et al 2002 the solver options are to a large extent set to default values the optimality and feasibility tolerances are increased compared to the default values to reduce the number of objective and constraint function and gradient evaluations they are increased from 10 6 to 10 3 and 10 5 respectively manufacturing or design catalog requirements corrosion allowance effects of icing or add ons such as appurtenances are not considered in this process the structural analysis routines used in the optimization method have been validated by exporting the jacket structure and tower modelled as a frame structure to the commercial finite element software abaqus abaqus was used to validate the implementation by comparing global responses of the jacket and tower such as the lowest eigen frequencies and tower top displacements for some of the applied loads validation has also been done in a similar way for local stresses the analytical design sensitivity analyses implemented in the optimization framework have been compared to the results from finite differences and found to give accurate results 4 wind turbine setup the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine bak et al 2013 is utilized in the computation of the design loads on the jacket the system level properties of the dtu 10 mw turbine are given in table 1 the initial reference for the jacket of this 10 mw wind turbine is taken from the innwind eu project deliverable d4 31 von borstel 2013 which satisfies the ultimate load conditions but does not fulfill the fatigue life requirements of 25 years this is due to the significant 3p excitation of the support structure from the rotor the fully coupled design load simulations on the turbine with jacket are done using the aeroelastic software hawc2 larsen and hansen 2012 the software hawc2 utilizes a multibody formulation which couples different elastic bodies together using timoshenko beam finite elements the mann wind turbulence model mann 1994 is used in the load case simulation to represent the input wind turbulence over the rotor random gaussian 10 min turbulent wind realizations are used as input to simulate normal operation over 11 equally spaced mean wind speed bins 5 m s 25 m s in 16 equally spaced directions aligned with the rotor in each case and with 10 yaw misalignment the input ocean waves are assumed to be aligned with the wind random wave kinematics are utilized according to the linear airy model with wheeler stretching and nonlinear wave components are not considered the hydrodynamic forces on the jacket are computed using the morison equation morison et al 1950 5 conceptual design of the jacket the description of the reference turbine bak et al 2013 lists the 1p frequency range to be 0 1 0 16 hz the 3p range is thus 0 3 0 48 hz and the 6p range is 0 6 0 96 hz further the wave excitation frequency is between the frequencies 0 1 0 2 hz the natural frequencies of the support structure including jacket should thereby be in the interval 0 2 0 28 or in the interval 0 54 0 58 or above 1 0 hz for the present design case we have targeted to place the two first fundamental frequencies in the first interval the higher frequencies in the second interval or above 1 0 hz the outer variables are bounded by the values listed in table 2 the relative positions of the x and k joints are also included in the list of outer design variables the locations of the k joint are allowed to move over the length of the leg and are only constrained not to coincide the locations of the x joints are allowed to move in the middle of the plane described by the two incident legs again the included constraints prevent two joints to coincide i e joints cannot vanish from the final structure the outer problem has in total 11 continuous variables the inner variables are bounded by the values listed in table 3 furthermore we include a number of constraints linking the variables in the various members the members of the x braces all have the same dimensions in every section and the same applied for the leg members the inner problem has before reductions through variable linking 226 design variables the tower top is not allowed to displace more than 3 2 m in any direction for any load we have also included local static stress constraints the von mises stresses are constrained not to exceed 355 mpa anywhere in the jacket sub structure 5 1 optimization results the results from the optimization process are shown in table 4 and table 5 from which it can be seen that the resulting jacket has a low mass of 654 tons where most of the mass rests with the braces see table 4 as can be seen from table 4 the optimization moves towards enabling similar diameters and wall thicknesses for the braces and legs even though the legs are wider and thicker as in conventional jackets the braces are also of significant cross sectional area thus allowing for thick welded joints at the intersections since the stress hot spots are at the welded joints this optimized design enables the jacket to withstand fatigue and ultimate design stress limit while the optimizer had fixed constraints on fatigue and ultimate stresses using fixed tower top loads and assumed max load cycles in fatigue there has been no coupled iterations with an aeroelastic software to verify that the fatigue and ultimate loads are indeed within the design margins the next sections verify the found jacket design using full coupled aeroelastic simulations 6 verification of the design integrity of the optimized jacket the optimized jacket needs to be assessed using fully coupled aeroelastic simulations under normal wind turbulence and normal sea state conditions to confirm that its fatigue lifetime is satisfactory and that the ultimate loads during operation do not exceed the standstill extreme loads used as constraints in the optimization process the iec 61400 3 international 2005 recommends that load assessment is carried out considering variable wind and wave directions the primary verification concerns the ultimate limit state where the extreme stresses are checked against the allowable stress the buckling limit state where the compressive stress in the slender members are seen not to produce any instability and the fatigue limit state where the accumulated damage during the structure lifetime should not lead to fatigue failure the ultimate and fatigue limit states are based on stresses whose magnitudes are magnified at the welded joints compared to their nominal values thus it is sufficient to carry out the verification at the welded joints where failures generally occur for beam with constant section and unique material in this study the verification will be carried out at all the lowest members of the jacket and at the members near the transition piece as these are the most vulnerable locations that is at the fixed boundaries 6 1 environmental conditions and load assessment the site specific metocean conditions assumed in the load simulations during wind turbine operation are presented in table 6 several loads simulations of design load case dlc 1 2 are made using hawc2 with the input wind wave conditions shown in table 6 it is particularly important that the load simulations include the rotor facing different directions over a 360 polar so as to account for a variation in dynamic loading over the different faces of the jacket random gaussian 10 min turbulent wind realizations are used as input to simulate normal operation over 11 mean wind speed bins spanning from 5 m s 25 m s in 16 equally spaced directions collinear with the rotor in each case and with 10 degree yaw misalignment thus each mean wind speed has 3 yaw mis alignments and 16 wind directions to simulate with one random wind turbulence seed the input waves are assumed to be aligned with the wind random wave kinematics are computed according to the linear airy model with wheeler stretching the hydrodynamic forces are calculated based on the morison equation the structure is assumed to be embedded all degrees of freedom are fully restrained at the seabed implying the soil is not considered in the simulation this set of conditions provides 11 1 3 16 528 load time series of 10 min duration this provides a high fidelity set of simulations to verify the limit states on all the members of the jacket the internal loads are observed over several members of the jacket which are typically the most vulnerable von borstel 2013 each jacket leg is numbered leg 1 leg 2 leg 3 or leg 4 similarly each side is named from the boundary leg number side 1 2 side 2 3 side 3 4 or side 4 1 on a side the connections of the lowest braces to the legs at the floor just above the mud brace are also numbered 1 or 2 according to their position left or right respectively thus the hotspot appellation is formed from the side number and its position 1 2 1 1 2 2 or 2 3 1 for example based on the load time series computed from the hydro servo aero elastic simulation nominal axial stresses are calculated at a given location by taking the absolute maximum over eight angular positions at a joint as depicted in fig 4 and given by 9 σ x θ f x a m z r i sin θ m y r i cos θ where f x m z and m y are respectively the axial force in the member x direction and the two bending moments in the member about the two axes perpendicular to the axial direction the geometry parameters r a and i are the outer radius the cross section area and the cross section second moment respectively while θ is the circumferential coordinate measured from axis y along the saddle direction at the joint at welded joints the nominal axial stress σ x θ that is the stress calculated at a typical section of the beam is magnified using stress concentration factors scfs to obtain the characteristic axial stress σ k for each side brace side and chord side of the welds the stress concentration factor at the saddle for axial load scf as the stress concentration factor at the crown for axial load scf ac the stress concentration factor for in plane moment scf mip and the stress concentration factor for out of plane moment scf mop are estimated from dnv rp c203 det norske veritas dnv 2013 the characteristic stresses around the weld circumference are computed using 10 σ k θ scf as 2 θ π scf ac 1 2 θ π n a scf mip m x i r sin θ scf mop m y i r cos θ where 0 θ π 2 is the positive value of the angle between the considered point line and x axis 6 2 verification of ultimate load limit states the design stresses are checked against the steel material yield stress at the ultimate limit state the associated utilization ratio u l s γ m γ c γ l σ v f y where the partial safety factors taken from international 2005 γ m 1 30 γ c 1 10 are associated with the material properties and to the components consequence of failure respectively iec 61400 1 ed 3 international 2005 recommends that the partial safety factor related to normal conditions is γ l 1 35 corresponding to the mean of the extreme loads however since all extreme load cases have not been run here γ l is taken to be 1 50 and corresponding to the absolute maximum of the extreme loads the constant f y 355 mpa is the steel yield limit the ultimate stress over all jacket joints is determined using the load simulation results with load extremes occurring in different directions and contemporaneous loads corresponding to the extreme value the peak ultimate stresses are seen to occur at the lowest braces pf the jacket the distribution of the utilization ratio for braces is shown in table 7 wherein the utilization ratio for braces are all much lower than one a failure in ultimate strength limit state would occur only if a magnification of extreme loads by a factor of 3 occurs over what is presently seen this would be unrealistic even if all iec load case situations had been simulated in table 7 the node id corresponds to leg number brace connecting to leg number node number on that brace this 1 2 2 refers to the second node on the brace connecting leg 1 with leg 2 the optimized jacket members are furthermore verified with respect to column buckling as the members are subjected to axial force combined with bending moments eulers formula for buckling is not sufficient to assess the stability the buckling check is required det norske veritas dnv 2011 if k l c i c 2 2 5 e f y where k is the effective length factor l c is the member length i c i a is the radius of gyration and e is the material elastic modulus table 8 presents the slenderness of all members and compares with the threshold it is seen that three members require further assessment lowest part of leg 1 and x brace portions and the mud braces where σ a is the design compression stress σ m 1 is the design bending stress about the given axis f a is the design local buckling strength f k is the design column buckling strength and f e is the euler buckling strength details of the procedure can be found in det norske veritas dnv 2011 table 9 presents the utilization ratios for each of the three members whose slenderness ratios are more than the limit in table 8 the buckling utilization ratios are shown in table 9 to be significantly lower than one indicating the survival of the members with respect to the column buckling limit state based on tables 7 9 it is concluded that the optimized jacket satisfies the necessary ultimate load and buckling constraints 6 3 verification of fatigue limit state and predicted lifetime in order to assess the fatigue limit state the design axial stress σ d is computed from the simulated stress amplitudes at all mean wind speed bins across 16 equally distributed wind directions as explained in section 6 1 life computation of the structural members are based on the palmgren miner s rule using the design s n curve i e the t curve in sea water with cathodic protection as per dnv rp c203 det norske veritas dnv 2013 and using the recommended fatigue design factor fdf det norske veritas dnv 2013 of 3 as recommended for welded joints below the water level with moderate consequences of failure the critical hotspots across the optimized jacket are examined which are the welded joints between the legs and braces or between two braces the damage equivalent stress can be computed using 9 and 12 where n j is the number of design stress cycles accumulated over all the 10 min load simulation results at a particular mean wind speed i w n i is the annual expected number of 10 minute samples for that mean wind speed and n e q is the total number of stress cycles of the year 12 σ e q i 5 25 w n i j 1 n n j σ d j m n e q 1 m the stresses themselves are computed using 10 where the impact of the stress concentration factor on the total stress at a point is to be quantified the stress concentration factors at a welded joint are to be determined empirically using the relations in dnv rp c203 det norske veritas dnv 2013 which are typically a function of four sizing parameters 1 the ratio of wall thickness of the brace to the wall thickness of the leg at the joint τ 2 the ratio of the outer diameter of the leg to twice the thickness of the leg γ 3 the ratio of the outer diameter of the brace to the outer diameter of the leg β and 4 for k and y joints the ratio of the gap between the intersection of two connections to the diameter of the leg ζ the stress concentration in the axial direction on the chord side of a k joint is typically expressed as det norske veritas dnv 2013 13 scf ac τ 0 9 γ 0 5 0 67 β 2 1 16 β sin θ sin θ m a x sin θ m i n 0 3 β m a x β m i n 0 3 1 64 0 29 β 0 38 tan 1 8 ζ similar empirical equations in the bending directions as well as for other types of joints x y can be found in det norske veritas dnv 2013 table 10 provides the variation of the fatigue life over all joints on one side of the jacket where the bottom joint connecting the mud brace to the leg is modelled as a k joint and as a y joint a similar but not identical life distribution can be shown for the other jacket sides as well since the predicted life shown in table 10 does not include the fdf the required fatigue life of each joint should be at least 75 years as seen in table 10 four of the welded joints fail this criteria k joints and y joints are quite similar in classification but in the case of y joints the axial component of the brace connection is counter acted by the shear force in the chord or leg section thus the end connections of the jacket at the base should be modelled as y joint connections table 10 shows the effect of the classification on the bottom welded joint where using the scfs of a y joint results in significantly lower fatigue life than for a k joint if the four joints shown in table 10 times four sides along with the leg connection to the joints are modified to have sufficient fatigue lifetime then the jacket can be confirmed to satisfy the fatigue limit state fully the fully coupled load simulations described in section 6 1 can be re used to determine if the desired fatigue lifetime is met provided the re design does not alter the natural frequencies of the support structure the re design of the four failing joints needs to be done based on two aspects 1 the influence of the stress concentration factors and 2 the stress at the welded joints with respect to the scfs it can be readily see from eq 13 that increase in τ or γ would directly increase the scf in the axial direction however the relationship of the scf with β is less straight forward since it appears in interaction with other variables in those equations thus it can be concluded that to lower the scfs at a welded joint τ or γ would need to be as low as feasible and the influence of β needs to be investigated fig 5 shows the variation in the scf at a tubular welded joint in the different loading directions it can be readily seen that β should be high in order to reduce the scf thus the diameter of the brace should be as near to the diameter of the connecting leg as possible at the welded joint therefore increase in β is beneficial to reduce stresses while eq 13 shows that to lower scf τ or γ needs to be reduced which implies the thickness of the brace to be small in comparison to the thickness of the leg and the thickness of the leg is small in comparison to its diameter however a higher β values not only reduces the scf but also allows for a low stress state since it encourages a larger brace diameter thus the diameter of the brace at the 4 joints with insufficient life in table 10 are first increased to a level that is just short of the diameter of the leg if the fatigue life of these joints is still less than required due to high stress cycles then the thickness of the brace is moderately increased to increase section area until the desired fatigue life is obtained here it is assumed that s n curves with cathodic protection are to be used the fdf above mean sea level for the x braces was assumed to be 2 0 as allowed by the det norske veritas dnv 2013 while the fdf below mean sea level was taken as 3 0 no other partial safety factors were considered in the evaluation of fatigue life the required changed geometry of the affected joints as compared with the output from the optimization procedure is given in table 11 it can be seen that there is an increase in outer diameter of the top brace near the x joint but a significant increase in its wall thickness the corresponding k joint on leg 3 that connects to the brace below also is seen to require significant increase in its wall thickness and diameter with these changes to the optimized jacket geometry the minimum design fatigue life was determined to be 26 years at the top x joint all other hot spots in the jacket had a fatigue life greater than 26 years with the corrections described in table 11 the overall jacket mass was increased from 654 tons reported earlier to 861 tons however the first few frequencies of the support structure are reduced by less than 5 this is due to the high stiffness of the jacket and the fact that all the members changed are only localized to the four joints that had insufficient life without any change made to remaining structure or the transition piece this also shows that localize changes to the jacket structure have little affect on the overall natural frequencies of the support structure which is the essential premise for not using minimization of mass as an objective in the structural optimization of the jacket since the natural frequencies were altered by less than 5 it is assumed that the load simulations need not be repeated on the modified jacket as the underlying dynamics of the wind turbine and support structure remain the same however the sixteen wind wave directions that were used in the above verification can be further permuted to identify the variation in the fatigue damage as a function of the discretization in the number of wind wave directions the variation in fatigue life with varying wind directions is ascertained by bootstrapping that is repeated sampling of a sub set of directions from the original sixteen for example in twelve different directions using the same load time series at each mean wind speed but now sampled from each different subset of 12 wind directions over the 360 polar around the jacket the distribution of fatigue damage on the joints at the braces and legs is determined if the average damage over 26 years for such a sampling is lower than unity at the weakest joint then the jacket design can be said to be robust to variation in wind wave directional loading fig 6 depicts the damage distribution and the mean damage over eight points on the chord side and brace side on the top k joint on leg 3 which was originally the weakest joint from the optimization result the results shown consider the weibull parameters for each wind direction fig 6 shows that the re designed joint dimensions possess the mean net damage level to be below 1 for a design life of 26 years regardless of the number of load directions and regardless of symmetry of the loading directions as a comparison the jacket used in conti et al 2018 designed in the innwind eu project for the 10 mw turbine was more than 1000 tons and requires specialized post welding grinding treatment to meet 25 years fatigue lifetime at all joints thus the present re designed jacket of 861 tons for the 10 mw turbine is a low mass jacket configuration that has moved natural frequencies away from excitation and satisfies all limits states so as to obtain 25 years lifetime without post weld treatments 7 conclusions and future research it was shown that using the single objective of minimization of the fundamental frequency in the structural optimization of offshore wind turbine jackets enables the design of cost effective long life jackets this optimization objective was shown to exploit the full displacement constraints available to significantly reduce the inherent stiffness of the jacket structure to not only minimize its natural frequencies but also reduce the mass the placing of the structural frequencies away from the regions of harmonic excitation allows alleviation of the fatigue damage the resulting optimized jacket had a low fundamental frequency which was below the 3p excitation range and its first five frequencies were away from all excitations the structure further had a low mass for supporting the 10 mw wind turbine and satisfied all ultimate stress and displacement constraints further it was shown by subsequent load analysis of the jacket that there was also no buckling problems a detailed fatigue damage analysis showed that while the optimized jacket produced the required fatigue life time of 25 years or greater at most members which are typically highly stressed it did not possess satisfactory lifetime at four welded members near the transition piece and at the base these jacket members were subsequently re designed which increased the lifetime above 25 years without impacting the natural frequencies of the structure the re designed jacket mass increased by 30 over the initial optimized jacket the final solution still possessed natural frequencies away from excitation and the first fundamental frequency was less than 5 away from the result of the structural optimization thus satisfying all stated requirements future research is recommended in allowing the optimization to consider a probability of fatigue damage exceeding a threshold versus a deterministic approach so as to determine the probability that the lifetime of certain members of the jacket will be below 25 years acknowledgements the research leading

in pressure is called the air cushion or the ram effect the air with high dynamic pressure under the wing stagnates and the pressure of the pressure side becomes extremely high therefore the lift augmentation and drag reduction are considerable compared to an airplane operating out of ground effect and they enhance the aerodynamic performance the lift to drag ratio wig vehicles are expected to have the high aerodynamic efficiency and reduced energy consumption early researchers observed these phenomena during takeoff and landing rozhdestvensky 2006 kikuchi et al 1997 joh and kim 2004 kim and joh 2004 some of the leading researchers applied this phenomenon to improve the vehicle performance actively the extreme aerodynamic enhancement has attracted much attention until these days ships cannot match the speed of wig vehicles and they are more economical than other aircraft in terms of the operational expenses therefore wig vehicles could fill the niche between ships and aircrafts and show great potential for a next generation transportation despite their attractive aerodynamic advantages wig vehicles have technical difficulties such as hump drag when taking off and instability in the ground effect these issues are generally not observed in typical aircraft flying out of ground effect improving the stability and control usually requires a huge vertical t tail an s shaped wing profile a tandem configuration or a sophisticated control system rozhdestvensky 2006 wig vehicle industries are still limited by these technical difficulties until recently experimental and numerical research on the ground effect has concentrated on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing profile three dimensional configuration fuselage and tail configuration including the area of the tail joh et al joh and kim 2004 numerically studied the pressure change drag and stability around the airfoils of wig vehicles for two and three dimensional configurations decreasing the height of the vehicle to the ground causes of changes the velocity distribution around the airfoil the motion of vehicles near the ground strongly affects the characteristics of the boundary layer ghadimi et al 2012 investigated the boundary layers according to the vehicles height and reynolds numbers the boundary layer characteristics such as the transition phenomena separation location and boundary layer thickness and aerodynamic properties such as lift and drag were functions of the reynolds number angle of attack flight height and thickness of the airfoil approaching the ground surface results in a drop in local reynolds number at the surface of the airfoil which leads to a delay of the transition an increase in momentum thickness results in accelerated the flow separation and the thickness of the boundary layer increases the lift was shown to have no significant alteration but the drag affected considerably and shows a tendency to increase sun et al 2007 performed an experimental study on the hydrodynamic interactions between a three dimensional oval in ground effect with a numerical regression the boundary hydrodynamic interactions of a model with a small aspect ratio was almost linearly dependent on the angle of attack but there was only a small effect of the moving speed of the body on the hydrodynamic coefficients the effect of clearance was related to the geometry and the hydrodynamic forces between re 2 5 10 5 1 10 6 were constant qu wang and liu qu et al 2015 investigated the aerodynamics and flow characteristics of a naca 4412 airfoil in ground effect for the wide range of heights and angles of attack with numerical methods they found that the aerodynamics characteristics could be divided into three different regions according to positive and negative ground effects the region i showed the positive ground effect and the other two regions showed the negative ground effect in region i the airflow is blocked in the convergent passage between the pressure side and the ground resulting in increases of pressure on the pressure side in the region ii with high angles of attack the adverse pressure gradient increases and results in a larger region of the flow separation in region iii with negative angles of attack there are the large suction and the negative ground effect by the venturi effect by the convergent divergent passage between the surface and the ground the wig vehicle experiences the wavy water surface instead of the flat that changes the aerodynamic characteristics lift and moment qu et al 2014 performed the numerical simulation employing the compressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and the spalart allmaras turbulent model the simulation includes wings side endplate and central wing fuselage and tail the lift nose down pitching moment and lift to drag ratio increase and decrease according to uphill climb and downhill of wavy water surface respectively however the average of the aerodynamic coefficient of both wavy water surface and flat rigid surface are similar at high angle of attack aoa 9 deg the reducing the height strengthens the span wise flow on the upper flow of the central wing and the boundary layer at the central wing tip becomes thicker dakhrabadi and seif 2016 investigated the composed wings and their stability the vehicle has an inner wing with a low aspect ratio which is in ground effect and an outer wing with a high aspect ratio the location of the outer wing with respect to the main wing influenced the static stability and the characteristics of the static height stability which is very important for a safety of the wig craft with composed wings the main wing plays an important role in the aerodynamic coefficients of the compound wig under an extreme ground effect and its role decreases as the vehicle moves away from the ground the outer wing can enhance the aerodynamic performance of the compound wig at a higher flying height in ground effect the static height stability criterion of the compound wig was also discussed for the various outer wing positions the results showed that the static stability of the compound wig could be increased by shifting the outer wing to the trailing edge of the main wing yang et al 2015 derived stability conditions for a high lift device hydrofoil that included irodov s height stability condition irodov 1970 to improve the stability the hydrodynamic center of heave should be located behind the aerodynamic center of height aerodynamic center and center of gravity they also concluded that a hydrofoil located behind center of gravity provides a sufficient pitch stability margin when taking off or in float turning in ground effect is different from that of out of ground effect and so are the aerodynamic characteristics and vortex shedding at the wing tip jia et al jai et al 2016 performed a numerical analysis on three wing configurations a rectangular wing with an endplate and one without an endplate and a reverse delta wing numerical simulations were carried out to simulate the flow of a banked wing in ground effect even though two dimensional analyses are conducted for airfoil sections vehicles do not fly in such conditions the three dimensional effects and configuration should be considered carefully recently lee and lee 2013 performed a numerical optimization of airfoil shapes that were parameterized using bezier curves due to the trade offs between the multiple objectives the optimal solutions are a set of wing profiles that are not dominated by the other designs within the given design space the 113 non dominated optimal solutions are known as the pareto optima or set could be obtained the pareto optima include various shapes of the airfoil and the aerodynamic characteristics of the pareto optima were analyzed in detail the pareto optima can be divided according to two significant features a high lift to drag ratio and high stability based on the wing profiles this study focused on the aerodynamic performance of a wig vehicle with a three dimensional wing fuselage and tail the wing section is based on the pareto optimum obtained by lee and lee 2013 the wing section of the wig vehicle is very important for the stability and aerodynamic performance the ultimate goal for a wig vehicle is to sustain high performance with sufficient safety under the ground effect a computational analysis has been performed with the optimized wings applied to the wig vehicle and the aerodynamic performance has been analyzed based on this study a three dimensional optimization including wing and fuselage can be conducted to reduce the horizontal tail and improve the static stability in near future 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equations and validation the flow around the vehicle is assumed to be three dimensional turbulent in steady state and incompressible the turbulent flow of the air is described by the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations which can be expressed in tensor notation for the mass and momentum as follows 1 x j ρ u j 0 2 x j ρ u j u i τ i j p x i s i 3 τ i j μ t s i j 2 3 μ t u k x k δ i j ρ u i u j where x j j 1 2 3 are the cartesian coordinate vectors u j are the mean velocity components ρ u j u i is the reynolds stress tensor and μ t and s i j are the turbulent viscosity and the modulus of the mean strain rate tensor respectively which are defined as 4 μ t f μ c μ ρ k 2 ε s i j u i x j u j x i the realizable k ε equation is applied to model the turbulent flow around the vehicle for representing the exact flight conditions the moving wall boundary condition with a flight velocity is applied at the ground the solutions are treated as converged ones where the normalized residual is less than 1 10 6 the upstream boundary is modeled using a velocity inlet boundary condition with a uniform velocity distribution the downstream boundary is modeled using a pressure outlet boundary condition a slip wall boundary condition is imposed on the undisturbed far boundary therefore imposing a zero crossflow condition 2 2 cfd validations to certify the reliability of the numerical model employed in this study both computational results of wings with and without ground effects are compared with experimental and analytical results first a rectangular wing with a naca 0015 section and aspect ratio of 6 6 has been calculated to determine the out of ground effect and the lift and drag coefficients are plotted in fig 1 this rectangular wing configuration originally comes from experiments by mcalister and takahashi 1991 the experiments however focused on wake development behind the wing and only provided raw data readings from the experimental apparatus we compare the cfd results to analytical solutions instead three consecutive computational results with different numbers of grids base 1m cells refine01 2 2m cells and refine02 4m cells are compared as shown in fig 1 the grid distributions next to the solid wall are adjusted so that the y max maximum y is less than 50 in the case of refine02 it takes about 34 h with a single cpu opteron 2 4 ghz with linux to obtain a converged solution and thus only three points are calculated the results of consecutive cells of refine01 and refine02 cells are identical as shown in fig 1 these results show a small difference in drag coefficient but are generally consistent with the analytic solutions jacobs and sherman 1939 anderson 1999a due to the flow separation and wake at α 14 a properly converged solution cannot be obtained and is excluded from fig 1 in numerical simulations the vortex may rapidly disappear because of numerical diffusion due to insufficient cells therefore a sufficient number of cells is required within the domains of interest to obtain proper results the computational trajectories of the wing tip vortex of refine01 are also compared with the experiments mcaliser and takahashi 1991 and are presented in fig 2 as well as high aspect ratio cells around the wing surface dense grids with a corn shape in the downstream x direction are used to improve the reliability of the computational results in this region the number of cells grows exponentially and the area is only extended up to x c 2 5 thus the vortex radius and location at x c 2 0 are plotted as shown in fig 2 the vortex radius and locations agree well with the experiments except next to the wing tip the vortex shedding from the wing tip moves in the span wise direction y in the downstream 2 3 flow analysis three dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations are employed and to reduce the blockage effects and disturbances by the outer boundaries the computational domain is sufficiently extended in each direction as shown in fig 3 the inlet region is upstream from the center of gravity by 24 times the chord and the exit is downstream at a distance of 48 times the chord the top outer boundary in the y direction is extended by 14 times the chord the commercial cfd package star ccm star 2006 is used to calculate aerodynamic characteristics and flow around a vehicle the second order upwind and central differencing schemes are adopted for convective and diffusion terms in the governing equations the pressure velocity coupling is resolved using the simple algorithm since the angle of attack is 2 deg there is no severe flow separation across the vehicle except the sharp edge wing tip the 6 layers of the shape following mesh so called a layer mesh next to a vehicle is used the maximum value of y is 15 on the upper surface of the wing suction side to ensure that there is no flow interaction between the vehicle and outer boundaries the upper boundary extends twice and two computational results are compared difference of aerodynamic forces is less than 0 05 since the geometry of the vehicle is smooth angle of attack is low there is no severe flow separation and the computational domain used in this study is sufficient the accuracy of the computational results depends on the quality of the grid system for accuracy and cost effectiveness polyhedral cells and a non uniform distribution refined next to the vehicle and ground are used as shown in fig 3 the height from the ground is measured where the center of gravity is located near half chord as shown in fig 4 the computation is carried out using a reynolds number of 3 51 10 5 based on the airfoil chord c and a corresponding inlet velocity of 20 0 m s no slip boundary conditions on the airfoil surface a moving wall boundary at the ground and a pressure boundary condition at the exit are employed a slip wall boundary condition is applied to the top outer and side boundaries the solutions are considered to converge when all of the residuals for the continuity and momentum equations are less than or equal to 10 6 the number of polyhedral cells is about 1 2 million an amd athlon processor 2 2 ghz with linux is used for the computations a mesh dependency test was performed with three different consecutive meshes 0 65 million 1 2 million and 1 9 million cells the relative errors compared to the fine mesh 1 9 million cells are listed in table 1 the lift and drag coefficients converge as the number of cells increased the relative errors of c l and c d of the base mesh are 0 09 and 1 3 respectively thus the fine mesh is used for analyzing the aerodynamic characteristics of the ground effect vehicle the locally refined cells in the box area that encloses the vehicle is named local refine region in fig 3 to capture the wake clearly the more dense meshes are used in downstream lee and lee 2013 performed a numerical multi objective optimization of wings in ground effect at h c 0 2 and α 2 deg and found 113 pareto optima that were not dominated by each other in this study we choose three airfoils among the pareto set that have high stability and a high lift to drag ratio and applied them to a wig effect vehicle that have fuselage wing and tail their aerodynamic characteristics and stability have been carefully studied the three airfoils are denoted as p001 p052 and p113 for p001 x h is close to the center of gravity and shows the highest stability whereas p113 shows the highest lift to drag ratio the lift to drag ratio and stability of p052 are in between the other two cases fig 5 shows two dimensional sections of the three pareto airfoils and a naca4415 airfoil more details about the sections and two dimensional aerodynamic characteristics are available from lee and lee 2013 3 results and discussion the aerodynamic characteristics of vehicles in the vicinity of the surface are dependent on two significant effects the ground effect and the venturi effect lee and lee 2014 qu et al 2015 in the moderate angle of attack the significant pressure distributions both pressure and suction sides are observed according to decreasing height it is positive ground effect which increases the lift and decrease drag when the height decrease qu et al 2015 however when the angle is negative or even positive according to the shape of airfoil the passage between pressure side and the ground is a typical convergence divergence channel and it results in negative ground effect these significant effects depend on the shapes of the lower surface of the vehicle the oncoming air to the lower wing surface gradually decreases the magnitude of the speed and the dynamic pressure on the lower wing surface changes to static pressure the pressure of the lower wing surface increases that leads to higher lift in addition to the high lift the drag also decreases with decreasing height lee et al 2010 this improvement in the aerodynamic characteristics with decreasing height is a positive feature of the ground effect rozhdestvensky 2006 as a result the lift to drag ratio dramatically increases with the ground effect the venturi effect mainly comes from the convergence divergence passage between the surface ground or water and the lower surface of the vehicle it accelerates the air flow under the vehicle and ground and causes a lower pressure distribution in the area due to the lower pressure the lift decreases and drag increase at the same time therefore to obtain stability and effectiveness the venturi effect should be prevented when the vehicle is close to the surface of ground or water generally racing cars employ the venturi effect to improve the contact force between the tires and road the shapes of the wing surface have a significant effect on the venturi and ground effects since a wig vehicle flies above the water or ground surface it has to satisfy the aerodynamic constraints and stability conditions for the ground effect at the same time for stable and satisfy flying the ground effect vehicle must fulfill the following conditions simultaneously 1 c l h 0 staufenbiel and schlichting 1988 2 h s 0 static stability condition staufenbiel and schlichting 1988 3 h s 0 2 static stability becomes excessive leading to dynamic instability kornev and matveev 2003 4 h s 0 05 there is insufficient stability which can lead to long period phugoid fluctuations kornev and matveev 2003 5 x h x c g x a x c g x h proper location of cg kornev and matveev 2003 6 c m a 0 trim at a positive angle of attack nelson 1998 the first condition implies that when c l h is positive the lift becomes lower as the height of the wig effect vehicle decreases when the height of a wig effect vehicle lowers decreases due to disturbances or by chance its equilibrium cannot be recovered at the new height so there is a risk of crashing on the surface the second static stability condition is a necessary condition for dynamic stability the dynamic stability cannot be satisfied without static height stability to achieve dynamic stability conditions 3 and 4 have to be also satisfied from conditions 2 to 4 the range of the static height stability has to be narrowed to 0 2 h s 0 05 condition 5 provides the proper location of the center of gravity under conditions 2 to 4 the last condition comes from the static stability of an airplane design when c m a has a negative sign the vehicle can be trimmed with a positive angle of attack in case of negative c m a the nose down pitching moment increases when the angle of attack increases the vehicle goes back to its original equilibrium in nature whereas in the case of positive c m a the nose down pitching moment decreases when the angle of attack increases considering the conditions we can choose a favorable location of the center of gravity for static and dynamic stability basically the location of x h is placed upstream and x a is downstream and x h is near x c g for stability table 2 shows the derivative coefficient of the optimum and reference naca4412 airfoils if the airfoil does not satisfy the static stability conditions s unstable is indicated in the static stability column and unstable is indicated in the d stability column because static stability is a necessary condition for dynamic stability if the case satisfies h s but does not conditions 3 and 4 d unstable is indicated in the d stability column to compare the results the computation is performed for a naca4412 airfoil with the same conditions as the other cases h c 0 2 and a o a 2 deg this case is named naca4412 old in table 2 however the naca4412 airfoil shows a positive c l h and is unstable in the same conditions this implies that a decrease in height leads to a lower flight height because of the lift decreases this instability mainly comes from the venturi effect and the air does not stagnate under the vehicle to produce a sufficient air cushion lee and lee 2014 therefore the angle of attack of the naca4412 airfoil is increased to 3 deg to improve the ground effect the new case named naca4412 and is used to compare the aerodynamic characteristics to the other optimized cases all cases except naca4412 old with angle of attack 2 deg that is only dominated by the venturi effect satisfy stability condition 1 as shown in table 2 in the second stability condition naca4412 with angle of attack 3 deg does not meet the condition as the height decreases h c 0 4 and 0 6 all the optimum cases except p052 h c 0 6 satisfy stability condition 2 some cases do not satisfy the static height stability condition according to the heights for safety it is necessary to maintain the operation height for safety while the wig vehicle is operating the naca4412 and p113 airfoils among the pareto optima have similar wing profiles with a straight lower surface but the aerodynamic characteristics such as the lift drag x h and x a are quite different x h is one of the objectives in previous research and the three optima p001 p052 and p113 have larger x h than naca4412 there is a great deal of difference between p001 the stability oriented wing profile from the pareto set and naca4412 however in terms of x a which is governed by the angle of attack naca4412 and p001 have similar tendencies however x a of naca4412 is slightly further downstream compare to that of p001 which is more or less favorable for stability c m h of p001 is more upstream than that of naca4415 and has superior stability the effect of x h is more dominant than x a as the height increases the static stability conditions are satisfied but the dynamic condition condition 6 is slightly violated however the x c g x h condition is maintained condition 5 according to the heights x h rapidly moves to downstream and the margin decreases c m a keeps its values irrespective of the height changes but c l a decreases this leads to the movement of x a downstream p052 has a sufficiently negative value of x h at h c 0 2 as expected but it violates condition 3 and can be dynamically unstable that is p052 and p001 might be unstable because of their excessive margin x a moves downstream more quickly than x h as the height increases which results in instability at h c 0 6 precise height control is strongly required for stable skimming in ground effect it is expected that p113 which has the largest lift coefficient among three pareto optima will have lower stability than the other optimum cases however it satisfies condition 2 with respect to the heights that is static stability is satisfied at a relatively large height h c 0 6 as with p001 with a fixed location of center of gravity condition 6 is not satisfied since x h moves downstream as the height increases this instability leads the long period instability phugoid instability in fig 6 the dynamic stability condition 6 can be satisfied when h s is located between the two dotted lines the upper and lower limits in fig 6 b the change of the static height stability condition h s of p113 is smaller than that of p052 according to the height variations since the variation of x h of p113 is small it keeps its stability at h c 0 6 to decrease x h c m h in denominator should be large or c l h in the numerator should be smaller that is the deviation according to the height should be decreased this results in a small deviation of the lift according to height considering safety the optimized airfoils show better performance in stability than naca4415 the cases considered in this study satisfy the static stability condition 2 with decreasing heights but become less stable dynamically the instability is influenced more by variations of the center of height x h than the angle of attack generally x a the aerodynamic center of the angle of attack is irrelevant to the height variations at h c 0 4 and 0 6 the values are almost constant and that of naca4415 moves upstream slightly this is unfavorable for the static stability but since x a is located upstream of x c g it is still stable at h c 0 2 naca4415 satisfies the static stability condition condition 2 but because of the excessive stability margin it may be dynamically unstable similar dynamic instability can be observed in the case of p001 at h c 0 2 with the increasing height x h sharply moves downstream and at h c 0 4 the locations of x h and x a are reversed therefore naca4415 is completely unstable both dynamically and statically a typical naca4415 an airfoil for airplane flying out of ground effect is not suitable for a ground effect vehicle in contrast to the other cases p113 satisfies the dynamic and static stability at h c 0 2 however at h c 0 4 and 0 6 the static stability is satisfied but the stability margin is insufficient and might lead to long period instability the naca4412 has the largest angle of attack among the cases and shows the large c l among the calculations at all heights p114 has the next largest c l followed by p052 and p001 the shape of the pressure side of p114 is nearly parallel to the ground at α 2 0 which is similar to that of naca4412 therefore the lift and lift to drag ratio tend to be similar the reason for the high lift of naca4412 is simply the use of a high angle of attack α 3 0 to remove the venturi effect at a low angle of attack the lift and lift to drag ratio at α 2 0 and h c 0 2 which are not plotted in fig 7 are 0 44 and 10 4 respectively and they are similar to those of p001 and p052 therefore the optimized cases provide better aerodynamic performance and better stability for all cases calculated in this study the lift and lift to drag ratio increase as the vehicle s height decreases this is generally observed in ground effect vehicles the drag force decreases slightly and thus the slip of the lift to drag ratio is slightly steeper than that of the lift because of the drag the key elements that affect the aerodynamic forces in a three dimensional flow are the tip vortex and fuselage generally the vortical flow at the wing tip reduces the lift by downwash and leads to induced drag the fuselage generates skin friction drag and pressure drag anderson 1999b however the fuselage pushes the air to each side and results in increased air flow next to the fuselage wing root when the vehicle is in the ground effect the stagnation of air under the pressure side enforces the lift whereas the venturi effect by a decrease increase sectional area reduces the lift suddenly when the venturi effect is dominant the vehicle cannot sustain its height an f1 formula car uses the venturi effect from an inversed wing with the suction side facing ground katz 1995 the lifts of both optimized and non optimized cases near the ground are increased by the ground effect as shown in figs 8 and 9 the pressure distributions along the suction and pressure sides vary according to the heights and angles of attack qu et al 2015 the pressure variations on the suction side according to the heights are relatively fewer comparing to pressure side due to the three dimensional effect the pressures rapidly decrease along the span even though the vehicles are sufficiently in the ground effect h c 0 2 a lift reduction due to vortical flow at the wing tip can be observed even though the vehicles are in the ground effect interestingly the pressures along the pressure side at y b 2 0 5 are larger than the pressure at y b 2 0 15 which is closer to the fuselage these results are different from lee and lee s wing only results lee and lee 2014 that only considered a wing the pressure differences can be observed in all cases used which implies that the flow next to the fuselage pushes outward and augments the air flow on both the pressure and suction sides the similar pressure distribution can be observed in ref qu et al 2014 that includes a fuselage and central and side wings as the height decreases the pressure difference on the pressure side increases and result in the span wise flow strengthening as the wings approach the ground except for naca4415 with a low angle of attack α 2 0 the pressure on the pressure side increases and thus the pressure differences between the pressure side and suction side also increase this results in a strong wing tip vortex as shown in figs 8 and 9 because of the three dimensional effects the increase in lift to drag ratio does not reach as it does in two dimensional ground effect in three dimension the wing tip vortex is still an important phenomenon on aerodynamics in ground effect fig 10 shows the pressure distribution on the upper side of the vehicles at both h c 0 2 and 0 6 the pressure on the upper side of naca4415 is quite different from those of the optimized wings according to the three dimensional effect the pressures for all the cases including optimized wings decrease at the wing tip this confirms that the three dimensional effects from the wing tip vortex cannot be ignored even though in ground effect since naca4415 is not optimized for the ground effect great amounts of its lift come from the suction side the cases that are optimized for the ground effect show the similar peak pressure coefficient but have the narrow band of the peak on the suction side the horizontal tail is expected to be out of ground effect to control the flight easily but the pressure distributions of all the cases including optimized wings on the horizontal tail change as the height decreases on the other hand the suction on the wing is slightly increased as the height decreases the pressure distributions on the pressure side are also very different from that of naca4415 as shown in fig 11 because of the stagnation of the air under the pressure side there are slight differences in the pressure distributions of the optimized wings at different heights the optimized cases show uniform pressure distributions across the pressure side except next to leading edge because of stagnation of the air flow p113 shows a large pressure change as the height changes than the other two optimized cases as the heights decrease the locations of the vortex change at h c 0 2 where the ground effect is dominant the wing tip vortices are pushed outward whereas at h c 0 6 the vortices move toward the fuselage similar to a general airplane flying out of ground effect as shown in fig 12 the movement of the wing tip comes from the pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides the ground effect reinforces the pressure difference on both the pressure and suction sides and the vortices tend to drift away from the wing as shown in fig 13 the vortex strength becomes stronger as the wing approximates the ground and the lift increases whereas the drag becomes smaller on the other word the high lift results in large pressure differences between the pressure and suction sides and thus the strength of the vortex becomes stronger and drifts further outward figs 14 and 15 show the iso surfaces of the vortex strength at two different heights the vortex strength at h c 0 2 in fig 14 is stronger than that at h c 0 6 in fig 15 the pressures on the lower surface are much stronger when the vehicle approaches the ground there is clearly an increase in the vortex strength as the height decreases even though wings are in ground effect the three dimensional vortex is important for a ground effect vehicle the wing tip vortex moves outward when it is in ground effect but it moves inward when it is out of ground effect various studies have observed the drag reduction according to decreasing heights of the wing to the ground ghadimi et al 2012 ahmed and sharma 2005 kumar 1969 wang et al 2013 in this study the reduction of drag and increase in lift are also observed as shown in figs 16 and 17 the drag consists of friction and pressure drag anderson 1999b the primary factors of the drag are the wet area and dynamic pressure velocity square regardless of the height changes the wet areas of the vehicle are constant and the velocity on the pressure side decreases slightly whereas the velocity on the suction side increases therefore the friction drag is constant or decreases slightly the value in the horizontal tail increases slightly the tail is placed sufficiently high to reduce the ground effect but it is implied that the tail is in the ground effect as a vehicle approaches the ground the drag decreases but the strength of the wing tip vortex due to pressure differences between the pressure and suction sides increases this increase in the vortex strength can be explained by the prandtl lifting model katz and plotkin 2001 prandtl 1924 jones 1979 the ground can be modeled with a vortex filament for wings with equal strength but opposite sign and the height can be measured at half of the distance between two opposite vortices when the vortex filament modeling a wing approaches the ground the image vortex also approaches thus the strength of the vortex filament increases at a rate of 1 h 2 but the downwash decreases consequently the lift increases and the induced drag decreases on the other hand the circulation of the bound vortex increases and results in an increasing in the wing tip vortex however the prandtl lifting model can provide a clue about the increasing lift to drag ratio but it cannot provide the exact values because it does not consider the viscous boundary layer 4 conclusions a three dimensional analysis is performed with optimized wing sections that are obtained by optimization based on a two dimensional analysis the vehicle considered in this study includes three dimensional wings a fuselage and a tail the characteristics of the three dimensional flow and stability including various stability conditions are closely investigated six stability conditions are evaluated including static height stability proper location of center of gravity and trim for flight in ground effect all the cases with an optimized wing section show higher stability and aerodynamic performance than the naca4412 that is a general purpose airfoil for safety it is necessary to maintain the operation height while the wig vehicle is operating because of its insufficient stability when the vehicle height increases pressure decreases at a wing top can be observed and the effect of a wing tip vortex and fuselage is significant the trajectories of the wing tip vortex in ground effect are different from those out of ground effect the vortices move outward because of the high pressure under the wings in ground effect the highest pressure of the lower wing surface is observed at the middle of the half span because of the side flow due to the fuselage pushing air outward the height of the tail is about h c 1 2 but interaction between downstream and the tail can be observed to improve the controllability the tail should be located higher than the height considered in this study with the optimized wing sections a tail area of about one fourth that of the main wing can satisfy the stability conditions when it is in ground effect typically wig effect vehicles have a large wing area to satisfy the stability which leads to structural failure more investigation of the flow interaction is strongly required 
23079,wing in ground wig effect vehicles skim the surface of the ground or water using an air cushion between the vehicle and the surface the lift augmentation and drag reduction are considerable compared to an airplane flying out of ground effect and significantly enhance the aerodynamic performance however the stability problem is still a challenge for researchers and designers of wig effect vehicles in a previous study sectional shapes were optimized for the wing in round effect wig using computational fluid dynamics cfd and multi objective optimization with two objectives the aerodynamic center of height which is part of the static height stability and the lift to drag ratio the optimization study obtained 113 optimal solutions called pareto optima or pareto sets which include various airfoil profiles such as a flat lower surface and a convex lower surface next to the trailing edge in this study some of the pareto optima that show the characteristics of features in the design domain are selected and are applied to a three dimensional vehicle with a fuselage lifting and control surfaces such as a horizontal tail three featured optima that show high stability high

water or ground surfaces use an air cushion between the vehicle and the surface the speed of the oncoming air gradually decreases under the lower surface of the vehicle pressure side because of the small gap between wing and surface the reduction of the dynamic pressure by the small gap tends to be associated with high static pressure under the vehicle including a wing and this eventual increase in pressure is called the air cushion or the ram effect the air with high dynamic pressure under the wing stagnates and the pressure of the pressure side becomes extremely high therefore the lift augmentation and drag reduction are considerable compared to an airplane operating out of ground effect and they enhance the aerodynamic performance the lift to drag ratio wig vehicles are expected to have the high aerodynamic efficiency and reduced energy consumption early researchers observed these phenomena during takeoff and landing rozhdestvensky 2006 kikuchi et al 1997 joh and kim 2004 kim and joh 2004 some of the leading researchers applied this phenomenon to improve the vehicle performance actively the extreme aerodynamic enhancement has attracted much attention until these days ships cannot match the speed of wig vehicles and they are more economical than other aircraft in terms of the operational expenses therefore wig vehicles could fill the niche between ships and aircrafts and show great potential for a next generation transportation despite their attractive aerodynamic advantages wig vehicles have technical difficulties such as hump drag when taking off and instability in the ground effect these issues are generally not observed in typical aircraft flying out of ground effect improving the stability and control usually requires a huge vertical t tail an s shaped wing profile a tandem configuration or a sophisticated control system rozhdestvensky 2006 wig vehicle industries are still limited by these technical difficulties until recently experimental and numerical research on the ground effect has concentrated on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing profile three dimensional configuration fuselage and tail configuration including the area of the tail joh et al joh and kim 2004 numerically studied the pressure change drag and stability around the airfoils of wig vehicles for two and three dimensional configurations decreasing the height of the vehicle to the ground causes of changes the velocity distribution around the airfoil the motion of vehicles near the ground strongly affects the characteristics of the boundary layer ghadimi et al 2012 investigated the boundary layers according to the vehicles height and reynolds numbers the boundary layer characteristics such as the transition phenomena separation location and boundary layer thickness and aerodynamic properties such as lift and drag were functions of the reynolds number angle of attack flight height and thickness of the airfoil approaching the ground surface results in a drop in local reynolds number at the surface of the airfoil which leads to a delay of the transition an increase in momentum thickness results in accelerated the flow separation and the thickness of the boundary layer increases the lift was shown to have no significant alteration but the drag affected considerably and shows a tendency to increase sun et al 2007 performed an experimental study on the hydrodynamic interactions between a three dimensional oval in ground effect with a numerical regression the boundary hydrodynamic interactions of a model with a small aspect ratio was almost linearly dependent on the angle of attack but there was only a small effect of the moving speed of the body on the hydrodynamic coefficients the effect of clearance was related to the geometry and the hydrodynamic forces between re 2 5 10 5 1 10 6 were constant qu wang and liu qu et al 2015 investigated the aerodynamics and flow characteristics of a naca 4412 airfoil in ground effect for the wide range of heights and angles of attack with numerical methods they found that the aerodynamics characteristics could be divided into three different regions according to positive and negative ground effects the region i showed the positive ground effect and the other two regions showed the negative ground effect in region i the airflow is blocked in the convergent passage between the pressure side and the ground resulting in increases of pressure on the pressure side in the region ii with high angles of attack the adverse pressure gradient increases and results in a larger region of the flow separation in region iii with negative angles of attack there are the large suction and the negative ground effect by the venturi effect by the convergent divergent passage between the surface and the ground the wig vehicle experiences the wavy water surface instead of the flat that changes the aerodynamic characteristics lift and moment qu et al 2014 performed the numerical simulation employing the compressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and the spalart allmaras turbulent model the simulation includes wings side endplate and central wing fuselage and tail the lift nose down pitching moment and lift to drag ratio increase and decrease according to uphill climb and downhill of wavy water surface respectively however the average of the aerodynamic coefficient of both wavy water surface and flat rigid surface are similar at high angle of attack aoa 9 deg the reducing the height strengthens the span wise flow on the upper flow of the central wing and the boundary layer at the central wing tip becomes thicker dakhrabadi and seif 2016 investigated the composed wings and their stability the vehicle has an inner wing with a low aspect ratio which is in ground effect and an outer wing with a high aspect ratio the location of the outer wing with respect to the main wing influenced the static stability and the characteristics of the static height stability which is very important for a safety of the wig craft with composed wings the main wing plays an important role in the aerodynamic coefficients of the compound wig under an extreme ground effect and its role decreases as the vehicle moves away from the ground the outer wing can enhance the aerodynamic performance of the compound wig at a higher flying height in ground effect the static height stability criterion of the compound wig was also discussed for the various outer wing positions the results showed that the static stability of the compound wig could be increased by shifting the outer wing to the trailing edge of the main wing yang et al 2015 derived stability conditions for a high lift device hydrofoil that included irodov s height stability condition irodov 1970 to improve the stability the hydrodynamic center of heave should be located behind the aerodynamic center of height aerodynamic center and center of gravity they also concluded that a hydrofoil located behind center of gravity provides a sufficient pitch stability margin when taking off or in float turning in ground effect is different from that of out of ground effect and so are the aerodynamic characteristics and vortex shedding at the wing tip jia et al jai et al 2016 performed a numerical analysis on three wing configurations a rectangular wing with an endplate and one without an endplate and a reverse delta wing numerical simulations were carried out to simulate the flow of a banked wing in ground effect even though two dimensional analyses are conducted for airfoil sections vehicles do not fly in such conditions the three dimensional effects and configuration should be considered carefully recently lee and lee 2013 performed a numerical optimization of airfoil shapes that were parameterized using bezier curves due to the trade offs between the multiple objectives the optimal solutions are a set of wing profiles that are not dominated by the other designs within the given design space the 113 non dominated optimal solutions are known as the pareto optima or set could be obtained the pareto optima include various shapes of the airfoil and the aerodynamic characteristics of the pareto optima were analyzed in detail the pareto optima can be divided according to two significant features a high lift to drag ratio and high stability based on the wing profiles this study focused on the aerodynamic performance of a wig vehicle with a three dimensional wing fuselage and tail the wing section is based on the pareto optimum obtained by lee and lee 2013 the wing section of the wig vehicle is very important for the stability and aerodynamic performance the ultimate goal for a wig vehicle is to sustain high performance with sufficient safety under the ground effect a computational analysis has been performed with the optimized wings applied to the wig vehicle and the aerodynamic performance has been analyzed based on this study a three dimensional optimization including wing and fuselage can be conducted to reduce the horizontal tail and improve the static stability in near future 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equations and validation the flow around the vehicle is assumed to be three dimensional turbulent in steady state and incompressible the turbulent flow of the air is described by the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations which can be expressed in tensor notation for the mass and momentum as follows 1 x j ρ u j 0 2 x j ρ u j u i τ i j p x i s i 3 τ i j μ t s i j 2 3 μ t u k x k δ i j ρ u i u j where x j j 1 2 3 are the cartesian coordinate vectors u j are the mean velocity components ρ u j u i is the reynolds stress tensor and μ t and s i j are the turbulent viscosity and the modulus of the mean strain rate tensor respectively which are defined as 4 μ t f μ c μ ρ k 2 ε s i j u i x j u j x i the realizable k ε equation is applied to model the turbulent flow around the vehicle for representing the exact flight conditions the moving wall boundary condition with a flight velocity is applied at the ground the solutions are treated as converged ones where the normalized residual is less than 1 10 6 the upstream boundary is modeled using a velocity inlet boundary condition with a uniform velocity distribution the downstream boundary is modeled using a pressure outlet boundary condition a slip wall boundary condition is imposed on the undisturbed far boundary therefore imposing a zero crossflow condition 2 2 cfd validations to certify the reliability of the numerical model employed in this study both computational results of wings with and without ground effects are compared with experimental and analytical results first a rectangular wing with a naca 0015 section and aspect ratio of 6 6 has been calculated to determine the out of ground effect and the lift and drag coefficients are plotted in fig 1 this rectangular wing configuration originally comes from experiments by mcalister and takahashi 1991 the experiments however focused on wake development behind the wing and only provided raw data readings from the experimental apparatus we compare the cfd results to analytical solutions instead three consecutive computational results with different numbers of grids base 1m cells refine01 2 2m cells and refine02 4m cells are compared as shown in fig 1 the grid distributions next to the solid wall are adjusted so that the y max maximum y is less than 50 in the case of refine02 it takes about 34 h with a single cpu opteron 2 4 ghz with linux to obtain a converged solution and thus only three points are calculated the results of consecutive cells of refine01 and refine02 cells are identical as shown in fig 1 these results show a small difference in drag coefficient but are generally consistent with the analytic solutions jacobs and sherman 1939 anderson 1999a due to the flow separation and wake at α 14 a properly converged solution cannot be obtained and is excluded from fig 1 in numerical simulations the vortex may rapidly disappear because of numerical diffusion due to insufficient cells therefore a sufficient number of cells is required within the domains of interest to obtain proper results the computational trajectories of the wing tip vortex of refine01 are also compared with the experiments mcaliser and takahashi 1991 and are presented in fig 2 as well as high aspect ratio cells around the wing surface dense grids with a corn shape in the downstream x direction are used to improve the reliability of the computational results in this region the number of cells grows exponentially and the area is only extended up to x c 2 5 thus the vortex radius and location at x c 2 0 are plotted as shown in fig 2 the vortex radius and locations agree well with the experiments except next to the wing tip the vortex shedding from the wing tip moves in the span wise direction y in the downstream 2 3 flow analysis three dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations are employed and to reduce the blockage effects and disturbances by the outer boundaries the computational domain is sufficiently extended in each direction as shown in fig 3 the inlet region is upstream from the center of gravity by 24 times the chord and the exit is downstream at a distance of 48 times the chord the top outer boundary in the y direction is extended by 14 times the chord the commercial cfd package star ccm star 2006 is used to calculate aerodynamic characteristics and flow around a vehicle the second order upwind and central differencing schemes are adopted for convective and diffusion terms in the governing equations the pressure velocity coupling is resolved using the simple algorithm since the angle of attack is 2 deg there is no severe flow separation across the vehicle except the sharp edge wing tip the 6 layers of the shape following mesh so called a layer mesh next to a vehicle is used the maximum value of y is 15 on the upper surface of the wing suction side to ensure that there is no flow interaction between the vehicle and outer boundaries the upper boundary extends twice and two computational results are compared difference of aerodynamic forces is less than 0 05 since the geometry of the vehicle is smooth angle of attack is low there is no severe flow separation and the computational domain used in this study is sufficient the accuracy of the computational results depends on the quality of the grid system for accuracy and cost effectiveness polyhedral cells and a non uniform distribution refined next to the vehicle and ground are used as shown in fig 3 the height from the ground is measured where the center of gravity is located near half chord as shown in fig 4 the computation is carried out using a reynolds number of 3 51 10 5 based on the airfoil chord c and a corresponding inlet velocity of 20 0 m s no slip boundary conditions on the airfoil surface a moving wall boundary at the ground and a pressure boundary condition at the exit are employed a slip wall boundary condition is applied to the top outer and side boundaries the solutions are considered to converge when all of the residuals for the continuity and momentum equations are less than or equal to 10 6 the number of polyhedral cells is about 1 2 million an amd athlon processor 2 2 ghz with linux is used for the computations a mesh dependency test was performed with three different consecutive meshes 0 65 million 1 2 million and 1 9 million cells the relative errors compared to the fine mesh 1 9 million cells are listed in table 1 the lift and drag coefficients converge as the number of cells increased the relative errors of c l and c d of the base mesh are 0 09 and 1 3 respectively thus the fine mesh is used for analyzing the aerodynamic characteristics of the ground effect vehicle the locally refined cells in the box area that encloses the vehicle is named local refine region in fig 3 to capture the wake clearly the more dense meshes are used in downstream lee and lee 2013 performed a numerical multi objective optimization of wings in ground effect at h c 0 2 and α 2 deg and found 113 pareto optima that were not dominated by each other in this study we choose three airfoils among the pareto set that have high stability and a high lift to drag ratio and applied them to a wig effect vehicle that have fuselage wing and tail their aerodynamic characteristics and stability have been carefully studied the three airfoils are denoted as p001 p052 and p113 for p001 x h is close to the center of gravity and shows the highest stability whereas p113 shows the highest lift to drag ratio the lift to drag ratio and stability of p052 are in between the other two cases fig 5 shows two dimensional sections of the three pareto airfoils and a naca4415 airfoil more details about the sections and two dimensional aerodynamic characteristics are available from lee and lee 2013 3 results and discussion the aerodynamic characteristics of vehicles in the vicinity of the surface are dependent on two significant effects the ground effect and the venturi effect lee and lee 2014 qu et al 2015 in the moderate angle of attack the significant pressure distributions both pressure and suction sides are observed according to decreasing height it is positive ground effect which increases the lift and decrease drag when the height decrease qu et al 2015 however when the angle is negative or even positive according to the shape of airfoil the passage between pressure side and the ground is a typical convergence divergence channel and it results in negative ground effect these significant effects depend on the shapes of the lower surface of the vehicle the oncoming air to the lower wing surface gradually decreases the magnitude of the speed and the dynamic pressure on the lower wing surface changes to static pressure the pressure of the lower wing surface increases that leads to higher lift in addition to the high lift the drag also decreases with decreasing height lee et al 2010 this improvement in the aerodynamic characteristics with decreasing height is a positive feature of the ground effect rozhdestvensky 2006 as a result the lift to drag ratio dramatically increases with the ground effect the venturi effect mainly comes from the convergence divergence passage between the surface ground or water and the lower surface of the vehicle it accelerates the air flow under the vehicle and ground and causes a lower pressure distribution in the area due to the lower pressure the lift decreases and drag increase at the same time therefore to obtain stability and effectiveness the venturi effect should be prevented when the vehicle is close to the surface of ground or water generally racing cars employ the venturi effect to improve the contact force between the tires and road the shapes of the wing surface have a significant effect on the venturi and ground effects since a wig vehicle flies above the water or ground surface it has to satisfy the aerodynamic constraints and stability conditions for the ground effect at the same time for stable and satisfy flying the ground effect vehicle must fulfill the following conditions simultaneously 1 c l h 0 staufenbiel and schlichting 1988 2 h s 0 static stability condition staufenbiel and schlichting 1988 3 h s 0 2 static stability becomes excessive leading to dynamic instability kornev and matveev 2003 4 h s 0 05 there is insufficient stability which can lead to long period phugoid fluctuations kornev and matveev 2003 5 x h x c g x a x c g x h proper location of cg kornev and matveev 2003 6 c m a 0 trim at a positive angle of attack nelson 1998 the first condition implies that when c l h is positive the lift becomes lower as the height of the wig effect vehicle decreases when the height of a wig effect vehicle lowers decreases due to disturbances or by chance its equilibrium cannot be recovered at the new height so there is a risk of crashing on the surface the second static stability condition is a necessary condition for dynamic stability the dynamic stability cannot be satisfied without static height stability to achieve dynamic stability conditions 3 and 4 have to be also satisfied from conditions 2 to 4 the range of the static height stability has to be narrowed to 0 2 h s 0 05 condition 5 provides the proper location of the center of gravity under conditions 2 to 4 the last condition comes from the static stability of an airplane design when c m a has a negative sign the vehicle can be trimmed with a positive angle of attack in case of negative c m a the nose down pitching moment increases when the angle of attack increases the vehicle goes back to its original equilibrium in nature whereas in the case of positive c m a the nose down pitching moment decreases when the angle of attack increases considering the conditions we can choose a favorable location of the center of gravity for static and dynamic stability basically the location of x h is placed upstream and x a is downstream and x h is near x c g for stability table 2 shows the derivative coefficient of the optimum and reference naca4412 airfoils if the airfoil does not satisfy the static stability conditions s unstable is indicated in the static stability column and unstable is indicated in the d stability column because static stability is a necessary condition for dynamic stability if the case satisfies h s but does not conditions 3 and 4 d unstable is indicated in the d stability column to compare the results the computation is performed for a naca4412 airfoil with the same conditions as the other cases h c 0 2 and a o a 2 deg this case is named naca4412 old in table 2 however the naca4412 airfoil shows a positive c l h and is unstable in the same conditions this implies that a decrease in height leads to a lower flight height because of the lift decreases this instability mainly comes from the venturi effect and the air does not stagnate under the vehicle to produce a sufficient air cushion lee and lee 2014 therefore the angle of attack of the naca4412 airfoil is increased to 3 deg to improve the ground effect the new case named naca4412 and is used to compare the aerodynamic characteristics to the other optimized cases all cases except naca4412 old with angle of attack 2 deg that is only dominated by the venturi effect satisfy stability condition 1 as shown in table 2 in the second stability condition naca4412 with angle of attack 3 deg does not meet the condition as the height decreases h c 0 4 and 0 6 all the optimum cases except p052 h c 0 6 satisfy stability condition 2 some cases do not satisfy the static height stability condition according to the heights for safety it is necessary to maintain the operation height for safety while the wig vehicle is operating the naca4412 and p113 airfoils among the pareto optima have similar wing profiles with a straight lower surface but the aerodynamic characteristics such as the lift drag x h and x a are quite different x h is one of the objectives in previous research and the three optima p001 p052 and p113 have larger x h than naca4412 there is a great deal of difference between p001 the stability oriented wing profile from the pareto set and naca4412 however in terms of x a which is governed by the angle of attack naca4412 and p001 have similar tendencies however x a of naca4412 is slightly further downstream compare to that of p001 which is more or less favorable for stability c m h of p001 is more upstream than that of naca4415 and has superior stability the effect of x h is more dominant than x a as the height increases the static stability conditions are satisfied but the dynamic condition condition 6 is slightly violated however the x c g x h condition is maintained condition 5 according to the heights x h rapidly moves to downstream and the margin decreases c m a keeps its values irrespective of the height changes but c l a decreases this leads to the movement of x a downstream p052 has a sufficiently negative value of x h at h c 0 2 as expected but it violates condition 3 and can be dynamically unstable that is p052 and p001 might be unstable because of their excessive margin x a moves downstream more quickly than x h as the height increases which results in instability at h c 0 6 precise height control is strongly required for stable skimming in ground effect it is expected that p113 which has the largest lift coefficient among three pareto optima will have lower stability than the other optimum cases however it satisfies condition 2 with respect to the heights that is static stability is satisfied at a relatively large height h c 0 6 as with p001 with a fixed location of center of gravity condition 6 is not satisfied since x h moves downstream as the height increases this instability leads the long period instability phugoid instability in fig 6 the dynamic stability condition 6 can be satisfied when h s is located between the two dotted lines the upper and lower limits in fig 6 b the change of the static height stability condition h s of p113 is smaller than that of p052 according to the height variations since the variation of x h of p113 is small it keeps its stability at h c 0 6 to decrease x h c m h in denominator should be large or c l h in the numerator should be smaller that is the deviation according to the height should be decreased this results in a small deviation of the lift according to height considering safety the optimized airfoils show better performance in stability than naca4415 the cases considered in this study satisfy the static stability condition 2 with decreasing heights but become less stable dynamically the instability is influenced more by variations of the center of height x h than the angle of attack generally x a the aerodynamic center of the angle of attack is irrelevant to the height variations at h c 0 4 and 0 6 the values are almost constant and that of naca4415 moves upstream slightly this is unfavorable for the static stability but since x a is located upstream of x c g it is still stable at h c 0 2 naca4415 satisfies the static stability condition condition 2 but because of the excessive stability margin it may be dynamically unstable similar dynamic instability can be observed in the case of p001 at h c 0 2 with the increasing height x h sharply moves downstream and at h c 0 4 the locations of x h and x a are reversed therefore naca4415 is completely unstable both dynamically and statically a typical naca4415 an airfoil for airplane flying out of ground effect is not suitable for a ground effect vehicle in contrast to the other cases p113 satisfies the dynamic and static stability at h c 0 2 however at h c 0 4 and 0 6 the static stability is satisfied but the stability margin is insufficient and might lead to long period instability the naca4412 has the largest angle of attack among the cases and shows the large c l among the calculations at all heights p114 has the next largest c l followed by p052 and p001 the shape of the pressure side of p114 is nearly parallel to the ground at α 2 0 which is similar to that of naca4412 therefore the lift and lift to drag ratio tend to be similar the reason for the high lift of naca4412 is simply the use of a high angle of attack α 3 0 to remove the venturi effect at a low angle of attack the lift and lift to drag ratio at α 2 0 and h c 0 2 which are not plotted in fig 7 are 0 44 and 10 4 respectively and they are similar to those of p001 and p052 therefore the optimized cases provide better aerodynamic performance and better stability for all cases calculated in this study the lift and lift to drag ratio increase as the vehicle s height decreases this is generally observed in ground effect vehicles the drag force decreases slightly and thus the slip of the lift to drag ratio is slightly steeper than that of the lift because of the drag the key elements that affect the aerodynamic forces in a three dimensional flow are the tip vortex and fuselage generally the vortical flow at the wing tip reduces the lift by downwash and leads to induced drag the fuselage generates skin friction drag and pressure drag anderson 1999b however the fuselage pushes the air to each side and results in increased air flow next to the fuselage wing root when the vehicle is in the ground effect the stagnation of air under the pressure side enforces the lift whereas the venturi effect by a decrease increase sectional area reduces the lift suddenly when the venturi effect is dominant the vehicle cannot sustain its height an f1 formula car uses the venturi effect from an inversed wing with the suction side facing ground katz 1995 the lifts of both optimized and non optimized cases near the ground are increased by the ground effect as shown in figs 8 and 9 the pressure distributions along the suction and pressure sides vary according to the heights and angles of attack qu et al 2015 the pressure variations on the suction side according to the heights are relatively fewer comparing to pressure side due to the three dimensional effect the pressures rapidly decrease along the span even though the vehicles are sufficiently in the ground effect h c 0 2 a lift reduction due to vortical flow at the wing tip can be observed even though the vehicles are in the ground effect interestingly the pressures along the pressure side at y b 2 0 5 are larger than the pressure at y b 2 0 15 which is closer to the fuselage these results are different from lee and lee s wing only results lee and lee 2014 that only considered a wing the pressure differences can be observed in all cases used which implies that the flow next to the fuselage pushes outward and augments the air flow on both the pressure and suction sides the similar pressure distribution can be observed in ref qu et al 2014 that includes a fuselage and central and side wings as the height decreases the pressure difference on the pressure side increases and result in the span wise flow strengthening as the wings approach the ground except for naca4415 with a low angle of attack α 2 0 the pressure on the pressure side increases and thus the pressure differences between the pressure side and suction side also increase this results in a strong wing tip vortex as shown in figs 8 and 9 because of the three dimensional effects the increase in lift to drag ratio does not reach as it does in two dimensional ground effect in three dimension the wing tip vortex is still an important phenomenon on aerodynamics in ground effect fig 10 shows the pressure distribution on the upper side of the vehicles at both h c 0 2 and 0 6 the pressure on the upper side of naca4415 is quite different from those of the optimized wings according to the three dimensional effect the pressures for all the cases including optimized wings decrease at the wing tip this confirms that the three dimensional effects from the wing tip vortex cannot be ignored even though in ground effect since naca4415 is not optimized for the ground effect great amounts of its lift come from the suction side the cases that are optimized for the ground effect show the similar peak pressure coefficient but have the narrow band of the peak on the suction side the horizontal tail is expected to be out of ground effect to control the flight easily but the pressure distributions of all the cases including optimized wings on the horizontal tail change as the height decreases on the other hand the suction on the wing is slightly increased as the height decreases the pressure distributions on the pressure side are also very different from that of naca4415 as shown in fig 11 because of the stagnation of the air under the pressure side there are slight differences in the pressure distributions of the optimized wings at different heights the optimized cases show uniform pressure distributions across the pressure side except next to leading edge because of stagnation of the air flow p113 shows a large pressure change as the height changes than the other two optimized cases as the heights decrease the locations of the vortex change at h c 0 2 where the ground effect is dominant the wing tip vortices are pushed outward whereas at h c 0 6 the vortices move toward the fuselage similar to a general airplane flying out of ground effect as shown in fig 12 the movement of the wing tip comes from the pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides the ground effect reinforces the pressure difference on both the pressure and suction sides and the vortices tend to drift away from the wing as shown in fig 13 the vortex strength becomes stronger as the wing approximates the ground and the lift increases whereas the drag becomes smaller on the other word the high lift results in large pressure differences between the pressure and suction sides and thus the strength of the vortex becomes stronger and drifts further outward figs 14 and 15 show the iso surfaces of the vortex strength at two different heights the vortex strength at h c 0 2 in fig 14 is stronger than that at h c 0 6 in fig 15 the pressures on the lower surface are much stronger when the vehicle approaches the ground there is clearly an increase in the vortex strength as the height decreases even though wings are in ground effect the three dimensional vortex is important for a ground effect vehicle the wing tip vortex moves outward when it is in ground effect but it moves inward when it is out of ground effect various studies have observed the drag reduction according to decreasing heights of the wing to the ground ghadimi et al 2012 ahmed and sharma 2005 kumar 1969 wang et al 2013 in this study the reduction of drag and increase in lift are also observed as shown in figs 16 and 17 the drag consists of friction and pressure drag anderson 1999b the primary factors of the drag are the wet area and dynamic pressure velocity square regardless of the height changes the wet areas of the vehicle are constant and the velocity on the pressure side decreases slightly whereas the velocity on the suction side increases therefore the friction drag is constant or decreases slightly the value in the horizontal tail increases slightly the tail is placed sufficiently high to reduce the ground effect but it is implied that the tail is in the ground effect as a vehicle approaches the ground the drag decreases but the strength of the wing tip vortex due to pressure differences between the pressure and suction sides increases this increase in the vortex strength can be explained by the prandtl lifting model katz and plotkin 2001 prandtl 1924 jones 1979 the ground can be modeled with a vortex filament for wings with equal strength but opposite sign and the height can be measured at half of the distance between two opposite vortices when the vortex filament modeling a wing approaches the ground the image vortex also approaches thus the strength of the vortex filament increases at a rate of 1 h 2 but the downwash decreases consequently the lift increases and the induced drag decreases on the other hand the circulation of the bound vortex increases and results in an increasing in the wing tip vortex however the prandtl lifting model can provide a clue about the increasing lift to drag ratio but it cannot provide the exact values because it does not consider the viscous boundary layer 4 conclusions a three dimensional analysis is performed with optimized wing sections that are obtained by optimization based on a two dimensional analysis the vehicle considered in this study includes three dimensional wings a fuselage and a tail the characteristics of the three dimensional flow and stability including various stability conditions are closely investigated six stability conditions are evaluated including static height stability proper location of center of gravity and trim for flight in ground effect all the cases with an optimized wing section show higher stability and aerodynamic performance than the naca4412 that is a general purpose airfoil for safety it is necessary to maintain the operation height while the wig vehicle is operating because of its insufficient stability when the vehicle height increases pressure decreases at a wing top can be observed and the effect of a wing tip vortex and fuselage is significant the trajectories of the wing tip vortex in ground effect are different from those out of ground effect the vortices move outward because of the high pressure under the wings in ground effect the highest pressure of the lower wing surface is observed at the middle of the half span because of the side flow due to the fuselage pushing air outward the height of the tail is about h c 1 2 but interaction between downstream and the tail can be observed to improve the controllability the tail should be located higher than the height considered in this study with the optimized wing sections a tail area of about one fourth that of the main wing can satisfy the stability conditions when it is in ground effect typically wig effect vehicles have a large wing area to satisfy the stability which leads to structural failure more investigation of the flow interaction is strongly required
