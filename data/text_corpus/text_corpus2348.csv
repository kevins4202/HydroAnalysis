11740,the presence of different heavy metals such as arsenic in groundwater is evident and can be attributed to environmental processes and anthropogenic activities arsenic is considered one of the most toxic chemical elements in nature therefore many studies proposed valid processes for groundwater remediation in this review the primary arsenic sources are explored it also has provided an interesting discussion of how arsenic impurities can be removed from the groundwater using various processes while highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each of them particular attention has been focused on the membrane process nanofiltration applications at large scales are obstructed by the difficulty of as iii removal which is the most toxic as form and fouling issues application of nanofiber membranes in arsenic remediation is also described these membranes characterized by high surface area uniform pore size distribution and improved pore connectivity exhibit excellent adsorption capacity although the research activities in this field have made progress several problems need to be solved such as improvement of the porosity and the size of the pores and the mechanical strength for promoting their use in industrial operating conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic removal toxicity nanofiltration electrospinning nanofibrous membrane 1 introduction groundwater is widely employed as a water resource for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes especially in arid regions due to the scarcity of surface water and rainfalls li 2020 the continuous growth of the worldwide population industrialization agriculture production and climate change determined a detrimental effect on groundwater quality abdelkader et al some chemical species such as mercury hg zinc zn chromium cr lead pb cadmium cd fluoride f and metalloid as selenium se and arsenic as are present in amounts higher than the who limit in groundwaters most of them has severe effects on human health ab razak et al 2015 maity vithanage 2021 these metals and metalloids are natural elements on the earth and their concentration can change according to the local geology table 1 are reported the highest level of heavy metals found in drinking water according to epa kurniawan et al 2006 a higher level of arsenic in groundwaters hurts the quality of drinking water being extremely poisonous to humans and animals oliveira et al 2021 chakraborti et al 2013 arsenic occurs in distinct inorganic and organic forms and different oxidation states 3 0 3 and 5 smedley et al 2002 ahmad et al 2018 in particular some forms trivalent asiii and pentavalent asv are hazardous for human and environmental health bhattacharya et al 2007 the main chemical groups containing as retraceable in the environment are arsenic acids h3aso4 h3aso4 h3aso4 2 arsenious acids h3aso3 h3aso3 h3aso3 2 arsenites dimethylarsinic acid arsine arsenates and methyl arsenic acid as reported in table 1 the latter a metalloid is extremely dangerous for humans and animals elevated concentrations of arsenic 10 μg l are observed in different countries including the usa argentina germany vietnam chile mexico bangladesh pakistan china and india aftabtalab et al 2022 traditional methods to remove arsenic from groundwater include flocculation precipitation filtration coagulation ion exchange oxidation reduction and carbon adsorption m and s 2019 however these methods present different disadvantages high energy demand reduced efficiency particularly for slightly polluted groundwater andic compounds m and m 2015a mani and kumar 2013 membrane technology is appropriate for cleaning groundwater due to the reduced energy consumption high efficiency in retaining pollutants of different sizes reduced waste production and the easiness of integration with different traditional processes kehrein et al 2020 membrane processes typically used for water and wastewater treatment are microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro in most of the membrane operation the driving force is the pressure difference across the membrane saleh et al 2022 for arsenic removal nf and ro membrane processes are appropriate due to the minimal pore size of the membranes ezugbe and rathilal 2020 those methods see polymeric membranes as the primary membrane type used and this is true for the whole water sector on an industrial level to their ease of manufacturing and remarkable efficiency al aani mustafa and hilal 2020 gharsallah et al 2022 suffer disadvantages such as fouling chemical stability and the trade off between permeability and selectivity hofs et al 2011a ahmad et al 2022 m g de paola and lopresto 2021 the accumulation of organic and inorganic materials present in the wastewater on the surface and in the membrane pores causes fouling which determines a reduction of the permeate flux and quality and a consequent increase in process costs guo et al 2012 different routes are followed for fouling mitigation as wastewater pretreatments and cleaning either physical or chemical the hydrophobic character of the membranes also influences the fouling so the development of membranes with high hydrophilicity permits a fouling lessening 1 editorial board 2019 this review discusses the source of arsenic and its adverse impact on human and environmental health in addition the pros and cons of the different conventional technologies used to remove as are briefly discussed subsequently nanofiltration nf membrane technology for heavy metal removal the advantages and drawbacks of nanotechnology are presented with a look to future perspectives 2 arsenic sources arsenic is an essential element in hundreds of minerals such as sulfides arsenates arsenides and arsenites furthermore it is an ever present component in the atmosphere soils minerals natural waters and organisms matschullat et al 2000 the primary means of diffusion of arsenic are usually water streams which are discharged into the environment by biological and artificial sources and volcanic activity aided by windblown dust clouds merian 2008 artificial emissions in the air occur from the smelting of metals the discharge of fuels mainly brown coal and pesticides merian 2008 chakraborty et al 2012 however arsenic based pesticides were gradually replaced by other preparations and consequently the production of arsenic decreased even if arsenic in different amounts is still utilized in agricultural chemicals today arsenic pollution has different sources and its diffusion has been documented worldwide particularly in south argentina chile north american and south asian countries vietnam myanmar india nepal cambodia bangladesh and indonesia are regarded as the most arsenic polluted regions ahoulé et al 2015 ahmad and bhattacharya 2019b shaji et al 2021a more than 100 countries are affected by arsenic pollution in groundwater above the maximum contaminant level mcl limit of 0 010 mg l herath et al 2016 and most of the arsenic contaminated zones are located near mines mountain belts and river delta areas shaji et al 2021b 2021c bundschuh et al 2022 the summary of arsenic distribution around the world is reported in fig 1 arsenic is essentially embedded as sulfide salt within ores complexes and in particular can be found in mineralized areas integrated with metals particularly silver lead and gold with 46 by mass arsenopyrite feass and orpiment are considered the most significant arsenic source among all ferrous sulfates moreover under oxidizing conditions it decomposes to discharge acids of as and s into the environment contributing to polluting the acid mine sewerage with high concentrations of dissolved as corkhill and vaughan 2009 once oxidized and then dissolved arsenopyrite represents a crucial element of pollution in the environment and the oxidoreduction process affects the geochemical behavior of as mandaliev et al 2014 hong et al 2020 the chemical structure and molecular structure of arsenopyrite are shown in fig 2 as an integral part of the ore structure and assimilated components significant amounts of arsenic are present in several hydrated metal oxides and oxide minerals usually arsenic concentrations in iron oxides could reach weight values whereas one weight is equivalent to 10 000 mg kg essentially they result from primary iron sulfide minerals oxidation which contains an abundant presence of arsenic punshon et al 2017 arsenate adsorption to iron iii oxide hydroxides even to hydrous aluminum and manganese oxides if in abundant presence is a robust process and the amount of sorbed mass could be noticeable even at low arsenic concentrations in solution most usual silicate ores enclose about 1 mg kg or smaller arsenic and carbonate alloys generally have below 10 mg kg of arsenic smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the concentration and the structure of arsenic depend on multiple aspects suchas the existence of oxygen in the water the degree of biological activity the type of water source and the closeness of the water supply to arsenic bearing geological formations howe et al 2001 the arsenic presence in underground water can vary widely in terms of concentration arsenic amount is comprised from 0 5 μg l to 5000 μg l higher arsenic concentrations are detected in spring water in various environments such as oxidizing alkaline ph values and reducing aquifers arsenic is also noticeable in regions affected by drilling and industrialized activity smedley and kinniburgh 2002 arsenic is essentially present in water in arsenate as v form which is considerably less toxic than its trivalent form this form can easily create solid interactions with the sulfhydryl group in protein cysteine residues and small molecules of organosulfur compounds such as glutathione gsh however aquatic micro organisms may degrade the arsenate to arsenite under precise reducing conditions in an aqueous phase the methylation of organic arsenic to methyl and dimethyl l arsenic acids is strictly related to biological activity who air quality guidelines for europe 2nd edition 2000 cd rom version 2017 moreover arsenate is the chemical analog of phosphate p it can inhibit energy and metabolism by substituting p in phosphorylation reactions as iii attaches to the sh containing sulfhydryl groups of proteins and polypeptides that interfere with their activity chakraborty et al 2021 as v absorption via phosphate carriers had a high impact on human health as previously shown in several studies which reveal a connection between arsenic exposure and the predisposition to mellitus type diabetes in high as presence areas arsenic is present in many oxidation states and different environmental forms as shown in table 2 high concentrations of arsenic have been detected as an effect of leaching and natural weathering of arsenic from geological materials containing drainage from thermal sources and geysers arsenopyrite base metal sulfides and atmospheric precipitate globally pyrite arsenic sulfides and iron iii hydroxide are groundwater s most well known raw sources of arsenic pollution several studies have suggested how groundwater originating from the dissolution of sulfur minerals rich in arsenic or desorption from iron oxides can be considered the primary source of arsenic garelick et al 2008 barral fraga et al 2020 bjørklund et al 2020 the origin of global arsenic groundwater pollution in natural sources has been accredited to several processes of geochemical nature for example arsenic release from geothermal waters desorption from oxides and hydroxides oxidation of arsenic containing sulfides evaporative concentration leaching of arsenic from sulfides and reductive dissolution from oxides hydroxide welch et al 2000 coppola et al 2021 arsenic groundwater pollution is estimated to involve more than 200 million people worldwide samal et al 2021 the overview of the regions affected by arsenic and the possible sources is reported in table 3 the main anthropogenic actions accountable for arsenic delivery are smelting of non ferrous metals ore dressing electronic industries mining glass manufacture chemical industries pesticides tanning industries dye industries burning fossils fuels paints pigments cosmetics fungicides insecticides several anthropogenic sources of arsenic have been widely used during the last century their use has been restricted today due to the damaging impact on health and the environment bundschuh et al 2017 in particular chromated copper arsenate a well known wood chemical preserving agent containing a mixture of arsenic chromium and copper is regarded as the most significant anthropogenic arsenic pollutant anti corrosive agents leather tanning agents glass and ceramic products agricultural products pesticides textile chemicals and paints that contained this compound were widely utilized in the past however nowadays usage is prohibited in most of those chemicals the arsenic emitted from several anthropogenic activities differs significantly in chemical nature and bioavailability mahimairaja et al 2005 an overview of the primary uses and chemical types of arsenic is shown in table 4 jang et al 2016 several environmental reactions involve arsenic as biotransformation ligand exchange precipitation and oxide reduction welch et al 1988 pongratz 1998 those dynamic processes strongly depend on the ph temperature salinity metal sulfide sulfide ion concentrations iron concentration and oxidation reduction potential arsenic affects even the composition and the distribution of the complex of organisms that occupy a specific space in an ecosystem once extracted the mineral stable ores containing arsenic are strongly exposed to oxidizing conditions ensuing in the release of arsenic in surface waters and consequently to the environment for this reason the control of mining operations implemented by government departments is rigorous and increasingly strict the epa environmental protection agency has defined the mcl maximum contaminant level as the maximum acceptable limit of arsenic concentration to prevent prolonged arsenic exposure in public water systems and environments 3 effect of arsenic on human health arsenic is an abundant element in the environment exposition to this compound is possible by air groundwater and even by food consumption kar et al 2012 as discussed the leading causes of contamination can be traced in soils and various ordinary life actions bhattacharyya s et al 2022 itanna 2021 arsenic has been proved to affect many body organ systems its effects are evident on the skin the respiratory kapaj et al 2007 nervous and cardiovascular systems plus it can affect the immune and endocrine systems and have adverse effects on liver functionality kidneys and have repercussions on the reproductive system mohammed abdul et al 2015 all the adverse effects of as on human health including those mentioned above are represented in fig 3 skin anomalies are the most recognizable mark of arsenic exposure it is because human skin is considered as highly affected by arsenicosis which is a chronic disease due to as contaminated water drinking while highlighting its early manifestations in the body like melanosis maity et al 2012 pigmentation and keratosis rahman et al 2009 these skin modifications typically do not appear 5 years after exposure dn et al 1998 skin pigmentation and palm and sole thickening were evident in 65 of patients exposed to arsenic water from the indian region dn et al 1998 another case study was conducted in mongolia and china around a fifth of the studied population was exposed skin lesions and palm sole hyperkeratosis along with hyperpigmentation or depigmentation on chest skin for exposure to high amounts of arsenic in water jx et al 2007 arsenic can deposit in keratin rich body parts with evident effects like white lines on nails called mee s lines and commonly even alopecia rn 2003 e et al 2007 neurological issues have been widely reported to acute or chronic arsenic exposure often regarding sensorimotor polyneuropathy arsenic is more effective on nerves of the sensory system than on the nerves of the motor system at the same time some recurrent symptoms are ache and paresthesia in feet soles vahidnia et al 2007 spencer and palmer 2021 this is due to a reduced ability of neurons in glutathione formation and reactive oxygen species ros detoxification aoyama et al 2008 chou et al 2021 arsenic driven neurotoxicity is mainly caused by oxidative stress mundey et al 2013 prakash et al 2016 fig 4 shows how cytoskeletal disorganization and the consequent alteration of the protein composition and hyper phosphorylation cause arsenic driven neurotoxicity arsenic exposure is found to cause cardiovascular diseases cvd smelting workers are at high risk of cvd because of their exposure to high arsenic levels wang et al 2007 xu et al 2013 high levels of arsenic in drinking water sources have severe effects on the cardiovascular system and other organs such as kidneys liver and lung ahmad and bhattacharya 2019a healthiness effects of arsenic longitudinal study heals have established the arsenic effects on 20 000 people in bangladesh the resulting data showed how moderate and even low concentrations of as in the water resulted in increased mortality and chronic diseases including cvd among other reasons ahsan et al 2006 chen et al 2009 table 5 the baseline features of the study participants with incident cvd heart disease and stroke chen et al 2013 in the broader study the environmental protection agency epa has been working on cancer risk evaluation on the effect of inorganic arsenic ias cvds linked with exposure to ias were the foundation for a reference dose rfd evaluation the core of the risk assessment low level exposure to ias ranging from 100 to 150 μg l well water concentrations and cvd studied on multiple cohorts in bangladesh china taiwan and united states and an rfd was evaluated no adverse effect was observed under 100 μg l arsenic concentrations in water the equivalent to 0 009 mg kg day ias dose population resulted sensitive to as effects due to dietary deficiencies acting on arsenic methylation and one carbon metabolism while increasing the risk of cvd tsuji et al 2014 4 arsenic removal membranes based processes different methods are used for the as removal and each feature is reported in table 6 soluble arsenite is converted to arsenate soluble arsenite is converted to arsenate masscheleyn 2002 saha et al 2019 this process does not permit the removal of arsenic so other adsorption coagulation or ion exchange techniques are coupled to it different oxidizing agents used for oxidizing the arsenite to arsenate are used kim and nriagu 2000 maity and kar 2011 maity and chen 2021a the most effective oxidants are permanganate naocl kmno4 chlorine and ozone michael et al 2006 ahmad et al 2019 and the reactions involved are h 3 a s o 3 o 2 2 h a s o 4 2 4 h h 3 a s o 3 h c l o h a s o 4 2 3 h c l 5 h 3 a s o 3 2 m n o 4 5 h a s o 4 2 2 m n 2 4 h 3 h 2 o among these ozone is frequently used being a good oxidant and a potent disinfectant in developing countries permanganate is used for its long shelf life ease to recovery and disinfectant property against common enteric bacteria mohanty 2017 the adsorption method is primarily used for the nanomaterials being easy to perform and highly efficient singh et al 2021 usually activated carbon has been widely used for the removal mohan and pittman 2007 and the adsorption capacity depends on carbon characteristics temperature ph and ionic strength however it is less selective for arsenic removal a few milligrams of metalloid per gram of activated carbon carneiro et al 2021 and its recovery is complicated as a result this process is costly o it is arduous to utilize in developing countries ochedi et al 2020 activated alumina is also used for arsenic removal different study evidenced as the arsenite is adsorbed in the ph range 7 8 whereas the arseniate in the range 5 6 singh and pant 2004 in addition nanomaterials prepared using iron and copper oxides exhibit arsenic adsorption capacity at ph values close to the neutral m and m 2015b other innovative materials such as organic metal frameworks graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes represent a good alternative for the as v and as iii treatment showing better properties in terms of reuse and recovery and high adsorption capacity and so are an excellent route to follow for the as removal from wastewater liu et al 2020 another method efficient for the as removal from soil and groundwater is coagulation because it does not require pretreatment or preparation of the wastewater and the use of chemicals ge et al 2020 cheng et al 1994 maity et al 2019 only the pre oxidation and ph adjustment are necessary initially e metal based coagulant such as ferric chloride fecl3 is added to the wastewater sancha 2006a the water hydrolyzes fecl3 for forming the fe oh 3 and the arsenite as iii is oxidized to as v arsenate has a negative charge which is adsorbed by the fe oh 3 particles being positively charged finally the sedimentation and filtration processes permit the as remediation sancha 2006b other coagulants used are zirconium iv oxy chloride titanium sulfate titanium iii chloride zirconium iv chloride and titanium iv chloride and titanium iv oxy chloride rathi and kumar 2021 ion exchange is a process in which the ionic species are exchanged by means of the resins solid phase comstock and boyer 2014 francesco et al 2021 the ion exchange process allows obtaining an as concentration below 10 mg l jain and singh 2012 the resins used exhibit high affinity towards as v because they are negatively charged while the as iii is neutral sv et al 2015a therefore the pre oxidation technique is required sv et al 2015b this process is affected by several parameters such as the resin used the concentration of the metalloid the ph of the contaminated water and the presence of other anions i e cl co3 2 so4 2 electro coagulation is an emerging electrochemical technique used to treat potable water urban wastewater wastewater containing pollutants heavy metals and dyes elazzouzi et al 2019 anode and cathode are used and connected to an external power supply in an electro coagulation reactor in the beginning the oxidation occurs to the anode i e aluminum and ferrous electrodes with the generation of metallic cations at the same time the reduction of the water happens with the formation of h2 gas bubbles and hydroxide ions at the cathode sandoval et al 2021a the metallic ions combine with hydroxyl groups to form amorphous metallic hydroxides m oh n in the water which are very good adsorbents for pollutants maity and chen 2021b the m oh n species make chemical bonds with the pollutants forming loc pv and tsa 2017 then the flocs are removed from water by physical processes such as flotation precipitation and filtration sandoval et al 2021b membrane processes used in water treatment are microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro in these processes a pressure difference between the two sides of the membrane is the driving force bruggen et al 2003 dasgupta et al 2015 in these processes the membranes exhibit various pore sizes and can removing pollutants with dimensions from suspended particles mf to monovalent ions ro the characteristics of the pressure driven membrane processes are reported in table 7 low pressure membrane processes do not permit the permeation of arsenic due to its ionic radius 0 24 nm which is much smaller than the pore size range 10 000 1 nm in addition nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes easily remove the arsenic due to the minimal pore size of the membrane concerning its ionic radius mólgora et al 2013 in nf membranes the rejection combines steric donnan dielectric and transport effects the transport of neutral solutes is due to the steric mechanism size based exclusion mechanism the donnan mechanism refers to the equilibrium and the interaction between the charged chemical species and the charge present on the membrane rodrigues et al 2021 the ionizable groups on the surface and in the pores of the membranes generates the charges ernst et al 2000 these chemical species are acids or bases and their dissociations are affected by the solution s phn contact with the membrane ernst et al 2000 the first works on arsenic removal with membranes take place in the 90s waypa et al 1997 urase et al 1998 seidel et al 2004 kang et al 2000 in a paper published in 2002 three different nanofiltrations nf membranes were used and the characteristics and experimental data are reported in table 8 y 2002a in particular the rejection for the as v h2aso4 or haso4 2 is higher than 95 while the trivalent arsenic h3aso3 is very difficult to remove this different behavior of the membranes is due to their negative charge and so can reject the arsenic v existing in monovalent and divalent forms some years later saitua et al used the nf membrane process for as v removal from different model solutions saitúa et al 2005 the nf membrane module used was a thin film composite polyamide membrane 192 nf 300 in a spiral wound configuration produced by osmonic inc and characterized by a molecular weight cut off of 180 da the experimental results evidenced the possibility of removing the as v and the arsenic concentration in the permeate is 5 10 μg l the rejection of as v was between 93 and 99 for an initial arsenic concentration of f 100 and 382 mg l the rejection resulted independent of the feed flow rate temperature and transmembrane pressure the arsenic removal mechanism has been studied using a commercial nf membrane nguyen et al 2009 in particular in this research work a negatively charged polyamide membrane ne 90 manufactured by woongjin chemical south korea with a nominal mwco of 220 da and resistant in the ph range 3 10 the zeta potential measurements on the membrane evidenced an isoelectric at the value of ph 3 3 considering this aspect the experiments were performed in the ph range 5 8 to ensure a negative charge on the membrane surface the experimental results evidenced as the as v and as iii are removed even if the arsenate is more rejected this indicated that both ions experienced the steric exclusion but the arsenate for its negative charge is also subjected to the donnan exclusion mechanism in addition the authors demonstrated that the arsenate removal increased with cl and hco3 being more mobile ions and it decreased with so4 2 due to its low mobility the rejection of as v from the model solution raised from 89 to 96 by enhancing the as v concentration from 20 to 100 μg l in addition the as v removal increased with the ph because the membrane s zeta potential became more hostile increasing the electric exclusion in 2015 akin et al studied the effect of different parameters such as ph and operating pressure on arsenic rejection using the swhr and bw 30 membranes filmtec membranes akin et al 2011 the influence of the feed water ph on the arsenic removal is illustrated in fig 5 the experimental data evidenced as the rejection of the as v and as iii rejection are heavily influenced by the ph of the feed water for the considered membranes swhr and bw 30 membranes as v and as iii are rejected at ph 4 and ph 9 respectively these results are due to the dissociation of the arsenic and arsenous acids at the different ph values see equations 1 4 fischer 1965 1 h 3 a s o 4 h 2 o h 2 a s o 4 h 3 o p k a 1 2 19 2 h 2 a s o 4 h 2 o h a s o 4 2 h 3 o p k a 1 6 94 3 h a s o 4 2 h 2 o a s o 4 3 h 3 o p k a 1 11 50 the rejection of as v and as iii increases with the transmembrane pressure being the driving force in the nf process finally groundwater containing a total arsenic concentration of 62 μg l was treated with the membrane the total arsenic concentration in the permeate was about 2 86 μg l which was lower than who and epa recommendation limit 10 μg l song et al prepared composite membranes with a hollow fiber configuration and a thin active layer in sulfonated poly ether ether ketone speek and a pes uf membranes they are used or the arsenic removal song et al 2015 the coating is permitted to reduce the zeta potential due to the deprotonation of the sulfonate group of speek a water permeability of 11 1 l m2h bar has been obtained and the as v rejection enhanced from 89 to 96 4 by increasing the ph value from 4 to 9 this result is due to the anionic nature of the speek membrane and the different dissociation states of the of as v by varying the ph of the feed solution finally a techno economical evaluation indicated that the treatment cost of groundwater containing arsenic using the proposed speek coated hollow fiber membrane for a plant of 1000 m3 h was about 0 15 us per m3 however further improvement could be obtained by reducing both membrane and pretreatment costs the fouling represents a huge problem in membrane technology because it causes flux decline in time and a decrease of productivity and a rising in energy consumption for the accumulation of organic biological and inorganic constituents on the surface and into the pores of the membranes algieri and drioli 2022 different studies have explored the chemical modification of the membrane to enhance hydrophilicity and improve the antifouling capacity and separation performance kamaludin et al 2022 polysulfone psf is one of the most polymeric materials used to prepare uf membranes even if it does not have a hydrophilic character and surface charges blending the psf with hydrophilic materials permits applying these membranes to remove small dangerous ions as the arsenic in 2017 nayak et al functionalized the polyvinyl chloride pvc with l cysteine cys to obtain a zwitterionic polymer subsequently the cys pvc polymer was blended with psf and tio2 nanoparticles have also been added to enhance the membrane charge further mechanical stability the different composition of all synthesized membranes is reported in table 9 nayak et al 2017a the best permeation performances obtained in the cited study are relative to an applied pressure of 500 kpa with a permeate flux of 35 l m2h the pure water flux decreased with the tio2 amount from 300 mg to 500 mg in addition the composite membranes showed higher arsenic rejection in the ph range investigated from 4 to 9 furthermore for sample a1 the rejection is almost 100 in basic conditions because of the present negative charges provided by the cysteine and tio2 imhof 2002 increased tio2 concentration reduced the rejection for forming clusters in the membrane structure a zwitterionic copolymer p mpc co aema soluble in water has been prepared via free radical polymerization he et al 2018 that presents a zwitterionic segment containing both positively charged ammonium cations and negatively charged phosphate anion and 2 a poly aema segment with amino terminal groups subsequently the co polymer has been incorporated into the polyimide selective layer of a thin film composite membrane via interfacial polymerization the modified membrane has been used for the as removal the prepared membranes exhibited higher water flux and rejection values than those obtained with the pristine membrane in particular the membrane containing 50 co polymer exhibited an as v rejection of 99 8 and water permeability of 8 5 l m2h bar the modified membrane exhibited stable performance for 180 h tanne et al have studied the influence of pore dimension and surface properties of the membranes on the as removal tanne et al 2019 in particular three commercially nf membranes nf90 dow filmtec usa esna1 and esna1 lf2 ld both from nitto denko japan and a non commercially available m 1 origin water china have been used the nf90 membranes displayed the highest rejection values for the arsenate using an arsenate concentration of 70 μg l in the feed water and operating pressure of 5 bar the rejections of arsenate are 91 1 for nf90 86 2 for m 1 and 81 8 for esna1 these results are attributable to the negative surface charge of the membrane being very high for the sample nf90 followed by the m1 and the others however the m 1 sample has been used for the as removal from natural groundwater which is less prone to membrane fouling than nf90 recently pa blended membranes were prepared by varying the chitosan clay nanoparticles c sbf concentrations of 10 50 mg zeeshan et al 2020 the composite membranes exhibited increased hydrophilicity that grew with the chitosan clay content the composite membranes showed higher permeation fluxes than the control due to the presence of the c sbf hydrophilic nanoparticles jabur et al 2016 the modified membranes showed the highest rejection values for the as iii at ph 9 while the lowest rejection has been found in an acidic environment this result is interesting considering that as iii is removed with enormous difficulty by nf and ro membranes being neutral species recently ma and coworkers have fabricated highly electrically conducting ultrafiltration membranes to remove the as iii ma et al 2021 the uf membranes present a hydrophilic nickel coated cnt ni cnt layer deposited on psf membranes that acts as a support the application of cathodic potential to the surface of the membrane considerably determined an increase of the as iii rejection in synthetic and natural tap water r 72 6 5 1 when 7 v has been applied the application of the negative potentials determined an increase of the local ph production of oh ions that determined the transformation of the neutral arsenic species h3aso3 in its ionic forms h2aso3 haso3 2 so these last species are rejected by the negative charges present on the membrane surface in table 10 the application of various membranes for the as removal has been reported this section is evidenced as various nanofiltration membranes some of these commercial and other synthetized exhibited exciting performance in the arsenic removal algieri et al 2021 however a large scale application is still in the early stage for the water flux decrease and membrane degradation owing to the fouling leonzio 2018 electrospinning is an exciting process for preparing nanofiber porous membranes for drinking water production and wastewater purification zhu et al 2021a this process has the advantages of being economical easy to use and high efficient pereao et al 2019a in addition the nanofibers exhibit 3d interconnected pore structure high specific surface area ease of surface functionalization and recycling pereao et al 2019b an electrospinning set up illustrated in fig 6 presents high voltage power supply an electrospinning setup is constituted by a high voltage power source a syringe pump for generating the polymer solution jet a grounded collector a spinneret electrically conductive and a polymer solution the properties of the prepared nanofibers depend on voltage feed rate and air gap processing parameters temperature and humidity environmental parameters sanders et al 2019 and polymer solution parameters concentration solution viscosity polymer s molecular weight and solvent s evaporation medeiros et al 2008 the researchers have focused on developing mixed matrix electrospun nanofibrous membranes enms inorganic fillers dispersed into polymeric nanofibers owing to their improved physico chemical properties and separation performance nanofiber membranes made in polyvinylidene fluoride and loaded with specific adsorbents nanoparticles of titanium dioxide halloysite nanotubes have been used for the removal of as iii from contaminated water moslehyani et al 2020 a maximum amount of as 31 2 mg g has been adsorbed by using a mixed enm loaded with a 0 5 wt of adsorbents in some cases accomplishing consistent removal rates over sustained periods requires a regeneration free process like ion exchange and adsorption it is worth mentioning that these procedures can be slowed down by high salinity and the presence of organic matter this said the treatment choice should consider the ability to eliminate either salinity and organic matter this is why nf ro membranes could well serve many as contaminated waters boussouga et al 2021 recently novel adsorbent mixed matrix membrane consisting of a polycaprolactone matrix with iron intercalated mont morillonite filler has been synthesized peña et al 2021 the prepared fibers had diameters of 212 04 98 48 nm and showed attractive adsorption capacity towards the arsenic from wastewater recently torasso et al have developed electro spun membrane comprising super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles spions loaded in pva nanofibers pva spions torasso et al 2021 the experimental data confirmed a maximum adsorption capacity of 52 5 mg g for the sample containing the 0 14 wt of spions pva spions membrane did not present defects at the microscopic level and it is constituted of crisscrossed bead free nanofibers after the adsorption tests a change in the fiber morphology was detected see fig 7 recently another innovative technology for arsenic removal explored graphene based materials dueto its physical and chemical properties high surface area and structure yoon et al 2017 su et al 2017 la et al 2017 leaper et al demonstrated the possibility to remove arsenic by utilizing electro spun polyvinylidene difluoride membranes loaded with reduced graphene oxide leaper et al 2021 the membrane loaded with an amount of go equal to 2 wt exhibited higher flux than the pure polymer with an as iii rejection of about 99 9 in this field some challenges should be overcome such as the pore size the porosity and the mechanical strength of the enm improvement for ensuring to their large scale production and application 5 membrane fouling membrane fouling represents the main disadvantage of the membrane technology because of determines a flux decrease a permeate deterioration and an increase of the costs due to the increase energy demand chemicals and numerous cleanings mohammad et al 2015 it is caused by the accumulation on the surface and into the membrane pores in particular it determines the deposition of organic colloids proteins polysaccharides etc biologic viruses algae bacteria and other microorganisms and inorganic constituents salts on the membrane and into its porous structure different factors influence the fouling wastewater chemical composition membrane properties and operating conditions for example ph and temperature manawi et al 2016 a possible way to reduce the fouling is the pretreatment of the water before the membrane process to remove most of the foulant usually as membrane processes are chosen microfiltration and ultrafiltration enable the removal of larger pollutant that can clog the membrane used in nf and ro processes abdelkader et al the fouling reduction is obtained utilizing physical and chemical cleaning one of the most used physical cleanings is used during the process of water flushing wu et al 2018 carnevale et al studied the treatment of the olive milling wastewater by dcmd and vmd processes the authors demonstrated that cleaning the membrane with deionized water at 60 c for 15 min permitted a flux recovery up to 92 physical cleaning is used for treating reversible fouling while for irreversible fouling chemical cleaning is required poojamnong et al 2020 the chemical agents used are acid base chelating and surfactants zhao and coworkers studied the effect of three different chemical agents naoh edta and sodium dodecyl sulfate for cleaning hollow fiber membranes used for wastewater treatment zhao et al 2017 they found that cleaning with sds is more efficient than naoh and dta one recently ren et al demonstrated that the separation of monosaccharides and divalent salts by the nf process has improved post chemical cleaning in this study different chemicals were used as h2so4 naoh and naclo and the use of naclo showed a better result regarding membrane regeneration ren et al 2022 hydrophobic membranes are more prone to fouling than hydrophilic ones considering this aspect improving the membrane surface hydrophilicity has been considered an important route to follow fouling mitigation yuan et al 2014 various grafting coating and blending techniques are applied to modify the membrane surface díez and rosal 2020 the grafting permits hydrophilic chains on the membrane surface by forming chemical bonds lee et al 2018 this method is easy to perform and with the possibility to have high chemical stability but at the same time is determined an increase of the membrane cost and it is not accessible to scale up lee et al 2018 wang et al 2018 russo et al 2021 the surface coating is a simple cheap and environmentally friendly method for obtaining a hydrophilic membrane li et al 2014 in addition polymers with high molecular weight are utilized to avoid the penetration of the coating into the membrane pores du et al compared the performance of two membranes a hydrophobic pvdf and pvdf coated with a pva hydrophilic polymer du et al 2018 they demonstrated as hydrophilic coated membrane exhibited better performance for various treatment cycles polymeric materials or inorganic fillers characterized by hydrophilic properties are used s additives during membrane formation to manipulate the membrane properties alenazi et al 2017 in this technique the main drawbacks are the less compatibility between the additives and the polymeric materials and the leaching of the blended materials during long term operations shen et al 2020 asiri et al 2021 usually pvp or peg are added to the polymeric solution to improve the membrane performance malik et al 2019 the prepared membranes exhibit an increased water flux because these two pore forming and so induce a finger cause these twoore forming polymers induce ainger like structure malik et al 2019 in addition different inorganic fillers tio2 mofs zeolite carbon molecular sieve porous silica are added to the polymeric membranes for preparing the mixed matrix membranes malik et al 2019 the fillers modify the polymer free volume by altering the packing of the polymeric chains 6 conclusions the presence of arsenic in groundwater represents a problem for human health worldwide for its high toxicity inorganic as in drinking water causes different cancer types but also cardio vascular pulmonary immunological neurological and endocrine diseases nf membrane process shows high as rejection values and water flux operating at sustained pressure difference values in particular the rejection values obtained using commercial and synthesized nf membranes are very high for the as v however removing the arsenite as iii is complicated meaning low rejection values this different behavior is due to the membrane s negative charges that can reject the arsenic v by existing as monovalent and divalent ions arsenite is a neutral species commercial nf membranes present different drawbacks the most relevant are the fouling the efficiency for long term and the reduced arsenite removal the fouling mitigation is possible by following different ways as the cleaning and physical cleaning wastewater pretreatment and the utilization of more hydrophilic membrane in addition in the last years the researchers have focused on developing the electrospun nanofiber membranes that seem to be very promising for arsenic removal from the groundwater it is due to their 3d interconnected pore structure high specific surface area and ease of surface functionalization and recycling however their production at a large scale and the electrospinning process improvement represents the key drawbacks in this field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11740,the presence of different heavy metals such as arsenic in groundwater is evident and can be attributed to environmental processes and anthropogenic activities arsenic is considered one of the most toxic chemical elements in nature therefore many studies proposed valid processes for groundwater remediation in this review the primary arsenic sources are explored it also has provided an interesting discussion of how arsenic impurities can be removed from the groundwater using various processes while highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each of them particular attention has been focused on the membrane process nanofiltration applications at large scales are obstructed by the difficulty of as iii removal which is the most toxic as form and fouling issues application of nanofiber membranes in arsenic remediation is also described these membranes characterized by high surface area uniform pore size distribution and improved pore connectivity exhibit excellent adsorption capacity although the research activities in this field have made progress several problems need to be solved such as improvement of the porosity and the size of the pores and the mechanical strength for promoting their use in industrial operating conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic removal toxicity nanofiltration electrospinning nanofibrous membrane 1 introduction groundwater is widely employed as a water resource for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes especially in arid regions due to the scarcity of surface water and rainfalls li 2020 the continuous growth of the worldwide population industrialization agriculture production and climate change determined a detrimental effect on groundwater quality abdelkader et al some chemical species such as mercury hg zinc zn chromium cr lead pb cadmium cd fluoride f and metalloid as selenium se and arsenic as are present in amounts higher than the who limit in groundwaters most of them has severe effects on human health ab razak et al 2015 maity vithanage 2021 these metals and metalloids are natural elements on the earth and their concentration can change according to the local geology table 1 are reported the highest level of heavy metals found in drinking water according to epa kurniawan et al 2006 a higher level of arsenic in groundwaters hurts the quality of drinking water being extremely poisonous to humans and animals oliveira et al 2021 chakraborti et al 2013 arsenic occurs in distinct inorganic and organic forms and different oxidation states 3 0 3 and 5 smedley et al 2002 ahmad et al 2018 in particular some forms trivalent asiii and pentavalent asv are hazardous for human and environmental health bhattacharya et al 2007 the main chemical groups containing as retraceable in the environment are arsenic acids h3aso4 h3aso4 h3aso4 2 arsenious acids h3aso3 h3aso3 h3aso3 2 arsenites dimethylarsinic acid arsine arsenates and methyl arsenic acid as reported in table 1 the latter a metalloid is extremely dangerous for humans and animals elevated concentrations of arsenic 10 μg l are observed in different countries including the usa argentina germany vietnam chile mexico bangladesh pakistan china and india aftabtalab et al 2022 traditional methods to remove arsenic from groundwater include flocculation precipitation filtration coagulation ion exchange oxidation reduction and carbon adsorption m and s 2019 however these methods present different disadvantages high energy demand reduced efficiency particularly for slightly polluted groundwater andic compounds m and m 2015a mani and kumar 2013 membrane technology is appropriate for cleaning groundwater due to the reduced energy consumption high efficiency in retaining pollutants of different sizes reduced waste production and the easiness of integration with different traditional processes kehrein et al 2020 membrane processes typically used for water and wastewater treatment are microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro in most of the membrane operation the driving force is the pressure difference across the membrane saleh et al 2022 for arsenic removal nf and ro membrane processes are appropriate due to the minimal pore size of the membranes ezugbe and rathilal 2020 those methods see polymeric membranes as the primary membrane type used and this is true for the whole water sector on an industrial level to their ease of manufacturing and remarkable efficiency al aani mustafa and hilal 2020 gharsallah et al 2022 suffer disadvantages such as fouling chemical stability and the trade off between permeability and selectivity hofs et al 2011a ahmad et al 2022 m g de paola and lopresto 2021 the accumulation of organic and inorganic materials present in the wastewater on the surface and in the membrane pores causes fouling which determines a reduction of the permeate flux and quality and a consequent increase in process costs guo et al 2012 different routes are followed for fouling mitigation as wastewater pretreatments and cleaning either physical or chemical the hydrophobic character of the membranes also influences the fouling so the development of membranes with high hydrophilicity permits a fouling lessening 1 editorial board 2019 this review discusses the source of arsenic and its adverse impact on human and environmental health in addition the pros and cons of the different conventional technologies used to remove as are briefly discussed subsequently nanofiltration nf membrane technology for heavy metal removal the advantages and drawbacks of nanotechnology are presented with a look to future perspectives 2 arsenic sources arsenic is an essential element in hundreds of minerals such as sulfides arsenates arsenides and arsenites furthermore it is an ever present component in the atmosphere soils minerals natural waters and organisms matschullat et al 2000 the primary means of diffusion of arsenic are usually water streams which are discharged into the environment by biological and artificial sources and volcanic activity aided by windblown dust clouds merian 2008 artificial emissions in the air occur from the smelting of metals the discharge of fuels mainly brown coal and pesticides merian 2008 chakraborty et al 2012 however arsenic based pesticides were gradually replaced by other preparations and consequently the production of arsenic decreased even if arsenic in different amounts is still utilized in agricultural chemicals today arsenic pollution has different sources and its diffusion has been documented worldwide particularly in south argentina chile north american and south asian countries vietnam myanmar india nepal cambodia bangladesh and indonesia are regarded as the most arsenic polluted regions ahoulé et al 2015 ahmad and bhattacharya 2019b shaji et al 2021a more than 100 countries are affected by arsenic pollution in groundwater above the maximum contaminant level mcl limit of 0 010 mg l herath et al 2016 and most of the arsenic contaminated zones are located near mines mountain belts and river delta areas shaji et al 2021b 2021c bundschuh et al 2022 the summary of arsenic distribution around the world is reported in fig 1 arsenic is essentially embedded as sulfide salt within ores complexes and in particular can be found in mineralized areas integrated with metals particularly silver lead and gold with 46 by mass arsenopyrite feass and orpiment are considered the most significant arsenic source among all ferrous sulfates moreover under oxidizing conditions it decomposes to discharge acids of as and s into the environment contributing to polluting the acid mine sewerage with high concentrations of dissolved as corkhill and vaughan 2009 once oxidized and then dissolved arsenopyrite represents a crucial element of pollution in the environment and the oxidoreduction process affects the geochemical behavior of as mandaliev et al 2014 hong et al 2020 the chemical structure and molecular structure of arsenopyrite are shown in fig 2 as an integral part of the ore structure and assimilated components significant amounts of arsenic are present in several hydrated metal oxides and oxide minerals usually arsenic concentrations in iron oxides could reach weight values whereas one weight is equivalent to 10 000 mg kg essentially they result from primary iron sulfide minerals oxidation which contains an abundant presence of arsenic punshon et al 2017 arsenate adsorption to iron iii oxide hydroxides even to hydrous aluminum and manganese oxides if in abundant presence is a robust process and the amount of sorbed mass could be noticeable even at low arsenic concentrations in solution most usual silicate ores enclose about 1 mg kg or smaller arsenic and carbonate alloys generally have below 10 mg kg of arsenic smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the concentration and the structure of arsenic depend on multiple aspects suchas the existence of oxygen in the water the degree of biological activity the type of water source and the closeness of the water supply to arsenic bearing geological formations howe et al 2001 the arsenic presence in underground water can vary widely in terms of concentration arsenic amount is comprised from 0 5 μg l to 5000 μg l higher arsenic concentrations are detected in spring water in various environments such as oxidizing alkaline ph values and reducing aquifers arsenic is also noticeable in regions affected by drilling and industrialized activity smedley and kinniburgh 2002 arsenic is essentially present in water in arsenate as v form which is considerably less toxic than its trivalent form this form can easily create solid interactions with the sulfhydryl group in protein cysteine residues and small molecules of organosulfur compounds such as glutathione gsh however aquatic micro organisms may degrade the arsenate to arsenite under precise reducing conditions in an aqueous phase the methylation of organic arsenic to methyl and dimethyl l arsenic acids is strictly related to biological activity who air quality guidelines for europe 2nd edition 2000 cd rom version 2017 moreover arsenate is the chemical analog of phosphate p it can inhibit energy and metabolism by substituting p in phosphorylation reactions as iii attaches to the sh containing sulfhydryl groups of proteins and polypeptides that interfere with their activity chakraborty et al 2021 as v absorption via phosphate carriers had a high impact on human health as previously shown in several studies which reveal a connection between arsenic exposure and the predisposition to mellitus type diabetes in high as presence areas arsenic is present in many oxidation states and different environmental forms as shown in table 2 high concentrations of arsenic have been detected as an effect of leaching and natural weathering of arsenic from geological materials containing drainage from thermal sources and geysers arsenopyrite base metal sulfides and atmospheric precipitate globally pyrite arsenic sulfides and iron iii hydroxide are groundwater s most well known raw sources of arsenic pollution several studies have suggested how groundwater originating from the dissolution of sulfur minerals rich in arsenic or desorption from iron oxides can be considered the primary source of arsenic garelick et al 2008 barral fraga et al 2020 bjørklund et al 2020 the origin of global arsenic groundwater pollution in natural sources has been accredited to several processes of geochemical nature for example arsenic release from geothermal waters desorption from oxides and hydroxides oxidation of arsenic containing sulfides evaporative concentration leaching of arsenic from sulfides and reductive dissolution from oxides hydroxide welch et al 2000 coppola et al 2021 arsenic groundwater pollution is estimated to involve more than 200 million people worldwide samal et al 2021 the overview of the regions affected by arsenic and the possible sources is reported in table 3 the main anthropogenic actions accountable for arsenic delivery are smelting of non ferrous metals ore dressing electronic industries mining glass manufacture chemical industries pesticides tanning industries dye industries burning fossils fuels paints pigments cosmetics fungicides insecticides several anthropogenic sources of arsenic have been widely used during the last century their use has been restricted today due to the damaging impact on health and the environment bundschuh et al 2017 in particular chromated copper arsenate a well known wood chemical preserving agent containing a mixture of arsenic chromium and copper is regarded as the most significant anthropogenic arsenic pollutant anti corrosive agents leather tanning agents glass and ceramic products agricultural products pesticides textile chemicals and paints that contained this compound were widely utilized in the past however nowadays usage is prohibited in most of those chemicals the arsenic emitted from several anthropogenic activities differs significantly in chemical nature and bioavailability mahimairaja et al 2005 an overview of the primary uses and chemical types of arsenic is shown in table 4 jang et al 2016 several environmental reactions involve arsenic as biotransformation ligand exchange precipitation and oxide reduction welch et al 1988 pongratz 1998 those dynamic processes strongly depend on the ph temperature salinity metal sulfide sulfide ion concentrations iron concentration and oxidation reduction potential arsenic affects even the composition and the distribution of the complex of organisms that occupy a specific space in an ecosystem once extracted the mineral stable ores containing arsenic are strongly exposed to oxidizing conditions ensuing in the release of arsenic in surface waters and consequently to the environment for this reason the control of mining operations implemented by government departments is rigorous and increasingly strict the epa environmental protection agency has defined the mcl maximum contaminant level as the maximum acceptable limit of arsenic concentration to prevent prolonged arsenic exposure in public water systems and environments 3 effect of arsenic on human health arsenic is an abundant element in the environment exposition to this compound is possible by air groundwater and even by food consumption kar et al 2012 as discussed the leading causes of contamination can be traced in soils and various ordinary life actions bhattacharyya s et al 2022 itanna 2021 arsenic has been proved to affect many body organ systems its effects are evident on the skin the respiratory kapaj et al 2007 nervous and cardiovascular systems plus it can affect the immune and endocrine systems and have adverse effects on liver functionality kidneys and have repercussions on the reproductive system mohammed abdul et al 2015 all the adverse effects of as on human health including those mentioned above are represented in fig 3 skin anomalies are the most recognizable mark of arsenic exposure it is because human skin is considered as highly affected by arsenicosis which is a chronic disease due to as contaminated water drinking while highlighting its early manifestations in the body like melanosis maity et al 2012 pigmentation and keratosis rahman et al 2009 these skin modifications typically do not appear 5 years after exposure dn et al 1998 skin pigmentation and palm and sole thickening were evident in 65 of patients exposed to arsenic water from the indian region dn et al 1998 another case study was conducted in mongolia and china around a fifth of the studied population was exposed skin lesions and palm sole hyperkeratosis along with hyperpigmentation or depigmentation on chest skin for exposure to high amounts of arsenic in water jx et al 2007 arsenic can deposit in keratin rich body parts with evident effects like white lines on nails called mee s lines and commonly even alopecia rn 2003 e et al 2007 neurological issues have been widely reported to acute or chronic arsenic exposure often regarding sensorimotor polyneuropathy arsenic is more effective on nerves of the sensory system than on the nerves of the motor system at the same time some recurrent symptoms are ache and paresthesia in feet soles vahidnia et al 2007 spencer and palmer 2021 this is due to a reduced ability of neurons in glutathione formation and reactive oxygen species ros detoxification aoyama et al 2008 chou et al 2021 arsenic driven neurotoxicity is mainly caused by oxidative stress mundey et al 2013 prakash et al 2016 fig 4 shows how cytoskeletal disorganization and the consequent alteration of the protein composition and hyper phosphorylation cause arsenic driven neurotoxicity arsenic exposure is found to cause cardiovascular diseases cvd smelting workers are at high risk of cvd because of their exposure to high arsenic levels wang et al 2007 xu et al 2013 high levels of arsenic in drinking water sources have severe effects on the cardiovascular system and other organs such as kidneys liver and lung ahmad and bhattacharya 2019a healthiness effects of arsenic longitudinal study heals have established the arsenic effects on 20 000 people in bangladesh the resulting data showed how moderate and even low concentrations of as in the water resulted in increased mortality and chronic diseases including cvd among other reasons ahsan et al 2006 chen et al 2009 table 5 the baseline features of the study participants with incident cvd heart disease and stroke chen et al 2013 in the broader study the environmental protection agency epa has been working on cancer risk evaluation on the effect of inorganic arsenic ias cvds linked with exposure to ias were the foundation for a reference dose rfd evaluation the core of the risk assessment low level exposure to ias ranging from 100 to 150 μg l well water concentrations and cvd studied on multiple cohorts in bangladesh china taiwan and united states and an rfd was evaluated no adverse effect was observed under 100 μg l arsenic concentrations in water the equivalent to 0 009 mg kg day ias dose population resulted sensitive to as effects due to dietary deficiencies acting on arsenic methylation and one carbon metabolism while increasing the risk of cvd tsuji et al 2014 4 arsenic removal membranes based processes different methods are used for the as removal and each feature is reported in table 6 soluble arsenite is converted to arsenate soluble arsenite is converted to arsenate masscheleyn 2002 saha et al 2019 this process does not permit the removal of arsenic so other adsorption coagulation or ion exchange techniques are coupled to it different oxidizing agents used for oxidizing the arsenite to arsenate are used kim and nriagu 2000 maity and kar 2011 maity and chen 2021a the most effective oxidants are permanganate naocl kmno4 chlorine and ozone michael et al 2006 ahmad et al 2019 and the reactions involved are h 3 a s o 3 o 2 2 h a s o 4 2 4 h h 3 a s o 3 h c l o h a s o 4 2 3 h c l 5 h 3 a s o 3 2 m n o 4 5 h a s o 4 2 2 m n 2 4 h 3 h 2 o among these ozone is frequently used being a good oxidant and a potent disinfectant in developing countries permanganate is used for its long shelf life ease to recovery and disinfectant property against common enteric bacteria mohanty 2017 the adsorption method is primarily used for the nanomaterials being easy to perform and highly efficient singh et al 2021 usually activated carbon has been widely used for the removal mohan and pittman 2007 and the adsorption capacity depends on carbon characteristics temperature ph and ionic strength however it is less selective for arsenic removal a few milligrams of metalloid per gram of activated carbon carneiro et al 2021 and its recovery is complicated as a result this process is costly o it is arduous to utilize in developing countries ochedi et al 2020 activated alumina is also used for arsenic removal different study evidenced as the arsenite is adsorbed in the ph range 7 8 whereas the arseniate in the range 5 6 singh and pant 2004 in addition nanomaterials prepared using iron and copper oxides exhibit arsenic adsorption capacity at ph values close to the neutral m and m 2015b other innovative materials such as organic metal frameworks graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes represent a good alternative for the as v and as iii treatment showing better properties in terms of reuse and recovery and high adsorption capacity and so are an excellent route to follow for the as removal from wastewater liu et al 2020 another method efficient for the as removal from soil and groundwater is coagulation because it does not require pretreatment or preparation of the wastewater and the use of chemicals ge et al 2020 cheng et al 1994 maity et al 2019 only the pre oxidation and ph adjustment are necessary initially e metal based coagulant such as ferric chloride fecl3 is added to the wastewater sancha 2006a the water hydrolyzes fecl3 for forming the fe oh 3 and the arsenite as iii is oxidized to as v arsenate has a negative charge which is adsorbed by the fe oh 3 particles being positively charged finally the sedimentation and filtration processes permit the as remediation sancha 2006b other coagulants used are zirconium iv oxy chloride titanium sulfate titanium iii chloride zirconium iv chloride and titanium iv chloride and titanium iv oxy chloride rathi and kumar 2021 ion exchange is a process in which the ionic species are exchanged by means of the resins solid phase comstock and boyer 2014 francesco et al 2021 the ion exchange process allows obtaining an as concentration below 10 mg l jain and singh 2012 the resins used exhibit high affinity towards as v because they are negatively charged while the as iii is neutral sv et al 2015a therefore the pre oxidation technique is required sv et al 2015b this process is affected by several parameters such as the resin used the concentration of the metalloid the ph of the contaminated water and the presence of other anions i e cl co3 2 so4 2 electro coagulation is an emerging electrochemical technique used to treat potable water urban wastewater wastewater containing pollutants heavy metals and dyes elazzouzi et al 2019 anode and cathode are used and connected to an external power supply in an electro coagulation reactor in the beginning the oxidation occurs to the anode i e aluminum and ferrous electrodes with the generation of metallic cations at the same time the reduction of the water happens with the formation of h2 gas bubbles and hydroxide ions at the cathode sandoval et al 2021a the metallic ions combine with hydroxyl groups to form amorphous metallic hydroxides m oh n in the water which are very good adsorbents for pollutants maity and chen 2021b the m oh n species make chemical bonds with the pollutants forming loc pv and tsa 2017 then the flocs are removed from water by physical processes such as flotation precipitation and filtration sandoval et al 2021b membrane processes used in water treatment are microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro in these processes a pressure difference between the two sides of the membrane is the driving force bruggen et al 2003 dasgupta et al 2015 in these processes the membranes exhibit various pore sizes and can removing pollutants with dimensions from suspended particles mf to monovalent ions ro the characteristics of the pressure driven membrane processes are reported in table 7 low pressure membrane processes do not permit the permeation of arsenic due to its ionic radius 0 24 nm which is much smaller than the pore size range 10 000 1 nm in addition nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes easily remove the arsenic due to the minimal pore size of the membrane concerning its ionic radius mólgora et al 2013 in nf membranes the rejection combines steric donnan dielectric and transport effects the transport of neutral solutes is due to the steric mechanism size based exclusion mechanism the donnan mechanism refers to the equilibrium and the interaction between the charged chemical species and the charge present on the membrane rodrigues et al 2021 the ionizable groups on the surface and in the pores of the membranes generates the charges ernst et al 2000 these chemical species are acids or bases and their dissociations are affected by the solution s phn contact with the membrane ernst et al 2000 the first works on arsenic removal with membranes take place in the 90s waypa et al 1997 urase et al 1998 seidel et al 2004 kang et al 2000 in a paper published in 2002 three different nanofiltrations nf membranes were used and the characteristics and experimental data are reported in table 8 y 2002a in particular the rejection for the as v h2aso4 or haso4 2 is higher than 95 while the trivalent arsenic h3aso3 is very difficult to remove this different behavior of the membranes is due to their negative charge and so can reject the arsenic v existing in monovalent and divalent forms some years later saitua et al used the nf membrane process for as v removal from different model solutions saitúa et al 2005 the nf membrane module used was a thin film composite polyamide membrane 192 nf 300 in a spiral wound configuration produced by osmonic inc and characterized by a molecular weight cut off of 180 da the experimental results evidenced the possibility of removing the as v and the arsenic concentration in the permeate is 5 10 μg l the rejection of as v was between 93 and 99 for an initial arsenic concentration of f 100 and 382 mg l the rejection resulted independent of the feed flow rate temperature and transmembrane pressure the arsenic removal mechanism has been studied using a commercial nf membrane nguyen et al 2009 in particular in this research work a negatively charged polyamide membrane ne 90 manufactured by woongjin chemical south korea with a nominal mwco of 220 da and resistant in the ph range 3 10 the zeta potential measurements on the membrane evidenced an isoelectric at the value of ph 3 3 considering this aspect the experiments were performed in the ph range 5 8 to ensure a negative charge on the membrane surface the experimental results evidenced as the as v and as iii are removed even if the arsenate is more rejected this indicated that both ions experienced the steric exclusion but the arsenate for its negative charge is also subjected to the donnan exclusion mechanism in addition the authors demonstrated that the arsenate removal increased with cl and hco3 being more mobile ions and it decreased with so4 2 due to its low mobility the rejection of as v from the model solution raised from 89 to 96 by enhancing the as v concentration from 20 to 100 μg l in addition the as v removal increased with the ph because the membrane s zeta potential became more hostile increasing the electric exclusion in 2015 akin et al studied the effect of different parameters such as ph and operating pressure on arsenic rejection using the swhr and bw 30 membranes filmtec membranes akin et al 2011 the influence of the feed water ph on the arsenic removal is illustrated in fig 5 the experimental data evidenced as the rejection of the as v and as iii rejection are heavily influenced by the ph of the feed water for the considered membranes swhr and bw 30 membranes as v and as iii are rejected at ph 4 and ph 9 respectively these results are due to the dissociation of the arsenic and arsenous acids at the different ph values see equations 1 4 fischer 1965 1 h 3 a s o 4 h 2 o h 2 a s o 4 h 3 o p k a 1 2 19 2 h 2 a s o 4 h 2 o h a s o 4 2 h 3 o p k a 1 6 94 3 h a s o 4 2 h 2 o a s o 4 3 h 3 o p k a 1 11 50 the rejection of as v and as iii increases with the transmembrane pressure being the driving force in the nf process finally groundwater containing a total arsenic concentration of 62 μg l was treated with the membrane the total arsenic concentration in the permeate was about 2 86 μg l which was lower than who and epa recommendation limit 10 μg l song et al prepared composite membranes with a hollow fiber configuration and a thin active layer in sulfonated poly ether ether ketone speek and a pes uf membranes they are used or the arsenic removal song et al 2015 the coating is permitted to reduce the zeta potential due to the deprotonation of the sulfonate group of speek a water permeability of 11 1 l m2h bar has been obtained and the as v rejection enhanced from 89 to 96 4 by increasing the ph value from 4 to 9 this result is due to the anionic nature of the speek membrane and the different dissociation states of the of as v by varying the ph of the feed solution finally a techno economical evaluation indicated that the treatment cost of groundwater containing arsenic using the proposed speek coated hollow fiber membrane for a plant of 1000 m3 h was about 0 15 us per m3 however further improvement could be obtained by reducing both membrane and pretreatment costs the fouling represents a huge problem in membrane technology because it causes flux decline in time and a decrease of productivity and a rising in energy consumption for the accumulation of organic biological and inorganic constituents on the surface and into the pores of the membranes algieri and drioli 2022 different studies have explored the chemical modification of the membrane to enhance hydrophilicity and improve the antifouling capacity and separation performance kamaludin et al 2022 polysulfone psf is one of the most polymeric materials used to prepare uf membranes even if it does not have a hydrophilic character and surface charges blending the psf with hydrophilic materials permits applying these membranes to remove small dangerous ions as the arsenic in 2017 nayak et al functionalized the polyvinyl chloride pvc with l cysteine cys to obtain a zwitterionic polymer subsequently the cys pvc polymer was blended with psf and tio2 nanoparticles have also been added to enhance the membrane charge further mechanical stability the different composition of all synthesized membranes is reported in table 9 nayak et al 2017a the best permeation performances obtained in the cited study are relative to an applied pressure of 500 kpa with a permeate flux of 35 l m2h the pure water flux decreased with the tio2 amount from 300 mg to 500 mg in addition the composite membranes showed higher arsenic rejection in the ph range investigated from 4 to 9 furthermore for sample a1 the rejection is almost 100 in basic conditions because of the present negative charges provided by the cysteine and tio2 imhof 2002 increased tio2 concentration reduced the rejection for forming clusters in the membrane structure a zwitterionic copolymer p mpc co aema soluble in water has been prepared via free radical polymerization he et al 2018 that presents a zwitterionic segment containing both positively charged ammonium cations and negatively charged phosphate anion and 2 a poly aema segment with amino terminal groups subsequently the co polymer has been incorporated into the polyimide selective layer of a thin film composite membrane via interfacial polymerization the modified membrane has been used for the as removal the prepared membranes exhibited higher water flux and rejection values than those obtained with the pristine membrane in particular the membrane containing 50 co polymer exhibited an as v rejection of 99 8 and water permeability of 8 5 l m2h bar the modified membrane exhibited stable performance for 180 h tanne et al have studied the influence of pore dimension and surface properties of the membranes on the as removal tanne et al 2019 in particular three commercially nf membranes nf90 dow filmtec usa esna1 and esna1 lf2 ld both from nitto denko japan and a non commercially available m 1 origin water china have been used the nf90 membranes displayed the highest rejection values for the arsenate using an arsenate concentration of 70 μg l in the feed water and operating pressure of 5 bar the rejections of arsenate are 91 1 for nf90 86 2 for m 1 and 81 8 for esna1 these results are attributable to the negative surface charge of the membrane being very high for the sample nf90 followed by the m1 and the others however the m 1 sample has been used for the as removal from natural groundwater which is less prone to membrane fouling than nf90 recently pa blended membranes were prepared by varying the chitosan clay nanoparticles c sbf concentrations of 10 50 mg zeeshan et al 2020 the composite membranes exhibited increased hydrophilicity that grew with the chitosan clay content the composite membranes showed higher permeation fluxes than the control due to the presence of the c sbf hydrophilic nanoparticles jabur et al 2016 the modified membranes showed the highest rejection values for the as iii at ph 9 while the lowest rejection has been found in an acidic environment this result is interesting considering that as iii is removed with enormous difficulty by nf and ro membranes being neutral species recently ma and coworkers have fabricated highly electrically conducting ultrafiltration membranes to remove the as iii ma et al 2021 the uf membranes present a hydrophilic nickel coated cnt ni cnt layer deposited on psf membranes that acts as a support the application of cathodic potential to the surface of the membrane considerably determined an increase of the as iii rejection in synthetic and natural tap water r 72 6 5 1 when 7 v has been applied the application of the negative potentials determined an increase of the local ph production of oh ions that determined the transformation of the neutral arsenic species h3aso3 in its ionic forms h2aso3 haso3 2 so these last species are rejected by the negative charges present on the membrane surface in table 10 the application of various membranes for the as removal has been reported this section is evidenced as various nanofiltration membranes some of these commercial and other synthetized exhibited exciting performance in the arsenic removal algieri et al 2021 however a large scale application is still in the early stage for the water flux decrease and membrane degradation owing to the fouling leonzio 2018 electrospinning is an exciting process for preparing nanofiber porous membranes for drinking water production and wastewater purification zhu et al 2021a this process has the advantages of being economical easy to use and high efficient pereao et al 2019a in addition the nanofibers exhibit 3d interconnected pore structure high specific surface area ease of surface functionalization and recycling pereao et al 2019b an electrospinning set up illustrated in fig 6 presents high voltage power supply an electrospinning setup is constituted by a high voltage power source a syringe pump for generating the polymer solution jet a grounded collector a spinneret electrically conductive and a polymer solution the properties of the prepared nanofibers depend on voltage feed rate and air gap processing parameters temperature and humidity environmental parameters sanders et al 2019 and polymer solution parameters concentration solution viscosity polymer s molecular weight and solvent s evaporation medeiros et al 2008 the researchers have focused on developing mixed matrix electrospun nanofibrous membranes enms inorganic fillers dispersed into polymeric nanofibers owing to their improved physico chemical properties and separation performance nanofiber membranes made in polyvinylidene fluoride and loaded with specific adsorbents nanoparticles of titanium dioxide halloysite nanotubes have been used for the removal of as iii from contaminated water moslehyani et al 2020 a maximum amount of as 31 2 mg g has been adsorbed by using a mixed enm loaded with a 0 5 wt of adsorbents in some cases accomplishing consistent removal rates over sustained periods requires a regeneration free process like ion exchange and adsorption it is worth mentioning that these procedures can be slowed down by high salinity and the presence of organic matter this said the treatment choice should consider the ability to eliminate either salinity and organic matter this is why nf ro membranes could well serve many as contaminated waters boussouga et al 2021 recently novel adsorbent mixed matrix membrane consisting of a polycaprolactone matrix with iron intercalated mont morillonite filler has been synthesized peña et al 2021 the prepared fibers had diameters of 212 04 98 48 nm and showed attractive adsorption capacity towards the arsenic from wastewater recently torasso et al have developed electro spun membrane comprising super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles spions loaded in pva nanofibers pva spions torasso et al 2021 the experimental data confirmed a maximum adsorption capacity of 52 5 mg g for the sample containing the 0 14 wt of spions pva spions membrane did not present defects at the microscopic level and it is constituted of crisscrossed bead free nanofibers after the adsorption tests a change in the fiber morphology was detected see fig 7 recently another innovative technology for arsenic removal explored graphene based materials dueto its physical and chemical properties high surface area and structure yoon et al 2017 su et al 2017 la et al 2017 leaper et al demonstrated the possibility to remove arsenic by utilizing electro spun polyvinylidene difluoride membranes loaded with reduced graphene oxide leaper et al 2021 the membrane loaded with an amount of go equal to 2 wt exhibited higher flux than the pure polymer with an as iii rejection of about 99 9 in this field some challenges should be overcome such as the pore size the porosity and the mechanical strength of the enm improvement for ensuring to their large scale production and application 5 membrane fouling membrane fouling represents the main disadvantage of the membrane technology because of determines a flux decrease a permeate deterioration and an increase of the costs due to the increase energy demand chemicals and numerous cleanings mohammad et al 2015 it is caused by the accumulation on the surface and into the membrane pores in particular it determines the deposition of organic colloids proteins polysaccharides etc biologic viruses algae bacteria and other microorganisms and inorganic constituents salts on the membrane and into its porous structure different factors influence the fouling wastewater chemical composition membrane properties and operating conditions for example ph and temperature manawi et al 2016 a possible way to reduce the fouling is the pretreatment of the water before the membrane process to remove most of the foulant usually as membrane processes are chosen microfiltration and ultrafiltration enable the removal of larger pollutant that can clog the membrane used in nf and ro processes abdelkader et al the fouling reduction is obtained utilizing physical and chemical cleaning one of the most used physical cleanings is used during the process of water flushing wu et al 2018 carnevale et al studied the treatment of the olive milling wastewater by dcmd and vmd processes the authors demonstrated that cleaning the membrane with deionized water at 60 c for 15 min permitted a flux recovery up to 92 physical cleaning is used for treating reversible fouling while for irreversible fouling chemical cleaning is required poojamnong et al 2020 the chemical agents used are acid base chelating and surfactants zhao and coworkers studied the effect of three different chemical agents naoh edta and sodium dodecyl sulfate for cleaning hollow fiber membranes used for wastewater treatment zhao et al 2017 they found that cleaning with sds is more efficient than naoh and dta one recently ren et al demonstrated that the separation of monosaccharides and divalent salts by the nf process has improved post chemical cleaning in this study different chemicals were used as h2so4 naoh and naclo and the use of naclo showed a better result regarding membrane regeneration ren et al 2022 hydrophobic membranes are more prone to fouling than hydrophilic ones considering this aspect improving the membrane surface hydrophilicity has been considered an important route to follow fouling mitigation yuan et al 2014 various grafting coating and blending techniques are applied to modify the membrane surface díez and rosal 2020 the grafting permits hydrophilic chains on the membrane surface by forming chemical bonds lee et al 2018 this method is easy to perform and with the possibility to have high chemical stability but at the same time is determined an increase of the membrane cost and it is not accessible to scale up lee et al 2018 wang et al 2018 russo et al 2021 the surface coating is a simple cheap and environmentally friendly method for obtaining a hydrophilic membrane li et al 2014 in addition polymers with high molecular weight are utilized to avoid the penetration of the coating into the membrane pores du et al compared the performance of two membranes a hydrophobic pvdf and pvdf coated with a pva hydrophilic polymer du et al 2018 they demonstrated as hydrophilic coated membrane exhibited better performance for various treatment cycles polymeric materials or inorganic fillers characterized by hydrophilic properties are used s additives during membrane formation to manipulate the membrane properties alenazi et al 2017 in this technique the main drawbacks are the less compatibility between the additives and the polymeric materials and the leaching of the blended materials during long term operations shen et al 2020 asiri et al 2021 usually pvp or peg are added to the polymeric solution to improve the membrane performance malik et al 2019 the prepared membranes exhibit an increased water flux because these two pore forming and so induce a finger cause these twoore forming polymers induce ainger like structure malik et al 2019 in addition different inorganic fillers tio2 mofs zeolite carbon molecular sieve porous silica are added to the polymeric membranes for preparing the mixed matrix membranes malik et al 2019 the fillers modify the polymer free volume by altering the packing of the polymeric chains 6 conclusions the presence of arsenic in groundwater represents a problem for human health worldwide for its high toxicity inorganic as in drinking water causes different cancer types but also cardio vascular pulmonary immunological neurological and endocrine diseases nf membrane process shows high as rejection values and water flux operating at sustained pressure difference values in particular the rejection values obtained using commercial and synthesized nf membranes are very high for the as v however removing the arsenite as iii is complicated meaning low rejection values this different behavior is due to the membrane s negative charges that can reject the arsenic v by existing as monovalent and divalent ions arsenite is a neutral species commercial nf membranes present different drawbacks the most relevant are the fouling the efficiency for long term and the reduced arsenite removal the fouling mitigation is possible by following different ways as the cleaning and physical cleaning wastewater pretreatment and the utilization of more hydrophilic membrane in addition in the last years the researchers have focused on developing the electrospun nanofiber membranes that seem to be very promising for arsenic removal from the groundwater it is due to their 3d interconnected pore structure high specific surface area and ease of surface functionalization and recycling however their production at a large scale and the electrospinning process improvement represents the key drawbacks in this field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11741,besides air water is the most essential and irreplaceable element to ensure the continuance of life according to data only 71 of earth s surface is covered with water 96 5 is present in seas and ocean 1 7 in groundwater and 1 7 in ice and glaciers eventually less than 0 3 of fresh water is available as rivers lakes and precipitates in the atmosphere with the developing technologies and increasing water scarcity humans have started fulfilling water requirements by pumping out groundwater for industrial economic commercial and residential uses for this reason the interconnectivity of groundwater and the surface bodies has been created leading to ease for humans to use groundwater sources however interventions of human activities have impacted groundwater quality globally natural processes like leaching from the soil evapotranspiration weathering of rocks and biological activities of aquatic species are the reasons for the change in water quality these anthropogenic factors like deforestation discharging industrial effluents domestic and commercial sewage deposition aquaculture and mining are all directly or indirectly responsible for groundwater contamination these natural and anthropogenic factors elevated the heavy metal contaminants in water degraded water quality harmed aquatic species and eventually consumption of this water affected human health the economy of industries also became a target of contaminated groundwater this paper gives detailed impacts the world faces due to contaminated water tables and aquifers however in the present scenario controlling these impacts has become a significant challenge one such major challenge was to conserve soil quality and increase the nutrition level of the soil due to its complex composition and geological structure maintenance of groundwater quality and purification of such large scale groundwater has been a concern because of significant investment requirements considering the challenges of groundwater contamination and advanced technology there is a need to develop various potential methods to treat contaminated groundwater also many stakeholders like ngos and private public partnerships will need to adopt management policies for groundwater here there are a few policies and remedial measures discussed in the paper which were implemented by the government and a detailed understanding of how groundwater quality is impacted and the need for innovative techniques to manage deteriorated quality in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords impacts groundwater contamination 1 introduction groundwater is considered the most vital natural asset of water since it holds about 97 of available unfrozen fresh water in the world skevas 2020 european commission 2008 igrac 2017 it is a crucial capital that is not only required for the residential and agricultural purposes but also has a vital role in economic and commercial sectors like extraction industries real estate fishery mining sectors and many more bhatti et al 2020 tyagi et al 2013 arslan et al 2017 based on bhatti et al 2020 bahar and reza 2010 the literature also says that approximately 33 out of 100 people demand groundwater for quenching thirst and various other domestic requirements also to the u s geological survey done in 1984 about 50000 mi3 1 mi3 is equal to 4 km3 is stored in the nation s aquifers within 2500 ft 1 ft equals 0 304 m of the surface and groundwater is available to us in at least small amounts virtually everywhere knox and moody 1991 it has significant importance as sustenance of life and as the financial and economic state for local people living in arid regions all around the globe further discussing the importance of groundwater in dryland agriculture we know that water is a scarce resource in such areas due to inadequate surface water and insufficient irrigation systems farmers depend on canals and wells to pump out the groundwater for agricultural needs darwish et al 2011 aquifers along with groundwater are considered the most generous water supply for the rural population and industries vulnerable to surface water sources it is the most reliable source during droughts and the aquifers are relatively free of contaminants knox and moody 1991 groundwater holds importance not only for society and industries but the research shows that groundwater is also essential for sustaining water dependent ecosystems based on kath and dyer 2017 fan et al 2013 shallow groundwater lies and connects about one third of land surfaces and across these surfaces numerous high valued rivers ponds and floodplains are attached to the aquifers this could further help in the extraction of groundwater kath and dyer 2017 boulton and hancock 2006 if the groundwater level decreases or gets contaminated it directly affects the quality of surface water sources connected to groundwater sources hence groundwater is essential for the socio economic sector and human beings but also helps maintain the proper flora and fauna the inter connection of groundwater to that with the surface water is pertinent for many reasons one such reason is that drinking water sources may depend on the hydrological cycle between groundwater and surface water nevertheless many times along with the nutrients and minerals adequate contaminants may also get transported from the groundwater to surface water sources or vice versa lewandowski et al 2020 henceforth using both resources groundwater and surface water sustainably is reasonably necessary because every action of a human being in this rapidly developing world could become the reason for contamination the complexity of groundwater contamination is increasing day by day in many parts of the globe bhatti et al 2020 yolcubal et al 2016 due to human advancement such as industrial development expansion urbanization and overpopulation bhatti et al 2020 tyagi et al 2013 also due to chemicals road salt germs viruses medicines fertilizers and gasoline can all contribute to contamination compared to surface water contamination groundwater contamination is unseen and more challenging in the present scenario of applied science li et al 2021 macdonald and kavanaugh 1994 contaminant sources in groundwater typically include contaminants like nitrate no3 and arsenic as selck et al 2018 figures of contaminants are continuously growing but they can be roughly categorized into three types i e radioactive biological and chemical these contaminants can originate from both natural and those generated from human activities anthropogenic sources li et al 2021 elumalai et al 2020 familiar natural groundwater contaminant sources include geologic media selck et al 2018 schreiber et al 2003 and geothermal systems selck et al 2018 goodsell et al 2017 mccleskey et al 2010 while contaminants originated from human activities i e anthropogenic contaminant sources include industrial or urban pollution agriculture and mining activities selck et al 2018 garelick et al 2008 heaton et al 2012 rosenstock et al 2014 contaminated property such as abandoned junkyards landfills industrial sites and gasworks sites contributes significantly to groundwater nitrogen levels junkyards landfills are regarded as a significant contributor to pollutants and their effects on groundwater quality have been well documented over a long period wakida and lerner 2005 zanoni 1972 walls 1975 macfarlane et al 1983 reinhard et al 1984 albaiges et al 1986 flyammar 1995 oil fields are also considered a potential source of groundwater contamination furthermore it happens due to oil spills taking place because of disaggregation of supertankers on high seas or the spills taking place on off shore wells during the drilling of petroleum products which often have an immediate and catastrophic influence on groundwater and neighboring ecosystems duffy et al 1980 at present the covid 19 virus has caused a widespread epidemic and has spread to every corner of the globe this coronavirus is chiefly transmitted from body to body by respiratory droplets as it is contagious thus water contaminated by this virus also can be the source of contaminated water threatening the human system li et al 2021 bhowmick et al 2020 lokhandwala and gautam 2020 rapid urbanization has created much pressure on the land and surface water resources so people have now started using groundwater resources to fulfill their daily needs parameswari et al 2012 simone et al 2001 due to this the number of unwanted substances like industrial effluents and domestic waste increased in the groundwater this contamination has affected human health along with this it also deteriorated the environmental quality and socio economic development for instance previous studies have proved that the significant health risk for the human population is due to complex metal content in water and the other organic pollutants from agricultural fields li et al 2021 wu et al 2020 a large number of agricultural lands have been degraded due to contamination of groundwater toxic metal contaminants and soluble salts accumulate in the vegetation s root zone and affect crop quality moreover surface water quality is degraded due to the transportation of contaminants from aquifers to the related surface water bodies li et al 2021 teng et al 2018 one such consequence led by the groundwater contamination that has hindered the development of the society is the cost of cleaning the contaminants of groundwater to reuse it often local government is responsible for taking remedial actions to clean groundwater contaminants because those polluters are not identified or found legally liable william page1 and rabinowitz 1993 over exploitation of groundwater resources causes three significant negative impacts they are 1 the quality of groundwater gets deteriorates giannoccaro et al 2017 zeitouni and dinar 1997 and 2 it also affects the ecosystem of groundwater due to lower levels of groundwater and harmful contaminants giannoccaro et al 2017 esteban and albiac 2011 and 3 cost of extracting groundwater got increased as levels got lowered down giannoccaro et al 2017 so contamination of groundwater has left no stone unturned it damaged human health and impacted an area s socio and economic development also the agricultural lands and crops were affected by contaminated groundwater adding to this the ecosystem is also equally affected according to esteban and albiac 2011 scheffer et al 2001 sometimes the ecosystem may suddenly change between two alternative states is said to be regime shifts many times if groundwater contamination is at a low extent then the ecosystem may show gradual change however as soon as the contamination level increases there is a drastic change in the ecosystem and sometimes it may even collapse the linked ecosystem then in such cases restoration of good quality and increasing groundwater levels could not even lead to the recovery of the previously flourished ecosystem esteban and albiac 2011 groundwater is a diminishing resource and groundwater contamination and its impacts have become a global concern groundwater levels are declining due to increasing population urban growth and industrialization groundwater is readily available and easy to extract which results in numerous consequences supply crises triggered by shocks to supply systems that are losing their resilience will be the foreseeable surprise when the water ran out in the past communities suffered and they will continue to do so schwartz and ibaraki 2011 it is highly desirable to educate the local farmers about the water requirements of plants and the potential harm that over irrigation may cause ali al ali al ibrahim 1991 the need of the hour is to increase the awareness and education related to groundwater mukherji and shah 2005 there should be proper laws regulating groundwater use by modern technologies like geographic information system gis and artificial intelligence ai the use of groundwater and its advantages have profoundly influenced humanity and it is very accurate that groundwater provided numerous employment opportunities and a significant increase in crop yields as groundwater is a limited resource our main aim should be sustainable use of groundwater without exceeding its natural formation limits mukherji and shah 2005 2 classification of groundwater contaminants today the world is facing a significant challenge to use the resources in a fair sustainable way such that it does not affect the environment one such challenge is the decreased levels of groundwater and the increasing levels of its contaminants due to the world s rapid evolution this problem gave researchers a better chance to study the aquifers and the sources which led to their contamination broadly the groundwater contamination sources can be categorized as shown below each category has a broad area and subdivisions which becomes a cause for groundwater contamination fig 1 2 1 agricultural contaminants in the past few decades as the population rate increased there was an urgent need to develop agricultural technology to meet the demand for food so the efficiency of production and nutrient level was increased by using many chemical fertilizers savci 2012 however these fertilizers are mostly ammonia and nitrate based which may degrade groundwater quality for long term uses nitrogen content in groundwater and aquifers comes from many sources but the main reason is chemical fertilizers and pesticides used in agricultural fields giraldez and fox 1995 usda 1987 conservation council 1987 this nitrate content in the fields is due to the overuse of pesticides and microbial contamination when the excessive nitrogen compounds in fertilizers get oxidized in the soil they convert into soluble nitrates this content gets leached into the roots and enters the unconfined aquifers hence shallow water tables are likely to be affected by nitrate contamination mahvi et al 2005 precise cutting is also one such agricultural activity that disturbs the hydrological regime and decreases the groundwater recharge it also erodes the land and causes high turbidity in the rivers adding to this it also destroys the perennial streams and rivers this causes health issues in the community due to the loss of potable water in the region wastewater management a un water analytical brief groundwater also gets contaminated indirectly due to the feedlot and animal corrals when surface water gets contaminated by the microorganisms and other veterinary drugs they indirectly get transported to the attached groundwater sources and henceforth lead to quality degradation also the lower metal content in the urine and feces of animals gets accumulated in the surface water this further passes on to the groundwater and contaminates it with metal content especially nitrates and excess salts 2 2 commercial contaminants initially we discussed all agricultural sources of contaminants keeping our views on commercial activities many sources of contamination are associated with human activities like disposal practices and leaking sewerage systems also the leakages in waste dumping sites and accidental oil spills in pipelines and gas stations becomes a reason for contamination schmoll world health organization 2006 due to the development of industries and rapid growth in urbanization there is a significant shortage of lands to bury and dump the waste generated in any area as a result the municipalities illegally dispose of them in water bodies which causes surface water pollution a significant amount of this waste then runoffs or seeps into the topmost aquifer degrading groundwater quality sangodoyin 1993 reible et al 1990 furthermore rural and urban sewage may contain human and animal feces the vital source of coliform bacteria once this sewage seeps into water tables the bacteria start breeding more and more due to the availability of fresh groundwater streams this further led to microbial contamination of groundwater such conditions cause eutrophication and increase nitrogen content reducing water has dissolved oxygen levels khatri and tyagi 2015 us epa 1990 smith and schindler 2009 another anthropogenic source of groundwater contamination is accidental oil spills in pipelines and gas stations it is a significant contaminant as it causes inevitable threats to the ecosystem and humans even if less oil or gas leaks out duffy et al 1980 both the accidental cases of oil tankers and leakages in underground oil pipelines are equally responsible for degrading underground water and polluting soil content initially the oil spreads on the upper layer of soil then based on the chemical nature of oil and the absorbing capacity the oil penetrates the soil and forms the layer on top of the water vanloocke et al 1975 bartz and käss 1972 due to this action the groundwater no longer remains portable and becomes unfit for industrial use 2 3 industrial contaminants the emission of pollutants produced by various sectors has a noticeable impact on the environment water pollution has drawn considerable attention as one of the most urgent environmental issues due to its specific vulnerability to contamination saravanan et al 2021 diverse sources that have led to groundwater contamination and water quality deterioration include mining operations production toxic hazardous spills and septage lagoons and sludge sites in gold mines of west african countries like ghana it is estimated that about 5 tones of mercury are liberated also sulfide oxidation occurs due to groundwater s ph lowering increasing the mobility of trace and concentration metals in water bodies bhattacharya et al 2012 kortatsi 2004 hilson 2001 crude oil spill is a significant issue and likely to cause while drilling offshore transportation and transfer to onshore a significant source of oil pollution in water is oil spills which are caused by 13 by transportation oil spills saravanan et al 2021 ali et al 2020 niu et al 2020 also the production of petroleum products is the causal agent of toxic effluents discharged into the water bodies sayed et al 2021 long term application of sludge on land causes an increase in the electrical conductivity and concentration of nitrate and ammonia in the aquifers beneath the sludge sites which affect aquatic life as well as the life of humans higg ns n d 2 4 radioactive contaminants natural pollutants or human activities may be the reason for the phenomena of contamination in groundwater the current radioactive materials found in groundwater are by and significant uranium radon and radium the most important source of groundwater contamination is radioactivity through nuclear power plants and various nuclear devices the main elements used for this purpose are radium uranium and thorium klasson et al n d radioactive pollutants in groundwater can come from natural radionuclide deposits but they can also come from anthropogenic sources including nuclear power plant waste nuclear weapons testing and inappropriate medical radioisotope disposal dahlgaard et al 2004 lytle et al 2014 huang et al 2012 radioactive elements enter the human body mainly through drinking water studies have found high levels of nitrates fluorides and organic metals in the human body wu et al 2020 groundwater pollution can also impact human health by impacting the food chain for production irrigation with heavy metal contaminated groundwater and wastewater containing persistent pollutants can cause hazardous substances to accumulate in grains and vegetables and causes serious health problems in human beings jenifer and jha 2018 yuan et al 2019 njuguna et al 2019 li et al 2021 3 impacts of groundwater contamination moving ahead with the primary objective of the paper now the impacts of the groundwater are described for the different areas globally it gives detailed knowledge about the contamination sources in the study area the number of contaminants present in aquifers and what the government took appropriate measures to protect and manage groundwater quality from getting deteriorated these impacts are categorized into two different sectors they are 1 impacts of groundwater contamination on nature and ecosystem 2 impacts of groundwater contamination on socio economic sector 3 1 impacts of groundwater contamination on nature and ecosystem as the contaminants can be classified in many different ways the impacts of groundwater contamination are observed in many different sectors there is no such area that is not affected by the degradation of groundwater each sector is affected by the degraded groundwater from soil to the ecosystem and from humans to industries now briefly discuss the impacts of groundwater contamination on nature and the ecosystem in different global areas and how government initiatives helped increase groundwater quality usually contaminants are from the agricultural sectors due to the over exploitative use of fertilizers and excessive irrigation of fields in the thrust of best productivity in the end it degrades the quality of water tables due to the percolation of chemicals like nitrates and phosphorous in the soil it affects the soil quality the animal species of aquifers and the surface water which are interconnected to deep shallow aquifers below are the different areas worldwide that face the problems due to contaminated water and preventive measures taken to conserve groundwater and surface water nebraska the highly irrigated and densely cultivated farmland of the u s had been using agricultural chemicals to the crops for maximum prices and better yield through the developed irrigation systems since the 1960s later in 2008 a paper poor 2000 was published which gave a briefing about the valuation method to determine the number of chemicals used in fields and the need to stop the use due to significant contamination results due to potential environmental hazards as human health also awareness was created about implementing sustainable technology to improve environmental quality according to the reports poor 2000 u s bureau of census 1994 nebraska has 19 2 million acres of cultivated land of which 31 were irrigated farmlands the major drawback in this area was the lack of training and knowledge of specialized chemical equipment which led to the accidental discharge of chemicals in water bodies due to these reasons both the surface run off and the water tables and aquifers got contaminated chemigation producers of nebraska faced a challenge in maintaining water quality they were concerned about the impacts of chemicals and had to produce the maximum profitable agricultural products later the welfare measures were taken which stated that the producers with more chemigation experience and those near the area where contamination rates are high due to agriculture have to pay more than those producers who contribute less to contamination in this manner the water pollution rates were lowered down according to the study by chatterjee et al 2017 arsenic content in groundwater is a significant issue in bengal delta plain the presence of arsenic is influenced mainly by the local land use patterns like agricultural practices sanitation and surface water source and due to this there is a heterogeneous distribution of arsenic in water tables this affected the quality of crops grown in west bengal and bangladesh due to the high amount of arsenic contamination in aquifers agricultural productivity and soil conditions have drawn significant attention samples of groundwater and potable water were taken from the nadia district of west bengal to carry out the hydro geochemical screening which gave out the worst and the patchiest distribution of arsenic in water the as content level was far more than the normed national drinking water standards and the concentration was more than the who guided value hence the study explained the as distribution and the reasons for contamination as well as the dire need to take significant steps for the change in agricultural practice and recreating the soil quality free from arsenic in the study area arslan et al 2017 shows the assessment carried out to check the contamination of heavy metal in shallow and deep aquifers and surface water the heavy metal pollution index hpi is explained for the northern develi closed basin sample in turkey the study was undertaken for dry and wet seasons for both seasons more than half of the sample had a high amount of as b and fe contamination this basin has no industrial or mining areas but all of this contamination is caused only due to geogenic reasons because of erciyes volcanism which emits toxic metal products this surface water toxicity harmed the soil quality and degraded the groundwater sources and aquifers also the rocks formed after the cooling down of magma in the later stages of erciyes volcanism dissolve and seep into groundwater this degrades the soil by perforating heavy metals from the ground so to step up for good cultivation the turkish government needed to find ways to control these geogenic sources of heavy metals in water bodies and measures to bring down the value of hpi in north italy one of the agricultural areas of albenga coastal plain was vulnerably affected by groundwater contamination according to the data from bartzas et al 2015 groundwater constitutes about 72 of the total water supplied for irrigation pesticide chemicals and nitrates are the most common non point sources of contaminants found in alluvial aquifers in this study area alluvial aquifers contain nitrates for several reasons including shallow water levels highly permeable deposits of alluvial and connections between freshwater sources and agricultural land use that usually occurs on flood plain terraces with river and seawater intrusion due to excessive pumping of groundwater for irrigating fields two accurate approaches were made to check the vulnerability of groundwater contamination susceptibility index s i and pesticide drastic methods which showed the high risk of contamination these vulnerability maps helped policymakers prioritize the importance of groundwater management and protection policies in this study area where intensive agricultural activities were carried on the groundwater ecosystem is considered to be an essential part of biodiversity however these ecosystems are poorly understood because of their diversification as the contaminants are harming aquifer ecosystems one such place of study in australia for which humphreys n d gave a particular study about the fauna of groundwater ecosystem in australia and how their population was impacted due to contaminated water tables many areas in australia have the biodiversity hot spots of stygofauna species humphreys 2001 boulton et al submitted however over the past decade anthropogenic activities like mining of minerals dewatering operation due to civil projects and many more have become an issue for stygofauna species and proved detrimental the effect of these activities depended on the rate of dewatering operation and the spread of biodiversity in the water table these activities created a concern for the stygal population in western australia aquifers humphreys 2001 playford 2001 moreover human activities like pumping groundwater at high rates decreased groundwater flow velocity and reduced the flux of oxygen and dissolved organic carbon doc in the downstream aquifers various studies showed that stygofauna are extremely sensitive to environmental changes and their diversity can be used to detect various types of contaminations of heavy metal and sewage waste in aquifers on this basis humphreys n d malard et al 1996 suggested that such biological indicators should be used to test the groundwater rather than using hydrodynamic data and on this basis management and protection programs of groundwater should be the central area of focus increasing demand for water for the industrial expansion and the necessity to fulfill the thrust of a growing population in china s most important region north china plain ncp has led to the overexploitation of surface and groundwater sources ncp region produces 1 4th of the country s total grain yield which is china s most demanding agricultural region the main objective of the study done by changming et al 2001 was to find out the main reasons for exploitation which were known to be increased pumping rates and the decline in water tables and a sharp decrease in both shallow and deep aquifers in the hebei plain which is the most cultivated area of china these all reasons led to overexploitation of water sources and also the groundwater became the default source of irrigation where the surface water bodies dried up also the loss of hydraulic pressure from the sub surfaces due to depletion of groundwater led to land subsidence and the water quality degraded these problems can be overcome by increasing the management policies of groundwater in the entire area and imposing a water price policy to decrease water withdrawal moreover it increases water supply by adapting the purification techniques and reducing wastewater the problem of high fluoride content in water resources is a significant concern among all the contaminants because of its toxicological and geo environmental concerns fluoride containing minerals in the rocks and soil seep into the water table and are the primary source of fluoride in groundwater moreover the weathering and leaching of soil are also crucial in deciding the amount of fluoride in water in india many states are prone to fluoride content in drinking water one such study was done on rajasthan described in thesai n d which gives a briefing about the impacts of fluoride on animals due to contaminated water the drinking water of northern rajasthan is highly contaminated by fluoride according to the study of 54 samples from different villages almost all the samples had fluoride content more than the maximum value set up by who this affected not only humans but also animals in rajasthan in many domesticated animals fluorosis was observed fluorosis affects animals giving symptoms like crooked legs dental fluorosis hyperostosis hoof deformities and decreased bone resorption thesai n d krook 2006 herbivores animals were also affected by fluorosis using dairy products on these animals affects the health of humans as well later on due to increased concern many defluoridation techniques were adopted to reduce the excess fluoride content below the permitted level those techniques included dialysis membrane processes and electrocoagulation and were successful due to economic viability one of the unknown significant problems that are never considered is the spread of leachates to the soil surface and groundwater aquifers for a similar reason one of the ex landfill sites of malaysia named taman beringin was investigated for the contamination of leachates and a few essential points were concluded from the study according to atta et al 2015 many parameters like ph value of water temperature different chemical properties and other heavy metal concentrations were used to detect leachate contamination in water samples the results showed that the groundwater beneath this landfill was highly contaminated with heavy and organic metals and the results and statistics showed an increase in contaminants in future years in malaysia levels of contaminants like nh3 n cl f pb ni and fe were more than the stipulated level set by malaysia it was a risk for the habitats because this water flowed into rivers and this contaminated groundwater was pumped for domestic use for this reason the rivers of malaysia also got contaminated with leachates so malaysia needed to decrease the leachate contamination and its impact on the surrounding environment the rapid development of agriculture since 1950 led to increased loss of nitrogen in agricultural land and an increase in nitrogen content of groundwater in the sandy soil of east and south boersb et al 1998 fraters et al 1997 as described in boersb et al 1998 the main reason for this loss of nitrogen in soil and increase in nitrogen content in aquifers is because of more input of fertilizers and chemical manure for good yield and to harvest better nitrogen output products the objective was to determine the present scenario in the netherlands regarding the nitrogen surpluses in fields and nitrate contamination study the model prepared by the dutch government for the protection of aquifers and implement different policies of the nutrient accounting programs when the samples from east and south netherlands were tested it was observed that the nitrogen content of only peat soils was low because of denitrification actions in contrast in other fields the nitrate concentration in groundwater was much higher than the accepted values the samples also concluded that the loss of nitrogen and phosphorous from the agricultural fields led to the exceeding nitrate values in water tables and other environmental issues of soil fertility boersb et al 1998 brouwer hellegers 1997 so the netherland government gave warnings regarding contamination issues to the local and commercial farmers and later accounting system minas minerals accounting system was implemented this policy led to a decrease in nitrogen input in fields also fertilizer use was expected to decrease by 50 which will help reduce nitrate content in shallow waters and surface water bodies this policy aimed to implement levy free nitrogen surpluses in farmlands these all implementations gave a drastic decrease leaching of nitrate from agriculture over the decades one of the states of the u s named oregon has many clusters of groundwater dependent ecosystem gde in its watersheds region known as gde clusters assessment brown et al 2011 shows that groundwater contamination affected 30 of the gde cluster by nitrate concentration 30 by industrial chemicals and 40 by pesticides in agriculture the assessment of the entire water tables of oregon was done based on the flow of groundwater which sustains the ecosystems and the risks of human activities groundwater contamination which was mapped proper evaluation of human activities in this area is necessary to save the groundwater ecosystems from the threats of pesticides and chemicals like metribuzin and carbofuran present in water tables due to agricultural activities moreover a groundwater program has been mandated in this state to protect the quality of water and decrease the chances of eutrophication due to phosphorous which harmed the aquatic ecosystem in deep aquifers for decades brown et al 2011 carpenter et al 1998 this assessment of gdes shows the level of contamination of water tables and eventually showed the ecological importance of groundwater and the necessity of protection and management policies to save gdes in oregon which is considered the main component of the ecosystem and biodiversity in the thrust of better yield and good productivity of crops the soil quality has largely been impacted to study these impacts and find the appropriate solution and management policies four soil samples were tested from the region of sub humid bekaa plain of lebanon east mediterranean around 21 samples of groundwater were observed for contaminations according to the study darwish et al 2011 bouwer 2000 möller et al 2003 mahvi et al 2005 ju et al 2006 intensive agricultural practices and improper use of fertilizers were primary nitrogen contaminants in groundwater and surface water the movement of nitrate compounds can be estimated based on the texture and permeability of the soil in clayey soil the water percolates slowly to the water tables and also the pores lack oxygen amount and it favors denitrification hence the region of lebanon east mediterranean which has clayey soil has less nitrate contamination darwish et al 2011 strong and fillery 2002 but places with the preferential flow of water along with soil cracks and high oxygen interaction showed a high level of nitrate contaminations darwish et al 2011 oostindie and bronswijk 1995 this overuse of fertilizers led to the nitrogen build up in the soil groundwater continuum one more significant and indirect impact was the eutrophication of freshwater sources due to excess phosphorous in the groundwater connected to surface streams this also led to a lack of dissolved oxygen for the aquatic species of surface water after increasing complexity the lebanon east government started management programs and also brought a change in cropping patterns moreover the primary implementation was the rotation of crops and growing crops that absorb the nitrogen from the soil and do not allow percolation of nitrogen in water tables optimizing the nitrogen and phosphorous based fertilizers and managing the environmental protection laws were the main aim for increasing groundwater quality later on the salinity of the soil was managed and in this manner the contamination was reduced as mentioned in table 1 higher arsenic concentrations in the bengal delta of bangladesh and india are due to the desorption of as bearing minerals and alluvial sediments these are considered the geogenic sources of contamination and naturally lead to increased contamination below fig 2 is the illustration of how arsenic from the origin gets transported to the groundwater in the sedimentary basins of the bengal delta after studying the different areas across the globe and observing the contaminants and their sources a few points can be concluded on the bases of the study this includes the overuse and over exploitation of fertilizers and chemical products are the primary sources of contamination this indirectly states that agricultural practices are the main reason for the contamination of water tables and in all its impacts are also observed on cropping patterns only also in industrial places the high contaminations are because by effluents and discharging toxic slurries to the surrounding due to all these heavy metals leachates oil and hydrocarbon the overall impact is caused on soil quality and the life of lotic organisms this affects the yield and productivity of crops and damages the ecosystem moreover consuming such products with heavy metal content affects human health so eventually humans have been affected due to the exploitation of nature 3 2 socio economic impacts groundwater contamination has led to various socio economic impacts and costs of around 330 per household various samples were collected from different study areas and impacts were evaluated out of which some lead to the society at risk of chronic disease in contrast some lead to a dip in property values using contaminated groundwater has led to diseases like dental fluorosis arsenicosis infectious intestinal disease and bone problems below are a few brief case studies to examine the impacts of contaminated water krishnan indu n d carried out a study of contaminated groundwater due to fluorine and arsenic concentration in gujarat the main aim of the research work was to evaluate social health and economic impacts the study was conducted in 25 villages of north gujarat and it was found that 16 were suffering from at least one disease of fluorosis and 36 were suffering from dental fluorosis thus the above values depict that the groundwater of those 25 villages can be used for industrial and agricultural use but not for drinking purposes walker and hoehn 1990 evaluated groundwater contamination due to nitrates in the rural areas of michigan united states the main aim of the research work was to estimate the economic damages of contaminated groundwater the survey found that 34 of the households in southern michigan exceeded the contamination level of nitrates in groundwater nitrate contamination causes an economic burden of around 330 per household it was found that when the level of contamination increases the end user incurs the damage or the loss nahar 2009 carried out an assessment of degraded groundwater in the northwest regions of bangladesh the main objective of the research work was to assess the concentration of arsenic and the societal impacts of contamination after surveying it was found that there was a deep rooted stereotype among people of bangladesh which socially impacted mental health people were unwilling to marry those suffering from arsenicosis this study shows that contaminated groundwater affects not only health issues but also the environment and creates social issues william page1 and rabinowitz 1993 carried out the analysis of the effects of contaminated groundwater on property values and cities in the united states the study found that the presence of toxic chemicals in groundwater resulted in decreased property value in the property markets contaminated lands are also declared as temporarily abandoned sites the economic cost of cleaning contaminated land varies from 30 million to 40 million it causes severe financial problems and moral dilemmas in institutions hussain et al 2021 evaluated groundwater quality and its impact on human health in the swabi region of pakistan the main of the study was to assess the human health impacts of groundwater contaminated by industrial wastewater 86 samples were collected from gadoon amazai industrial estate various parameters include chemical oxygen demand cod hardness ph and suspension total dissolved solids were analyzed and it was found that the concentration of elements such as cr cd pb cu fe mg na ca and k exceeded the acceptable levels the study found that health problems in nearby areas were due to contaminated drinking water scholz 2012 carried out implications of contaminated groundwater for commercial and industrial land concerns in silicon valley united states the paper s main aim was to provide an overview of economic costs and fluctuating land prices due to hazardous groundwater the study found that either the property s sale is being terminated or the property value is reduced significantly causing a loss of 400 000 for its clean up it was found that there will be no safe land for future housing and that will have to spend millions of dollars on clean up efforts baba and tayfur 2011 carried out implications of polluted groundwater in the city of izmir turkey the study s main aim was to assess health impacts due to deteriorated groundwater quality in the city of izmir it was found that the ph value ranges between 6 87 and 7 8 and increases dissolved oxygen level ranges from 0 48 to 2 38 mg l health impacts such as infectious intestinal disease and dental and bone problems were noticed high iron zinc sodium magnesium and calcium concentrations were found in groundwater thus increasing public awareness of and value and vulnerability of aquifers in turkey is required parameswari et al 2012 evaluated the interdisciplinary approach and its impacts due to contaminated groundwater in tamil nadu india the main aim of the research work was to determine the socio economic impacts of groundwater contamination due to solid waste dumping sites from leachate characterization it was found that the value of tds ranged from 470 to 2990 mg l due to which various health impacts such as respiratory cardiovascular disease and cancer are found the result showed a significant impact on socio economic and educational status li et al 2017 carried out research on the deteriorated quality of groundwater in china the main aim of the research work was to determine impacts on groundwater due to economic and anthropogenic activities it was found that 18 of the wells are filled with degraded groundwater which will lead to the demand for new administrative policies and better hydro economics the need of the hour is to make people aware of groundwater quality protection adimalla et al 2019 carried out a study on tarnished groundwater due to nitrate and fluoride concentration in nirmal province south india the study s main aim was to assess fluoride and nitrate content on human health due to groundwater contamination 34 samples of groundwater were collected and found that fluoride and nitrate content were relatively higher than the acceptable level of the bureau of indian standards and hazards of non carcinogenic disease were observed the study shows that serious health problems were noticed and necessary steps should be taken to protect future generations from health hazards rahman et al 2009 the implications of arsenic groundwater contamination in southeast asian regions cambodia myanmar nepal taiwan and vietnam the main of the paper is to evaluate the number of people at risk due to arsenic contamination of groundwater the study found that in cambodia the level of arsenic as content is 1 1610 μg l in myanmar the level of arsenic as content is above 50 μg l and in nepal the level of arsenic as content is 2620 μg l in taiwan the level of arsenic as content is less than 0 15 3590 μg l and in vietnam the level of arsenic as content is 1 3050 μg l diseases like leprosy or skin disease were found and societal problems like exclusion from society were there thus various prevention techniques like phytoremediation can be used to eradicate arsenic contamination enrichment of fluorine in groundwater is due to geogenic sources this includes the interaction of bedrock rich in fluorine fig 3 it also depends on the factors like hydrochemistry dynamics of groundwater and environmental factors like volcanic eruptions various hydrogeochemical processes involved in the enrichment of f in groundwater are absorption desorption evaporation and dissolution precipitation leaching of f bearing minerals lithology and geological condition of aquifers play an essential role in enriching fluorine in groundwater wang et al 2021b wenzel and blum 1992 a schematic of fluorine enrichment through geogenic reason is shown below groundwater plays a vital role in fulfilling the freshwater requirements of all the living creatures on the earth due to the continuous impact of human activities such as deforestation continuous erosion excessive use of insecticides and fertilizers effluents from industries and source of contamination has led to contamination of groundwater decrease in groundwater levels the deeper the level of groundwater difficult it becomes to extract the groundwater for the people it requires enormous investments economic cost and infrastructure advanced technologies the need of the hour is the participation of the people and awareness among the people regarding groundwater contamination and conservation table 2 so to achieve sustainability and conserve groundwater quality it is necessary to decrease the excessive use of chemical products implement sustainable agricultural practices and encourage organic farming moreover proper management of solid waste is essential to protect our ecosystem 4 challenges groundwater is majorly polluted by anthropogenic sources hydrocarbons and natural compounds nitrate and arsenic which become a challenge due to a lack of technological advancement cecconet et al 2020 one of the essential freshwater sources is deteriorated due to increasing population and economic development like industrialization and urbanization ojha et al 2014 due to a lack of irrigational efficiency lack of technical assistance and knowledge of usage of irrigational facilities to the farmers groundwater use has increased for agricultural purposes and has become very difficult to monitor due to the increase in sea level there is the intrusion of saline water in groundwater aquifers leading to deteriorated soil quality ultimately resulting in decreased nutrition in the crops crop failure droughts and loss of livelihood of the farmers the pre eminent cause of saline water pollution is influenced by the dynamics of seawater and static fossil groundwater this phenomenon occurs in the interface between saline water i e seawater and groundwater where saline water diffusion occurs into fresh fossil water the primary cause of saline water intrusion is the over pumping of groundwater leading to saline water pollution and land subsidence purnama and marfai 2012 an increase in groundwater salinity results in various ions such as chloride sodium and sulfate ions purnama and marfai 2012 abdel aal et al 1996 the straightforward mechanism underlying saline water intrusion is that when the surface water level drops the nearby groundwater level also drops as a result saline seawater intrusion occurs through lateral channels mokhlesur rahman et al 2000 in agrarian countries like india it is challenging to monitor the number of wells and lack of logistics resulting in exploitative groundwater usage lall et al 2020 exploitative usage of groundwater results in side effects like increased pumping cost land degradation land subsidence loss of soil fertility and desertification hiscock 2011 increasing industrialization and urbanization lead to massive deforestation causing erosion and decreased groundwater aquifers decreased groundwater level leads to social and economic tensions regarding groundwater usage hiscock 2011 the intervention of human activities led to groundwater quality research being more complex time consuming and costly groundwater maintenance is a long term task associated with great uncertainty and professional and technical personnel requirement for groundwater quality research work groundwater management also requires data sharing cooperation and advanced technologies li 2016 untimely environmental impact assessment and careless actions maximize the final cost and damage even the developed countries face significant challenges in the maintenance of groundwater due to a lack of innovation in groundwater research and technology weber et al 2008 once the groundwater is polluted it becomes a challenging task to purify it on a large scale due to geological structures and compositions leading to increased investment and a lack of financial capacity to purify the groundwater 5 innovative techniques and way ahead groundwater will play a crucial role in maintaining the freshwater resource and will require administrative efficiency investments and an interdisciplinary approach through biomonitoring the groundwater by novel microbiological approaches mösslacher and notenboom 1999 different technical treatments have been put forward for groundwater remediation these treatments use physical biological or chemical methods to remove contaminants few of such are briefly discussed which includes bio electrochemical system bes is a versatile and promising technology that helps remove nitrates and hydrocarbons increasing advancements in technologies have led to the development of potential treatment of contaminated groundwater through bio electrochemical systems bes which is a treatment method used for the removal of hydrocarbons such as toluene phenanthrene benzene btex and light pahs nitrates cecconet et al 2020 these happen due to the interaction of microbial metabolism with poised electrodes and the effect of bes s electric field the physical migration of nitrate and hydrocarbon impurities occurs cecconet et al 2020 besides bes many remedial techniques can be implemented like bioaugmentation cecconet et al 2020 lyon et al 2013 permeable reactive barriers cecconet et al 2020 obiri nyarko et al 2014 but on the other side there are several drawbacks for these techniques like the necessity to add chemicals which adds to the cost of remediation also strong dependency on the site characteristics limits the use of techniques bes application for in situ remediation does not involve the addition of chemicals and so is highly advantageous due to environmental sustainability fig 4 eventually this aspect becomes relevant when bess compared with other technologies where the supply of electron donors acceptors and addition of chemicals is an operational condition research in this field has shown excellent denitrification and hydrocarbon removal results due to the interaction of microbial metabolism and poised electrodes in bioelectric remediation systems this technique is still under research to shift focus toward interacting with more than one contaminant and finding ways to estimate power consumption for this remediation also the use of biosensors has become an emerging topic of investigation such investigations can develop a reliable technique for groundwater remediation shortly cecconet et al 2020 the removal of trichloroethylene tce from the groundwater can be done through nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi which is a remediation technique to transfer the contaminants from one phase to another sharma et al 2020 the nanoscale zero valent iron technique has proved propitious for groundwater remediation at the source itself the significant advantage of this method is that the water is remediated at the contaminated sources and a large variety of contaminants can be treated for example trichloroethylene in this technique of groundwater remediation particles of iron are manufactured through the milling process the nzvi is mainly produced from fe 0 ions from the solution of fe 2 with the help of potent reducing agents the particles produced are reduced to a micrometer or nanometre scale the reactivity conditions for nzvi are that for short term treatment the reactivity should be high and for treatments lasting for two to three months the reactivity should be sufficiently high köber et al 2014 this technique is mainly efficient for treating perchloroethylene as it dechlorinates the halogenated compounds crampon et al 2019 ceramic filter module pilot plant units are used for groundwater remediation and wastewater treatment in residential areas this plant is specially designed to remove the inorganic forms of arsenic mainly as v and as iii present in groundwater koley 2021 hanh et al 2010 scanlon et al 2009 scudlark and church 1988 generally in remote rural areas arsenic treatment plants atus are installed to treat pumped groundwater and use this treated water to remove this toxic arsenic the atus follow the chemical principles like ion exchange membrane based process dominguez ramos et al 2014 usepa 2003 coagulation jekel and seith 2000 kobya et al 2020 kumar et al 2004 pokhrel et al 2005 adsorption kango kumar 2016 lunge et al 2014 nikolaidis et al 2003 uddin and jeong 2020 followed by filtration few advanced remediations consist of phytoremediation and bioremediation dadwal and mishra 2017 gogoi et al 2017 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 kumari et al 2019 maity et al 2021 rahman et al 2014 tsai et al 2009 in which the water treatment media are minerals of iron and aluminum due to their higher co precipitation affinity for arsenic the arsenic removal plants installed have a unique cementitious sealed separation bed with filter units these beds are kept open during the daytime for proper aeration so that toxic arsenic species get stabilized rapidly also the oxidized iron arsenic complexes get retained in the filters leading to groundwater purification for domestic use also the wastewater is treated in the plant where the sludge is formed and sent to the sludge separation bed then the filtered water is re circulated to the media for retreatment and recycling koley 2021 it has been a widely used method due to its economic benefits and ease of installation koley 2021 basu et al 2015 kabir and chowdhury 2017 odling et al 2020 singh 2017 therefore extracting groundwater for treatment and drinking water supply using economical atus has become necessary to relieve remote masses at risk hence future efforts in arsenic mitigation strategies should attempt to assess more such treatment plants using filtration and adsorption processes implementing a rainwater harvesting system in every field will recharge the groundwater and reduce the fluorine concentration in the groundwater aravinthasamy et al 2020 there should be an integrated detailed and transparent approach for waste disposal from the polluting industries influx of the chemicals through the usage of fertilizers and risk management strategies for the groundwater weber et al 2008 groundwater resource management will require participation from stakeholders like public private partnerships ngos political will and commitments toward the sustainable management of groundwater resources hiscock 2011 government should play an active role in tackling the problems related to groundwater and groundwater contamination and the remedial measures by collecting appropriate data and by establishing the central data management system shrestha et al 2003 in the saturated and unsaturated zones by using the multiple tracer analysis and sophisticated technologies at individual sites böhlke 2002 groundwater resources will require a better understanding of quality and quantity recharge and timely monitoring hiscock 2011 although it may not be optimal to adopt the management policies and remediations measures successfully implemented by the developed countries to the economically poor and developing countries it is necessary to use different approaches to mitigate different types of contaminants in areas with different soil characteristics and climatic conditions these natural factors greatly influence the mechanism and extent of contaminant transport 6 conclusion as far as health and the economy are concerned the quality of groundwater and surface water is considered to be the most sensitive issue globally it is high time for us to understand that contamination of these resources should be prevented controlled and reduced looking at the complete paper no such place is present in the world that does not face the issue of groundwater contamination eventually no such sector is unaffected due to this contamination soil quality human health biological processes of aquatic species and the economy of developed countries either directly or indirectly got affected due to groundwater contaminants major issues occurred when the concentration of heavy metals in water tables and aquifers exceeded the health organizations minimum value limit this led to a decrease in the nutrition level of any agricultural productivity and increased its toxicity level eventually in the race to get better yields and productivity humans are themselves causing harm to their health it is insufficient time for developed and developing countries to shift from chemical manures and fertilizers to organic cultivation practices though yield will not be much high it will develop a sustainable environment this will indirectly reduce the contamination rates of water a particular focus on groundwater sciences is necessary for developing economies where financial resources and advanced technologies are not readily available these countries must invest in and encourage training and research programs to determine contamination rates and remediate the impacts the above discussed innovative techniques are cost friendly and society can quickly put up the plants for remediation every three techniques cover almost all the groundwater contaminants that need to be treated for further use bes is already in use for denitrification and removal of hydrocarbons but is still under development to make it more effective and sustainable it also makes the system available for remediation of multiple contaminants simultaneously also the ceramic filter module pilot plant unit aimed to treat one of the most toxic contaminants of groundwater arsenic it is yet used on a small scale however with the proper funding it is mandatory to increase the plant s capacity and make it available for large scale mitigation of arsenic and lowering the impacts on human health moreover the n zvi technology mainly works to purify nanoscale contaminants and its highly advantageous process as mitigation of halogenated compounds is done at the water sources so adopting these techniques and various other measures for mitigating contaminants is an immediate necessity for the countries to increase sustainability and improve water quality moreover developed countries have already adopted strategies to control contamination levels with novel technologies like geophysical and geo informatics techniques and remote sensing methods the rates of heavy metals were detected and accordingly protection measures were taken future techniques like artificial intelligence drone surveys and stable isotope analysis techniques are the best way to study groundwater contamination henceforth developing these techniques is necessary to adopt a sustainable and clean environment authors

11741,besides air water is the most essential and irreplaceable element to ensure the continuance of life according to data only 71 of earth s surface is covered with water 96 5 is present in seas and ocean 1 7 in groundwater and 1 7 in ice and glaciers eventually less than 0 3 of fresh water is available as rivers lakes and precipitates in the atmosphere with the developing technologies and increasing water scarcity humans have started fulfilling water requirements by pumping out groundwater for industrial economic commercial and residential uses for this reason the interconnectivity of groundwater and the surface bodies has been created leading to ease for humans to use groundwater sources however interventions of human activities have impacted groundwater quality globally natural processes like leaching from the soil evapotranspiration weathering of rocks and biological activities of aquatic species are the reasons for the change in water quality these anthropogenic factors like deforestation discharging industrial effluents domestic and commercial sewage deposition aquaculture and mining are all directly or indirectly responsible for groundwater contamination these natural and anthropogenic factors elevated the heavy metal contaminants in water degraded water quality harmed aquatic species and eventually consumption of this water affected human health the economy of industries also became a target of contaminated groundwater this paper gives detailed impacts the world faces due to contaminated water tables and aquifers however in the present scenario controlling these impacts has become a significant challenge one such major challenge was to conserve soil quality and increase the nutrition level of the soil due to its complex composition and geological structure maintenance of groundwater quality and purification of such large scale groundwater has been a concern because of significant investment requirements considering the challenges of groundwater contamination and advanced technology there is a need to develop various potential methods to treat contaminated groundwater also many stakeholders like ngos and private public partnerships will need to adopt management policies for groundwater here there are a few policies and remedial measures discussed in the paper which were implemented by the government and a detailed understanding of how groundwater quality is impacted and the need for innovative techniques to manage deteriorated quality in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords impacts groundwater contamination 1 introduction groundwater is considered the most vital natural asset of water since it holds about 97 of available unfrozen fresh water in the world skevas 2020 european commission 2008 igrac 2017 it is a crucial capital that is not only required for the residential and agricultural purposes but also has a vital role in economic and commercial sectors like extraction industries real estate fishery mining sectors and many more bhatti et al 2020 tyagi et al 2013 arslan et al 2017 based on bhatti et al 2020 bahar and reza 2010 the literature also says that approximately 33 out of 100 people demand groundwater for quenching thirst and various other domestic requirements also to the u s geological survey done in 1984 about 50000 mi3 1 mi3 is equal to 4 km3 is stored in the nation s aquifers within 2500 ft 1 ft equals 0 304 m of the surface and groundwater is available to us in at least small amounts virtually everywhere knox and moody 1991 it has significant importance as sustenance of life and as the financial and economic state for local people living in arid regions all around the globe further discussing the importance of groundwater in dryland agriculture we know that water is a scarce resource in such areas due to inadequate surface water and insufficient irrigation systems farmers depend on canals and wells to pump out the groundwater for agricultural needs darwish et al 2011 aquifers along with groundwater are considered the most generous water supply for the rural population and industries vulnerable to surface water sources it is the most reliable source during droughts and the aquifers are relatively free of contaminants knox and moody 1991 groundwater holds importance not only for society and industries but the research shows that groundwater is also essential for sustaining water dependent ecosystems based on kath and dyer 2017 fan et al 2013 shallow groundwater lies and connects about one third of land surfaces and across these surfaces numerous high valued rivers ponds and floodplains are attached to the aquifers this could further help in the extraction of groundwater kath and dyer 2017 boulton and hancock 2006 if the groundwater level decreases or gets contaminated it directly affects the quality of surface water sources connected to groundwater sources hence groundwater is essential for the socio economic sector and human beings but also helps maintain the proper flora and fauna the inter connection of groundwater to that with the surface water is pertinent for many reasons one such reason is that drinking water sources may depend on the hydrological cycle between groundwater and surface water nevertheless many times along with the nutrients and minerals adequate contaminants may also get transported from the groundwater to surface water sources or vice versa lewandowski et al 2020 henceforth using both resources groundwater and surface water sustainably is reasonably necessary because every action of a human being in this rapidly developing world could become the reason for contamination the complexity of groundwater contamination is increasing day by day in many parts of the globe bhatti et al 2020 yolcubal et al 2016 due to human advancement such as industrial development expansion urbanization and overpopulation bhatti et al 2020 tyagi et al 2013 also due to chemicals road salt germs viruses medicines fertilizers and gasoline can all contribute to contamination compared to surface water contamination groundwater contamination is unseen and more challenging in the present scenario of applied science li et al 2021 macdonald and kavanaugh 1994 contaminant sources in groundwater typically include contaminants like nitrate no3 and arsenic as selck et al 2018 figures of contaminants are continuously growing but they can be roughly categorized into three types i e radioactive biological and chemical these contaminants can originate from both natural and those generated from human activities anthropogenic sources li et al 2021 elumalai et al 2020 familiar natural groundwater contaminant sources include geologic media selck et al 2018 schreiber et al 2003 and geothermal systems selck et al 2018 goodsell et al 2017 mccleskey et al 2010 while contaminants originated from human activities i e anthropogenic contaminant sources include industrial or urban pollution agriculture and mining activities selck et al 2018 garelick et al 2008 heaton et al 2012 rosenstock et al 2014 contaminated property such as abandoned junkyards landfills industrial sites and gasworks sites contributes significantly to groundwater nitrogen levels junkyards landfills are regarded as a significant contributor to pollutants and their effects on groundwater quality have been well documented over a long period wakida and lerner 2005 zanoni 1972 walls 1975 macfarlane et al 1983 reinhard et al 1984 albaiges et al 1986 flyammar 1995 oil fields are also considered a potential source of groundwater contamination furthermore it happens due to oil spills taking place because of disaggregation of supertankers on high seas or the spills taking place on off shore wells during the drilling of petroleum products which often have an immediate and catastrophic influence on groundwater and neighboring ecosystems duffy et al 1980 at present the covid 19 virus has caused a widespread epidemic and has spread to every corner of the globe this coronavirus is chiefly transmitted from body to body by respiratory droplets as it is contagious thus water contaminated by this virus also can be the source of contaminated water threatening the human system li et al 2021 bhowmick et al 2020 lokhandwala and gautam 2020 rapid urbanization has created much pressure on the land and surface water resources so people have now started using groundwater resources to fulfill their daily needs parameswari et al 2012 simone et al 2001 due to this the number of unwanted substances like industrial effluents and domestic waste increased in the groundwater this contamination has affected human health along with this it also deteriorated the environmental quality and socio economic development for instance previous studies have proved that the significant health risk for the human population is due to complex metal content in water and the other organic pollutants from agricultural fields li et al 2021 wu et al 2020 a large number of agricultural lands have been degraded due to contamination of groundwater toxic metal contaminants and soluble salts accumulate in the vegetation s root zone and affect crop quality moreover surface water quality is degraded due to the transportation of contaminants from aquifers to the related surface water bodies li et al 2021 teng et al 2018 one such consequence led by the groundwater contamination that has hindered the development of the society is the cost of cleaning the contaminants of groundwater to reuse it often local government is responsible for taking remedial actions to clean groundwater contaminants because those polluters are not identified or found legally liable william page1 and rabinowitz 1993 over exploitation of groundwater resources causes three significant negative impacts they are 1 the quality of groundwater gets deteriorates giannoccaro et al 2017 zeitouni and dinar 1997 and 2 it also affects the ecosystem of groundwater due to lower levels of groundwater and harmful contaminants giannoccaro et al 2017 esteban and albiac 2011 and 3 cost of extracting groundwater got increased as levels got lowered down giannoccaro et al 2017 so contamination of groundwater has left no stone unturned it damaged human health and impacted an area s socio and economic development also the agricultural lands and crops were affected by contaminated groundwater adding to this the ecosystem is also equally affected according to esteban and albiac 2011 scheffer et al 2001 sometimes the ecosystem may suddenly change between two alternative states is said to be regime shifts many times if groundwater contamination is at a low extent then the ecosystem may show gradual change however as soon as the contamination level increases there is a drastic change in the ecosystem and sometimes it may even collapse the linked ecosystem then in such cases restoration of good quality and increasing groundwater levels could not even lead to the recovery of the previously flourished ecosystem esteban and albiac 2011 groundwater is a diminishing resource and groundwater contamination and its impacts have become a global concern groundwater levels are declining due to increasing population urban growth and industrialization groundwater is readily available and easy to extract which results in numerous consequences supply crises triggered by shocks to supply systems that are losing their resilience will be the foreseeable surprise when the water ran out in the past communities suffered and they will continue to do so schwartz and ibaraki 2011 it is highly desirable to educate the local farmers about the water requirements of plants and the potential harm that over irrigation may cause ali al ali al ibrahim 1991 the need of the hour is to increase the awareness and education related to groundwater mukherji and shah 2005 there should be proper laws regulating groundwater use by modern technologies like geographic information system gis and artificial intelligence ai the use of groundwater and its advantages have profoundly influenced humanity and it is very accurate that groundwater provided numerous employment opportunities and a significant increase in crop yields as groundwater is a limited resource our main aim should be sustainable use of groundwater without exceeding its natural formation limits mukherji and shah 2005 2 classification of groundwater contaminants today the world is facing a significant challenge to use the resources in a fair sustainable way such that it does not affect the environment one such challenge is the decreased levels of groundwater and the increasing levels of its contaminants due to the world s rapid evolution this problem gave researchers a better chance to study the aquifers and the sources which led to their contamination broadly the groundwater contamination sources can be categorized as shown below each category has a broad area and subdivisions which becomes a cause for groundwater contamination fig 1 2 1 agricultural contaminants in the past few decades as the population rate increased there was an urgent need to develop agricultural technology to meet the demand for food so the efficiency of production and nutrient level was increased by using many chemical fertilizers savci 2012 however these fertilizers are mostly ammonia and nitrate based which may degrade groundwater quality for long term uses nitrogen content in groundwater and aquifers comes from many sources but the main reason is chemical fertilizers and pesticides used in agricultural fields giraldez and fox 1995 usda 1987 conservation council 1987 this nitrate content in the fields is due to the overuse of pesticides and microbial contamination when the excessive nitrogen compounds in fertilizers get oxidized in the soil they convert into soluble nitrates this content gets leached into the roots and enters the unconfined aquifers hence shallow water tables are likely to be affected by nitrate contamination mahvi et al 2005 precise cutting is also one such agricultural activity that disturbs the hydrological regime and decreases the groundwater recharge it also erodes the land and causes high turbidity in the rivers adding to this it also destroys the perennial streams and rivers this causes health issues in the community due to the loss of potable water in the region wastewater management a un water analytical brief groundwater also gets contaminated indirectly due to the feedlot and animal corrals when surface water gets contaminated by the microorganisms and other veterinary drugs they indirectly get transported to the attached groundwater sources and henceforth lead to quality degradation also the lower metal content in the urine and feces of animals gets accumulated in the surface water this further passes on to the groundwater and contaminates it with metal content especially nitrates and excess salts 2 2 commercial contaminants initially we discussed all agricultural sources of contaminants keeping our views on commercial activities many sources of contamination are associated with human activities like disposal practices and leaking sewerage systems also the leakages in waste dumping sites and accidental oil spills in pipelines and gas stations becomes a reason for contamination schmoll world health organization 2006 due to the development of industries and rapid growth in urbanization there is a significant shortage of lands to bury and dump the waste generated in any area as a result the municipalities illegally dispose of them in water bodies which causes surface water pollution a significant amount of this waste then runoffs or seeps into the topmost aquifer degrading groundwater quality sangodoyin 1993 reible et al 1990 furthermore rural and urban sewage may contain human and animal feces the vital source of coliform bacteria once this sewage seeps into water tables the bacteria start breeding more and more due to the availability of fresh groundwater streams this further led to microbial contamination of groundwater such conditions cause eutrophication and increase nitrogen content reducing water has dissolved oxygen levels khatri and tyagi 2015 us epa 1990 smith and schindler 2009 another anthropogenic source of groundwater contamination is accidental oil spills in pipelines and gas stations it is a significant contaminant as it causes inevitable threats to the ecosystem and humans even if less oil or gas leaks out duffy et al 1980 both the accidental cases of oil tankers and leakages in underground oil pipelines are equally responsible for degrading underground water and polluting soil content initially the oil spreads on the upper layer of soil then based on the chemical nature of oil and the absorbing capacity the oil penetrates the soil and forms the layer on top of the water vanloocke et al 1975 bartz and käss 1972 due to this action the groundwater no longer remains portable and becomes unfit for industrial use 2 3 industrial contaminants the emission of pollutants produced by various sectors has a noticeable impact on the environment water pollution has drawn considerable attention as one of the most urgent environmental issues due to its specific vulnerability to contamination saravanan et al 2021 diverse sources that have led to groundwater contamination and water quality deterioration include mining operations production toxic hazardous spills and septage lagoons and sludge sites in gold mines of west african countries like ghana it is estimated that about 5 tones of mercury are liberated also sulfide oxidation occurs due to groundwater s ph lowering increasing the mobility of trace and concentration metals in water bodies bhattacharya et al 2012 kortatsi 2004 hilson 2001 crude oil spill is a significant issue and likely to cause while drilling offshore transportation and transfer to onshore a significant source of oil pollution in water is oil spills which are caused by 13 by transportation oil spills saravanan et al 2021 ali et al 2020 niu et al 2020 also the production of petroleum products is the causal agent of toxic effluents discharged into the water bodies sayed et al 2021 long term application of sludge on land causes an increase in the electrical conductivity and concentration of nitrate and ammonia in the aquifers beneath the sludge sites which affect aquatic life as well as the life of humans higg ns n d 2 4 radioactive contaminants natural pollutants or human activities may be the reason for the phenomena of contamination in groundwater the current radioactive materials found in groundwater are by and significant uranium radon and radium the most important source of groundwater contamination is radioactivity through nuclear power plants and various nuclear devices the main elements used for this purpose are radium uranium and thorium klasson et al n d radioactive pollutants in groundwater can come from natural radionuclide deposits but they can also come from anthropogenic sources including nuclear power plant waste nuclear weapons testing and inappropriate medical radioisotope disposal dahlgaard et al 2004 lytle et al 2014 huang et al 2012 radioactive elements enter the human body mainly through drinking water studies have found high levels of nitrates fluorides and organic metals in the human body wu et al 2020 groundwater pollution can also impact human health by impacting the food chain for production irrigation with heavy metal contaminated groundwater and wastewater containing persistent pollutants can cause hazardous substances to accumulate in grains and vegetables and causes serious health problems in human beings jenifer and jha 2018 yuan et al 2019 njuguna et al 2019 li et al 2021 3 impacts of groundwater contamination moving ahead with the primary objective of the paper now the impacts of the groundwater are described for the different areas globally it gives detailed knowledge about the contamination sources in the study area the number of contaminants present in aquifers and what the government took appropriate measures to protect and manage groundwater quality from getting deteriorated these impacts are categorized into two different sectors they are 1 impacts of groundwater contamination on nature and ecosystem 2 impacts of groundwater contamination on socio economic sector 3 1 impacts of groundwater contamination on nature and ecosystem as the contaminants can be classified in many different ways the impacts of groundwater contamination are observed in many different sectors there is no such area that is not affected by the degradation of groundwater each sector is affected by the degraded groundwater from soil to the ecosystem and from humans to industries now briefly discuss the impacts of groundwater contamination on nature and the ecosystem in different global areas and how government initiatives helped increase groundwater quality usually contaminants are from the agricultural sectors due to the over exploitative use of fertilizers and excessive irrigation of fields in the thrust of best productivity in the end it degrades the quality of water tables due to the percolation of chemicals like nitrates and phosphorous in the soil it affects the soil quality the animal species of aquifers and the surface water which are interconnected to deep shallow aquifers below are the different areas worldwide that face the problems due to contaminated water and preventive measures taken to conserve groundwater and surface water nebraska the highly irrigated and densely cultivated farmland of the u s had been using agricultural chemicals to the crops for maximum prices and better yield through the developed irrigation systems since the 1960s later in 2008 a paper poor 2000 was published which gave a briefing about the valuation method to determine the number of chemicals used in fields and the need to stop the use due to significant contamination results due to potential environmental hazards as human health also awareness was created about implementing sustainable technology to improve environmental quality according to the reports poor 2000 u s bureau of census 1994 nebraska has 19 2 million acres of cultivated land of which 31 were irrigated farmlands the major drawback in this area was the lack of training and knowledge of specialized chemical equipment which led to the accidental discharge of chemicals in water bodies due to these reasons both the surface run off and the water tables and aquifers got contaminated chemigation producers of nebraska faced a challenge in maintaining water quality they were concerned about the impacts of chemicals and had to produce the maximum profitable agricultural products later the welfare measures were taken which stated that the producers with more chemigation experience and those near the area where contamination rates are high due to agriculture have to pay more than those producers who contribute less to contamination in this manner the water pollution rates were lowered down according to the study by chatterjee et al 2017 arsenic content in groundwater is a significant issue in bengal delta plain the presence of arsenic is influenced mainly by the local land use patterns like agricultural practices sanitation and surface water source and due to this there is a heterogeneous distribution of arsenic in water tables this affected the quality of crops grown in west bengal and bangladesh due to the high amount of arsenic contamination in aquifers agricultural productivity and soil conditions have drawn significant attention samples of groundwater and potable water were taken from the nadia district of west bengal to carry out the hydro geochemical screening which gave out the worst and the patchiest distribution of arsenic in water the as content level was far more than the normed national drinking water standards and the concentration was more than the who guided value hence the study explained the as distribution and the reasons for contamination as well as the dire need to take significant steps for the change in agricultural practice and recreating the soil quality free from arsenic in the study area arslan et al 2017 shows the assessment carried out to check the contamination of heavy metal in shallow and deep aquifers and surface water the heavy metal pollution index hpi is explained for the northern develi closed basin sample in turkey the study was undertaken for dry and wet seasons for both seasons more than half of the sample had a high amount of as b and fe contamination this basin has no industrial or mining areas but all of this contamination is caused only due to geogenic reasons because of erciyes volcanism which emits toxic metal products this surface water toxicity harmed the soil quality and degraded the groundwater sources and aquifers also the rocks formed after the cooling down of magma in the later stages of erciyes volcanism dissolve and seep into groundwater this degrades the soil by perforating heavy metals from the ground so to step up for good cultivation the turkish government needed to find ways to control these geogenic sources of heavy metals in water bodies and measures to bring down the value of hpi in north italy one of the agricultural areas of albenga coastal plain was vulnerably affected by groundwater contamination according to the data from bartzas et al 2015 groundwater constitutes about 72 of the total water supplied for irrigation pesticide chemicals and nitrates are the most common non point sources of contaminants found in alluvial aquifers in this study area alluvial aquifers contain nitrates for several reasons including shallow water levels highly permeable deposits of alluvial and connections between freshwater sources and agricultural land use that usually occurs on flood plain terraces with river and seawater intrusion due to excessive pumping of groundwater for irrigating fields two accurate approaches were made to check the vulnerability of groundwater contamination susceptibility index s i and pesticide drastic methods which showed the high risk of contamination these vulnerability maps helped policymakers prioritize the importance of groundwater management and protection policies in this study area where intensive agricultural activities were carried on the groundwater ecosystem is considered to be an essential part of biodiversity however these ecosystems are poorly understood because of their diversification as the contaminants are harming aquifer ecosystems one such place of study in australia for which humphreys n d gave a particular study about the fauna of groundwater ecosystem in australia and how their population was impacted due to contaminated water tables many areas in australia have the biodiversity hot spots of stygofauna species humphreys 2001 boulton et al submitted however over the past decade anthropogenic activities like mining of minerals dewatering operation due to civil projects and many more have become an issue for stygofauna species and proved detrimental the effect of these activities depended on the rate of dewatering operation and the spread of biodiversity in the water table these activities created a concern for the stygal population in western australia aquifers humphreys 2001 playford 2001 moreover human activities like pumping groundwater at high rates decreased groundwater flow velocity and reduced the flux of oxygen and dissolved organic carbon doc in the downstream aquifers various studies showed that stygofauna are extremely sensitive to environmental changes and their diversity can be used to detect various types of contaminations of heavy metal and sewage waste in aquifers on this basis humphreys n d malard et al 1996 suggested that such biological indicators should be used to test the groundwater rather than using hydrodynamic data and on this basis management and protection programs of groundwater should be the central area of focus increasing demand for water for the industrial expansion and the necessity to fulfill the thrust of a growing population in china s most important region north china plain ncp has led to the overexploitation of surface and groundwater sources ncp region produces 1 4th of the country s total grain yield which is china s most demanding agricultural region the main objective of the study done by changming et al 2001 was to find out the main reasons for exploitation which were known to be increased pumping rates and the decline in water tables and a sharp decrease in both shallow and deep aquifers in the hebei plain which is the most cultivated area of china these all reasons led to overexploitation of water sources and also the groundwater became the default source of irrigation where the surface water bodies dried up also the loss of hydraulic pressure from the sub surfaces due to depletion of groundwater led to land subsidence and the water quality degraded these problems can be overcome by increasing the management policies of groundwater in the entire area and imposing a water price policy to decrease water withdrawal moreover it increases water supply by adapting the purification techniques and reducing wastewater the problem of high fluoride content in water resources is a significant concern among all the contaminants because of its toxicological and geo environmental concerns fluoride containing minerals in the rocks and soil seep into the water table and are the primary source of fluoride in groundwater moreover the weathering and leaching of soil are also crucial in deciding the amount of fluoride in water in india many states are prone to fluoride content in drinking water one such study was done on rajasthan described in thesai n d which gives a briefing about the impacts of fluoride on animals due to contaminated water the drinking water of northern rajasthan is highly contaminated by fluoride according to the study of 54 samples from different villages almost all the samples had fluoride content more than the maximum value set up by who this affected not only humans but also animals in rajasthan in many domesticated animals fluorosis was observed fluorosis affects animals giving symptoms like crooked legs dental fluorosis hyperostosis hoof deformities and decreased bone resorption thesai n d krook 2006 herbivores animals were also affected by fluorosis using dairy products on these animals affects the health of humans as well later on due to increased concern many defluoridation techniques were adopted to reduce the excess fluoride content below the permitted level those techniques included dialysis membrane processes and electrocoagulation and were successful due to economic viability one of the unknown significant problems that are never considered is the spread of leachates to the soil surface and groundwater aquifers for a similar reason one of the ex landfill sites of malaysia named taman beringin was investigated for the contamination of leachates and a few essential points were concluded from the study according to atta et al 2015 many parameters like ph value of water temperature different chemical properties and other heavy metal concentrations were used to detect leachate contamination in water samples the results showed that the groundwater beneath this landfill was highly contaminated with heavy and organic metals and the results and statistics showed an increase in contaminants in future years in malaysia levels of contaminants like nh3 n cl f pb ni and fe were more than the stipulated level set by malaysia it was a risk for the habitats because this water flowed into rivers and this contaminated groundwater was pumped for domestic use for this reason the rivers of malaysia also got contaminated with leachates so malaysia needed to decrease the leachate contamination and its impact on the surrounding environment the rapid development of agriculture since 1950 led to increased loss of nitrogen in agricultural land and an increase in nitrogen content of groundwater in the sandy soil of east and south boersb et al 1998 fraters et al 1997 as described in boersb et al 1998 the main reason for this loss of nitrogen in soil and increase in nitrogen content in aquifers is because of more input of fertilizers and chemical manure for good yield and to harvest better nitrogen output products the objective was to determine the present scenario in the netherlands regarding the nitrogen surpluses in fields and nitrate contamination study the model prepared by the dutch government for the protection of aquifers and implement different policies of the nutrient accounting programs when the samples from east and south netherlands were tested it was observed that the nitrogen content of only peat soils was low because of denitrification actions in contrast in other fields the nitrate concentration in groundwater was much higher than the accepted values the samples also concluded that the loss of nitrogen and phosphorous from the agricultural fields led to the exceeding nitrate values in water tables and other environmental issues of soil fertility boersb et al 1998 brouwer hellegers 1997 so the netherland government gave warnings regarding contamination issues to the local and commercial farmers and later accounting system minas minerals accounting system was implemented this policy led to a decrease in nitrogen input in fields also fertilizer use was expected to decrease by 50 which will help reduce nitrate content in shallow waters and surface water bodies this policy aimed to implement levy free nitrogen surpluses in farmlands these all implementations gave a drastic decrease leaching of nitrate from agriculture over the decades one of the states of the u s named oregon has many clusters of groundwater dependent ecosystem gde in its watersheds region known as gde clusters assessment brown et al 2011 shows that groundwater contamination affected 30 of the gde cluster by nitrate concentration 30 by industrial chemicals and 40 by pesticides in agriculture the assessment of the entire water tables of oregon was done based on the flow of groundwater which sustains the ecosystems and the risks of human activities groundwater contamination which was mapped proper evaluation of human activities in this area is necessary to save the groundwater ecosystems from the threats of pesticides and chemicals like metribuzin and carbofuran present in water tables due to agricultural activities moreover a groundwater program has been mandated in this state to protect the quality of water and decrease the chances of eutrophication due to phosphorous which harmed the aquatic ecosystem in deep aquifers for decades brown et al 2011 carpenter et al 1998 this assessment of gdes shows the level of contamination of water tables and eventually showed the ecological importance of groundwater and the necessity of protection and management policies to save gdes in oregon which is considered the main component of the ecosystem and biodiversity in the thrust of better yield and good productivity of crops the soil quality has largely been impacted to study these impacts and find the appropriate solution and management policies four soil samples were tested from the region of sub humid bekaa plain of lebanon east mediterranean around 21 samples of groundwater were observed for contaminations according to the study darwish et al 2011 bouwer 2000 möller et al 2003 mahvi et al 2005 ju et al 2006 intensive agricultural practices and improper use of fertilizers were primary nitrogen contaminants in groundwater and surface water the movement of nitrate compounds can be estimated based on the texture and permeability of the soil in clayey soil the water percolates slowly to the water tables and also the pores lack oxygen amount and it favors denitrification hence the region of lebanon east mediterranean which has clayey soil has less nitrate contamination darwish et al 2011 strong and fillery 2002 but places with the preferential flow of water along with soil cracks and high oxygen interaction showed a high level of nitrate contaminations darwish et al 2011 oostindie and bronswijk 1995 this overuse of fertilizers led to the nitrogen build up in the soil groundwater continuum one more significant and indirect impact was the eutrophication of freshwater sources due to excess phosphorous in the groundwater connected to surface streams this also led to a lack of dissolved oxygen for the aquatic species of surface water after increasing complexity the lebanon east government started management programs and also brought a change in cropping patterns moreover the primary implementation was the rotation of crops and growing crops that absorb the nitrogen from the soil and do not allow percolation of nitrogen in water tables optimizing the nitrogen and phosphorous based fertilizers and managing the environmental protection laws were the main aim for increasing groundwater quality later on the salinity of the soil was managed and in this manner the contamination was reduced as mentioned in table 1 higher arsenic concentrations in the bengal delta of bangladesh and india are due to the desorption of as bearing minerals and alluvial sediments these are considered the geogenic sources of contamination and naturally lead to increased contamination below fig 2 is the illustration of how arsenic from the origin gets transported to the groundwater in the sedimentary basins of the bengal delta after studying the different areas across the globe and observing the contaminants and their sources a few points can be concluded on the bases of the study this includes the overuse and over exploitation of fertilizers and chemical products are the primary sources of contamination this indirectly states that agricultural practices are the main reason for the contamination of water tables and in all its impacts are also observed on cropping patterns only also in industrial places the high contaminations are because by effluents and discharging toxic slurries to the surrounding due to all these heavy metals leachates oil and hydrocarbon the overall impact is caused on soil quality and the life of lotic organisms this affects the yield and productivity of crops and damages the ecosystem moreover consuming such products with heavy metal content affects human health so eventually humans have been affected due to the exploitation of nature 3 2 socio economic impacts groundwater contamination has led to various socio economic impacts and costs of around 330 per household various samples were collected from different study areas and impacts were evaluated out of which some lead to the society at risk of chronic disease in contrast some lead to a dip in property values using contaminated groundwater has led to diseases like dental fluorosis arsenicosis infectious intestinal disease and bone problems below are a few brief case studies to examine the impacts of contaminated water krishnan indu n d carried out a study of contaminated groundwater due to fluorine and arsenic concentration in gujarat the main aim of the research work was to evaluate social health and economic impacts the study was conducted in 25 villages of north gujarat and it was found that 16 were suffering from at least one disease of fluorosis and 36 were suffering from dental fluorosis thus the above values depict that the groundwater of those 25 villages can be used for industrial and agricultural use but not for drinking purposes walker and hoehn 1990 evaluated groundwater contamination due to nitrates in the rural areas of michigan united states the main aim of the research work was to estimate the economic damages of contaminated groundwater the survey found that 34 of the households in southern michigan exceeded the contamination level of nitrates in groundwater nitrate contamination causes an economic burden of around 330 per household it was found that when the level of contamination increases the end user incurs the damage or the loss nahar 2009 carried out an assessment of degraded groundwater in the northwest regions of bangladesh the main objective of the research work was to assess the concentration of arsenic and the societal impacts of contamination after surveying it was found that there was a deep rooted stereotype among people of bangladesh which socially impacted mental health people were unwilling to marry those suffering from arsenicosis this study shows that contaminated groundwater affects not only health issues but also the environment and creates social issues william page1 and rabinowitz 1993 carried out the analysis of the effects of contaminated groundwater on property values and cities in the united states the study found that the presence of toxic chemicals in groundwater resulted in decreased property value in the property markets contaminated lands are also declared as temporarily abandoned sites the economic cost of cleaning contaminated land varies from 30 million to 40 million it causes severe financial problems and moral dilemmas in institutions hussain et al 2021 evaluated groundwater quality and its impact on human health in the swabi region of pakistan the main of the study was to assess the human health impacts of groundwater contaminated by industrial wastewater 86 samples were collected from gadoon amazai industrial estate various parameters include chemical oxygen demand cod hardness ph and suspension total dissolved solids were analyzed and it was found that the concentration of elements such as cr cd pb cu fe mg na ca and k exceeded the acceptable levels the study found that health problems in nearby areas were due to contaminated drinking water scholz 2012 carried out implications of contaminated groundwater for commercial and industrial land concerns in silicon valley united states the paper s main aim was to provide an overview of economic costs and fluctuating land prices due to hazardous groundwater the study found that either the property s sale is being terminated or the property value is reduced significantly causing a loss of 400 000 for its clean up it was found that there will be no safe land for future housing and that will have to spend millions of dollars on clean up efforts baba and tayfur 2011 carried out implications of polluted groundwater in the city of izmir turkey the study s main aim was to assess health impacts due to deteriorated groundwater quality in the city of izmir it was found that the ph value ranges between 6 87 and 7 8 and increases dissolved oxygen level ranges from 0 48 to 2 38 mg l health impacts such as infectious intestinal disease and dental and bone problems were noticed high iron zinc sodium magnesium and calcium concentrations were found in groundwater thus increasing public awareness of and value and vulnerability of aquifers in turkey is required parameswari et al 2012 evaluated the interdisciplinary approach and its impacts due to contaminated groundwater in tamil nadu india the main aim of the research work was to determine the socio economic impacts of groundwater contamination due to solid waste dumping sites from leachate characterization it was found that the value of tds ranged from 470 to 2990 mg l due to which various health impacts such as respiratory cardiovascular disease and cancer are found the result showed a significant impact on socio economic and educational status li et al 2017 carried out research on the deteriorated quality of groundwater in china the main aim of the research work was to determine impacts on groundwater due to economic and anthropogenic activities it was found that 18 of the wells are filled with degraded groundwater which will lead to the demand for new administrative policies and better hydro economics the need of the hour is to make people aware of groundwater quality protection adimalla et al 2019 carried out a study on tarnished groundwater due to nitrate and fluoride concentration in nirmal province south india the study s main aim was to assess fluoride and nitrate content on human health due to groundwater contamination 34 samples of groundwater were collected and found that fluoride and nitrate content were relatively higher than the acceptable level of the bureau of indian standards and hazards of non carcinogenic disease were observed the study shows that serious health problems were noticed and necessary steps should be taken to protect future generations from health hazards rahman et al 2009 the implications of arsenic groundwater contamination in southeast asian regions cambodia myanmar nepal taiwan and vietnam the main of the paper is to evaluate the number of people at risk due to arsenic contamination of groundwater the study found that in cambodia the level of arsenic as content is 1 1610 μg l in myanmar the level of arsenic as content is above 50 μg l and in nepal the level of arsenic as content is 2620 μg l in taiwan the level of arsenic as content is less than 0 15 3590 μg l and in vietnam the level of arsenic as content is 1 3050 μg l diseases like leprosy or skin disease were found and societal problems like exclusion from society were there thus various prevention techniques like phytoremediation can be used to eradicate arsenic contamination enrichment of fluorine in groundwater is due to geogenic sources this includes the interaction of bedrock rich in fluorine fig 3 it also depends on the factors like hydrochemistry dynamics of groundwater and environmental factors like volcanic eruptions various hydrogeochemical processes involved in the enrichment of f in groundwater are absorption desorption evaporation and dissolution precipitation leaching of f bearing minerals lithology and geological condition of aquifers play an essential role in enriching fluorine in groundwater wang et al 2021b wenzel and blum 1992 a schematic of fluorine enrichment through geogenic reason is shown below groundwater plays a vital role in fulfilling the freshwater requirements of all the living creatures on the earth due to the continuous impact of human activities such as deforestation continuous erosion excessive use of insecticides and fertilizers effluents from industries and source of contamination has led to contamination of groundwater decrease in groundwater levels the deeper the level of groundwater difficult it becomes to extract the groundwater for the people it requires enormous investments economic cost and infrastructure advanced technologies the need of the hour is the participation of the people and awareness among the people regarding groundwater contamination and conservation table 2 so to achieve sustainability and conserve groundwater quality it is necessary to decrease the excessive use of chemical products implement sustainable agricultural practices and encourage organic farming moreover proper management of solid waste is essential to protect our ecosystem 4 challenges groundwater is majorly polluted by anthropogenic sources hydrocarbons and natural compounds nitrate and arsenic which become a challenge due to a lack of technological advancement cecconet et al 2020 one of the essential freshwater sources is deteriorated due to increasing population and economic development like industrialization and urbanization ojha et al 2014 due to a lack of irrigational efficiency lack of technical assistance and knowledge of usage of irrigational facilities to the farmers groundwater use has increased for agricultural purposes and has become very difficult to monitor due to the increase in sea level there is the intrusion of saline water in groundwater aquifers leading to deteriorated soil quality ultimately resulting in decreased nutrition in the crops crop failure droughts and loss of livelihood of the farmers the pre eminent cause of saline water pollution is influenced by the dynamics of seawater and static fossil groundwater this phenomenon occurs in the interface between saline water i e seawater and groundwater where saline water diffusion occurs into fresh fossil water the primary cause of saline water intrusion is the over pumping of groundwater leading to saline water pollution and land subsidence purnama and marfai 2012 an increase in groundwater salinity results in various ions such as chloride sodium and sulfate ions purnama and marfai 2012 abdel aal et al 1996 the straightforward mechanism underlying saline water intrusion is that when the surface water level drops the nearby groundwater level also drops as a result saline seawater intrusion occurs through lateral channels mokhlesur rahman et al 2000 in agrarian countries like india it is challenging to monitor the number of wells and lack of logistics resulting in exploitative groundwater usage lall et al 2020 exploitative usage of groundwater results in side effects like increased pumping cost land degradation land subsidence loss of soil fertility and desertification hiscock 2011 increasing industrialization and urbanization lead to massive deforestation causing erosion and decreased groundwater aquifers decreased groundwater level leads to social and economic tensions regarding groundwater usage hiscock 2011 the intervention of human activities led to groundwater quality research being more complex time consuming and costly groundwater maintenance is a long term task associated with great uncertainty and professional and technical personnel requirement for groundwater quality research work groundwater management also requires data sharing cooperation and advanced technologies li 2016 untimely environmental impact assessment and careless actions maximize the final cost and damage even the developed countries face significant challenges in the maintenance of groundwater due to a lack of innovation in groundwater research and technology weber et al 2008 once the groundwater is polluted it becomes a challenging task to purify it on a large scale due to geological structures and compositions leading to increased investment and a lack of financial capacity to purify the groundwater 5 innovative techniques and way ahead groundwater will play a crucial role in maintaining the freshwater resource and will require administrative efficiency investments and an interdisciplinary approach through biomonitoring the groundwater by novel microbiological approaches mösslacher and notenboom 1999 different technical treatments have been put forward for groundwater remediation these treatments use physical biological or chemical methods to remove contaminants few of such are briefly discussed which includes bio electrochemical system bes is a versatile and promising technology that helps remove nitrates and hydrocarbons increasing advancements in technologies have led to the development of potential treatment of contaminated groundwater through bio electrochemical systems bes which is a treatment method used for the removal of hydrocarbons such as toluene phenanthrene benzene btex and light pahs nitrates cecconet et al 2020 these happen due to the interaction of microbial metabolism with poised electrodes and the effect of bes s electric field the physical migration of nitrate and hydrocarbon impurities occurs cecconet et al 2020 besides bes many remedial techniques can be implemented like bioaugmentation cecconet et al 2020 lyon et al 2013 permeable reactive barriers cecconet et al 2020 obiri nyarko et al 2014 but on the other side there are several drawbacks for these techniques like the necessity to add chemicals which adds to the cost of remediation also strong dependency on the site characteristics limits the use of techniques bes application for in situ remediation does not involve the addition of chemicals and so is highly advantageous due to environmental sustainability fig 4 eventually this aspect becomes relevant when bess compared with other technologies where the supply of electron donors acceptors and addition of chemicals is an operational condition research in this field has shown excellent denitrification and hydrocarbon removal results due to the interaction of microbial metabolism and poised electrodes in bioelectric remediation systems this technique is still under research to shift focus toward interacting with more than one contaminant and finding ways to estimate power consumption for this remediation also the use of biosensors has become an emerging topic of investigation such investigations can develop a reliable technique for groundwater remediation shortly cecconet et al 2020 the removal of trichloroethylene tce from the groundwater can be done through nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi which is a remediation technique to transfer the contaminants from one phase to another sharma et al 2020 the nanoscale zero valent iron technique has proved propitious for groundwater remediation at the source itself the significant advantage of this method is that the water is remediated at the contaminated sources and a large variety of contaminants can be treated for example trichloroethylene in this technique of groundwater remediation particles of iron are manufactured through the milling process the nzvi is mainly produced from fe 0 ions from the solution of fe 2 with the help of potent reducing agents the particles produced are reduced to a micrometer or nanometre scale the reactivity conditions for nzvi are that for short term treatment the reactivity should be high and for treatments lasting for two to three months the reactivity should be sufficiently high köber et al 2014 this technique is mainly efficient for treating perchloroethylene as it dechlorinates the halogenated compounds crampon et al 2019 ceramic filter module pilot plant units are used for groundwater remediation and wastewater treatment in residential areas this plant is specially designed to remove the inorganic forms of arsenic mainly as v and as iii present in groundwater koley 2021 hanh et al 2010 scanlon et al 2009 scudlark and church 1988 generally in remote rural areas arsenic treatment plants atus are installed to treat pumped groundwater and use this treated water to remove this toxic arsenic the atus follow the chemical principles like ion exchange membrane based process dominguez ramos et al 2014 usepa 2003 coagulation jekel and seith 2000 kobya et al 2020 kumar et al 2004 pokhrel et al 2005 adsorption kango kumar 2016 lunge et al 2014 nikolaidis et al 2003 uddin and jeong 2020 followed by filtration few advanced remediations consist of phytoremediation and bioremediation dadwal and mishra 2017 gogoi et al 2017 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 kumari et al 2019 maity et al 2021 rahman et al 2014 tsai et al 2009 in which the water treatment media are minerals of iron and aluminum due to their higher co precipitation affinity for arsenic the arsenic removal plants installed have a unique cementitious sealed separation bed with filter units these beds are kept open during the daytime for proper aeration so that toxic arsenic species get stabilized rapidly also the oxidized iron arsenic complexes get retained in the filters leading to groundwater purification for domestic use also the wastewater is treated in the plant where the sludge is formed and sent to the sludge separation bed then the filtered water is re circulated to the media for retreatment and recycling koley 2021 it has been a widely used method due to its economic benefits and ease of installation koley 2021 basu et al 2015 kabir and chowdhury 2017 odling et al 2020 singh 2017 therefore extracting groundwater for treatment and drinking water supply using economical atus has become necessary to relieve remote masses at risk hence future efforts in arsenic mitigation strategies should attempt to assess more such treatment plants using filtration and adsorption processes implementing a rainwater harvesting system in every field will recharge the groundwater and reduce the fluorine concentration in the groundwater aravinthasamy et al 2020 there should be an integrated detailed and transparent approach for waste disposal from the polluting industries influx of the chemicals through the usage of fertilizers and risk management strategies for the groundwater weber et al 2008 groundwater resource management will require participation from stakeholders like public private partnerships ngos political will and commitments toward the sustainable management of groundwater resources hiscock 2011 government should play an active role in tackling the problems related to groundwater and groundwater contamination and the remedial measures by collecting appropriate data and by establishing the central data management system shrestha et al 2003 in the saturated and unsaturated zones by using the multiple tracer analysis and sophisticated technologies at individual sites böhlke 2002 groundwater resources will require a better understanding of quality and quantity recharge and timely monitoring hiscock 2011 although it may not be optimal to adopt the management policies and remediations measures successfully implemented by the developed countries to the economically poor and developing countries it is necessary to use different approaches to mitigate different types of contaminants in areas with different soil characteristics and climatic conditions these natural factors greatly influence the mechanism and extent of contaminant transport 6 conclusion as far as health and the economy are concerned the quality of groundwater and surface water is considered to be the most sensitive issue globally it is high time for us to understand that contamination of these resources should be prevented controlled and reduced looking at the complete paper no such place is present in the world that does not face the issue of groundwater contamination eventually no such sector is unaffected due to this contamination soil quality human health biological processes of aquatic species and the economy of developed countries either directly or indirectly got affected due to groundwater contaminants major issues occurred when the concentration of heavy metals in water tables and aquifers exceeded the health organizations minimum value limit this led to a decrease in the nutrition level of any agricultural productivity and increased its toxicity level eventually in the race to get better yields and productivity humans are themselves causing harm to their health it is insufficient time for developed and developing countries to shift from chemical manures and fertilizers to organic cultivation practices though yield will not be much high it will develop a sustainable environment this will indirectly reduce the contamination rates of water a particular focus on groundwater sciences is necessary for developing economies where financial resources and advanced technologies are not readily available these countries must invest in and encourage training and research programs to determine contamination rates and remediate the impacts the above discussed innovative techniques are cost friendly and society can quickly put up the plants for remediation every three techniques cover almost all the groundwater contaminants that need to be treated for further use bes is already in use for denitrification and removal of hydrocarbons but is still under development to make it more effective and sustainable it also makes the system available for remediation of multiple contaminants simultaneously also the ceramic filter module pilot plant unit aimed to treat one of the most toxic contaminants of groundwater arsenic it is yet used on a small scale however with the proper funding it is mandatory to increase the plant s capacity and make it available for large scale mitigation of arsenic and lowering the impacts on human health moreover the n zvi technology mainly works to purify nanoscale contaminants and its highly advantageous process as mitigation of halogenated compounds is done at the water sources so adopting these techniques and various other measures for mitigating contaminants is an immediate necessity for the countries to increase sustainability and improve water quality moreover developed countries have already adopted strategies to control contamination levels with novel technologies like geophysical and geo informatics techniques and remote sensing methods the rates of heavy metals were detected and accordingly protection measures were taken future techniques like artificial intelligence drone surveys and stable isotope analysis techniques are the best way to study groundwater contamination henceforth developing these techniques is necessary to adopt a sustainable and clean environment authors

11742,congo red cr dye is an organic pollutant of environmental concern it is applied in textile printing dyeing and rubber industries as colorant the carcinogenicity mutagenicity and various associated toxicities of cr to flora fauna and humas have necessitated the requirements for removal of cr from industrial cr laden waste water in this review a total number of 300 research and review based publications are selected and reviewed for more assessment the modelled toxicity effects of cr dye on aquatic fauna and flora are discussed with cr found to be phytotoxic to aquatic flora and also capable of interfering with the reproductive activity of aquatic fauna in addition the removal strategies for cr were thoroughly explored and discussed with adsorption technology offering best route for decontamination of cr due to some inherent advantages like regenerability of ad sorbents lack of production of secondary toxic contaminant simplicity and low cost nature when compared with others this synthesis concludes by recommending research in areas of column adsorption and assessment of adsorption removal of cr in the presence of co organic inorganic contaminant s graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment pollution congo red dye contaminant 1 introduction water is unarguably an invaluable natural resource required for life sustenance one of the challenges plaguing the world is access to clean water and drinking water the pollution of water occurs due to input of environmental stressors at concentration beyond maximum permissible level a water is contaminated or polluted when it is unfit for drinking or other purposes due to the presence of the likes of organic and or inorganic chemicals minerals or wastes emanating from industrial agricultural clinical and or domestic sources ajiboye et al 2022 ali et al 2019 basheer 2018 oladoye et al 2021 the industrial effluents contribute the most to surface and ground water pollution sequel to rapid globalization and urbanization there is an increased demand for items that are manufactured using dyes and heavy metals alqadami et al 2017 oladoye 2022 for instance copper cu and lead pb are some of heavy metals commonly found in waste waters around smelting electrical mining areas alothman et al 2020 while dyes and pigments are common in wastewater of some industries like food textile and pharmaceuticals which commonly use pigments and dyes as colorants worthy of mention is the carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of these non biodegradable and highly toxic chemical substances mandal et al 2021 yin et al 2019 broadly dyes can be categorized as schematically depicted in fig 1 the dyeing industries relied on synthetic pigments and they have experienced global expansion reaching approximately 8 105 tons of synthetic dyes manufactured per annum bhatia et al 2017 jamee and siddique 2019 obviously textile industries are accountable for 75 of dyestuff market globally with about ten thousand varieties of dyes applied for coloring and or printing of different types of fabrics madhav et al 2018 excessive application of dyes or pigments causes some of the dyes not to be well fixed on the textile or food and leads to contamination of surface water and groundwater via effluent discharged santos and boaventura 2008 one of the easiest contaminants to be recognized by naked eye is color and thus needed to be eliminated before being discharged into surrounding water bodies zhu et al 2011 aquatic animals suffer from low dissolved oxygen due to enhanced chemical oxygen demand resulting from dye pollution and other toxicity related effects the presence of synthetic dyes in industrial effluents often decreased the quantity of light penetrating into the water body leading to more biochemical oxygen demand bod impairment of the photosynthetic related activities of aquatic flora and thereby negatively impacting the food source of aquatic organisms annuar et al 2009 kumar et al 2020 apart from affecting flora photosynthetic activities the discharge of synthetic dyes aesthetically makes water unfit and objectionable saravanan et al 2013 as regards human health previous studies by environmentalists and eco toxicologists have also confirmed that drinking or intake of synthetic dye containing water can cause genotoxic mutagenic and carcinogenic effects chowdhury and saha 2010 nekouei et al 2015 congo red cr or 1 naphthalenesulfonic acid 3 3 4 4 biphenylenebis azo bis 4 amino disodium salt is a typical example of synthetic anionic azo dye figs 1 and 2 that find application in rubber plastic textile paper printing and dyeing industries costa et al 2020 mandal et al 2021 table 1 reveals the physico chemical properties of cr characteristically cr has a stable aromatic structure non biodegradable and is deleterious to aquatic animals and human health sud et al 2008 it is therefore very germane to treat effluents containing cr before it is released into the environment scientists have largely investigated and reported a number of treatment technology for cr physical chemical and biological with their inherent challenges disadvantages advantages limitations applicability costs and so on so far about 6563 publications of various types have been published as documented in scopus search with search word congo red dye research articles has the highest percentage contribution of 6081 while about only 98 review articles on cr dye have been published till the time of compiling this review as shown in fig 3 thus this necessitates the need to compile compare contrast and makes suggestions on previous research reports on cr toxicities and removal strategies this systematic and comprehensive synthesis of reported studies on cr elimination shall put in detail the various methods applicable for the effective removal of cr so far reported in literature adsorption technology membrane technology non photochemical and photochemical removal methods biodegradation and biocatalytic degradation and the influence of variables controlling cr removal by adsorption technology the review would conclude by highlighting and recommending the effective cost effective and practicable cr elimination technique as well as the research gaps for future work 2 congo red dye 2 1 uses of congo red dye 2 1 1 application of congo red dye in amyloidosis studies amyloidosis is an abnormal condition where a protein compound known as amyloid is being synthesized which primarily affects and damage the human organs also neurological diseases such as parkinson s and alzheimer disease were known to possess ripple effect through the accumulation of insoluble form of amyloid plaques in the nerve tissue yakupova et al 2019 it has been posited that chemistry of interaction of cellulose is synonymous to that of cr yakupova et al 2019 bhaduri et al 1967 hydrogen bonding exists between the linear molecules of cellulose and cr according to virchow et al amyloids in human tissues were visualized as having similar structure to cellulose hence it was believed that the interaction of amyloids with cr also follows similar fashion like cellulose yakupova et al 2019 bhaduri et al 1967 puchtler et al proposed that the hydrogen bonding interaction occurs from the hydroxyl group of the polysaccharide chain and the amino group of cr compounds puchtler et al 1962 as shown in fig 4 however it is worthy to note that there may be disparity in the mechanism of interaction of cr with amyloids and that of cellulose cr was firstly used during laboratory studies to diagnose amyloidosis in 1923 where comparative studies was carried out between 21 healthy subjects injected with 1 solution of cr and with patients who are recipients of different diseases yakupova et al 2019 the results showed that for patients diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome cr disappeared in their blood stream faster than those with without any disease this implies that there is an interaction between cr and amyloid containing specie in the blood stream thus confirming presence of amyloidosis although several criticisms unger and zuckerbrod 1948 arise on the suboptimal effect of cr for the diagnosis of amyloidosis the development of cr staining methods for the diagnosis of amyloidosis has continued to this day initially intravenous injection of cr was adopted for clinical practice for approximately 40 years but this was substituted by staining of histological sections and biopsies with cr dye howie and brewer 2009 2 1 2 application of congo red dye in textile industries organic dyes absorb light around 400 750 nm of the visible region due to the presence of auxochromes and chromophoric substances in their structure pande et al 2019 dyes applied for textile and fabric production exhibit a varied range of structures including chromophore azo indigo arylmethane and anthraquinone groups and chemical properties such as solubility and reactive functional groups lewis 2008 chromophore describes the chromogenic part conjugated double bonds of a molecule that makes molecule to absorb visible light 400 nm 800 nm and reflect a particular color on the other hand auxochrome are functionalities or moieties in a molecule that are capable of altering the light absorption intensity and or wavelength of chromophore like oh nh2 cooh etc the auxochrome and chromophoric functionalities so3 2 benzene ring and nh2 make cr find application in dyeing technology in primitive period dyes were obtained by extraction from plants roots of trees and biotic parts jiang et al 2021 due to increasing demand from industries to produce textile materials in large quantity colorant and need to optimize the fixative characteristics of color on fabrics thus synthetic dyes are produced in large quantities of which cr dye is one mishra et al 2021 annually various types of dyes are manufactured globally in a measure of up to 108 tons this is particularly true for azo dyes 60 70 of the total e g cr harja et al 2022 based on demographic distribution of dyes and according to production and usage asian countries are the largest leading producer of dyestuffs due to the decline of production of dyestuff by developed countries like united states and europe based on production of textile materials china accounts for 40 of textile production which makes china to be the country with largest production of textile materials while the second largest producer is india with 9 pensupa et al 2017 2 1 3 application of congo red in optoelectronics the interaction between matter and light and numerous applications in different fields of materials science is intriguing kocyigit et al studied the light detection performance of the congo red dye in a schottky type photodiode kocyigit et al 2022 it was proved that the fabricated device co cr n si has dichroic characteristics and hence can be applied in optoelectronic applications the device co cr n si was reported to enhance light power intensity from 100 mw cm2 to 400 mw cm2 ascribed to the charge carriers increment in the interface by light illumination at reverse biases jini et al evaluated the impact of cr doping on magnesium sulfate mgso4 crystal jini et al 2022 it was found that the optical biological structural electrical and morphological activities of the doped material were enhanced the uv visible spectrum investigation of cr doped crystals indicated a characteristic absorption band at 230 245 nm ascribed to the doping of cr the cr hued and non dyed crystals have computed band gaps of 5 1 and 4 98 5 1 ev respectively authors conclude that the improved optical biological dielectric and photoconductivity properties of the cr dyed mgso4 crystals were also improved as a result of cr dye doping 2 2 toxicity of congo red dye among the class of organic dyes synthesized by the textile industries azo dyes are intensely used and accounted for a large amount of dyes introduced into water bodies such as streams and surface run offs which leads to environmental contamination however during the dyeing and bleaching process a significant amount 15 is lost and discharged into the environment pande et al 2019 tahsin et al 2019 eco toxicity studies of textile dyestuff conducted by ecological and toxicological association of the dyestuffs manufacturing industry discovered that about 90 of colorants used in fabric dyeing process have lethal dose value 2000 mg kg mishra et al 2021 vikrant et al 2018 aquatic flora constitutes a main source of protein for human diet thus the consumption of aquatic animals known to have bioaccumulated cr can induce sicknesses like hypertension fever and cramps amer et al 2022 sharma et al 2022 previous studies have assessed the toxicity of cr on the photosynthetic metabolism and growth of green algae i e chlorella vulgaris findings revealed that chlorella vulgaris experienced a reduced rate of development photosynthetic activity and respiration hernández zamora et al 2014 hernández zamora and martínez jerónimo 2019 in addition according to chlorophyll measurement using fluorescence emission spectroscopic technique it was found that at elevated cr concentration the donor site of photosystem ii psii can be impaired cr also reduce the rate of electron transport performance index pi and electron transport quantum yield of psii furthermore a high concentration of cr in water inhibits light penetration thereby impairing aquatic fauna and flora biological activity and reducing dissolved oxygen concentrations ghaedi et al 2015 ultimately the alteration in the biological activity negatively impacts the photosynthetic activity of aquatic flora by triggering eutrophication sequel to uninhibited release of mineral elements adomas and others investigated the effect of congo red cr and gentian violet gv dyes on the biosynthesis of biogenic amines using l minor adomas et al 2020 evidently the cr and gv dyes repressed chlorophyll biosynthesis production of biomass and l minor growth adomas et al 2020 comparatively the study found that gv was more toxic than cr because gv interrupted the biosynthetic processes for biogenic amines production the results show that biogenic amine levels and decarboxylase activity are very good early bio indicators of phytotoxicity effects of gv and cr on l minor dwivedi et al investigated the effects of cr on s platensis at various cr dye concentrations dwivedi 2013 the authors found that at high cr concentrations the growth of s platensis is highly suppressed this implies that algal cell growth is typically reduced at enhanced cr concentrations owing to possible toxicity of cr inside the cell and thus the rationale behind the s platensis growth inhibition cr dose relationship there is dearth of investigation on effects of cr on aquatic fauna hernández zamora and others evaluated the influence of cr on reproduction and existence of ceriodaphnia dubia hernández zamora et al 2016 the median lethal concentration lc50 in 48 h was found to be 13 58 mg l by making c dubia to feed on fresh algae control and algae previously exposed to cr it was reported that the fertility of c dubia decreased to 40 and 70 respectively and survival to 80 and 55 respectively when compared to the control sample hernández zamora et al 2016 it was concluded that cr is highly toxic to c dubia due to inhibitory effects on fertility and survival of c dubia at concentrations exceeding 3 mg l and that the type and amount of food taken had a significant effect too furthermore benzidine 1 1 biphenyl 2 amine 1 1 biphenyl 4 amine n phenyl 4 phenylazo benzenamine a degradation product of cr has been found to be extremely toxic to biological system generally azobenze is a known carcinogen with human carcinogen potency factor of 1 08 10 1 mg kg day 1 when orally exposed benzidine is therefore an established mutagenic oberly et al 1984 and carcinogenic meigs et al 1986 chemical substances that has ability to induce cancer of the bladder in humans and other kinds of cancer in model animals prokof eva 1971 overall in aquatic environment cr can severely affect metabolic processes and development in photosynthetic organisms flora and aquatic fauna simply by changing the ecological functioning of the environment when discharged without proper and thorough treatment pande et al 2019 rather et al 2018 based on the toxicity information it is crucial to eliminate the pollution load caused by the release of this carcinogenic contaminant via the treatment of wastewater generated during various dye related industrial processes in order to achieve this remediation process various methods such as physical chemical and biological methods have been researched and adopted for detoxifying and decolorizing cr laden effluents mishra et al 2021 mishra and maiti 2018 giannakoudakis et al 2018 kumar and gupta 2020 however the selection of a cheap effective simple and feasible treatment process is very crucial mishra and maiti 2018 3 removal strategies of congo red dye 3 1 physical removal strategies 3 1 1 adsorption technology adsorption is a separation process by which solute adsorbate pollutant is attracted or attached to the surface of an adsorbent in an aqueous medium by any form of attractive force van der waals hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic bonding or chemisorption rashed 2013 it has been reported as one of the most effective techniques for the removal of dye in wastewater treatment plants as well as contaminants of emerging concern due to its flexibility adaptability and ease of operation donkadokula et al 2020 oladoye 2022 various adsorbents used for the removal of cr range from natural products clay zeolite natural phosphate agricultural waste plant materials to synthetic adsorbents graphene polymers composites metal organic frameworks biogenic nanocomposites etc adeyemo et al 2017 piaskowski et al 2018 of all activated carbon is the most frequently used adsorbent due to its high adsorption capacity surface characteristics of its functional group versatility and stability foo and hameed 2010 however its high production cost and problem of regeneration have driven research into the use of economically viable carbon based materials with high efficiency and ease of regeneration to replace expensive commercial activated carbon comparatively literature revealed that natural adsorbents fly ash peat bagasse zeolites clay minerals illite kaolinite bentonite and montmorillonite have low price 1 0 usd per 1000 g momina et al 2018 which makes them more suitable adsorbents when compared to expensive commercial activated carbon other adsorbents like metal organic frameworks oladoye et al 2021 carbon nanotube jagusiak et al 2021 nanoparticles liu et al 2019 cnt based hybrid adsorbents zourou et al 2022 have been found to be almost four times higher in price when compared to that of natural adsorbents thus low cost natural adsorbents have attracted applicability in the treatment of cr dye containing wastewaters other examples of low cost materials or items for adsorption of cr dye are listed in fig 5 3 1 1 1 clay minerals clay is a naturally occurring hydrous aluminosilicate mineral that contains both tetrahedral silicon sheets si2o5 2 and octahedral aluminum gibbsite sheets adeyemo et al 2017 many clay minerals are extensively expended for cr adsorption due to their organic molecule adsorption desorption properties özcan et al 2007 for instance the acid base dissociation of the hydroxylated oxides of clay minerals results in ion exchange mechanism apart from diffusion of cr dye into the porous mineral montmorillonite kaolinite smectite halloysite sepiolite illite and chlorite are the classes of clay minerals of which montmorillonite sepiolite and kaolinite are generally used because of their large surface area chemical thermal inertness low cost and structural properties srinivasan 2011 fig 6 shows the layered sheet and particle structure and or arrangement of clay minerals the presence of several active sites like hydroxylated oxides on the surface makes them good adsorbents for dyes and thus effective materials for the remediation of environmental contaminants through exchange of ionic cr dye srinivasan 2011 otunola and ololade 2020 previous studies have reported the use of natural clay bentahar et al 2017 bentonite modified clay material bhattacharyya and ray 2015 hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide modified bentonite fosso kankeu et al 2016 belachew 2020 kaolinite chit ailp kaolinite ahmad et al 2021 acid treated montmorillonite and kaolinite bhattacharyya et al 2015 and acid activated sepiolite organic modified nano fibres vahidhabanu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for the removal of cr because of their cost effectiveness availability swelling properties surface hydrophobicity low toxicity and tendency for exchange of ions massaro et al 2018 clay materials have been used as a substitute for commercially available adsorbents with very comparable maximum adsorption capacity as shown in table 2 3 1 1 2 agriculturally based adsorbent the use of agricultural by products as adsorbents for the treatment of environmental contaminant not only provide a low cost effective eco friendly adsorbent but also minimize amount of waste generated and disposal problems different agricultural by products used for the adsorption of cr are jujuba seed reddy et al 2012 rice husk bamroongwongdee et al 2019 wood biomass stjepanović et al 2021 moringa oleifera seed coat jabar et al 2020b pineapple peels dai et al 2020b tea waste foroughi dahr et al 2015a b eichhornia crassipes roy and mondal 2017 walnut shell ojo et al 2019 agro wastes contain hemicellulose lignin cellulose starch protein as well as hydroxyl and carboxyl group that enhance adsorption efficiency via various uptake or interaction physico chemical mechanisms indeed the mechanism of ad sorption cr dye onto agriculturally based adsorbents occur by two separate forms of interactions for example weak interactions such as van der waals force π π and n π interactions and strong interactions like formation of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction have been described as the mechanistic uptake pathway for cr liu et al 2010 mattson et al 1969 finally the delocalization of lone pair of electrons on oxygen atoms of agriculturally based ad sorbents into the π orbital of the cr dye aromatic rings arises from the n π interactions and also responsible for cr adsorption by agro wastes achour et al 2021 the processing of agriculturally based adsorbent involves physical chemical thermal treatments or a combination of any to give the needed final adsorbents for cr removal see fig 7 aside the agricultural by products siliceous materials such as perlite silica glass fibres alunite and dolomite are also used for the removal of cr table 3 presents the adsorption capacity of different agriculturally sourced adsorbents for the treatment of cr dye containing wastewater 3 1 1 3 nanoparticles adsorption processes using nanoparticles are highly effective methods for mitigating the presence of both organic and inorganic contaminants in wastewater treatment plants as nanoparticles have exceptionally large surface areas small diffusion resistance higher adsorption capacities and faster adsorption equilibrium they are useful alternatives to commercial activated carbon ahmad et al 2015 while several nano adsorbents have demonstrated impressive adsorption capacities and features it is worth noting that a lot of them still fall short in terms of durability efficiency and the potential to be used in industry this is owing to a variety of factors including a proclivity for agglomeration the possibility of oxidation in iron based materials and regeneration difficulties as a result strategies for making the most of nanoparticles and maximizing their applications were achieved through surface modification manyangadze et al 2020 for example cnt impregnated chitosan hydrogel showed 450 4 mg g removal of cr than chitosan without surface modification 200 mg g based on langmuir adsorption modelling chatterjee et al 2010 likewise the potential of novel cross linked chitosan for the elimination of cr has been investigated zahir et al 2017 the authors reported that adsorption capacity increases with increase in contact time temperature and initial concentration of cr whereas reduces with increase in ph and dosage the equilibrium maximum cr adsorbed from sips isotherm model was found to be 1447 mg g for urea diammonium tartrate modified chitosan udmc while 1597 mg g was achieved for diammonium tartrate modified chitosan dmc polyhedral cuprous oxide nanoparticle cu2o nps was reported as the first nanoparticle to achieve maximum adsorption of cr 3904 mg g at 20 c following freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order model shu et al 2015 different nanoparticles used for removal of cr are fexco3 xo4 liu et al 2019 graphene oxide chitosan fibers du et al 2014 gamma aluminum oxide zhang et al 2019a mgo nanoparticles priyadarshini et al 2021 zno mwcnt arabi et al 2019 besides van der waals hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic bonding the other mechanisms mentioned in literature for uptake of cr dye by various adsorbents like nanocomposites ahmad et al 2020 2021 are shown in fig 8 recently various studies on the use of biogenic nanocomposites in removing toxic cr from wastewater are emerging in the recent studies biochar prepared from s robusta leaves was used to prepare ag nbc together with biosynthesized agnps using s robusta leaves extract shaikh et al 2021 the ag nbc indicated 90 removal efficiency for both cr and rhodamine b rhb reusability studies was also promising as ag nbc revealed outstanding regeneration ability 80 removal for both cr and rhb during the 1st cycle however the removal efficiency reduced with further cycles 70 achieved up to the 3rd cycle shaikh et al investigated the suitability of fabricated biochar based hybrid ag nanocomposite for decontaminating cr from cr dye laden wastewater shaikh et al 2022a the nanocomposite nagbc containing nag and algal biomass as composite material was noted to exhibit thermostability meso porosity with active binding sites consisting of c o c c oh s o nh and c h cr removal efficiency of 95 92 was obtained qe 34 53 mg g with 0 5 g l of nagbc nanocomposite at solution ph 6 and room temperature the same research group shaik et al also conducted another study by compositing another material with nag shaikh et al 2022b this time tea leaf biochar was composited with nag to form nag tc it was noted that the nag tc matrix similarly exhibited heterogeneity thermostability and meso porosity as in the case of nagbc with enriched active surface functional groups the biogenic nanocomposite nag tc was found to be capable of removing cr dye with an efficiency of 94 10 at 300 k and cr concentrations 22 5 mg l these findings revealed the efficacy of biogenic nanocomposite in reducing cr dyes from dyes laden waste water table 4 below shows the adsorption capacity of nanoparticles and its composite for cr removal 3 1 1 4 metal organic frameworks mofs these days synthesized polymeric materials like metal organic frameworks mofs are finding applications in the treatment of cr laden wastewater mof synthesis can be tailored towards producing positively charged active sites required for electrostatic interaction with anionic dye like cr for remediation purposes davoodi et al synthesized a composite of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with fe3o4 to form zif 8 m 8 mif davoodi et al 2021 the synthesized composite was found to be crystalline superparamagnetic and with a high surface area 958 m2 g at solution ph 7 zif 8 m 8 mif achieved 99 9 removal efficiency for cr within 60 with a reported monolayer sorption capacity of 210 5 mg g liu et al prepared indium in mof in tatab for cr elimination j liu et al 2020 as expected the surface area of indium in mof in tatab was as high as 623 m2 g when tested indium in mof in tatab recorded complete elimination of cr within 6 min q max 299 mg g the authors attributed the phenomenal cr complete removal to the presence of triazine ring secondary amine and nitrogen in the synthesized mof panda et al assessed the efficacy of zirconium based metal organic frameworks zr mof uio 66 for the treatment of synthetic cr containing wastewater panda et al 2020 findings revealed a low q max of 80 mg g adjudging the material to be unsuitable for cr removal another research group yang et al attempted the modification of the zr mof by doping it with ce iii to produce ce ii uio 67 yang et al 2020a the dopant ce iii was found to greatly enhance the adsorptive potential of the zr mof with a surface area of 1911 9 m2 g and q max for cr uptake of 799 6 mg g it may be concluded that ce iii increase the adsorptive binding sites on the resultant materials for cr by increasing the overall positive charge and surface area also liu et al synthesized novel tremella like ferrocene based metal organic framework tmof nanosheets for cr decontamination l liu et al 2020 the tmof was reported to achieved q max of 254 1 mg g at ph 4 and the low monolayer adsorption capacity was ascribed to low surface area of the material 89 9 m2 g furthermore yang et al investigated the adsorption of cr using sulfo modified metal organic frameworks assigned as mil 101 so3h yang et al 2020b the mof synthesis was successful by variation of the molar concentration of terephthalic acid to monosodiumterephthalic acid during synthesis process a q max for cr uptake of 2592 7 mg g was achieved with a removal efficiency of 89 6 mil 101 cr skeleton was found to drive the sorption interaction between anionic cr and the mil 101 so3h recently mil 100 fe de fe mof composited with diatom with a surface area of 364 0 m2 g has been investigated for cr removal uthappa et al 2020 the composite was found to exhibit enhanced cr removal 98 1 at ph 7 relative to bare diatom with 7 9 removal efficiency first the characteristically low surface area 18 m2 g of bare diatom could be attributed to this low removal potential in addition it may be concluded that fe mof acts as the main material in the composite thereby enhancing surface functionality and area required for cr elimination in another related study fe mil 88nh2 fe mof was found to exhibit high 87 2 and fast removal tendency for cr with a q max of 769 1 mg g fu et al 2021 after 4th cycle the regeneration potential of fe mil 88nh2 showed 83 removal efficiency for cr the presence of amine functionality may be responsible for the effectiveness of the mof at eliminating cr dye table 5 shows the maximum adsorption capacity of mofs and composite mofs for cr 3 1 2 membrane technology membrane separation technology for the removal of synthetic dyes from wastewater treatment plants has gained increasing application due to its low energy consumption high elimination efficiency and low operation cost qasem et al 2021 it enhances the removal and recovery of dyes from wastewater since no heating is required the various techniques are ultrafiltration uf microfiltration mf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro table 6 presents the various membrane filtration types and applications 3 1 2 1 microfiltration mf microfiltration technique uses a membrane of pore size of 0 1 10 μm the large pore size makes it unsuitable for dye removal in textile wastewater treatment plants therefore limiting its application to the removal of suspended and colloidal dye particles singh and arora 2011 however its application in wastewater treatment plant could be enhanced when combined with other conventional treatment procedures iaich et al reported 91 99 cr removal with three low cost ceramic microfiltration membrane made from moroccan clay these membranes were prepared by suspension and casting of clay powder on polyvinyl alcohol membrane m10 m12 and m10 25pva and water iaich et al 2021 various hyphenated microfiltration membrane have been reported for the successful removal of cr these are polypropylene hollow fibre microfiltration membrane 99 8 yu et al 2012b pvpf ptfe membrane 99 khumalo et al 2019a cof lzu1 99 9 su et al 2021 polyether sulfonate microfiltration with graphene oxide 90 homem et al 2019 this therefore confirms the effectiveness of microfiltration when applied in tandem with other conventional techniques 3 1 2 2 ultrafiltration uf ultrafiltration membrane has a pore size of 0 1 to 0 01 μm operated at high solvent permeation flux rate and low pressure gradient wang and zhou 2013 singh et al 2018 it can be used for the removal of high molecular weight solute ranging from 1000 to 100 000 da colloidal particles and soluble dyes moradihamedani 2021 however it is not suitable for low molecular weight solute and inorganic dyes to overcome this limitation its operation efficiency has been enhanced by coupling with other treatment processes and by surface modification ramutshatsha and nomngongo 2022 for example a dual functionalized psf pva ultrafiltration membrane was modified separately with zno and silica the zno modified membrane achieved 53 5 cr removal through adsorption and rejection also during the reusability studies the efficiency of the membrane decreased to 31 19 on the second cycle khumalo et al 2019b zwane et al reported 27 of cr removal by un modified polyethersulfone pes membrane but when modified with chromolaena odorata co pes co adsorption efficiency increases to 85 the adsorption of cr occurred on the heterogeneous surface through the formation of a multilayered surface by the langmuir freundlich isotherm zwane et al 2019 thus ultrafiltration is also effective upon membrane modification or functionalization 3 1 2 3 reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis is characterized by a pore size of greater than 0 0001 μm with an operating pressure of 1000 5000 kpa while nanofiltration has a pore size of greater than 0 001 μm with an operating pressure of 500 1000 kpa wang and zhou 2013 singh et al 2018 both processes have low permeability and high operating pressure as compared to mf and uf which have high permeability and low operating pressure moradihamedani 2021 they can be used for the removal of both organic and inorganic compounds color bacteria and hardness however they are prone to fouling and scaling one basic method of eliminating this fouling and scaling limitations is by using of pre treated mf and uf joshi and purwar 2004 table 7 shows the summary of previous studies on the use of membrane technology for cr 3 1 3 coagulation and flocculation 3 1 3 1 coagulation and flocculation this treatment strategy is commonly applied in water works during water treatment for town water supply here coagulants are employed to increase the density of contaminants such that contaminant settle under gravity polymers and metal salts are mostly used for coagulation purposes on the other hand flocculants enhance the floc formation agglomeration or aggregation of contaminants and are usually polymeric substances al mutairi 2006 during this process coagulation flocculation flocculants are added to waste water and the mixture is vortexed such that the added coagulant traps impurities and the large flocs formed then settle by precipitation so far one of the effective natural coagulants to have been reported in literature is azadirachta indica and tamarindus indica these coagulants have been found to be effective at treating cr laden wastewater mathuram et al 2018 raghuwanshi et al evaluated agrobased materials abm like maize zea mays nirmali seed strychnos potatorum and surjana seed moringa oleifera as coagulant aid for cr removal raghuwanshi et al 2002 with the use of zea mays or strychnos potatorum as coagulant aid it was found that the dose of alum required reduced to 15 and 25 mg l respectively and the filtrate turbidity obtained was 0 2 ntu however when alum alone was applied at a dosage of 45 mg l the recorded filtrate turbidity levels was more than 1 ntu previous studies on chemical flocculants and or coagulants have been reported for cr removal for instance various salts of iron ferrous sulfate ferric chloride and ferric chloride sulfate hydrated lime and magnesium carbonate have been successfully used to remove azo dyes badawi and zaher 2021 li et al 2018 consequent upon flocculation coagulation the settled particles are then physically removed patel and vashi investigated the effectiveness of natural coagulant aid like maize seed powder msp surjana seed powder ssp and chitosan for cr removal patel and vashi 2012 it was reported that ssp recorded highest removal efficiency for cr 98 0 as against 94 5 and 89 4 obtained for chitosan and msp respectively at coagulant concentration of 25 mg l contact time of 60 min and solution ph of 4 similar reports on the effectiveness of ssp has been reported elsewhere okuda et al 2001 raghuwanshi et al 2002 chitosan possesses amino functionality that can be easily protonated to produce positively charged sites needed to electrostatically interact with anionic cr dye apart from hydrogen bonding interactions between the two molecules patel and vashi 2012 goudjil et al investigated the use of commercial powdered activated carbon pac agriculturally sourced polymers and lime ca oh 2 to improve the coagulation flocculation efficiency of aluminum sulfate as as coagulants aid goudjil et al 2021 it was reported that pac achieved elimination efficiency of 97 68 at 0 05 g l pac dose as against 99 06 of natural polymers at a dose of 0 02 g l this thus confirmed that the natural polymer has comparable coagulant aid property as the pac kristianto et al studied the suitability of leucaena leucocephala as a natural coagulant from seed kernel at solution ph 3 and coagulant dosage 10 ml l 99 9 cr removal was obtained with reduced sludge generated compared to the use of alum in a recent study kristianto et al investigated the applicability of galactomannan as coagulant aid for cr kristianto et al 2021 report has it that fecl3 alone achieved 27 5 cr removal while the addition of galactomannan increased the efficiency of fecl3 to 40 subsequent addition of galactomannan correspondingly increased cr removal although the sludge volume is also increased due to repulsive forces kristianto et al 2019 it can be concluded that both natural and chemical coagulants are effective at removing cr dye from wastewater 3 2 chemical removal methods chemical removal strategies are tailored towards complete remediation of organic contaminants containing wastewater through the mineralization of the organic contaminants alfred et al 2020 issaka et al 2022 the methods can be used to completely turn hazardous substances to non toxic substances by changing the chemical properties of the contaminants and this can be achieved through the application of chemical reagents and or reaction thereby producing other products that are useful and green these methods are characterized with some advantages like enhanced efficiency operation at low cost cost intensiveness inability to treat large volumes of wastewater cao et al 2022 rajasulochana and preethy 2016 cr is carcinogenic due to the presence of aromatic groups and thus the aromaticity makes it resistant to some biological degradation and or treatment methods hence chemical methods are developed to remove them from our ecosystems 3 2 1 non photochemical methods 3 2 1 1 ozonation ozonation in combinations with other oxidants like h2o2 o3 h2o2 has been used to treating waste water containing a number of organic contaminants fast et al 2017 as a result of the complex molecular structure of cr dye the great volume of wastewater generated by industries like textile paper and the need for immediate treatment of cr contaminant ozonation treatment application is therefore not suitable because the process is not time friendly additionally beside the high operational cost ozone is highly toxic and can produce carcinogenic by products and these demerits have limited extensive research into the use of ozone for the treatment of cr wastewater fast et al 2017 table 8 presents a few examples of previous studies using ozonation to remove cr as scanty works have been reported with respect cr ozonation 3 2 1 2 fenton system iron an element with good oxygen transfer qualities when reacted with hydrogen peroxide results in the production of hydroxyl radical which is a strong oxidant capable of oxidizing organic compounds kausley et al 2018 fenton reaction is the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by iron catalyst to produce hydroxyl radical and it is an acidic reaction mohajeri et al 2010 the oh reacts with organic pollutant causing degradation and or mineralization to carbon iv oxide and water ali et al 2014 this reaction originated in 1894 by fenton and its application started in 1960 huang et al 1993 the process involved in fenton system is agglomeration and oxidation lai et al 2020 h2o2 decomposition is catalyzed by ferrous ion to form oh and for the augmentation of other radicals which can fully oxidize organic matters such as cr table 9 shows the findings and or conclusions from fenton degradation of cr the mechanism of reaction in the fenton process has been accepted to be the formation of hydroxyl radical while the formation of the radical initiates organic contaminants oxidation as can be seen in the chemical equations 1 4 shen et al 2017 the hydroxyl radical oh has standard potential of 2 80 v making it a strong oxidizing agent zhu and chen 2021 the chemistry of the reaction gives a high formation rate constant when ferrous ion reacts with hydrogen peroxide fe2 is oxidized to fe3 at a short time in the presence of h2o2 even though hydroxyl radical is formed but more of it is produced in the reaction of the fe3 reacting with h2o2 roudi et al 2018 chemical equations 1 4 represent the chemical processes in fenton reaction system 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 h f e o o h 2 3 f e o o h 2 h o 2 f e 2 4 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h it has been noted that the removal of organic pollutant by fenton s reagent is dependent on fe3 h2o2 reaction and thus the main fenton s reagent this process has many merits which include high performance simplicity ability to be operated at room temperature rt and atmospheric pressure for the oxidation of organics the process has proven to be very effective at removing ubiquitous organic compound like cr capable of complete mineralization of organic contaminant into carbon iv oxide if desired produce less harmful by products and a rapid process with little maintenance amiri and sabour 2014 lai et al 2020 nevertheless fenton also has some built in disadvantages and thus its application is technically and or largely limited these includes strict ph range high h2o2 consumption and the accumulation of ferric sludge that affects the oxidation efficiency wang et al 2016 yuan et al 2013 to achieve a good working condition for this process an optimal amount of fe must be present for the production of hydroxyl radical necessary for contaminant oxidation once the concentration of iron increases impurity removal accelerates yang et al 2021 also temperature between 20 and 40 c is the best for this process at high temperatures hydrogen peroxide is quickly decomposed to oxygen and water preventing the production of oh parson gave the optimal ph in a fenton reaction to be between 2 and 4 and also noted that the formation of ferric oxyhydroxide at ph 2 8 could generate another adsorbent used for lead pb removal from aquatic media parsons 2004 rahimi et al reported that when the ph is between 2 and 4 the fenton oxidation is usually efficient rahimi et al 2015b furthermore the activity of fenton reagent is reduced with increasing solution ph due to the lack of active fe2 ion szpyrkowicz et al 2001 similarly at very low ph values iron complex species fe h2o 6 2 and oxonium ion h3o2 exist which reduces the reactivity between fe2 and h2o2 kavitha and palanivelu 2005 from these findings it can be established that the efficiency of the fenton process to degrade organic compounds is reduced both at high and very low solution ph the flow chart fig 9 depicts the various steps associated with a fenton oxidation process and further highlights the acid regulation the addition of iron catalyst the introduction of h2o2 and followed by mixing however the generation of sludge limits the use of this process for cr degradation table 9 show some studies on the application of fenton process for cr mineralization 3 2 2 photochemical methods photochemical treatment processes have gained attention due to their efficiency and ability to treat almost all solid components in textile effluents a photochemical method operates at any temperature and pressure and does not produce any biogenic component the basic mechanism involves the generation of hydroxyl radical umamaheswari et al 2018 this radical has proven to be able to degrade and mineralize textile effluents nikravesh et al 2020 whereby the generated hydroxyl radicals are generally accelerated by the combinations of some commonly used semiconductors when irradiated claudino et al 2020 3 2 2 1 photo fenton in order to circumvent the limitations associated with ferric sludge generation and to quickly degrade cr to non toxic substances fenton oxidation process has been modified to improve upon the limitations associated with it via the generation of a great volume of hydroxyl radical the main limitation of fenton based reaction is the oxidant and fe ion loss due to the radical scavenging effect of hydrogen peroxide zhou et al 2015 table 10 shows different studies on the degradation of cr via the photo fenton system photo fenton process is a reaction that involves ultraviolet uv light fe and h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radical that can degrade cr conventionally uv light was not used in the fenton process but its usage give rise to the production of more hydroxyl radical to be formed during photolysis and therefore promoting better degradation babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 without irradiation the reaction goes into completion when ferrous ion has been converted to ferric ion while during solar impartation there is photo reduction of fe3 to fe2 thereby giving rise to new formation of hydroxyl radical babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 as represented in the chemical equation below 5 f e 3 h 2 o 2 h v f e 2 o h h to enhance the efficiency of photo fenton distinct ligands such as edta edds oxalate and other organic carboxylic acid were added and complexed with fe3 under photocatalysis katsumata et al 2006 lai et al 2020 xu et al noted that the enhanced efficiency could be traced to ability of the ligands complexing with the fe to reduce fe3 to fe2 during irradiation causing hydroxyl radical resurgence and also to encourage the migration of h2o2 and oh radical generation rahim pouran et al 2015 hydroxyl radical is better generated here via photolysis therefore the dosage of catalyst is reduced thereby preventing iron sludge as we have in conventional fenton process giri and golder 2014 xiao et al 2014 however photo fenton is expensive if irradiation aside sunlight is used and as a result electrical energy consumption could be a challenge or limitation for the technical and or practical application of photo fenton reaction method furthermore to give a great production better hydroxyl radical and to improve the process ultrasound can be added to uv light a process known as sono photo fenton spf process vaishnave et al 2014 the sonolysis of water produces hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen atoms the intermediate complex formed due to the reaction of fe3 with h2o2 during the fenton reaction could be reduced to fe2 by sonolysis in a report the color of cr achieved about 90 decolourization when ph of 3 and 10 mg l of iron were used and about 80 cod removal was achieved in 120 min masalvad and sakare 2020 it was brought to awareness that there is an increase in degradation of cr between 24 17 and 60 as active hydroxyl radicals is formed during illumination time ranging from 1 to 10 h thereby giving room for the photolysis of h2o2 shaban et al 2017 3 2 2 2 catalyst uv light assisted advanced oxidation process previous studies have developed some photocatalysts for treating wastewater containing organic contaminants a catalyst is any substance that increases the rate of a reaction without itself being consumed consequently researchers have developed the following methods 3 2 2 2 1 catalytic ozonation this is the use of catalyst to surrogate controlled decomposition of ozone and hydroxyl radical formation catalytic ozonation provides fast degradation of organic pollutants and also more effective mineralization of both micropollutants and natural organic matter due to an increase in hydroxyl radical formation aided by catalyst incorporation in catalytic ozonation the catalysts are used with ozone to generate hydroxyl radicals a radical with more oxidation potential than ozone khuntia et al 2016 in previous studies many transition metal ions or oxides have been reported to improve pollutant degradation in water including cobalt ii nickel ii copper ii iron ii manganese ii and zinc ii for instance khuntia et al noted that metal ion catalyst increases the generation of the hydroxyl radical causing the oxidation of the pollutant directly and indirectly and also increasing the total organic carbon toc removal khuntia et al 2016 li et al was able to investigate catalytic ozonation via combination of ceramic membrane ccm filtration with catalytic ozonation it was noted that the removal efficiency increased from approximately 30 for the ceramic membrane for cr dye without catalyst coating to over 80 for the ccm with the catalyst coating the result was attributed to an increase in the hydroxyl radical generation li et al 2021 while the research supported catalytic ozonation as a good method of removing cr hu et al also used catalytic magnetic manganese ferrite ozonation on effluents from textile industries of which cr would have been among the dyes and the results showed that the catalyst enhanced dye degradation and a cod removal of about 25 higher than ordinary ozonation was achieved hu et al 2019 catalysts are safe compounds since they do not undergo any physical or chemical changes within the process thereby promoting its usage in degradation of diazo dyes furthermore sulfate radicals have been used to replace the hydroxyl radicals because of the higher solubility and reactivity of sulfate thermodynamically peroxymonosulfate pms is a very strong oxidant although its interaction with a large number of organic contaminants is quite slow and requires catalyst or activating agent after activating pms it produces sulfate radical s o 4 which play an important role in contaminant degradation s o 4 has high oxidation potential and is a powerful oxidant 2 5 0 31 v generated via the breaking of peroxo bond of persulfate ps or peroxymonosulfate pms it is noteworthy that pms has the potential to auto regulate the ph of the system via protonation in addition to sulfate radical hydroxyl radical is another significant radical released during activation ghanbari and moradi 2017b however hydroxyl radical has lower shorter half life 20 ns when compared with sulfate radical 30 40 μs attributed to the preference of sulfate radical to participate in electron transfer during its reaction with organic contaminants as against hydroxyl radical participation in different reactions both equally and non selectively li et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 from reported literature oxidation processes based on s o 4 are known to be very effective processes for the degradation of recalcitrant organic contaminants primarily due to powerful oxidation capability of the radical jegadeesan et al used sulfate radical to degrade cr carried out by using biogenic iron to activate ps and pms to degrade cr it was pointed out that the concentration of the catalyst will either increase degradation or result in scavenging of sulfate ion as it was further noted that excess of the oxidant increased degradation the result showed that the chemogenic iron nanoparticles with ps and pms gave the degradation of cr as follows c fe pms 86 b fe pms 83 c fe ps 75 b fe ps 63 jegadeesan et al 2019 figs 10 and 11 show the activation of pms by transition metal ion and sulfate radical chain reaction mechanism respectively 3 2 2 2 2 photocatalysis photocatalysis describes a photochemical method for pollutants removal lai et al 2020 via chemical reaction induced by solid catalyst which uses photonic energy as driving force for the chemical transformation ohtani 2008 this method has a high efficiency in degrading and mineralizing organic pollutants from water characterized with environmental friendliness low cost and generation of harmless by products tan et al 2020 shaban et al have noted that low cost and environmental heterogeneous photocatalysts could be adopted as approved means in the degradation of dyes and wastewater remediation application shaban et al 2017 photocatalysis ha advantage over other methods in degradation due to the use of solar energy especially in the visible light region in the production of hydroxyl radical a cheap and green process shaban et al 2017 there are several or different photocatalysts that have been synthesized like nanoparticles however a photocatalyst which is cost effective good environmental benign and abundance will be great in solving dye pollution the catalysts are semiconductors whose electronic structures are characterized by a filled valence band vb and an empty conduction band cb as graphically shown in fig 12 absorption of a photon by the semiconductor with photon energy higher than the band gap energy leads to excitation thereby causing a movement of electron from the vb to the cb implying an electron hole pair the excited electrons can react with electrophiles such as o2 that is dissolved in water and reduce it to form superoxide radical anion o2 equation 6 the holes can scout out h2o and oh molecules on the surface of the nanoparticle to generate hydroxyl radicals which can degrade or mineralize pollutants like cr to form water and carbon iv oxide equations 6 13 akerdi and bahrami 2019 6 s e m i c o n d u c t o r hv h e 7 o 2 e o 2 8 h h 2 o o h h aq 9 h d y e p r o d u c t s 10 o h d y e p r o d u c t s 11 e o 2 o 2 aq 12 e 1 2 o 2 h 2 o

nabi et al 2020 harun et al revealed that heterogenous degradation is very effective to remove pollutant like cr harun et al 2018 when compared degradation between irradiation solar and uv light and with without catalyst high degradation of 66 69 and 64 72 were achieved using uv light and direct sunlight both with tio2 however a very low degradation of below 40 without catalyst was obtained this implies that degradation with both catalyst and irradiation removes cr from our ecosystem harun et al 2018 in order to avoid all these restraints in the application of photocatalysis band gaps of semiconductors have been narrowed to activate their photoactivity efficiency under visible or near infrared light which is widely available and safer compared to uv radiation several ways of doping the semiconductors have also been developed like self doping zhang and zhang denoted that self doping is able to modify the electronic and band structures of semiconductors to increase their photocatalytic activities marcelino and amorim 2019 zhang and zhang 2010 in recent era extensive efforts have been made to develop a large number of semiconductor materials like tio2 zno agcl biocl wo3 and cds for potential applications as photocatalysts for photodegradation of organic pollutants meribout et al 2016 a nanocomposite bismuth oxychloride was doped with polyaniline and iron biocl pani fe was synthesized to degrade cr the doping reduced the band gap of bismuth oxychloride 3 2 3 5 ev thus preventing recombination of the radicals in the cb to go back to vb also polyaniline pani 2 8 ev which is very stable to the environment and has a good collegiality was used to diffuse the iron particles enhancing the catalytic performance this doping increases the bet surface area which improved dye adsorption and photocatalytic activities velmurugan et al 2015 wang et al 2013 oladoye et al 2021 table 11 reveals the effectiveness of different semi conductors and or nanocomposites as photocatalyst for cr degradation 3 2 2 3 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes advanced oxidation processes aops is a method capable of achieving complete mineralization of organic pollutants with the use of a powerful oxidant such as hydroxyl radicals ho cheng et al 2020 electrochemical advanced oxidation is a good example with respect to the direct or indirect generation of hydroxyl radical through a clean and effective means thereby aiding mineralization of pollutants like cr although this process has demerits like high costs due to the electric supply needed and that the reactions go through some ph ranges compared to photocatalysis the catalyst is not usually reused the reaction is slow and sometimes long reaction times are sometimes needed to destroy resistant intermediates radjenovic and sedlak 2015 in addition intermediate by products can be more toxic than their parent compounds seibert et al 2020 phillips et al used electrochemical oxidation on boron doped diamond bdd eo anodes to degrade cr phillips et al 2018 the assays which was conducted in a single compartment electrochemical flow cell and in galvanostatic mode achieved almost total chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc removals of cr solano et al studied the degradation of 0 260 mm of diazo dye cr at ph 3 0 using electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops like photoelectro fenton ef electro fenton pef and anodic oxidation with electrogenerated h2o2 ao h2o2 in these systems cr was mainly degraded by oh produced from water oxidation at anode and or from fenton s reaction of fe2 and cathodically generated h2o2 findings revealed that approximate mineralization of cr was achieved within a period of 6 h of pef at j 66 7 ma cm 2 attributed to parallel photolytic action of uva light solano et al 2015 maldonado larios et al investigated the applicability of titanium dioxide polyaniline pani nanocomposite films for the electroremediation of cr it was found that composite 2 1 tio2 pani achieved an approximate 60 cr decontamination after 90 min interaction time see fig 13 the nanocomposites were found to be effective at removing cr by electrocatalysis than by adsorption or photocatalysis maldonado larios et al 2020 elahmadi et al employed ozonation and electrochemical processes to degrade cr the electrochemical processes achieved total toc and cod removals unlike ozonation process that attained only 81 and 85 of toc and cod removals faouzi elahmadi et al 2009b sathishkumar et al confirmed the effectiveness of cr degradation by electrochemical oxidation it was found that cr pre treatment by electrochemical oxidation before biological textile dye effluent treatment achieved 98 decolourization within 10 min at nacl concentration current density and ph of 2 gl 1 20 ma cm 2 and 7 respectively sathishkumar et al 2019 akhtar et al investigated electrocoagulation of cr by optimizing the process parameters akhtar et al 2020 the study reported the use of 36 9 kj of electrical energy to obtain 97 and 89 color and cod removal respectively at cr concentrations of 1000 mg l ph 3 and inter electrode distance of 3 cm the quantum analysis also revealed that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy of fe3 of 15 09 ev and cr with highest unoccupied molecular orbital homo energy of 5 58 ev display electron accepting and electron donating inclination respectively it is evident from these studies that electrochemical oxidation appears to be more effective and more economic than ozonation in terms of toc removals these results have also proved that other strong oxidants are electrogenerated from the oxidation of electrolyte such as persulfates and direct oxidation of cr and its by products on anodes accompanied with the hydroxyl radical mediated oxidation to achieve the total mineralization of organics 3 3 biological removal strategies biological method is one of the pivotal tools used for the elimination of persistent dyes from effluents and wastewaters biological methods are incredibly useful for the conversion of azo dyes into less toxic products considering the recalcitrant behavior to biodegradation saratale et al 2011 removal strategies by biological method is beneficial in the sense that it is environmentally friendly as it does not involve the use of toxic chemicals for the elimination of the dye producing chemical substance that are less toxic compared to azo dye and it is cost effective since most of the microbes can be cultured easily in the laboratory saratale et al 2011 the mechanism of this removal involves the interaction of the organic dyes with microbes in effluents which in turn leads to the transformation of toxic chemicals into less harmful forms this removal is aided by the influence of enzymatic reactions in the microbial systems different enzymatic pathways to the degradation products includes hexane oxidase saratale et al 2006 2011 lignin peroxidase duran and esposito 2000 laccase hatvani and mecs 2001 and nadh dcip reductase bhosale et al 2006 there is a wide pool of microbes reported in literature for the elimination of dyes and these are potentially capable of removing azo dyes from solution these microbes includes bacteria dawkar et al 2008 yeasts saratale et al 2009 fungi fournier et al 2004 algae daneshvar et al 2007 and actinomycetes machado et al 2006 3 3 1 biodegradation biodegradation of organic dyes often follows the decolourization of the dye using microbial agents common microbes used for this process includes fungi bacteria yeasts and actinomycetes filamentous shaped fungi are known to be ubiquitous in environments mostly inhabiting soils effluents and organic waste material fungi typically possess attributes to adapt their metabolic activities to varieties on carbon and nitrogen sources which is crucial for their survival concerning biodegradation of organic dyes using fungi most of studies in literature has focused on application of white rot fungi cultures for the degradation of azo dyes machado et al 2006 saratale et al 2011 fungi cultures commonly used for azo dye removal includes phanerochaete chrysosporium trametes versicolor aspergillus ochraceus bjerkandera adusta saratale et al 2006 2011 heinfling et al 1998 humnabadkar et al 2008 pointing and vrijmoed 2000 furthermore degradation of azo dyes using varieties of bacteria occurs in oxic anoxic and facultative anoxic conditions the pathways of decomposition of azo dyes using bacteria strands involves the reductive breaking of the azo dye bonds n n using an enzymatic azoreductase agent under anoxic conditions chang and kuo 2000 saratale et al 2011 the oxidoreductive enzymes are accountable for producing highly reactive free radicals that trigger a multifaceted series of spontaneous cleavage reactions saratale et al 2011 this resulting reaction leads to the formation of a potentially hazardous colorless aromatic amines this intermediate formed is further degraded under oxic and anoxic conditions bacterial method for the degradation and decolourization of azo dyes is intensely utilized due to its application for degrading wide varieties of azo dye compounds effective mineralization and ecofriendly nature verma and madamwar 2003 rai et al 2005 saratale et al 2009 3 3 2 biocatalytic degradation catalytic reduction is often preferred to other methods due to the application of reduction products in diverse fields naseem et al 2018b peculiar challenges related to other conventional method includes disadvantages like high cost volume of waste generated after decontamination the exchange of dye between two media processing time is slow and toxic by products production and so on in this decolourization approach cr compounds are lyzed at azo bond during reaction and are converted into less toxic and eco friendly products hence catalytic reduction of cr as environmental and industrial significance when compared to other methods naseem et al 2018a one of the common methods of catalytic removal of congo red is the application of sodium borohydride nabh4 the mechanism of reaction follows the following steps as shown in fig 14 upon dissociation of nabh4 to form bh4 it diffuses along with congo red dye to the surface of a nanoparticle hydrogen atom released from bh4 attacks congo red dye which activates the dye s azo bond initially congo red are attached to the nanoparticles through the sulphur and oxygen atom in the structure the azo bond is primarily weakened through the conjugation which leading to the lysis of the azo bond upon complete reduction the colorless solution is developed because of conversion of n n to nh nh bond and subsequent breakage of the hn nh bond due to acceptance of electron through a catalyst and hydrogen from bh4 ions jia et al 2014 naseem et al 2018a 4 influences of some variables on adsorption of congo red dye considering the fact that some removal strategies have some drawbacks for instance treatment of cr by membrane filtration technology is often accompanied with fouling of membrane and generation of sludge without the formation of harmful and toxic intermediates while photo catalytic degradation and biodegradation release toxic intermediate compounds like aniline and cycloheptadienylium m z 91 and sodium naphthalene sulfonate m z 227 respectively asses et al 2018 hence the sludge formed and its disposal challenges are main drawbacks also the choice of removal strategy is also dictated by operational costs consequently the adsorption process is considered to be one of the most effective and low priced treatment processes to eliminate dyes in wastewater and is commonly researched as shown in fig 15 the effectiveness of an adsorption is dependent on contact time concentration of the adsorbent and pollutant type of the adsorbent functional group attached to the surface of the adsorbent operating condition of adsorption system and others which requires to be studied understood and optimized in order to construct and or operate an effective wastewater treatment plant wwtp 4 1 influence of adsorbent concentration the concentration of adsorbent is an important parameter that influence the adsorption procedures and determines the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent at an increased concentration the number of functional groups and or active binding site increases and can result in increased cr removal however when removal percentage reaches a constant value there is a simultaneous decrease in bio sorption capacity this decrease is attributed to the saturation of surface sorption sites that leads to an increase in electrostatic repulsion between the dye molecules present in the medium stjepanović et al 2021 this was proven by the study carried out by wekoye et al on the removal of cr with cabbage waste powder cwp as the concentration of the adsorbent increases from 0 25 to 1 78 mg g the adsorption of the pollutant also increases from 4 88 to 48 76 however the rate of adsorption decreases when all the active sites of the cwp are fully saturated wekoye et al 2020 using activated carbon aminu et al investigated the effectiveness of adsorbent dosage in the removal of cr dye aminu et al 2020 the activated carbon used was prepared from jujube seed the graph in fig 16 shows the results of their findings a dosage rage of between 0 2 and 1 0 g was applied and the percent removal at each dosage application was recorded it was established that the increase in adsorbent dosage has resulted to an equally increase in the adsorption of the dye to a greater degree aminu et al 2020 in contrast to the proportional relationship described above for adsorbent dose and cr uptake khaniabadi et al reported a decrease in cr adsorption from 37 8 to 2 8 mg g when the concentration of montmorillonite increases from 1 to 9 g l as shown in fig 17 this is due to lower equilibrium concentration when higher dose was used than when lower dosage was used khaniabadi et al 2018 and the ability of the adsorbate to form agglomerate at higher concentration thereby resisting the adsorption of the dye on the adsorbent amran and zulfikar 2010 priyadarshini et al 2021 this means adsorbent dose needs to be optimized and the dose depends on the nature of the adsorbent 4 2 influence of contact time adsorption depends on the contact time between the adsorbate and the adsorbent stjepanović et al 2021 at the start of an adsorption experiment the functional groups of the adsorbent are readily available for interaction which increases the rate of adsorption as adsorption continues the functional group attached to the surface of the adsorbent becomes used up the rate of adsorption decreases accordingly and finally reaches a dynamic equilibrium with a maximum value where the rate of adsorption equals the rate of desorption at this point the dye is transported from the site of the bio sorbent surface to the internal sites of the bio sorbent hence a slow removal of dye bhattacharyya and ray 2015 wycliffe et al reported with the use of eichhnornia crassippes root 98 of cr was removed at 90 min sorption equilibrium wanyonyi et al 2014 the amount of dye adsorbed at a particular time t and at equilibrium is calculated as 14 q t c o c t v m where co is the initial dye concentration mg l ct is the dye concentration at any time t v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass of adsorbent the percentage of dye adsorbed is calculated as 15 a d s o r p t i o n 100 c o c t c o as shown in fig 18 above giwa et al monitored the effect of contact time on cr and reported an increase in the adsorption of cr from 1 16 to 2 75 mg g as the contact time increased from 60 to 1080 with parkia bioglobosa pine saw dust giwa et al 2021 a study on the use of eichnornia crassipes biomass adsorbent showed that 80 of cr was removed within 15 min of the experiment due to the large surface area of the adsorbent and reduces when equilibrium was attained at 45 min s due to the saturation of the active site on the surface of the adsorbent khaniabadi et al 2018 4 3 influence of solution ph the ph of the solution is another factor that affect the efficiency of adsorption due to its influence on the surface binding site of the adsorbent and the ionization of the dye molecule a change in the ph of the system can lead to change in the ionization and speciation of the dye and change in the active site of the adsorbent vijayakumar et al 2009 cr is an anionic dye slightly soluble at ph value 2 and negatively charged at ph range 5 10 in addition when ph phpzc the surface of the adsorbent becomes negatively charged favoring the adsorption of cation while when the ph phpzc the surface becomes positively charge favoring anionic specie uptake stjepanović et al 2021 this justifies the report of ferrarini et al that cr is best adsorbed at ph 5 acidic ph ferrarini et al 2016 and also by zulfika et al as illustrated in table 12 below zulfika et al 2017 from table 9 the adsorption of cr an anionic decreases as the ph increases this is as a result of the point of zero charge of cr being 8 6 therefore as the ph increases above the point of zero charge 8 6 ph phpzc the surface of the adsorbent becomes negatively charged resulting in a repulsive force between the adsorbent and the pollutant and lower percentage removal while at a lower ph ph phpzc the surface of the adsorbent becomes positively charged promoting the adsorption of the dye onto the surface of the aluminum dross and hence increasing the percentage removal zulfika et al 2017 aside from the surface charge of the adsorbent the functional group attached to the surface also enhanced the electrostatic interaction with the pollutant this was shown by lafi et al where coffee waste cw was used for the synthesis of activated carbon with the adsorption efficiency of cr decreasing from 25 5 to 12 mg g when the ph changes from 2 9 to 10 2 lafi et al 2019 as shown in fig 19 this effect was attributed to oxygen group attached to the prepared activated carbon which increases the surface acidity of the adsorbent thereby making the surface positively charged for electrostatic attraction or interaction with the r so3 functional group of cr lafi et al 2019 this finding was also supported by ausavasukhi et al 2016 according to this study at ph 5 the surface of the carbonized leonardite was positively charged due to protonation of the hydroxyl and carboxylic groups of the leonardite this promote the electrostatic π π interaction between the functional group of the adsorbent and cr for higher adsorption capacity as shown in fig 20 ausavasukhi et al 2016 in summary the optimum solution ph for effective removal of cr by adsorption is within ph 1 5 whereby the surface of adsorbent becomes positively charged and enhances electrostatic attraction between anionic cr and positively charged ad sorbent 5 conclusions this article reviewed the physical biological and chemical removal strategies for toxic cr dye from wastewater based on the review the following findings were observed emerging materials like mofs exhibits exceptionally high adsorption capacity for cr dye with mil 100 fe tma guo et al 2020 zif 8 chitosan x liu et al 2020 and nu uio 67 dong et al 2020 exhibiting maximum adsorption capacity of 1790 5 1221 and 2387 9 mg g respectively the chemical removal methods are effective but limited in application due to cost associated with it and likelihood of generating secondary toxic intermediates or pollutants during degradation like carcinogenic benzidine aniline cycloheptadienylium m z 91 and sodium naphthalene sulfonate membrane technology can be explored for cr removal but needs to be used in tandem with other conventional cr elimination strategies for effectiveness the feasibility of using microbial enzymes or microorganisms or the combination of both with a physicochemical method like adsorption may also be considered for the remediation of cr dye all the conventional treatment strategies for cr dye are linked to one or two limitations such as inability to treat large volumes of wastewater ineffectiveness expensiveness and method complexity with the exception of adsorption technology overall the summarized merits and demerits of various removal strategies for cr is presented in table 13 6 future research the following highlights the future research or challenges that needs to be focused on in order to achieve complete elimination of toxic cr dye from wastewater wastewater usually contain complex organic and inorganic pollutants and most findings have reported cr dye removal via adsorption without considering the impact of the presence of other pollutants hence future research should focus on the adsorption of the dye in the presence of other legacy or emerging contaminants of concern such as pesticides herbicides mercury hg lead pb cadmium perfluoroalkyl substances pfas etc in order to determine the efficacy of the adsorbent commonly a number of literatures reported mere lab bench scale adsorption removal strategies for cr dye studies its full application on industrial scale is yet to be fully explored due to scarcity of data or research on fixed column adsorption technology in the treatment of wastewater consequently more studies are needed on column adsorption of cr dye as it simulates the real wastewater treatment plant wwtp scenario declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11742,congo red cr dye is an organic pollutant of environmental concern it is applied in textile printing dyeing and rubber industries as colorant the carcinogenicity mutagenicity and various associated toxicities of cr to flora fauna and humas have necessitated the requirements for removal of cr from industrial cr laden waste water in this review a total number of 300 research and review based publications are selected and reviewed for more assessment the modelled toxicity effects of cr dye on aquatic fauna and flora are discussed with cr found to be phytotoxic to aquatic flora and also capable of interfering with the reproductive activity of aquatic fauna in addition the removal strategies for cr were thoroughly explored and discussed with adsorption technology offering best route for decontamination of cr due to some inherent advantages like regenerability of ad sorbents lack of production of secondary toxic contaminant simplicity and low cost nature when compared with others this synthesis concludes by recommending research in areas of column adsorption and assessment of adsorption removal of cr in the presence of co organic inorganic contaminant s graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment pollution congo red dye contaminant 1 introduction water is unarguably an invaluable natural resource required for life sustenance one of the challenges plaguing the world is access to clean water and drinking water the pollution of water occurs due to input of environmental stressors at concentration beyond maximum permissible level a water is contaminated or polluted when it is unfit for drinking or other purposes due to the presence of the likes of organic and or inorganic chemicals minerals or wastes emanating from industrial agricultural clinical and or domestic sources ajiboye et al 2022 ali et al 2019 basheer 2018 oladoye et al 2021 the industrial effluents contribute the most to surface and ground water pollution sequel to rapid globalization and urbanization there is an increased demand for items that are manufactured using dyes and heavy metals alqadami et al 2017 oladoye 2022 for instance copper cu and lead pb are some of heavy metals commonly found in waste waters around smelting electrical mining areas alothman et al 2020 while dyes and pigments are common in wastewater of some industries like food textile and pharmaceuticals which commonly use pigments and dyes as colorants worthy of mention is the carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of these non biodegradable and highly toxic chemical substances mandal et al 2021 yin et al 2019 broadly dyes can be categorized as schematically depicted in fig 1 the dyeing industries relied on synthetic pigments and they have experienced global expansion reaching approximately 8 105 tons of synthetic dyes manufactured per annum bhatia et al 2017 jamee and siddique 2019 obviously textile industries are accountable for 75 of dyestuff market globally with about ten thousand varieties of dyes applied for coloring and or printing of different types of fabrics madhav et al 2018 excessive application of dyes or pigments causes some of the dyes not to be well fixed on the textile or food and leads to contamination of surface water and groundwater via effluent discharged santos and boaventura 2008 one of the easiest contaminants to be recognized by naked eye is color and thus needed to be eliminated before being discharged into surrounding water bodies zhu et al 2011 aquatic animals suffer from low dissolved oxygen due to enhanced chemical oxygen demand resulting from dye pollution and other toxicity related effects the presence of synthetic dyes in industrial effluents often decreased the quantity of light penetrating into the water body leading to more biochemical oxygen demand bod impairment of the photosynthetic related activities of aquatic flora and thereby negatively impacting the food source of aquatic organisms annuar et al 2009 kumar et al 2020 apart from affecting flora photosynthetic activities the discharge of synthetic dyes aesthetically makes water unfit and objectionable saravanan et al 2013 as regards human health previous studies by environmentalists and eco toxicologists have also confirmed that drinking or intake of synthetic dye containing water can cause genotoxic mutagenic and carcinogenic effects chowdhury and saha 2010 nekouei et al 2015 congo red cr or 1 naphthalenesulfonic acid 3 3 4 4 biphenylenebis azo bis 4 amino disodium salt is a typical example of synthetic anionic azo dye figs 1 and 2 that find application in rubber plastic textile paper printing and dyeing industries costa et al 2020 mandal et al 2021 table 1 reveals the physico chemical properties of cr characteristically cr has a stable aromatic structure non biodegradable and is deleterious to aquatic animals and human health sud et al 2008 it is therefore very germane to treat effluents containing cr before it is released into the environment scientists have largely investigated and reported a number of treatment technology for cr physical chemical and biological with their inherent challenges disadvantages advantages limitations applicability costs and so on so far about 6563 publications of various types have been published as documented in scopus search with search word congo red dye research articles has the highest percentage contribution of 6081 while about only 98 review articles on cr dye have been published till the time of compiling this review as shown in fig 3 thus this necessitates the need to compile compare contrast and makes suggestions on previous research reports on cr toxicities and removal strategies this systematic and comprehensive synthesis of reported studies on cr elimination shall put in detail the various methods applicable for the effective removal of cr so far reported in literature adsorption technology membrane technology non photochemical and photochemical removal methods biodegradation and biocatalytic degradation and the influence of variables controlling cr removal by adsorption technology the review would conclude by highlighting and recommending the effective cost effective and practicable cr elimination technique as well as the research gaps for future work 2 congo red dye 2 1 uses of congo red dye 2 1 1 application of congo red dye in amyloidosis studies amyloidosis is an abnormal condition where a protein compound known as amyloid is being synthesized which primarily affects and damage the human organs also neurological diseases such as parkinson s and alzheimer disease were known to possess ripple effect through the accumulation of insoluble form of amyloid plaques in the nerve tissue yakupova et al 2019 it has been posited that chemistry of interaction of cellulose is synonymous to that of cr yakupova et al 2019 bhaduri et al 1967 hydrogen bonding exists between the linear molecules of cellulose and cr according to virchow et al amyloids in human tissues were visualized as having similar structure to cellulose hence it was believed that the interaction of amyloids with cr also follows similar fashion like cellulose yakupova et al 2019 bhaduri et al 1967 puchtler et al proposed that the hydrogen bonding interaction occurs from the hydroxyl group of the polysaccharide chain and the amino group of cr compounds puchtler et al 1962 as shown in fig 4 however it is worthy to note that there may be disparity in the mechanism of interaction of cr with amyloids and that of cellulose cr was firstly used during laboratory studies to diagnose amyloidosis in 1923 where comparative studies was carried out between 21 healthy subjects injected with 1 solution of cr and with patients who are recipients of different diseases yakupova et al 2019 the results showed that for patients diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome cr disappeared in their blood stream faster than those with without any disease this implies that there is an interaction between cr and amyloid containing specie in the blood stream thus confirming presence of amyloidosis although several criticisms unger and zuckerbrod 1948 arise on the suboptimal effect of cr for the diagnosis of amyloidosis the development of cr staining methods for the diagnosis of amyloidosis has continued to this day initially intravenous injection of cr was adopted for clinical practice for approximately 40 years but this was substituted by staining of histological sections and biopsies with cr dye howie and brewer 2009 2 1 2 application of congo red dye in textile industries organic dyes absorb light around 400 750 nm of the visible region due to the presence of auxochromes and chromophoric substances in their structure pande et al 2019 dyes applied for textile and fabric production exhibit a varied range of structures including chromophore azo indigo arylmethane and anthraquinone groups and chemical properties such as solubility and reactive functional groups lewis 2008 chromophore describes the chromogenic part conjugated double bonds of a molecule that makes molecule to absorb visible light 400 nm 800 nm and reflect a particular color on the other hand auxochrome are functionalities or moieties in a molecule that are capable of altering the light absorption intensity and or wavelength of chromophore like oh nh2 cooh etc the auxochrome and chromophoric functionalities so3 2 benzene ring and nh2 make cr find application in dyeing technology in primitive period dyes were obtained by extraction from plants roots of trees and biotic parts jiang et al 2021 due to increasing demand from industries to produce textile materials in large quantity colorant and need to optimize the fixative characteristics of color on fabrics thus synthetic dyes are produced in large quantities of which cr dye is one mishra et al 2021 annually various types of dyes are manufactured globally in a measure of up to 108 tons this is particularly true for azo dyes 60 70 of the total e g cr harja et al 2022 based on demographic distribution of dyes and according to production and usage asian countries are the largest leading producer of dyestuffs due to the decline of production of dyestuff by developed countries like united states and europe based on production of textile materials china accounts for 40 of textile production which makes china to be the country with largest production of textile materials while the second largest producer is india with 9 pensupa et al 2017 2 1 3 application of congo red in optoelectronics the interaction between matter and light and numerous applications in different fields of materials science is intriguing kocyigit et al studied the light detection performance of the congo red dye in a schottky type photodiode kocyigit et al 2022 it was proved that the fabricated device co cr n si has dichroic characteristics and hence can be applied in optoelectronic applications the device co cr n si was reported to enhance light power intensity from 100 mw cm2 to 400 mw cm2 ascribed to the charge carriers increment in the interface by light illumination at reverse biases jini et al evaluated the impact of cr doping on magnesium sulfate mgso4 crystal jini et al 2022 it was found that the optical biological structural electrical and morphological activities of the doped material were enhanced the uv visible spectrum investigation of cr doped crystals indicated a characteristic absorption band at 230 245 nm ascribed to the doping of cr the cr hued and non dyed crystals have computed band gaps of 5 1 and 4 98 5 1 ev respectively authors conclude that the improved optical biological dielectric and photoconductivity properties of the cr dyed mgso4 crystals were also improved as a result of cr dye doping 2 2 toxicity of congo red dye among the class of organic dyes synthesized by the textile industries azo dyes are intensely used and accounted for a large amount of dyes introduced into water bodies such as streams and surface run offs which leads to environmental contamination however during the dyeing and bleaching process a significant amount 15 is lost and discharged into the environment pande et al 2019 tahsin et al 2019 eco toxicity studies of textile dyestuff conducted by ecological and toxicological association of the dyestuffs manufacturing industry discovered that about 90 of colorants used in fabric dyeing process have lethal dose value 2000 mg kg mishra et al 2021 vikrant et al 2018 aquatic flora constitutes a main source of protein for human diet thus the consumption of aquatic animals known to have bioaccumulated cr can induce sicknesses like hypertension fever and cramps amer et al 2022 sharma et al 2022 previous studies have assessed the toxicity of cr on the photosynthetic metabolism and growth of green algae i e chlorella vulgaris findings revealed that chlorella vulgaris experienced a reduced rate of development photosynthetic activity and respiration hernández zamora et al 2014 hernández zamora and martínez jerónimo 2019 in addition according to chlorophyll measurement using fluorescence emission spectroscopic technique it was found that at elevated cr concentration the donor site of photosystem ii psii can be impaired cr also reduce the rate of electron transport performance index pi and electron transport quantum yield of psii furthermore a high concentration of cr in water inhibits light penetration thereby impairing aquatic fauna and flora biological activity and reducing dissolved oxygen concentrations ghaedi et al 2015 ultimately the alteration in the biological activity negatively impacts the photosynthetic activity of aquatic flora by triggering eutrophication sequel to uninhibited release of mineral elements adomas and others investigated the effect of congo red cr and gentian violet gv dyes on the biosynthesis of biogenic amines using l minor adomas et al 2020 evidently the cr and gv dyes repressed chlorophyll biosynthesis production of biomass and l minor growth adomas et al 2020 comparatively the study found that gv was more toxic than cr because gv interrupted the biosynthetic processes for biogenic amines production the results show that biogenic amine levels and decarboxylase activity are very good early bio indicators of phytotoxicity effects of gv and cr on l minor dwivedi et al investigated the effects of cr on s platensis at various cr dye concentrations dwivedi 2013 the authors found that at high cr concentrations the growth of s platensis is highly suppressed this implies that algal cell growth is typically reduced at enhanced cr concentrations owing to possible toxicity of cr inside the cell and thus the rationale behind the s platensis growth inhibition cr dose relationship there is dearth of investigation on effects of cr on aquatic fauna hernández zamora and others evaluated the influence of cr on reproduction and existence of ceriodaphnia dubia hernández zamora et al 2016 the median lethal concentration lc50 in 48 h was found to be 13 58 mg l by making c dubia to feed on fresh algae control and algae previously exposed to cr it was reported that the fertility of c dubia decreased to 40 and 70 respectively and survival to 80 and 55 respectively when compared to the control sample hernández zamora et al 2016 it was concluded that cr is highly toxic to c dubia due to inhibitory effects on fertility and survival of c dubia at concentrations exceeding 3 mg l and that the type and amount of food taken had a significant effect too furthermore benzidine 1 1 biphenyl 2 amine 1 1 biphenyl 4 amine n phenyl 4 phenylazo benzenamine a degradation product of cr has been found to be extremely toxic to biological system generally azobenze is a known carcinogen with human carcinogen potency factor of 1 08 10 1 mg kg day 1 when orally exposed benzidine is therefore an established mutagenic oberly et al 1984 and carcinogenic meigs et al 1986 chemical substances that has ability to induce cancer of the bladder in humans and other kinds of cancer in model animals prokof eva 1971 overall in aquatic environment cr can severely affect metabolic processes and development in photosynthetic organisms flora and aquatic fauna simply by changing the ecological functioning of the environment when discharged without proper and thorough treatment pande et al 2019 rather et al 2018 based on the toxicity information it is crucial to eliminate the pollution load caused by the release of this carcinogenic contaminant via the treatment of wastewater generated during various dye related industrial processes in order to achieve this remediation process various methods such as physical chemical and biological methods have been researched and adopted for detoxifying and decolorizing cr laden effluents mishra et al 2021 mishra and maiti 2018 giannakoudakis et al 2018 kumar and gupta 2020 however the selection of a cheap effective simple and feasible treatment process is very crucial mishra and maiti 2018 3 removal strategies of congo red dye 3 1 physical removal strategies 3 1 1 adsorption technology adsorption is a separation process by which solute adsorbate pollutant is attracted or attached to the surface of an adsorbent in an aqueous medium by any form of attractive force van der waals hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic bonding or chemisorption rashed 2013 it has been reported as one of the most effective techniques for the removal of dye in wastewater treatment plants as well as contaminants of emerging concern due to its flexibility adaptability and ease of operation donkadokula et al 2020 oladoye 2022 various adsorbents used for the removal of cr range from natural products clay zeolite natural phosphate agricultural waste plant materials to synthetic adsorbents graphene polymers composites metal organic frameworks biogenic nanocomposites etc adeyemo et al 2017 piaskowski et al 2018 of all activated carbon is the most frequently used adsorbent due to its high adsorption capacity surface characteristics of its functional group versatility and stability foo and hameed 2010 however its high production cost and problem of regeneration have driven research into the use of economically viable carbon based materials with high efficiency and ease of regeneration to replace expensive commercial activated carbon comparatively literature revealed that natural adsorbents fly ash peat bagasse zeolites clay minerals illite kaolinite bentonite and montmorillonite have low price 1 0 usd per 1000 g momina et al 2018 which makes them more suitable adsorbents when compared to expensive commercial activated carbon other adsorbents like metal organic frameworks oladoye et al 2021 carbon nanotube jagusiak et al 2021 nanoparticles liu et al 2019 cnt based hybrid adsorbents zourou et al 2022 have been found to be almost four times higher in price when compared to that of natural adsorbents thus low cost natural adsorbents have attracted applicability in the treatment of cr dye containing wastewaters other examples of low cost materials or items for adsorption of cr dye are listed in fig 5 3 1 1 1 clay minerals clay is a naturally occurring hydrous aluminosilicate mineral that contains both tetrahedral silicon sheets si2o5 2 and octahedral aluminum gibbsite sheets adeyemo et al 2017 many clay minerals are extensively expended for cr adsorption due to their organic molecule adsorption desorption properties özcan et al 2007 for instance the acid base dissociation of the hydroxylated oxides of clay minerals results in ion exchange mechanism apart from diffusion of cr dye into the porous mineral montmorillonite kaolinite smectite halloysite sepiolite illite and chlorite are the classes of clay minerals of which montmorillonite sepiolite and kaolinite are generally used because of their large surface area chemical thermal inertness low cost and structural properties srinivasan 2011 fig 6 shows the layered sheet and particle structure and or arrangement of clay minerals the presence of several active sites like hydroxylated oxides on the surface makes them good adsorbents for dyes and thus effective materials for the remediation of environmental contaminants through exchange of ionic cr dye srinivasan 2011 otunola and ololade 2020 previous studies have reported the use of natural clay bentahar et al 2017 bentonite modified clay material bhattacharyya and ray 2015 hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide modified bentonite fosso kankeu et al 2016 belachew 2020 kaolinite chit ailp kaolinite ahmad et al 2021 acid treated montmorillonite and kaolinite bhattacharyya et al 2015 and acid activated sepiolite organic modified nano fibres vahidhabanu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for the removal of cr because of their cost effectiveness availability swelling properties surface hydrophobicity low toxicity and tendency for exchange of ions massaro et al 2018 clay materials have been used as a substitute for commercially available adsorbents with very comparable maximum adsorption capacity as shown in table 2 3 1 1 2 agriculturally based adsorbent the use of agricultural by products as adsorbents for the treatment of environmental contaminant not only provide a low cost effective eco friendly adsorbent but also minimize amount of waste generated and disposal problems different agricultural by products used for the adsorption of cr are jujuba seed reddy et al 2012 rice husk bamroongwongdee et al 2019 wood biomass stjepanović et al 2021 moringa oleifera seed coat jabar et al 2020b pineapple peels dai et al 2020b tea waste foroughi dahr et al 2015a b eichhornia crassipes roy and mondal 2017 walnut shell ojo et al 2019 agro wastes contain hemicellulose lignin cellulose starch protein as well as hydroxyl and carboxyl group that enhance adsorption efficiency via various uptake or interaction physico chemical mechanisms indeed the mechanism of ad sorption cr dye onto agriculturally based adsorbents occur by two separate forms of interactions for example weak interactions such as van der waals force π π and n π interactions and strong interactions like formation of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction have been described as the mechanistic uptake pathway for cr liu et al 2010 mattson et al 1969 finally the delocalization of lone pair of electrons on oxygen atoms of agriculturally based ad sorbents into the π orbital of the cr dye aromatic rings arises from the n π interactions and also responsible for cr adsorption by agro wastes achour et al 2021 the processing of agriculturally based adsorbent involves physical chemical thermal treatments or a combination of any to give the needed final adsorbents for cr removal see fig 7 aside the agricultural by products siliceous materials such as perlite silica glass fibres alunite and dolomite are also used for the removal of cr table 3 presents the adsorption capacity of different agriculturally sourced adsorbents for the treatment of cr dye containing wastewater 3 1 1 3 nanoparticles adsorption processes using nanoparticles are highly effective methods for mitigating the presence of both organic and inorganic contaminants in wastewater treatment plants as nanoparticles have exceptionally large surface areas small diffusion resistance higher adsorption capacities and faster adsorption equilibrium they are useful alternatives to commercial activated carbon ahmad et al 2015 while several nano adsorbents have demonstrated impressive adsorption capacities and features it is worth noting that a lot of them still fall short in terms of durability efficiency and the potential to be used in industry this is owing to a variety of factors including a proclivity for agglomeration the possibility of oxidation in iron based materials and regeneration difficulties as a result strategies for making the most of nanoparticles and maximizing their applications were achieved through surface modification manyangadze et al 2020 for example cnt impregnated chitosan hydrogel showed 450 4 mg g removal of cr than chitosan without surface modification 200 mg g based on langmuir adsorption modelling chatterjee et al 2010 likewise the potential of novel cross linked chitosan for the elimination of cr has been investigated zahir et al 2017 the authors reported that adsorption capacity increases with increase in contact time temperature and initial concentration of cr whereas reduces with increase in ph and dosage the equilibrium maximum cr adsorbed from sips isotherm model was found to be 1447 mg g for urea diammonium tartrate modified chitosan udmc while 1597 mg g was achieved for diammonium tartrate modified chitosan dmc polyhedral cuprous oxide nanoparticle cu2o nps was reported as the first nanoparticle to achieve maximum adsorption of cr 3904 mg g at 20 c following freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order model shu et al 2015 different nanoparticles used for removal of cr are fexco3 xo4 liu et al 2019 graphene oxide chitosan fibers du et al 2014 gamma aluminum oxide zhang et al 2019a mgo nanoparticles priyadarshini et al 2021 zno mwcnt arabi et al 2019 besides van der waals hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic bonding the other mechanisms mentioned in literature for uptake of cr dye by various adsorbents like nanocomposites ahmad et al 2020 2021 are shown in fig 8 recently various studies on the use of biogenic nanocomposites in removing toxic cr from wastewater are emerging in the recent studies biochar prepared from s robusta leaves was used to prepare ag nbc together with biosynthesized agnps using s robusta leaves extract shaikh et al 2021 the ag nbc indicated 90 removal efficiency for both cr and rhodamine b rhb reusability studies was also promising as ag nbc revealed outstanding regeneration ability 80 removal for both cr and rhb during the 1st cycle however the removal efficiency reduced with further cycles 70 achieved up to the 3rd cycle shaikh et al investigated the suitability of fabricated biochar based hybrid ag nanocomposite for decontaminating cr from cr dye laden wastewater shaikh et al 2022a the nanocomposite nagbc containing nag and algal biomass as composite material was noted to exhibit thermostability meso porosity with active binding sites consisting of c o c c oh s o nh and c h cr removal efficiency of 95 92 was obtained qe 34 53 mg g with 0 5 g l of nagbc nanocomposite at solution ph 6 and room temperature the same research group shaik et al also conducted another study by compositing another material with nag shaikh et al 2022b this time tea leaf biochar was composited with nag to form nag tc it was noted that the nag tc matrix similarly exhibited heterogeneity thermostability and meso porosity as in the case of nagbc with enriched active surface functional groups the biogenic nanocomposite nag tc was found to be capable of removing cr dye with an efficiency of 94 10 at 300 k and cr concentrations 22 5 mg l these findings revealed the efficacy of biogenic nanocomposite in reducing cr dyes from dyes laden waste water table 4 below shows the adsorption capacity of nanoparticles and its composite for cr removal 3 1 1 4 metal organic frameworks mofs these days synthesized polymeric materials like metal organic frameworks mofs are finding applications in the treatment of cr laden wastewater mof synthesis can be tailored towards producing positively charged active sites required for electrostatic interaction with anionic dye like cr for remediation purposes davoodi et al synthesized a composite of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with fe3o4 to form zif 8 m 8 mif davoodi et al 2021 the synthesized composite was found to be crystalline superparamagnetic and with a high surface area 958 m2 g at solution ph 7 zif 8 m 8 mif achieved 99 9 removal efficiency for cr within 60 with a reported monolayer sorption capacity of 210 5 mg g liu et al prepared indium in mof in tatab for cr elimination j liu et al 2020 as expected the surface area of indium in mof in tatab was as high as 623 m2 g when tested indium in mof in tatab recorded complete elimination of cr within 6 min q max 299 mg g the authors attributed the phenomenal cr complete removal to the presence of triazine ring secondary amine and nitrogen in the synthesized mof panda et al assessed the efficacy of zirconium based metal organic frameworks zr mof uio 66 for the treatment of synthetic cr containing wastewater panda et al 2020 findings revealed a low q max of 80 mg g adjudging the material to be unsuitable for cr removal another research group yang et al attempted the modification of the zr mof by doping it with ce iii to produce ce ii uio 67 yang et al 2020a the dopant ce iii was found to greatly enhance the adsorptive potential of the zr mof with a surface area of 1911 9 m2 g and q max for cr uptake of 799 6 mg g it may be concluded that ce iii increase the adsorptive binding sites on the resultant materials for cr by increasing the overall positive charge and surface area also liu et al synthesized novel tremella like ferrocene based metal organic framework tmof nanosheets for cr decontamination l liu et al 2020 the tmof was reported to achieved q max of 254 1 mg g at ph 4 and the low monolayer adsorption capacity was ascribed to low surface area of the material 89 9 m2 g furthermore yang et al investigated the adsorption of cr using sulfo modified metal organic frameworks assigned as mil 101 so3h yang et al 2020b the mof synthesis was successful by variation of the molar concentration of terephthalic acid to monosodiumterephthalic acid during synthesis process a q max for cr uptake of 2592 7 mg g was achieved with a removal efficiency of 89 6 mil 101 cr skeleton was found to drive the sorption interaction between anionic cr and the mil 101 so3h recently mil 100 fe de fe mof composited with diatom with a surface area of 364 0 m2 g has been investigated for cr removal uthappa et al 2020 the composite was found to exhibit enhanced cr removal 98 1 at ph 7 relative to bare diatom with 7 9 removal efficiency first the characteristically low surface area 18 m2 g of bare diatom could be attributed to this low removal potential in addition it may be concluded that fe mof acts as the main material in the composite thereby enhancing surface functionality and area required for cr elimination in another related study fe mil 88nh2 fe mof was found to exhibit high 87 2 and fast removal tendency for cr with a q max of 769 1 mg g fu et al 2021 after 4th cycle the regeneration potential of fe mil 88nh2 showed 83 removal efficiency for cr the presence of amine functionality may be responsible for the effectiveness of the mof at eliminating cr dye table 5 shows the maximum adsorption capacity of mofs and composite mofs for cr 3 1 2 membrane technology membrane separation technology for the removal of synthetic dyes from wastewater treatment plants has gained increasing application due to its low energy consumption high elimination efficiency and low operation cost qasem et al 2021 it enhances the removal and recovery of dyes from wastewater since no heating is required the various techniques are ultrafiltration uf microfiltration mf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro table 6 presents the various membrane filtration types and applications 3 1 2 1 microfiltration mf microfiltration technique uses a membrane of pore size of 0 1 10 μm the large pore size makes it unsuitable for dye removal in textile wastewater treatment plants therefore limiting its application to the removal of suspended and colloidal dye particles singh and arora 2011 however its application in wastewater treatment plant could be enhanced when combined with other conventional treatment procedures iaich et al reported 91 99 cr removal with three low cost ceramic microfiltration membrane made from moroccan clay these membranes were prepared by suspension and casting of clay powder on polyvinyl alcohol membrane m10 m12 and m10 25pva and water iaich et al 2021 various hyphenated microfiltration membrane have been reported for the successful removal of cr these are polypropylene hollow fibre microfiltration membrane 99 8 yu et al 2012b pvpf ptfe membrane 99 khumalo et al 2019a cof lzu1 99 9 su et al 2021 polyether sulfonate microfiltration with graphene oxide 90 homem et al 2019 this therefore confirms the effectiveness of microfiltration when applied in tandem with other conventional techniques 3 1 2 2 ultrafiltration uf ultrafiltration membrane has a pore size of 0 1 to 0 01 μm operated at high solvent permeation flux rate and low pressure gradient wang and zhou 2013 singh et al 2018 it can be used for the removal of high molecular weight solute ranging from 1000 to 100 000 da colloidal particles and soluble dyes moradihamedani 2021 however it is not suitable for low molecular weight solute and inorganic dyes to overcome this limitation its operation efficiency has been enhanced by coupling with other treatment processes and by surface modification ramutshatsha and nomngongo 2022 for example a dual functionalized psf pva ultrafiltration membrane was modified separately with zno and silica the zno modified membrane achieved 53 5 cr removal through adsorption and rejection also during the reusability studies the efficiency of the membrane decreased to 31 19 on the second cycle khumalo et al 2019b zwane et al reported 27 of cr removal by un modified polyethersulfone pes membrane but when modified with chromolaena odorata co pes co adsorption efficiency increases to 85 the adsorption of cr occurred on the heterogeneous surface through the formation of a multilayered surface by the langmuir freundlich isotherm zwane et al 2019 thus ultrafiltration is also effective upon membrane modification or functionalization 3 1 2 3 reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis is characterized by a pore size of greater than 0 0001 μm with an operating pressure of 1000 5000 kpa while nanofiltration has a pore size of greater than 0 001 μm with an operating pressure of 500 1000 kpa wang and zhou 2013 singh et al 2018 both processes have low permeability and high operating pressure as compared to mf and uf which have high permeability and low operating pressure moradihamedani 2021 they can be used for the removal of both organic and inorganic compounds color bacteria and hardness however they are prone to fouling and scaling one basic method of eliminating this fouling and scaling limitations is by using of pre treated mf and uf joshi and purwar 2004 table 7 shows the summary of previous studies on the use of membrane technology for cr 3 1 3 coagulation and flocculation 3 1 3 1 coagulation and flocculation this treatment strategy is commonly applied in water works during water treatment for town water supply here coagulants are employed to increase the density of contaminants such that contaminant settle under gravity polymers and metal salts are mostly used for coagulation purposes on the other hand flocculants enhance the floc formation agglomeration or aggregation of contaminants and are usually polymeric substances al mutairi 2006 during this process coagulation flocculation flocculants are added to waste water and the mixture is vortexed such that the added coagulant traps impurities and the large flocs formed then settle by precipitation so far one of the effective natural coagulants to have been reported in literature is azadirachta indica and tamarindus indica these coagulants have been found to be effective at treating cr laden wastewater mathuram et al 2018 raghuwanshi et al evaluated agrobased materials abm like maize zea mays nirmali seed strychnos potatorum and surjana seed moringa oleifera as coagulant aid for cr removal raghuwanshi et al 2002 with the use of zea mays or strychnos potatorum as coagulant aid it was found that the dose of alum required reduced to 15 and 25 mg l respectively and the filtrate turbidity obtained was 0 2 ntu however when alum alone was applied at a dosage of 45 mg l the recorded filtrate turbidity levels was more than 1 ntu previous studies on chemical flocculants and or coagulants have been reported for cr removal for instance various salts of iron ferrous sulfate ferric chloride and ferric chloride sulfate hydrated lime and magnesium carbonate have been successfully used to remove azo dyes badawi and zaher 2021 li et al 2018 consequent upon flocculation coagulation the settled particles are then physically removed patel and vashi investigated the effectiveness of natural coagulant aid like maize seed powder msp surjana seed powder ssp and chitosan for cr removal patel and vashi 2012 it was reported that ssp recorded highest removal efficiency for cr 98 0 as against 94 5 and 89 4 obtained for chitosan and msp respectively at coagulant concentration of 25 mg l contact time of 60 min and solution ph of 4 similar reports on the effectiveness of ssp has been reported elsewhere okuda et al 2001 raghuwanshi et al 2002 chitosan possesses amino functionality that can be easily protonated to produce positively charged sites needed to electrostatically interact with anionic cr dye apart from hydrogen bonding interactions between the two molecules patel and vashi 2012 goudjil et al investigated the use of commercial powdered activated carbon pac agriculturally sourced polymers and lime ca oh 2 to improve the coagulation flocculation efficiency of aluminum sulfate as as coagulants aid goudjil et al 2021 it was reported that pac achieved elimination efficiency of 97 68 at 0 05 g l pac dose as against 99 06 of natural polymers at a dose of 0 02 g l this thus confirmed that the natural polymer has comparable coagulant aid property as the pac kristianto et al studied the suitability of leucaena leucocephala as a natural coagulant from seed kernel at solution ph 3 and coagulant dosage 10 ml l 99 9 cr removal was obtained with reduced sludge generated compared to the use of alum in a recent study kristianto et al investigated the applicability of galactomannan as coagulant aid for cr kristianto et al 2021 report has it that fecl3 alone achieved 27 5 cr removal while the addition of galactomannan increased the efficiency of fecl3 to 40 subsequent addition of galactomannan correspondingly increased cr removal although the sludge volume is also increased due to repulsive forces kristianto et al 2019 it can be concluded that both natural and chemical coagulants are effective at removing cr dye from wastewater 3 2 chemical removal methods chemical removal strategies are tailored towards complete remediation of organic contaminants containing wastewater through the mineralization of the organic contaminants alfred et al 2020 issaka et al 2022 the methods can be used to completely turn hazardous substances to non toxic substances by changing the chemical properties of the contaminants and this can be achieved through the application of chemical reagents and or reaction thereby producing other products that are useful and green these methods are characterized with some advantages like enhanced efficiency operation at low cost cost intensiveness inability to treat large volumes of wastewater cao et al 2022 rajasulochana and preethy 2016 cr is carcinogenic due to the presence of aromatic groups and thus the aromaticity makes it resistant to some biological degradation and or treatment methods hence chemical methods are developed to remove them from our ecosystems 3 2 1 non photochemical methods 3 2 1 1 ozonation ozonation in combinations with other oxidants like h2o2 o3 h2o2 has been used to treating waste water containing a number of organic contaminants fast et al 2017 as a result of the complex molecular structure of cr dye the great volume of wastewater generated by industries like textile paper and the need for immediate treatment of cr contaminant ozonation treatment application is therefore not suitable because the process is not time friendly additionally beside the high operational cost ozone is highly toxic and can produce carcinogenic by products and these demerits have limited extensive research into the use of ozone for the treatment of cr wastewater fast et al 2017 table 8 presents a few examples of previous studies using ozonation to remove cr as scanty works have been reported with respect cr ozonation 3 2 1 2 fenton system iron an element with good oxygen transfer qualities when reacted with hydrogen peroxide results in the production of hydroxyl radical which is a strong oxidant capable of oxidizing organic compounds kausley et al 2018 fenton reaction is the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by iron catalyst to produce hydroxyl radical and it is an acidic reaction mohajeri et al 2010 the oh reacts with organic pollutant causing degradation and or mineralization to carbon iv oxide and water ali et al 2014 this reaction originated in 1894 by fenton and its application started in 1960 huang et al 1993 the process involved in fenton system is agglomeration and oxidation lai et al 2020 h2o2 decomposition is catalyzed by ferrous ion to form oh and for the augmentation of other radicals which can fully oxidize organic matters such as cr table 9 shows the findings and or conclusions from fenton degradation of cr the mechanism of reaction in the fenton process has been accepted to be the formation of hydroxyl radical while the formation of the radical initiates organic contaminants oxidation as can be seen in the chemical equations 1 4 shen et al 2017 the hydroxyl radical oh has standard potential of 2 80 v making it a strong oxidizing agent zhu and chen 2021 the chemistry of the reaction gives a high formation rate constant when ferrous ion reacts with hydrogen peroxide fe2 is oxidized to fe3 at a short time in the presence of h2o2 even though hydroxyl radical is formed but more of it is produced in the reaction of the fe3 reacting with h2o2 roudi et al 2018 chemical equations 1 4 represent the chemical processes in fenton reaction system 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 h f e o o h 2 3 f e o o h 2 h o 2 f e 2 4 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h it has been noted that the removal of organic pollutant by fenton s reagent is dependent on fe3 h2o2 reaction and thus the main fenton s reagent this process has many merits which include high performance simplicity ability to be operated at room temperature rt and atmospheric pressure for the oxidation of organics the process has proven to be very effective at removing ubiquitous organic compound like cr capable of complete mineralization of organic contaminant into carbon iv oxide if desired produce less harmful by products and a rapid process with little maintenance amiri and sabour 2014 lai et al 2020 nevertheless fenton also has some built in disadvantages and thus its application is technically and or largely limited these includes strict ph range high h2o2 consumption and the accumulation of ferric sludge that affects the oxidation efficiency wang et al 2016 yuan et al 2013 to achieve a good working condition for this process an optimal amount of fe must be present for the production of hydroxyl radical necessary for contaminant oxidation once the concentration of iron increases impurity removal accelerates yang et al 2021 also temperature between 20 and 40 c is the best for this process at high temperatures hydrogen peroxide is quickly decomposed to oxygen and water preventing the production of oh parson gave the optimal ph in a fenton reaction to be between 2 and 4 and also noted that the formation of ferric oxyhydroxide at ph 2 8 could generate another adsorbent used for lead pb removal from aquatic media parsons 2004 rahimi et al reported that when the ph is between 2 and 4 the fenton oxidation is usually efficient rahimi et al 2015b furthermore the activity of fenton reagent is reduced with increasing solution ph due to the lack of active fe2 ion szpyrkowicz et al 2001 similarly at very low ph values iron complex species fe h2o 6 2 and oxonium ion h3o2 exist which reduces the reactivity between fe2 and h2o2 kavitha and palanivelu 2005 from these findings it can be established that the efficiency of the fenton process to degrade organic compounds is reduced both at high and very low solution ph the flow chart fig 9 depicts the various steps associated with a fenton oxidation process and further highlights the acid regulation the addition of iron catalyst the introduction of h2o2 and followed by mixing however the generation of sludge limits the use of this process for cr degradation table 9 show some studies on the application of fenton process for cr mineralization 3 2 2 photochemical methods photochemical treatment processes have gained attention due to their efficiency and ability to treat almost all solid components in textile effluents a photochemical method operates at any temperature and pressure and does not produce any biogenic component the basic mechanism involves the generation of hydroxyl radical umamaheswari et al 2018 this radical has proven to be able to degrade and mineralize textile effluents nikravesh et al 2020 whereby the generated hydroxyl radicals are generally accelerated by the combinations of some commonly used semiconductors when irradiated claudino et al 2020 3 2 2 1 photo fenton in order to circumvent the limitations associated with ferric sludge generation and to quickly degrade cr to non toxic substances fenton oxidation process has been modified to improve upon the limitations associated with it via the generation of a great volume of hydroxyl radical the main limitation of fenton based reaction is the oxidant and fe ion loss due to the radical scavenging effect of hydrogen peroxide zhou et al 2015 table 10 shows different studies on the degradation of cr via the photo fenton system photo fenton process is a reaction that involves ultraviolet uv light fe and h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radical that can degrade cr conventionally uv light was not used in the fenton process but its usage give rise to the production of more hydroxyl radical to be formed during photolysis and therefore promoting better degradation babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 without irradiation the reaction goes into completion when ferrous ion has been converted to ferric ion while during solar impartation there is photo reduction of fe3 to fe2 thereby giving rise to new formation of hydroxyl radical babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 as represented in the chemical equation below 5 f e 3 h 2 o 2 h v f e 2 o h h to enhance the efficiency of photo fenton distinct ligands such as edta edds oxalate and other organic carboxylic acid were added and complexed with fe3 under photocatalysis katsumata et al 2006 lai et al 2020 xu et al noted that the enhanced efficiency could be traced to ability of the ligands complexing with the fe to reduce fe3 to fe2 during irradiation causing hydroxyl radical resurgence and also to encourage the migration of h2o2 and oh radical generation rahim pouran et al 2015 hydroxyl radical is better generated here via photolysis therefore the dosage of catalyst is reduced thereby preventing iron sludge as we have in conventional fenton process giri and golder 2014 xiao et al 2014 however photo fenton is expensive if irradiation aside sunlight is used and as a result electrical energy consumption could be a challenge or limitation for the technical and or practical application of photo fenton reaction method furthermore to give a great production better hydroxyl radical and to improve the process ultrasound can be added to uv light a process known as sono photo fenton spf process vaishnave et al 2014 the sonolysis of water produces hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen atoms the intermediate complex formed due to the reaction of fe3 with h2o2 during the fenton reaction could be reduced to fe2 by sonolysis in a report the color of cr achieved about 90 decolourization when ph of 3 and 10 mg l of iron were used and about 80 cod removal was achieved in 120 min masalvad and sakare 2020 it was brought to awareness that there is an increase in degradation of cr between 24 17 and 60 as active hydroxyl radicals is formed during illumination time ranging from 1 to 10 h thereby giving room for the photolysis of h2o2 shaban et al 2017 3 2 2 2 catalyst uv light assisted advanced oxidation process previous studies have developed some photocatalysts for treating wastewater containing organic contaminants a catalyst is any substance that increases the rate of a reaction without itself being consumed consequently researchers have developed the following methods 3 2 2 2 1 catalytic ozonation this is the use of catalyst to surrogate controlled decomposition of ozone and hydroxyl radical formation catalytic ozonation provides fast degradation of organic pollutants and also more effective mineralization of both micropollutants and natural organic matter due to an increase in hydroxyl radical formation aided by catalyst incorporation in catalytic ozonation the catalysts are used with ozone to generate hydroxyl radicals a radical with more oxidation potential than ozone khuntia et al 2016 in previous studies many transition metal ions or oxides have been reported to improve pollutant degradation in water including cobalt ii nickel ii copper ii iron ii manganese ii and zinc ii for instance khuntia et al noted that metal ion catalyst increases the generation of the hydroxyl radical causing the oxidation of the pollutant directly and indirectly and also increasing the total organic carbon toc removal khuntia et al 2016 li et al was able to investigate catalytic ozonation via combination of ceramic membrane ccm filtration with catalytic ozonation it was noted that the removal efficiency increased from approximately 30 for the ceramic membrane for cr dye without catalyst coating to over 80 for the ccm with the catalyst coating the result was attributed to an increase in the hydroxyl radical generation li et al 2021 while the research supported catalytic ozonation as a good method of removing cr hu et al also used catalytic magnetic manganese ferrite ozonation on effluents from textile industries of which cr would have been among the dyes and the results showed that the catalyst enhanced dye degradation and a cod removal of about 25 higher than ordinary ozonation was achieved hu et al 2019 catalysts are safe compounds since they do not undergo any physical or chemical changes within the process thereby promoting its usage in degradation of diazo dyes furthermore sulfate radicals have been used to replace the hydroxyl radicals because of the higher solubility and reactivity of sulfate thermodynamically peroxymonosulfate pms is a very strong oxidant although its interaction with a large number of organic contaminants is quite slow and requires catalyst or activating agent after activating pms it produces sulfate radical s o 4 which play an important role in contaminant degradation s o 4 has high oxidation potential and is a powerful oxidant 2 5 0 31 v generated via the breaking of peroxo bond of persulfate ps or peroxymonosulfate pms it is noteworthy that pms has the potential to auto regulate the ph of the system via protonation in addition to sulfate radical hydroxyl radical is another significant radical released during activation ghanbari and moradi 2017b however hydroxyl radical has lower shorter half life 20 ns when compared with sulfate radical 30 40 μs attributed to the preference of sulfate radical to participate in electron transfer during its reaction with organic contaminants as against hydroxyl radical participation in different reactions both equally and non selectively li et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 from reported literature oxidation processes based on s o 4 are known to be very effective processes for the degradation of recalcitrant organic contaminants primarily due to powerful oxidation capability of the radical jegadeesan et al used sulfate radical to degrade cr carried out by using biogenic iron to activate ps and pms to degrade cr it was pointed out that the concentration of the catalyst will either increase degradation or result in scavenging of sulfate ion as it was further noted that excess of the oxidant increased degradation the result showed that the chemogenic iron nanoparticles with ps and pms gave the degradation of cr as follows c fe pms 86 b fe pms 83 c fe ps 75 b fe ps 63 jegadeesan et al 2019 figs 10 and 11 show the activation of pms by transition metal ion and sulfate radical chain reaction mechanism respectively 3 2 2 2 2 photocatalysis photocatalysis describes a photochemical method for pollutants removal lai et al 2020 via chemical reaction induced by solid catalyst which uses photonic energy as driving force for the chemical transformation ohtani 2008 this method has a high efficiency in degrading and mineralizing organic pollutants from water characterized with environmental friendliness low cost and generation of harmless by products tan et al 2020 shaban et al have noted that low cost and environmental heterogeneous photocatalysts could be adopted as approved means in the degradation of dyes and wastewater remediation application shaban et al 2017 photocatalysis ha advantage over other methods in degradation due to the use of solar energy especially in the visible light region in the production of hydroxyl radical a cheap and green process shaban et al 2017 there are several or different photocatalysts that have been synthesized like nanoparticles however a photocatalyst which is cost effective good environmental benign and abundance will be great in solving dye pollution the catalysts are semiconductors whose electronic structures are characterized by a filled valence band vb and an empty conduction band cb as graphically shown in fig 12 absorption of a photon by the semiconductor with photon energy higher than the band gap energy leads to excitation thereby causing a movement of electron from the vb to the cb implying an electron hole pair the excited electrons can react with electrophiles such as o2 that is dissolved in water and reduce it to form superoxide radical anion o2 equation 6 the holes can scout out h2o and oh molecules on the surface of the nanoparticle to generate hydroxyl radicals which can degrade or mineralize pollutants like cr to form water and carbon iv oxide equations 6 13 akerdi and bahrami 2019 6 s e m i c o n d u c t o r hv h e 7 o 2 e o 2 8 h h 2 o o h h aq 9 h d y e p r o d u c t s 10 o h d y e p r o d u c t s 11 e o 2 o 2 aq 12 e 1 2 o 2 h 2 o

nabi et al 2020 harun et al revealed that heterogenous degradation is very effective to remove pollutant like cr harun et al 2018 when compared degradation between irradiation solar and uv light and with without catalyst high degradation of 66 69 and 64 72 were achieved using uv light and direct sunlight both with tio2 however a very low degradation of below 40 without catalyst was obtained this implies that degradation with both catalyst and irradiation removes cr from our ecosystem harun et al 2018 in order to avoid all these restraints in the application of photocatalysis band gaps of semiconductors have been narrowed to activate their photoactivity efficiency under visible or near infrared light which is widely available and safer compared to uv radiation several ways of doping the semiconductors have also been developed like self doping zhang and zhang denoted that self doping is able to modify the electronic and band structures of semiconductors to increase their photocatalytic activities marcelino and amorim 2019 zhang and zhang 2010 in recent era extensive efforts have been made to develop a large number of semiconductor materials like tio2 zno agcl biocl wo3 and cds for potential applications as photocatalysts for photodegradation of organic pollutants meribout et al 2016 a nanocomposite bismuth oxychloride was doped with polyaniline and iron biocl pani fe was synthesized to degrade cr the doping reduced the band gap of bismuth oxychloride 3 2 3 5 ev thus preventing recombination of the radicals in the cb to go back to vb also polyaniline pani 2 8 ev which is very stable to the environment and has a good collegiality was used to diffuse the iron particles enhancing the catalytic performance this doping increases the bet surface area which improved dye adsorption and photocatalytic activities velmurugan et al 2015 wang et al 2013 oladoye et al 2021 table 11 reveals the effectiveness of different semi conductors and or nanocomposites as photocatalyst for cr degradation 3 2 2 3 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes advanced oxidation processes aops is a method capable of achieving complete mineralization of organic pollutants with the use of a powerful oxidant such as hydroxyl radicals ho cheng et al 2020 electrochemical advanced oxidation is a good example with respect to the direct or indirect generation of hydroxyl radical through a clean and effective means thereby aiding mineralization of pollutants like cr although this process has demerits like high costs due to the electric supply needed and that the reactions go through some ph ranges compared to photocatalysis the catalyst is not usually reused the reaction is slow and sometimes long reaction times are sometimes needed to destroy resistant intermediates radjenovic and sedlak 2015 in addition intermediate by products can be more toxic than their parent compounds seibert et al 2020 phillips et al used electrochemical oxidation on boron doped diamond bdd eo anodes to degrade cr phillips et al 2018 the assays which was conducted in a single compartment electrochemical flow cell and in galvanostatic mode achieved almost total chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc removals of cr solano et al studied the degradation of 0 260 mm of diazo dye cr at ph 3 0 using electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops like photoelectro fenton ef electro fenton pef and anodic oxidation with electrogenerated h2o2 ao h2o2 in these systems cr was mainly degraded by oh produced from water oxidation at anode and or from fenton s reaction of fe2 and cathodically generated h2o2 findings revealed that approximate mineralization of cr was achieved within a period of 6 h of pef at j 66 7 ma cm 2 attributed to parallel photolytic action of uva light solano et al 2015 maldonado larios et al investigated the applicability of titanium dioxide polyaniline pani nanocomposite films for the electroremediation of cr it was found that composite 2 1 tio2 pani achieved an approximate 60 cr decontamination after 90 min interaction time see fig 13 the nanocomposites were found to be effective at removing cr by electrocatalysis than by adsorption or photocatalysis maldonado larios et al 2020 elahmadi et al employed ozonation and electrochemical processes to degrade cr the electrochemical processes achieved total toc and cod removals unlike ozonation process that attained only 81 and 85 of toc and cod removals faouzi elahmadi et al 2009b sathishkumar et al confirmed the effectiveness of cr degradation by electrochemical oxidation it was found that cr pre treatment by electrochemical oxidation before biological textile dye effluent treatment achieved 98 decolourization within 10 min at nacl concentration current density and ph of 2 gl 1 20 ma cm 2 and 7 respectively sathishkumar et al 2019 akhtar et al investigated electrocoagulation of cr by optimizing the process parameters akhtar et al 2020 the study reported the use of 36 9 kj of electrical energy to obtain 97 and 89 color and cod removal respectively at cr concentrations of 1000 mg l ph 3 and inter electrode distance of 3 cm the quantum analysis also revealed that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy of fe3 of 15 09 ev and cr with highest unoccupied molecular orbital homo energy of 5 58 ev display electron accepting and electron donating inclination respectively it is evident from these studies that electrochemical oxidation appears to be more effective and more economic than ozonation in terms of toc removals these results have also proved that other strong oxidants are electrogenerated from the oxidation of electrolyte such as persulfates and direct oxidation of cr and its by products on anodes accompanied with the hydroxyl radical mediated oxidation to achieve the total mineralization of organics 3 3 biological removal strategies biological method is one of the pivotal tools used for the elimination of persistent dyes from effluents and wastewaters biological methods are incredibly useful for the conversion of azo dyes into less toxic products considering the recalcitrant behavior to biodegradation saratale et al 2011 removal strategies by biological method is beneficial in the sense that it is environmentally friendly as it does not involve the use of toxic chemicals for the elimination of the dye producing chemical substance that are less toxic compared to azo dye and it is cost effective since most of the microbes can be cultured easily in the laboratory saratale et al 2011 the mechanism of this removal involves the interaction of the organic dyes with microbes in effluents which in turn leads to the transformation of toxic chemicals into less harmful forms this removal is aided by the influence of enzymatic reactions in the microbial systems different enzymatic pathways to the degradation products includes hexane oxidase saratale et al 2006 2011 lignin peroxidase duran and esposito 2000 laccase hatvani and mecs 2001 and nadh dcip reductase bhosale et al 2006 there is a wide pool of microbes reported in literature for the elimination of dyes and these are potentially capable of removing azo dyes from solution these microbes includes bacteria dawkar et al 2008 yeasts saratale et al 2009 fungi fournier et al 2004 algae daneshvar et al 2007 and actinomycetes machado et al 2006 3 3 1 biodegradation biodegradation of organic dyes often follows the decolourization of the dye using microbial agents common microbes used for this process includes fungi bacteria yeasts and actinomycetes filamentous shaped fungi are known to be ubiquitous in environments mostly inhabiting soils effluents and organic waste material fungi typically possess attributes to adapt their metabolic activities to varieties on carbon and nitrogen sources which is crucial for their survival concerning biodegradation of organic dyes using fungi most of studies in literature has focused on application of white rot fungi cultures for the degradation of azo dyes machado et al 2006 saratale et al 2011 fungi cultures commonly used for azo dye removal includes phanerochaete chrysosporium trametes versicolor aspergillus ochraceus bjerkandera adusta saratale et al 2006 2011 heinfling et al 1998 humnabadkar et al 2008 pointing and vrijmoed 2000 furthermore degradation of azo dyes using varieties of bacteria occurs in oxic anoxic and facultative anoxic conditions the pathways of decomposition of azo dyes using bacteria strands involves the reductive breaking of the azo dye bonds n n using an enzymatic azoreductase agent under anoxic conditions chang and kuo 2000 saratale et al 2011 the oxidoreductive enzymes are accountable for producing highly reactive free radicals that trigger a multifaceted series of spontaneous cleavage reactions saratale et al 2011 this resulting reaction leads to the formation of a potentially hazardous colorless aromatic amines this intermediate formed is further degraded under oxic and anoxic conditions bacterial method for the degradation and decolourization of azo dyes is intensely utilized due to its application for degrading wide varieties of azo dye compounds effective mineralization and ecofriendly nature verma and madamwar 2003 rai et al 2005 saratale et al 2009 3 3 2 biocatalytic degradation catalytic reduction is often preferred to other methods due to the application of reduction products in diverse fields naseem et al 2018b peculiar challenges related to other conventional method includes disadvantages like high cost volume of waste generated after decontamination the exchange of dye between two media processing time is slow and toxic by products production and so on in this decolourization approach cr compounds are lyzed at azo bond during reaction and are converted into less toxic and eco friendly products hence catalytic reduction of cr as environmental and industrial significance when compared to other methods naseem et al 2018a one of the common methods of catalytic removal of congo red is the application of sodium borohydride nabh4 the mechanism of reaction follows the following steps as shown in fig 14 upon dissociation of nabh4 to form bh4 it diffuses along with congo red dye to the surface of a nanoparticle hydrogen atom released from bh4 attacks congo red dye which activates the dye s azo bond initially congo red are attached to the nanoparticles through the sulphur and oxygen atom in the structure the azo bond is primarily weakened through the conjugation which leading to the lysis of the azo bond upon complete reduction the colorless solution is developed because of conversion of n n to nh nh bond and subsequent breakage of the hn nh bond due to acceptance of electron through a catalyst and hydrogen from bh4 ions jia et al 2014 naseem et al 2018a 4 influences of some variables on adsorption of congo red dye considering the fact that some removal strategies have some drawbacks for instance treatment of cr by membrane filtration technology is often accompanied with fouling of membrane and generation of sludge without the formation of harmful and toxic intermediates while photo catalytic degradation and biodegradation release toxic intermediate compounds like aniline and cycloheptadienylium m z 91 and sodium naphthalene sulfonate m z 227 respectively asses et al 2018 hence the sludge formed and its disposal challenges are main drawbacks also the choice of removal strategy is also dictated by operational costs consequently the adsorption process is considered to be one of the most effective and low priced treatment processes to eliminate dyes in wastewater and is commonly researched as shown in fig 15 the effectiveness of an adsorption is dependent on contact time concentration of the adsorbent and pollutant type of the adsorbent functional group attached to the surface of the adsorbent operating condition of adsorption system and others which requires to be studied understood and optimized in order to construct and or operate an effective wastewater treatment plant wwtp 4 1 influence of adsorbent concentration the concentration of adsorbent is an important parameter that influence the adsorption procedures and determines the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent at an increased concentration the number of functional groups and or active binding site increases and can result in increased cr removal however when removal percentage reaches a constant value there is a simultaneous decrease in bio sorption capacity this decrease is attributed to the saturation of surface sorption sites that leads to an increase in electrostatic repulsion between the dye molecules present in the medium stjepanović et al 2021 this was proven by the study carried out by wekoye et al on the removal of cr with cabbage waste powder cwp as the concentration of the adsorbent increases from 0 25 to 1 78 mg g the adsorption of the pollutant also increases from 4 88 to 48 76 however the rate of adsorption decreases when all the active sites of the cwp are fully saturated wekoye et al 2020 using activated carbon aminu et al investigated the effectiveness of adsorbent dosage in the removal of cr dye aminu et al 2020 the activated carbon used was prepared from jujube seed the graph in fig 16 shows the results of their findings a dosage rage of between 0 2 and 1 0 g was applied and the percent removal at each dosage application was recorded it was established that the increase in adsorbent dosage has resulted to an equally increase in the adsorption of the dye to a greater degree aminu et al 2020 in contrast to the proportional relationship described above for adsorbent dose and cr uptake khaniabadi et al reported a decrease in cr adsorption from 37 8 to 2 8 mg g when the concentration of montmorillonite increases from 1 to 9 g l as shown in fig 17 this is due to lower equilibrium concentration when higher dose was used than when lower dosage was used khaniabadi et al 2018 and the ability of the adsorbate to form agglomerate at higher concentration thereby resisting the adsorption of the dye on the adsorbent amran and zulfikar 2010 priyadarshini et al 2021 this means adsorbent dose needs to be optimized and the dose depends on the nature of the adsorbent 4 2 influence of contact time adsorption depends on the contact time between the adsorbate and the adsorbent stjepanović et al 2021 at the start of an adsorption experiment the functional groups of the adsorbent are readily available for interaction which increases the rate of adsorption as adsorption continues the functional group attached to the surface of the adsorbent becomes used up the rate of adsorption decreases accordingly and finally reaches a dynamic equilibrium with a maximum value where the rate of adsorption equals the rate of desorption at this point the dye is transported from the site of the bio sorbent surface to the internal sites of the bio sorbent hence a slow removal of dye bhattacharyya and ray 2015 wycliffe et al reported with the use of eichhnornia crassippes root 98 of cr was removed at 90 min sorption equilibrium wanyonyi et al 2014 the amount of dye adsorbed at a particular time t and at equilibrium is calculated as 14 q t c o c t v m where co is the initial dye concentration mg l ct is the dye concentration at any time t v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass of adsorbent the percentage of dye adsorbed is calculated as 15 a d s o r p t i o n 100 c o c t c o as shown in fig 18 above giwa et al monitored the effect of contact time on cr and reported an increase in the adsorption of cr from 1 16 to 2 75 mg g as the contact time increased from 60 to 1080 with parkia bioglobosa pine saw dust giwa et al 2021 a study on the use of eichnornia crassipes biomass adsorbent showed that 80 of cr was removed within 15 min of the experiment due to the large surface area of the adsorbent and reduces when equilibrium was attained at 45 min s due to the saturation of the active site on the surface of the adsorbent khaniabadi et al 2018 4 3 influence of solution ph the ph of the solution is another factor that affect the efficiency of adsorption due to its influence on the surface binding site of the adsorbent and the ionization of the dye molecule a change in the ph of the system can lead to change in the ionization and speciation of the dye and change in the active site of the adsorbent vijayakumar et al 2009 cr is an anionic dye slightly soluble at ph value 2 and negatively charged at ph range 5 10 in addition when ph phpzc the surface of the adsorbent becomes negatively charged favoring the adsorption of cation while when the ph phpzc the surface becomes positively charge favoring anionic specie uptake stjepanović et al 2021 this justifies the report of ferrarini et al that cr is best adsorbed at ph 5 acidic ph ferrarini et al 2016 and also by zulfika et al as illustrated in table 12 below zulfika et al 2017 from table 9 the adsorption of cr an anionic decreases as the ph increases this is as a result of the point of zero charge of cr being 8 6 therefore as the ph increases above the point of zero charge 8 6 ph phpzc the surface of the adsorbent becomes negatively charged resulting in a repulsive force between the adsorbent and the pollutant and lower percentage removal while at a lower ph ph phpzc the surface of the adsorbent becomes positively charged promoting the adsorption of the dye onto the surface of the aluminum dross and hence increasing the percentage removal zulfika et al 2017 aside from the surface charge of the adsorbent the functional group attached to the surface also enhanced the electrostatic interaction with the pollutant this was shown by lafi et al where coffee waste cw was used for the synthesis of activated carbon with the adsorption efficiency of cr decreasing from 25 5 to 12 mg g when the ph changes from 2 9 to 10 2 lafi et al 2019 as shown in fig 19 this effect was attributed to oxygen group attached to the prepared activated carbon which increases the surface acidity of the adsorbent thereby making the surface positively charged for electrostatic attraction or interaction with the r so3 functional group of cr lafi et al 2019 this finding was also supported by ausavasukhi et al 2016 according to this study at ph 5 the surface of the carbonized leonardite was positively charged due to protonation of the hydroxyl and carboxylic groups of the leonardite this promote the electrostatic π π interaction between the functional group of the adsorbent and cr for higher adsorption capacity as shown in fig 20 ausavasukhi et al 2016 in summary the optimum solution ph for effective removal of cr by adsorption is within ph 1 5 whereby the surface of adsorbent becomes positively charged and enhances electrostatic attraction between anionic cr and positively charged ad sorbent 5 conclusions this article reviewed the physical biological and chemical removal strategies for toxic cr dye from wastewater based on the review the following findings were observed emerging materials like mofs exhibits exceptionally high adsorption capacity for cr dye with mil 100 fe tma guo et al 2020 zif 8 chitosan x liu et al 2020 and nu uio 67 dong et al 2020 exhibiting maximum adsorption capacity of 1790 5 1221 and 2387 9 mg g respectively the chemical removal methods are effective but limited in application due to cost associated with it and likelihood of generating secondary toxic intermediates or pollutants during degradation like carcinogenic benzidine aniline cycloheptadienylium m z 91 and sodium naphthalene sulfonate membrane technology can be explored for cr removal but needs to be used in tandem with other conventional cr elimination strategies for effectiveness the feasibility of using microbial enzymes or microorganisms or the combination of both with a physicochemical method like adsorption may also be considered for the remediation of cr dye all the conventional treatment strategies for cr dye are linked to one or two limitations such as inability to treat large volumes of wastewater ineffectiveness expensiveness and method complexity with the exception of adsorption technology overall the summarized merits and demerits of various removal strategies for cr is presented in table 13 6 future research the following highlights the future research or challenges that needs to be focused on in order to achieve complete elimination of toxic cr dye from wastewater wastewater usually contain complex organic and inorganic pollutants and most findings have reported cr dye removal via adsorption without considering the impact of the presence of other pollutants hence future research should focus on the adsorption of the dye in the presence of other legacy or emerging contaminants of concern such as pesticides herbicides mercury hg lead pb cadmium perfluoroalkyl substances pfas etc in order to determine the efficacy of the adsorbent commonly a number of literatures reported mere lab bench scale adsorption removal strategies for cr dye studies its full application on industrial scale is yet to be fully explored due to scarcity of data or research on fixed column adsorption technology in the treatment of wastewater consequently more studies are needed on column adsorption of cr dye as it simulates the real wastewater treatment plant wwtp scenario declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11743,acid mine drainage has always been considered to be toxic to the environment this paper highlights its potential role from a water resource perspective in alleviating water supply issues in the witwatersrand gold mining region of south africa relevant local and international literature on acid mine drainage amd occurrence and treatment technologies were reviewed and supplemented with additional water quality data from amd and geochemical data from tailings dams this study revealed that the tailings dams contain high concentrations of toxic metals co pb cu u as fe and oxides such as sio2 al2o3 fe2o3 and feo amd is characterized by acidic ph 1 89 3 50 high orp 485 mv to 650 mv high ec 7475 μs cm to 9750 μs cm and brackish tds 6000 mg l to 8890 mg l the discharge volume of acid mine drainage in the area is approximately 202 million l day which can be available to supply water for the community after treatment this resource can also be fully utilized for extracting minerals chemicals as well as clean water that are beneficial to support the sustainable development of the region this may be achieved through the application of reverse osmosis that can produce safe drinking water and associated byproducts metals gypsum iron compounds acid as well as neutralization and cation exchange methods to generate water for agricultural uses the extraction of the minerals also has economic benefits and can contribute to job creation that limits the displacement of the local people in the mining region graphical abstract image 1 keywords acid mine drainage gold and uranium mines metal and gypsum extraction tailings dams witwatersrand basin south africa 1 introduction in the 6th assessment report of the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change it was indicated that the rate of temperature increase across the african continent exceeds the global average ipcc 2021 this has several implications for the southern african region including the reduction of rainfall amount increase in the intensity of rainfall and flooding events and increase in aridity that leads to meteorological agricultural as well as ecological droughts these effects will have a significant impact on water availability and supply south africa is characterized by climatic aridity frequent drought and low rainfall occurrence therefore groundwater from weathered and fractured crystalline aquifers is a primary source of water supply for various activities abiye et al 2021 the increasingly unpredictable rainfall occurrence and the growing demand for water supply in south africa make it imperative to find other sources of water grewar 2019 treated and well managed mine water generated from mining related activities can be considered as a supplementary water resource to sustain the water supply system wastewater from mining operations can potentially play a significant role in supplying water to local communities for various economic activities the main environmental concern associated with gold mine waste emanates from the oxidation of sulfide minerals such as pyrite pyrrhotite arsenopyrite nickel and cobalt sulfarsenides low base metal sulphides within the host rock waste materials and mine workings and the release of metals such as aluminium arsenic cadmium cobalt chromium copper mercury nickel lead uranium and zinc however amd can also be a potential resource to extract metals sulphuric acid clean water and gypsum for economic use several amd treatment technologies that can purify mine water have been tested across the world see section 6 3 sahoo et al 2013b van rooyen and van staden 2020 mogashane et al 2020 thisani et al 2021 ighalo et al 2022 kaurbrar et al 2022 merchichi et al 2022 various challenges and opportunities are associated with the reprocessing of tailings dams and the treatment of amd nordstrom et al 2017 mkandawire 2020 some of the challenges include the cost of operation maintenance chemicals and running costs while the use of the amd for extracting economic minerals and water is considered as an opportunity since amd from more than century old gold and uranium mines is abundant in the johannesburg region this review focuses on its potential role to alleviate the water supply problem for domestic use and various economic activities the availability of amd and tailings dams as sources of fresh water has been confirmed based on the water chemistry and geochemical results obtained from this study therefore this review highlights its feasibility as a potential resource for water supply and metal extraction that can support the sustainable development of the region 2 background on the mining impact in the region in gold mining sites groundwater is known to contain a high level of metals due to mining related activities singer and stumm 1970 wittmann and forstner 1976 naicker et al 2003 tutu et al 2008 abiye 2014 moshupya et al 2019 which is often treated passively in wetlands dunbabin and bowmer 1992 gazea et al 1996 sheoran and sheoran 2006 nyquist and greger 2009 humphries et al 2017 abiye et al 2018a in some cases the leaching of metamorphosed rocks also releases metals into the groundwater abiye and leshomo 2014 the weathered and fractured crystalline basement aquifers metasedimentary metavolcanic and intrusive rocks contain variable groundwater quality due to water rock interaction and recharge from polluted water abiye et al 2020 2021 leketa and abiye 2020 2021 often groundwater with thousands of years in circulation within the crystalline aquifers is exploited for various activities in the region that has also been dewatered during underground mining abiye and leketa 2021 in the johannesburg region acidic rainwater has an important role in the leaching of mine wastes and deteriorates the quality of water supply besides its high content of cd cu zn and pb due to the mining related aerosol impact abiye 2021 due to the mining related impact the wonderfontein stream in the west rand region located west of johannesburg contains high levels of uranium derived from uranium mines winde and stoch 2010 high arsenic concentration in the groundwater was also recorded in coal and gold mining areas as a result of sulphide oxidation that releases arsenic into groundwater sami and druzynski 2003 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 acidic water in the johannesburg region is derived from the leaching of the oxidized sulphides in the tailings dams and waste rock piles that were left unattended for several decades besides the decanting of groundwater through shafts and boreholes due to the rise in groundwater levels after mine closure abiye 2014 the leached chemicals flow into the wetlands and eventually join the water supply system the generation of amd through sulphide oxidation has been thoroughly discussed in various literature in the area rösner 1999 rösner et al 2001 naicker et al 2003 tutu et al 2008 dwa 2013a 2013b although the prevention of amd formation in the region may not be feasible at the moment due to the large footprints of the tailings dams appropriate management of amd can reduce the environmental impacts and provides clean water for the community studies conducted in the gold mine areas in south africa have shown that as amd drains through the wetlands metals were effectively removed through adsorption and precipitation processes leading to a significant water quality improvement mayes et al 2009 this was attributed to the buffering characteristics of wetland substrates based on the ph and redox potential of the water garcia et al 2001 nyquist and greger 2009 during periods of high rainfall intensity especially in the summer months runoff leaches mine waste and drains the wetlands at a high rate of flux this effect coupled with the continuously decanting mine water from abandoned mines increases the runoff of amd and significantly reduces the wetlands effectiveness as metal removing substrates abiye et al 2018a furthermore the continuous flow of amd through streams and the rising of acidic groundwater within the aquifers are of great concern in the area due to an increase in water salinity deposition of secondary minerals such as calcrete gypsum calcite and oxides in the farmlands hence affecting the livelihood of the community 3 study area the witwatersrand basin is the world s largest gold mining area which produced over 52 000 tons of refined gold since mining commenced in 1886 tucker et al 2016 the gold mining areas are concentrated within the patches of the witwatersrand supergroup rocks with the mineralized zones that extend from west rand to the johannesburg metropolitan central rand and east rand including areas such as the heidelberg and springs to the east there are about 374 abandoned tailings dams with an area of 321 km2 gdard 2012 that are a characteristic feature of the region fig 1 the central rand group and west rand group metasedimentary rocks host gold within the banded pyritic quartzites that contain quartz sio2 sericite kal2 alsi3o10 oh 2 uraninite uo2 pyrite fes2 and other sulphide minerals feather and koen 1975 backstrtöm 1976 whiteside et al 1976 as a result of a century old gold mining activity in the region groundwater has been under stress due to over pumping and mine related environmental impacts such as water quality deterioration landscape change subsidence dissolution clean water shortage and health hazard related to toxicity and radioactivity the predominant gold mine tailings dams are more than a km long and over 150 m in height the majority of which have been abandoned for more than a century the city of johannesburg was established as a result of the gold mining activity and therefore the remnants of gold mines and tailings dams are easily visible along the e w axis fig 1 the region is also known for its vast industrial and agricultural activities where wetlands are used for cattle grazing in addition to the habitat for waterbirds fig 2 it is obvious that the toxicity levels in the amd are not suitable for cattle farming that affect the socio economy of the region over the past few decades re utilization of the tailings dams to extract gold and uranium was conducted which could reduce the concentration levels of toxic metals and potentially reduces the amd formation fig 3 this activity is vital in minimizing the impact of leaching from the tailings dams and improving the quality of the environment through the provision of land for various activities based on the local and international experiences tailings dams contain valuable metals that can be extracted with the available technologies in order to reduce the environmental impact of mining wastes cánovas et al 2020 krüger 2020 see section 6 1 4 hydrogeological overview the hydrogeological setting of the gold and uranium bearing witwatersrand supergroup quartzite sandstone shale is closely related to the underlying basement rocks granitic gneiss gabbro and serpentinite and the overlying ventersdorp supergroup lava basalt transvaal supergroup quartzite shale and dolomite and karoo supergroup shale and sandstone and dykes syenite and dolerite often groundwater circulation in the stratigraphically overlying rocks has a direct effect on the underlying witwatersrand metasedimentary aquifer which was observed in several deep gold mining areas the main groundwater bearing aquifers are represented by alluvial sediments and weathered fractured crystalline rocks except for the johannesburg dome which is composed of basement rocks that are often deeply weathered and fractured the majority of the aquifers are composed of deformed and fractured metasedimentary rocks of the witwatersrand and transvaal supergroups and hence it is common to encounter a multilayer aquifer system a thorough account of aquifer description and groundwater level fluctuation in the johannesburg region has been given in abiye 2011 abiye 2011 and abiye et al 2018b based on the findings the most prominent cause for groundwater level fluctuations was related to over pumping and lack of recharge the most prominent deep underground mines in the witwatersrand basin are the mponeng gold mine 4 0 km below the surface tau tona gold mine 3 9 km below the surface savuka gold mine 3 7 km below the surface dierfontein gold mine 3 4 km below the surface kusasalethu gold mine 3 2 km below the surface and south deep gold mine 3 0 km below the surface in such deep mines continuous dewatering of both shallow and deep aquifers is mandatory to facilitate a dry working condition that has a direct impact on groundwater users frommurze 1937 reported that in the east rand mining region mines were dewatered at a rate of 6000 m3 day on average equivalent to 2 1 million m3 year while in the central and western parts of johannesburg the dewatering rate ranged from 5000 m3 day to 11 000 m3 day equivalent to 1 8 million m3 year to 4 0 million m3 year from the depth of about 700 m funke 1990 reported that gold mines in the eastern part of johannesburg dewatered the aquifers at a rate of 7 2 million m3 year to 9 8 million m3 year in order to avoid flooding of the underground workings while in the western part of johannesburg the dewatering rate ranges between 10 million m3 year and 60 million m3 year this shows an increase in the pumping rate as mining progressed deeper mine dewatering had several hydrogeological impacts including the disappearance of boreholes and springs and the formation of sinkholes in the dolomites around west rand winde and stoch 2010 and centurion areas since the closure of the mines groundwater levels have recovered resulting in the discharge of amd abiye et al 2015 if it is not managed properly amd can affect vital infrastructures such as the corrosion of water and gas pipes concrete foundation breakdowns such as buildings bridges and concrete roads as well as other groundwater dependent and riverine ecosystems interaction of amd with shallow aquifers also impacts the quality of fresh groundwater the groundwater quality in the dolomitic aquifer underlying the tailings dams was found to be ca mg so4 type with tds 8000 mg l rösner et al 2001 high tds of more than 2500 mg l was also recorded from gold and uranium mine effluents in streams wagner and van niekerk 1987 funke 1990 reported that permeable sand dumps allow oxidation of pyrite to depths exceeding 10 m and hence facilitating the release of metals into the environment groundwater quality in the vicinity of the mines is often characterized by an elevated metal content such as as cd co fe mn and ni often related to the mining impacts rösner et al 2001 abiye 2014 abiye et al 2018a 5 materials and methods local and international literature was thoroughly reviewed in line with the objective of this paper in order to validate the reported results in the study area field based sample collection was conducted there are several areas that contain amd in the witwatersrand basin with a high discharge of acidic mine water some are retained in the ponds and wetlands while the overflow joins streams rivers and water supply dams therefore accessible areas were targeted for the amd sampling including 5 streams that are impacted by amd and 7 areas at the tailings dams the amd samples were collected from the west rand central rand and east rand regions the samples were filtered into 100 ml glass bottles using a 0 45 μm filter and acidified using hno3 to preserve the metals in the solution the samples were kept in a dark cooler box for analysis in a laboratory metals were analysed using the perkinelmer elan drc ii icp ms system equipped with a meinhard nebulizer and a cyclonic quartz spray chamber samples from the tailings dams were milled for 5 min for the xrf analysis for major element analysis the powder samples were placed inside a glass bead and fused with lithium metaborate once the samples were prepared and loaded into the xrf instrument the x ray tube emits primary radiation which excites electrons and induces secondary emissions in the examined sample the oxide abundance for each sample was recorded in weight while metals were recorded in ppm 6 results and discussion 6 1 tailings dams composition as a precursor for toxicity of amd and as a potential for metal extraction the deposition of various minerals in the tailings dams has resulted in an elevated concentration of economically important ions metals and oxides that can be remobilized through amd for example abiye et al 2018a reported an average concentration of au 0 001 mg kg to 5 740 mg kg cd 0 001 mg kg to 22 890 mg kg pb 0 001 mg kg to 184 200 mg kg and cu 0 001 mg kg to 929 000 mg kg in the tailings dams samples these metals can be leached from the tailings dams due to interaction with rainwater and the oxidation process some studies also show the presence of economically extractable levels of metals in the tailings dams according to tutu et al 2008 the average concentration of metals based on composite samples from tailings dams was found to be very high with iron and aluminium as dominant ions while the most toxic elements such as co cu u pb and as occur with concentrations of 15 mg kg see table 1 this highlights the need to reprocess the tailings dams and utilize the minerals in order to reduce their presence in the water supply system the composition of the tailings dams often shows variability based on the mineralized rocks used during the mining process the oxide concentration from the xrf analysis of the tailings samples revealed a high weight proportion for sio2 67 55 83 98 wt al2o3 5 7 13 59 wt and feo 0 65 3 63 wt while low abundance for mgo 0 01 0 08 eight and na2o 0 12 0 55 wt which indicate the dominance of silica containing conglomerate used during gold mining based on the variation of the host rock that contains gold the measured oxides and metals table 2 show variations across the tailings dams fig 1 based on the mineralized rock used for mining similarly the metal concentration in the tailings dams table 2 revealed a wide range of compositional variations where the tailings contain high concentrations of cr 1169 66 309 67 ppm ba 159 63 561 83 ppm pb 5 96 47 36 ppm co 1 2 241 98 ppm cu 15 1 235 77 ppm and th 0 77 14 1 ppm with some spikes in concentration for co ni cu and zn this shows the variability in the composition which is attributed to the geology of the mineralized zone most of the elements detected in the tailings dams are toxic hence need to be extracted from the tailings dams to reduce the deterioration of water quality among toxic constituents the arsenic concentration in groundwater ranges from 17 μg l to 318 μg l which was attributed to sulphide oxidation abiye and bhattacharya 2019 the progressive deterioration of tailings dams through erosion and the dependence of people on available water resources raised concerns about the quality of water impacted by mine wastes that are widely distributed throughout the johannesburg region there is a significant correlation among the various constituents as presented in fig 4 a and b the pairwise correlation fig 4a shows the relationship among geochemical variables in the tailings dams high correlation 60 was observed for al2o3 and na2o k2o cr2o3 al2o3 and ga rb sr mno mgo and co ni cu zn cr co ni cu zn and th indicating the possibility of similar host rock and mineralization process on the other hand less correlation was observed between sio2 and mno nio co ni cu zn al2o3 and pb fe2o3 and ga rb sr pb and sc v cr ga rb sr ba which reveals there is no relationship among them for their occurrence in the tailings dams the geochemical constituents that share the same attribute either in the process or similarity in the source are expected to cluster together fig 4b clustering with a strong correlation could suggest the constituents are similar or generated through a similar geochemical process such as oxidation precipitation etc or similar source those with less clustering affinity as a result of their formation through different processes result low correlation coefficients such as pb and al2o3 k2o na2o cr ga rb sr ba v sc sio2 also has less clustering affinity with th these could suggest the presence of pb and th in the tailings dams that are generated through radioactive decay as opposed to the oxides and other metals besides its association with the uraninite mineralized zones various minerals were successfully extracted from tailings dams across the world the methods used for the extraction of metals from tailings include bioleaching using a microbial consortium falagán et al 2017 acid leaching combined with activated carbon álvarez et al 2021 combined direct reduction roasting and leaching fu et al 2018 glycine ammonia leaching in the presence of permanganate li et al 2022 and using biosurfactants during the process of soil washing arab and mulligan 2018 based on the physicochemical and chemical data table 3 the main characteristic feature of amd is represented by low ph 1 89 3 50 ave 2 84 high orp 485 mv to 650 mv ave 580 25 mv high ec 7475 μs cm to 9750 μs cm ave 8306 25 μs cm and high tds 6000 mg l to 8890 mg l ave 6925 25 mg l where exceptionally high values of tds low ph high iron sulphate manganese uranium arsenic zinc and arsenic concentrations are above the who drinking water guideline values the current data show that amd contains a substantial concentration of toxic metals such as co cu u and as in the amd samples table 3 the records show that sulphate ranges from 3520 0 to 4098 0 mg l ave 3846 75 mg l iron tot ranges from 801 0 to 3380 0 ave 2159 5 mg l cu ranges from 0 01 to 25 mg l ave 7 38 mg l u ranges from 0 05 to 1 22 mg l ave 0 68 mg l and as ranges from 3 4 to 45 0 mg l ave 25 13 mg l that are above the who drinking water guideline values this indicates high toxicity level in the water that requires the need to extract metals and utilize the treated water for various beneficial uses the wetlands and streams that directly receive amd also reflect a high level of impacts table 4 with sulphate ranging from 124 mg l to 4096 mg l and iron ranging from 188 mg l to 900 mg l as a direct reflection of the amd that has to be treated to limit the environmental damage in most cases the streams that join water supply dams could also pose a serious threat to human health the plot in fig 5 shows the dominance of total iron and sulphate that characterizes the amd content in the region when the orp values decreases and ph increases the iron concentration in the amd decreases due to the possible iron hydroxide precipitation table 3 6 2 the need for the amd as a supplementary water resource currently water supply in the johannesburg region is obtained primarily from the adjacent vaal river basin which receives transboundary water transfer from the lesotho highland at local level groundwater is tapped from the weathered and fractured crystalline aquifers including the witwatersrand metasedimentary ventersdorp volcanic and transvaal metasedimentary aquifers however due to high water demand in the area the supply shortfall could be a result of an increase in population agriculture mining and industrial activities the recent covid 19 pandemic needed additional water supply for sanitation purposes which posed stress on the existing water resources while planning for water supply in the arid and semi arid regions where demand surpasses the supply it is important to consider the availability of other water resources irrespective of quality that can be improved through the existing technologies one of these resources in the witwatersrand gold mining region is acid mine drainage that emanates from the abandoned gold and uranium mines 6 3 amd treatment treated amd should be viewed as a potential resource that can be used to meet the growing water demand there are efficient technologies that can be used to treat amd and meet the water demand in various sectors considering the high discharge volume of approximately 202 million l day of the amd in the johannesburg region that includes 177 million l day as per dwa 2013a and runoff from 321 km2 area of tailings dams estimated for this work it is necessary to implement strategies to effectively use this resource there are already efforts to improve the mine water quality and discharge it back into the river systems in the west rand area several existing treatment technologies can generate clean water from amd such as conventional neutralization chemical desalination membrane method using reverse osmosis high recovery precipitating reverse osmosis hipro electrodialysis vibration shear enhanced process ion exchange and many others were tested in the areas affected by acid mine drainage in different parts of the world sahoo et al 2013b van rooyen and

biological methods that are often referred to as active and passive the treatment of mine effluent through bioremediation in anaerobic wetlands has been conducted in different mining sites across the world johnson and hallberg 2005 van rooyen and van staden 2020 processes of metal removal in wetlands often identified as a passive treatment include sedimentation adsorption complexation bioremediation uptake by plants and microbially mediated reactions including oxidation and reduction that improve the quality of toxic mine water for safe environmental use perry and kleinmann 1991 dunbabin and bowmer 1992 gazea et al 1996 kuyucak 1999 whitehead and prior 2005 johnson and hallberg 2005 stoltz and greger 2006 abiye 2015 gandy et al 2016 skousen et al 2017 abiye et al 2018a merchichi et al 2022 once acidic water enters the wetlands the velocity of water slows down which gives sufficient time for reaction and precipitation of its contents to take place due to the buffering characteristics of the substrate which is a function of ph and redox potential of the water sheoran and sheoran 2006 akcil and koldas 2006 nyquist and greger 2009 abiye et al 2018a regarding the active treatment process several methods including neutralization with natural alkaline materials such as lime dolomite calcium oxide alkaline chemicals such as sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate na2co3 10h2o sulphate reduction to h2s in anaerobic media electrocoagulation and precipitation of metals complexation filtration and reverse osmosis have also been applied to improve the water quality utami et al 2020 the continuous flow of amd through streams and rising of acidic groundwater within the aquifers are of great concern for water users in the mining region due to quality deterioration increase in water salinity deposition of secondary minerals such as calcrete gypsum calcite and oxides in the farmlands hence affecting the livelihood of the farming communities the formation of amd can be prevented by reducing oxygen diffusion into the mine tailings nyquist and greger 2009 sahoo et al 2013b which seems to be difficult in the case of south africa as the tailings dams are not sealed and are exposed to rainwater rösner 1999 rösner et al 2001 naicker et al 2003 abiye 2014 analysis of existing data and literature reviews in the witwatersrand gold and uranium mining region revealed that in the sites where amd flows on the surface precipitation of gypsum and ferric iron hydroxide is common in addition to the covellite cus precipitation in the anaerobic wetlands substrates hydrous precipitation such as jarossite kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 pyrochroite mn oh2 gibbsite al oh 3 gypsum caso4 2h2o uranyl hydroxide uo₂ oh ₂ and chromium hydroxide cr oh 3 occurs due to the abundance of u cu al k fe cr so4 in the system the field observation presented in fig 6 displays the precipitation of gypsum gibbsite pyrochroite and ferric iron hydroxide within the amd aluminium precipitates from the amd in various forms e g as basaluminite al4 so4 oh 10 5 h2o boehmite alo oh and alunite kal3 so4 2 oh 6 while fe is precipitated as ferrihydrite fe oh 3 goethite feo oh munk et al 2002 macingova and luptakova 2012 michalková et al 2013 recent studies show that amd from coal mines was neutralized effectively with fly ash from the power stations in south africa vadapalli et al 2008 and also in india sahoo et al 2013a shirin et al 2021 adsorption of metals from amd through the use of clay volcanic ash and red soil has also been successfully conducted that has reduced the concentration of ni cu and zn esmaeili et al 2019 at a semi industrial scale an integrated process was utilized to treat amd from coal mines which includes magnesite lime soda ash and co2 bubbling treatment and was effective in improving the water quality masindi et al 2018 in a laboratory setting oxidation of pyrite was inhibited by organic materials such as manure and sewage sludge which could be attributed to the conversion of thiobacillus ferroxidans from a chemolithotrophic to heterotrophic in the presence of a readily decomposable organic matter that consumes oxygen thereby decreasing its availability for pyrite oxidation lundgren 1971 kleinmann et al 1981 the treatment of amd was known to generate clean water with byproducts such as gypsum iron bearing compounds and metals van rooyen and van staden 2020 as a pioneering example it is important to mention the emalahleni water reclamation plant located in the coal mining areas 140 km east of johannesburg which was designed and built to recover potable water from amd that was generated from several coal mines in the emalahleni witbank area hutton et al 2009 coal is known to contain potentially hazardous metals in the region wagner and hlatshwayo 2005 the keyplan high recovery precipitating reverse osmosis khipro technique provides about 24 2 million l day of clean water to the local municipality with a recovery rate of 99 hutton et al 2009 as a byproduct the treatment process produces about 100 tons of gypsum per day that is used as a building material for local houses ion exchange columns were also used to recover uranium and sulphate besides metal recovery through cationic exchange resins from amd howard et al 2009 this technique has not been implemented in gold mining areas to treat amd the utilization of low cost and easily available adsorbents has a superior option since it can be used to remove toxic metals from amd and produce water that is significantly less harmful to the environment this includes bentonite clay zeolite and biomass motsi et al 2009 enslin et al 2010 kosasih et al 2010 falayi and ntuli 2014 nleya 2016 in the short to medium term irrigation with gypsiferous mine water was proved to be effective with a negligible impact on groundwater quality frost and sullivan 2011 a study by grewar 2019 showed an increase in agricultural productivity by irrigation schemes using gypsiferous mine water compared with rain fed farming in the mining region even though amd has high salinity in the range of 6000 mg l it can easily be managed through the desalination process and purifying the water for various activities 7 conclusion south africa is endowed with a variety of economic minerals that are also responsible for the oxidation and mobilization of toxic chemicals in the aquifers complex geochemical processes that involve oxidation reduction and acidic ph condition are among the few that have facilitated the mobilization of metals from host rocks into the water supply system through amd with the increase in population and high water demand coupled with the impact of climate change communities in the johannesburg area are struggling to get clean water as a result access to this vital resource is becoming more precarious which often leads to protests results from this study show that areas affected by amd have high concentrations of metals besides the tailings dams that contain high concentrations of co cu u pb as cr and au the processing of tailings dams for mineral extraction has several benefits such as the use of metals and oxides by reducing the formation of amd the acidic and brackish nature of amd necessitates neutralization and desalination processes to reduce the environmental impact the application of various treatment technologies is helpful to obtain water for drinking agricultural and environmental uses besides the possibility to extract economically important byproducts such as metals gypsum iron compounds and acid that can help to boost the economy of the region the high discharge volume of amd across the region which is currently subjected to the pump and discharge process to avoid infrastructure damage as a result of the rise in groundwater level will be helpful to treat and use the water to supplement the water supply shortage data availability the data used in this

basin who paved the way for the current review 
11743,acid mine drainage has always been considered to be toxic to the environment this paper highlights its potential role from a water resource perspective in alleviating water supply issues in the witwatersrand gold mining region of south africa relevant local and international literature on acid mine drainage amd occurrence and treatment technologies were reviewed and supplemented with additional water quality data from amd and geochemical data from tailings dams this study revealed that the tailings dams contain high concentrations of toxic metals co pb cu u as fe and oxides such as sio2 al2o3 fe2o3 and feo amd is characterized by acidic ph 1 89 3 50 high orp 485 mv to 650 mv high ec 7475 μs cm to 9750 μs cm and brackish tds 6000 mg l to 8890 mg l the discharge volume of acid mine drainage in the area is approximately 202 million l day which can be available to supply water for the community after treatment this resource can also be fully utilized for extracting minerals chemicals as well as clean water that are beneficial to support the sustainable development of the region this may be achieved through the application of reverse osmosis that can produce safe drinking water and associated byproducts metals gypsum iron compounds acid as well as neutralization and cation exchange methods to generate water for agricultural uses the extraction of the minerals also has economic benefits and can contribute to job creation that limits the displacement of the local people in the mining region graphical abstract image 1 keywords acid mine drainage gold and uranium mines metal and gypsum extraction tailings dams witwatersrand basin south africa 1 introduction in the 6th assessment report of the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change it was indicated that the rate of temperature increase across the african continent exceeds the global average ipcc 2021 this has several implications for the southern african region including the reduction of rainfall amount increase in the intensity of rainfall and flooding events and increase in aridity that leads to meteorological agricultural as well as ecological droughts these effects will have a significant impact on water availability and supply south africa is characterized by climatic aridity frequent drought and low rainfall occurrence therefore groundwater from weathered and fractured crystalline aquifers is a primary source of water supply for various activities abiye et al 2021 the increasingly unpredictable rainfall occurrence and the growing demand for water supply in south africa make it imperative to find other sources of water grewar 2019 treated and well managed mine water generated from mining related activities can be considered as a supplementary water resource to sustain the water supply system wastewater from mining operations can potentially play a significant role in supplying water to local communities for various economic activities the main environmental concern associated with gold mine waste emanates from the oxidation of sulfide minerals such as pyrite pyrrhotite arsenopyrite nickel and cobalt sulfarsenides low base metal sulphides within the host rock waste materials and mine workings and the release of metals such as aluminium arsenic cadmium cobalt chromium copper mercury nickel lead uranium and zinc however amd can also be a potential resource to extract metals sulphuric acid clean water and gypsum for economic use several amd treatment technologies that can purify mine water have been tested across the world see section 6 3 sahoo et al 2013b van rooyen and van staden 2020 mogashane et al 2020 thisani et al 2021 ighalo et al 2022 kaurbrar et al 2022 merchichi et al 2022 various challenges and opportunities are associated with the reprocessing of tailings dams and the treatment of amd nordstrom et al 2017 mkandawire 2020 some of the challenges include the cost of operation maintenance chemicals and running costs while the use of the amd for extracting economic minerals and water is considered as an opportunity since amd from more than century old gold and uranium mines is abundant in the johannesburg region this review focuses on its potential role to alleviate the water supply problem for domestic use and various economic activities the availability of amd and tailings dams as sources of fresh water has been confirmed based on the water chemistry and geochemical results obtained from this study therefore this review highlights its feasibility as a potential resource for water supply and metal extraction that can support the sustainable development of the region 2 background on the mining impact in the region in gold mining sites groundwater is known to contain a high level of metals due to mining related activities singer and stumm 1970 wittmann and forstner 1976 naicker et al 2003 tutu et al 2008 abiye 2014 moshupya et al 2019 which is often treated passively in wetlands dunbabin and bowmer 1992 gazea et al 1996 sheoran and sheoran 2006 nyquist and greger 2009 humphries et al 2017 abiye et al 2018a in some cases the leaching of metamorphosed rocks also releases metals into the groundwater abiye and leshomo 2014 the weathered and fractured crystalline basement aquifers metasedimentary metavolcanic and intrusive rocks contain variable groundwater quality due to water rock interaction and recharge from polluted water abiye et al 2020 2021 leketa and abiye 2020 2021 often groundwater with thousands of years in circulation within the crystalline aquifers is exploited for various activities in the region that has also been dewatered during underground mining abiye and leketa 2021 in the johannesburg region acidic rainwater has an important role in the leaching of mine wastes and deteriorates the quality of water supply besides its high content of cd cu zn and pb due to the mining related aerosol impact abiye 2021 due to the mining related impact the wonderfontein stream in the west rand region located west of johannesburg contains high levels of uranium derived from uranium mines winde and stoch 2010 high arsenic concentration in the groundwater was also recorded in coal and gold mining areas as a result of sulphide oxidation that releases arsenic into groundwater sami and druzynski 2003 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 acidic water in the johannesburg region is derived from the leaching of the oxidized sulphides in the tailings dams and waste rock piles that were left unattended for several decades besides the decanting of groundwater through shafts and boreholes due to the rise in groundwater levels after mine closure abiye 2014 the leached chemicals flow into the wetlands and eventually join the water supply system the generation of amd through sulphide oxidation has been thoroughly discussed in various literature in the area rösner 1999 rösner et al 2001 naicker et al 2003 tutu et al 2008 dwa 2013a 2013b although the prevention of amd formation in the region may not be feasible at the moment due to the large footprints of the tailings dams appropriate management of amd can reduce the environmental impacts and provides clean water for the community studies conducted in the gold mine areas in south africa have shown that as amd drains through the wetlands metals were effectively removed through adsorption and precipitation processes leading to a significant water quality improvement mayes et al 2009 this was attributed to the buffering characteristics of wetland substrates based on the ph and redox potential of the water garcia et al 2001 nyquist and greger 2009 during periods of high rainfall intensity especially in the summer months runoff leaches mine waste and drains the wetlands at a high rate of flux this effect coupled with the continuously decanting mine water from abandoned mines increases the runoff of amd and significantly reduces the wetlands effectiveness as metal removing substrates abiye et al 2018a furthermore the continuous flow of amd through streams and the rising of acidic groundwater within the aquifers are of great concern in the area due to an increase in water salinity deposition of secondary minerals such as calcrete gypsum calcite and oxides in the farmlands hence affecting the livelihood of the community 3 study area the witwatersrand basin is the world s largest gold mining area which produced over 52 000 tons of refined gold since mining commenced in 1886 tucker et al 2016 the gold mining areas are concentrated within the patches of the witwatersrand supergroup rocks with the mineralized zones that extend from west rand to the johannesburg metropolitan central rand and east rand including areas such as the heidelberg and springs to the east there are about 374 abandoned tailings dams with an area of 321 km2 gdard 2012 that are a characteristic feature of the region fig 1 the central rand group and west rand group metasedimentary rocks host gold within the banded pyritic quartzites that contain quartz sio2 sericite kal2 alsi3o10 oh 2 uraninite uo2 pyrite fes2 and other sulphide minerals feather and koen 1975 backstrtöm 1976 whiteside et al 1976 as a result of a century old gold mining activity in the region groundwater has been under stress due to over pumping and mine related environmental impacts such as water quality deterioration landscape change subsidence dissolution clean water shortage and health hazard related to toxicity and radioactivity the predominant gold mine tailings dams are more than a km long and over 150 m in height the majority of which have been abandoned for more than a century the city of johannesburg was established as a result of the gold mining activity and therefore the remnants of gold mines and tailings dams are easily visible along the e w axis fig 1 the region is also known for its vast industrial and agricultural activities where wetlands are used for cattle grazing in addition to the habitat for waterbirds fig 2 it is obvious that the toxicity levels in the amd are not suitable for cattle farming that affect the socio economy of the region over the past few decades re utilization of the tailings dams to extract gold and uranium was conducted which could reduce the concentration levels of toxic metals and potentially reduces the amd formation fig 3 this activity is vital in minimizing the impact of leaching from the tailings dams and improving the quality of the environment through the provision of land for various activities based on the local and international experiences tailings dams contain valuable metals that can be extracted with the available technologies in order to reduce the environmental impact of mining wastes cánovas et al 2020 krüger 2020 see section 6 1 4 hydrogeological overview the hydrogeological setting of the gold and uranium bearing witwatersrand supergroup quartzite sandstone shale is closely related to the underlying basement rocks granitic gneiss gabbro and serpentinite and the overlying ventersdorp supergroup lava basalt transvaal supergroup quartzite shale and dolomite and karoo supergroup shale and sandstone and dykes syenite and dolerite often groundwater circulation in the stratigraphically overlying rocks has a direct effect on the underlying witwatersrand metasedimentary aquifer which was observed in several deep gold mining areas the main groundwater bearing aquifers are represented by alluvial sediments and weathered fractured crystalline rocks except for the johannesburg dome which is composed of basement rocks that are often deeply weathered and fractured the majority of the aquifers are composed of deformed and fractured metasedimentary rocks of the witwatersrand and transvaal supergroups and hence it is common to encounter a multilayer aquifer system a thorough account of aquifer description and groundwater level fluctuation in the johannesburg region has been given in abiye 2011 abiye 2011 and abiye et al 2018b based on the findings the most prominent cause for groundwater level fluctuations was related to over pumping and lack of recharge the most prominent deep underground mines in the witwatersrand basin are the mponeng gold mine 4 0 km below the surface tau tona gold mine 3 9 km below the surface savuka gold mine 3 7 km below the surface dierfontein gold mine 3 4 km below the surface kusasalethu gold mine 3 2 km below the surface and south deep gold mine 3 0 km below the surface in such deep mines continuous dewatering of both shallow and deep aquifers is mandatory to facilitate a dry working condition that has a direct impact on groundwater users frommurze 1937 reported that in the east rand mining region mines were dewatered at a rate of 6000 m3 day on average equivalent to 2 1 million m3 year while in the central and western parts of johannesburg the dewatering rate ranged from 5000 m3 day to 11 000 m3 day equivalent to 1 8 million m3 year to 4 0 million m3 year from the depth of about 700 m funke 1990 reported that gold mines in the eastern part of johannesburg dewatered the aquifers at a rate of 7 2 million m3 year to 9 8 million m3 year in order to avoid flooding of the underground workings while in the western part of johannesburg the dewatering rate ranges between 10 million m3 year and 60 million m3 year this shows an increase in the pumping rate as mining progressed deeper mine dewatering had several hydrogeological impacts including the disappearance of boreholes and springs and the formation of sinkholes in the dolomites around west rand winde and stoch 2010 and centurion areas since the closure of the mines groundwater levels have recovered resulting in the discharge of amd abiye et al 2015 if it is not managed properly amd can affect vital infrastructures such as the corrosion of water and gas pipes concrete foundation breakdowns such as buildings bridges and concrete roads as well as other groundwater dependent and riverine ecosystems interaction of amd with shallow aquifers also impacts the quality of fresh groundwater the groundwater quality in the dolomitic aquifer underlying the tailings dams was found to be ca mg so4 type with tds 8000 mg l rösner et al 2001 high tds of more than 2500 mg l was also recorded from gold and uranium mine effluents in streams wagner and van niekerk 1987 funke 1990 reported that permeable sand dumps allow oxidation of pyrite to depths exceeding 10 m and hence facilitating the release of metals into the environment groundwater quality in the vicinity of the mines is often characterized by an elevated metal content such as as cd co fe mn and ni often related to the mining impacts rösner et al 2001 abiye 2014 abiye et al 2018a 5 materials and methods local and international literature was thoroughly reviewed in line with the objective of this paper in order to validate the reported results in the study area field based sample collection was conducted there are several areas that contain amd in the witwatersrand basin with a high discharge of acidic mine water some are retained in the ponds and wetlands while the overflow joins streams rivers and water supply dams therefore accessible areas were targeted for the amd sampling including 5 streams that are impacted by amd and 7 areas at the tailings dams the amd samples were collected from the west rand central rand and east rand regions the samples were filtered into 100 ml glass bottles using a 0 45 μm filter and acidified using hno3 to preserve the metals in the solution the samples were kept in a dark cooler box for analysis in a laboratory metals were analysed using the perkinelmer elan drc ii icp ms system equipped with a meinhard nebulizer and a cyclonic quartz spray chamber samples from the tailings dams were milled for 5 min for the xrf analysis for major element analysis the powder samples were placed inside a glass bead and fused with lithium metaborate once the samples were prepared and loaded into the xrf instrument the x ray tube emits primary radiation which excites electrons and induces secondary emissions in the examined sample the oxide abundance for each sample was recorded in weight while metals were recorded in ppm 6 results and discussion 6 1 tailings dams composition as a precursor for toxicity of amd and as a potential for metal extraction the deposition of various minerals in the tailings dams has resulted in an elevated concentration of economically important ions metals and oxides that can be remobilized through amd for example abiye et al 2018a reported an average concentration of au 0 001 mg kg to 5 740 mg kg cd 0 001 mg kg to 22 890 mg kg pb 0 001 mg kg to 184 200 mg kg and cu 0 001 mg kg to 929 000 mg kg in the tailings dams samples these metals can be leached from the tailings dams due to interaction with rainwater and the oxidation process some studies also show the presence of economically extractable levels of metals in the tailings dams according to tutu et al 2008 the average concentration of metals based on composite samples from tailings dams was found to be very high with iron and aluminium as dominant ions while the most toxic elements such as co cu u pb and as occur with concentrations of 15 mg kg see table 1 this highlights the need to reprocess the tailings dams and utilize the minerals in order to reduce their presence in the water supply system the composition of the tailings dams often shows variability based on the mineralized rocks used during the mining process the oxide concentration from the xrf analysis of the tailings samples revealed a high weight proportion for sio2 67 55 83 98 wt al2o3 5 7 13 59 wt and feo 0 65 3 63 wt while low abundance for mgo 0 01 0 08 eight and na2o 0 12 0 55 wt which indicate the dominance of silica containing conglomerate used during gold mining based on the variation of the host rock that contains gold the measured oxides and metals table 2 show variations across the tailings dams fig 1 based on the mineralized rock used for mining similarly the metal concentration in the tailings dams table 2 revealed a wide range of compositional variations where the tailings contain high concentrations of cr 1169 66 309 67 ppm ba 159 63 561 83 ppm pb 5 96 47 36 ppm co 1 2 241 98 ppm cu 15 1 235 77 ppm and th 0 77 14 1 ppm with some spikes in concentration for co ni cu and zn this shows the variability in the composition which is attributed to the geology of the mineralized zone most of the elements detected in the tailings dams are toxic hence need to be extracted from the tailings dams to reduce the deterioration of water quality among toxic constituents the arsenic concentration in groundwater ranges from 17 μg l to 318 μg l which was attributed to sulphide oxidation abiye and bhattacharya 2019 the progressive deterioration of tailings dams through erosion and the dependence of people on available water resources raised concerns about the quality of water impacted by mine wastes that are widely distributed throughout the johannesburg region there is a significant correlation among the various constituents as presented in fig 4 a and b the pairwise correlation fig 4a shows the relationship among geochemical variables in the tailings dams high correlation 60 was observed for al2o3 and na2o k2o cr2o3 al2o3 and ga rb sr mno mgo and co ni cu zn cr co ni cu zn and th indicating the possibility of similar host rock and mineralization process on the other hand less correlation was observed between sio2 and mno nio co ni cu zn al2o3 and pb fe2o3 and ga rb sr pb and sc v cr ga rb sr ba which reveals there is no relationship among them for their occurrence in the tailings dams the geochemical constituents that share the same attribute either in the process or similarity in the source are expected to cluster together fig 4b clustering with a strong correlation could suggest the constituents are similar or generated through a similar geochemical process such as oxidation precipitation etc or similar source those with less clustering affinity as a result of their formation through different processes result low correlation coefficients such as pb and al2o3 k2o na2o cr ga rb sr ba v sc sio2 also has less clustering affinity with th these could suggest the presence of pb and th in the tailings dams that are generated through radioactive decay as opposed to the oxides and other metals besides its association with the uraninite mineralized zones various minerals were successfully extracted from tailings dams across the world the methods used for the extraction of metals from tailings include bioleaching using a microbial consortium falagán et al 2017 acid leaching combined with activated carbon álvarez et al 2021 combined direct reduction roasting and leaching fu et al 2018 glycine ammonia leaching in the presence of permanganate li et al 2022 and using biosurfactants during the process of soil washing arab and mulligan 2018 based on the physicochemical and chemical data table 3 the main characteristic feature of amd is represented by low ph 1 89 3 50 ave 2 84 high orp 485 mv to 650 mv ave 580 25 mv high ec 7475 μs cm to 9750 μs cm ave 8306 25 μs cm and high tds 6000 mg l to 8890 mg l ave 6925 25 mg l where exceptionally high values of tds low ph high iron sulphate manganese uranium arsenic zinc and arsenic concentrations are above the who drinking water guideline values the current data show that amd contains a substantial concentration of toxic metals such as co cu u and as in the amd samples table 3 the records show that sulphate ranges from 3520 0 to 4098 0 mg l ave 3846 75 mg l iron tot ranges from 801 0 to 3380 0 ave 2159 5 mg l cu ranges from 0 01 to 25 mg l ave 7 38 mg l u ranges from 0 05 to 1 22 mg l ave 0 68 mg l and as ranges from 3 4 to 45 0 mg l ave 25 13 mg l that are above the who drinking water guideline values this indicates high toxicity level in the water that requires the need to extract metals and utilize the treated water for various beneficial uses the wetlands and streams that directly receive amd also reflect a high level of impacts table 4 with sulphate ranging from 124 mg l to 4096 mg l and iron ranging from 188 mg l to 900 mg l as a direct reflection of the amd that has to be treated to limit the environmental damage in most cases the streams that join water supply dams could also pose a serious threat to human health the plot in fig 5 shows the dominance of total iron and sulphate that characterizes the amd content in the region when the orp values decreases and ph increases the iron concentration in the amd decreases due to the possible iron hydroxide precipitation table 3 6 2 the need for the amd as a supplementary water resource currently water supply in the johannesburg region is obtained primarily from the adjacent vaal river basin which receives transboundary water transfer from the lesotho highland at local level groundwater is tapped from the weathered and fractured crystalline aquifers including the witwatersrand metasedimentary ventersdorp volcanic and transvaal metasedimentary aquifers however due to high water demand in the area the supply shortfall could be a result of an increase in population agriculture mining and industrial activities the recent covid 19 pandemic needed additional water supply for sanitation purposes which posed stress on the existing water resources while planning for water supply in the arid and semi arid regions where demand surpasses the supply it is important to consider the availability of other water resources irrespective of quality that can be improved through the existing technologies one of these resources in the witwatersrand gold mining region is acid mine drainage that emanates from the abandoned gold and uranium mines 6 3 amd treatment treated amd should be viewed as a potential resource that can be used to meet the growing water demand there are efficient technologies that can be used to treat amd and meet the water demand in various sectors considering the high discharge volume of approximately 202 million l day of the amd in the johannesburg region that includes 177 million l day as per dwa 2013a and runoff from 321 km2 area of tailings dams estimated for this work it is necessary to implement strategies to effectively use this resource there are already efforts to improve the mine water quality and discharge it back into the river systems in the west rand area several existing treatment technologies can generate clean water from amd such as conventional neutralization chemical desalination membrane method using reverse osmosis high recovery precipitating reverse osmosis hipro electrodialysis vibration shear enhanced process ion exchange and many others were tested in the areas affected by acid mine drainage in different parts of the world sahoo et al 2013b van rooyen and

biological methods that are often referred to as active and passive the treatment of mine effluent through bioremediation in anaerobic wetlands has been conducted in different mining sites across the world johnson and hallberg 2005 van rooyen and van staden 2020 processes of metal removal in wetlands often identified as a passive treatment include sedimentation adsorption complexation bioremediation uptake by plants and microbially mediated reactions including oxidation and reduction that improve the quality of toxic mine water for safe environmental use perry and kleinmann 1991 dunbabin and bowmer 1992 gazea et al 1996 kuyucak 1999 whitehead and prior 2005 johnson and hallberg 2005 stoltz and greger 2006 abiye 2015 gandy et al 2016 skousen et al 2017 abiye et al 2018a merchichi et al 2022 once acidic water enters the wetlands the velocity of water slows down which gives sufficient time for reaction and precipitation of its contents to take place due to the buffering characteristics of the substrate which is a function of ph and redox potential of the water sheoran and sheoran 2006 akcil and koldas 2006 nyquist and greger 2009 abiye et al 2018a regarding the active treatment process several methods including neutralization with natural alkaline materials such as lime dolomite calcium oxide alkaline chemicals such as sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate na2co3 10h2o sulphate reduction to h2s in anaerobic media electrocoagulation and precipitation of metals complexation filtration and reverse osmosis have also been applied to improve the water quality utami et al 2020 the continuous flow of amd through streams and rising of acidic groundwater within the aquifers are of great concern for water users in the mining region due to quality deterioration increase in water salinity deposition of secondary minerals such as calcrete gypsum calcite and oxides in the farmlands hence affecting the livelihood of the farming communities the formation of amd can be prevented by reducing oxygen diffusion into the mine tailings nyquist and greger 2009 sahoo et al 2013b which seems to be difficult in the case of south africa as the tailings dams are not sealed and are exposed to rainwater rösner 1999 rösner et al 2001 naicker et al 2003 abiye 2014 analysis of existing data and literature reviews in the witwatersrand gold and uranium mining region revealed that in the sites where amd flows on the surface precipitation of gypsum and ferric iron hydroxide is common in addition to the covellite cus precipitation in the anaerobic wetlands substrates hydrous precipitation such as jarossite kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 pyrochroite mn oh2 gibbsite al oh 3 gypsum caso4 2h2o uranyl hydroxide uo₂ oh ₂ and chromium hydroxide cr oh 3 occurs due to the abundance of u cu al k fe cr so4 in the system the field observation presented in fig 6 displays the precipitation of gypsum gibbsite pyrochroite and ferric iron hydroxide within the amd aluminium precipitates from the amd in various forms e g as basaluminite al4 so4 oh 10 5 h2o boehmite alo oh and alunite kal3 so4 2 oh 6 while fe is precipitated as ferrihydrite fe oh 3 goethite feo oh munk et al 2002 macingova and luptakova 2012 michalková et al 2013 recent studies show that amd from coal mines was neutralized effectively with fly ash from the power stations in south africa vadapalli et al 2008 and also in india sahoo et al 2013a shirin et al 2021 adsorption of metals from amd through the use of clay volcanic ash and red soil has also been successfully conducted that has reduced the concentration of ni cu and zn esmaeili et al 2019 at a semi industrial scale an integrated process was utilized to treat amd from coal mines which includes magnesite lime soda ash and co2 bubbling treatment and was effective in improving the water quality masindi et al 2018 in a laboratory setting oxidation of pyrite was inhibited by organic materials such as manure and sewage sludge which could be attributed to the conversion of thiobacillus ferroxidans from a chemolithotrophic to heterotrophic in the presence of a readily decomposable organic matter that consumes oxygen thereby decreasing its availability for pyrite oxidation lundgren 1971 kleinmann et al 1981 the treatment of amd was known to generate clean water with byproducts such as gypsum iron bearing compounds and metals van rooyen and van staden 2020 as a pioneering example it is important to mention the emalahleni water reclamation plant located in the coal mining areas 140 km east of johannesburg which was designed and built to recover potable water from amd that was generated from several coal mines in the emalahleni witbank area hutton et al 2009 coal is known to contain potentially hazardous metals in the region wagner and hlatshwayo 2005 the keyplan high recovery precipitating reverse osmosis khipro technique provides about 24 2 million l day of clean water to the local municipality with a recovery rate of 99 hutton et al 2009 as a byproduct the treatment process produces about 100 tons of gypsum per day that is used as a building material for local houses ion exchange columns were also used to recover uranium and sulphate besides metal recovery through cationic exchange resins from amd howard et al 2009 this technique has not been implemented in gold mining areas to treat amd the utilization of low cost and easily available adsorbents has a superior option since it can be used to remove toxic metals from amd and produce water that is significantly less harmful to the environment this includes bentonite clay zeolite and biomass motsi et al 2009 enslin et al 2010 kosasih et al 2010 falayi and ntuli 2014 nleya 2016 in the short to medium term irrigation with gypsiferous mine water was proved to be effective with a negligible impact on groundwater quality frost and sullivan 2011 a study by grewar 2019 showed an increase in agricultural productivity by irrigation schemes using gypsiferous mine water compared with rain fed farming in the mining region even though amd has high salinity in the range of 6000 mg l it can easily be managed through the desalination process and purifying the water for various activities 7 conclusion south africa is endowed with a variety of economic minerals that are also responsible for the oxidation and mobilization of toxic chemicals in the aquifers complex geochemical processes that involve oxidation reduction and acidic ph condition are among the few that have facilitated the mobilization of metals from host rocks into the water supply system through amd with the increase in population and high water demand coupled with the impact of climate change communities in the johannesburg area are struggling to get clean water as a result access to this vital resource is becoming more precarious which often leads to protests results from this study show that areas affected by amd have high concentrations of metals besides the tailings dams that contain high concentrations of co cu u pb as cr and au the processing of tailings dams for mineral extraction has several benefits such as the use of metals and oxides by reducing the formation of amd the acidic and brackish nature of amd necessitates neutralization and desalination processes to reduce the environmental impact the application of various treatment technologies is helpful to obtain water for drinking agricultural and environmental uses besides the possibility to extract economically important byproducts such as metals gypsum iron compounds and acid that can help to boost the economy of the region the high discharge volume of amd across the region which is currently subjected to the pump and discharge process to avoid infrastructure damage as a result of the rise in groundwater level will be helpful to treat and use the water to supplement the water supply shortage data availability the data used in this

11744,the presence of microplastics in various abiotic and biotic matrices has sought the attention of researchers across the globe despite being subsurface groundwater is also reported to be contaminated with microplastics however there is paucity of information regarding the major pathways responsible for microplastic contamination in groundwater further information is altogether lacking about the assessment methodologies for microplastics contamination in the subsurface zone therefore in this review paper we aim to provide insights into various interaction pathways among the surface and subsurface sources through which groundwater gets contaminated the novel feature of the review is that it also attempts to establish a conceptual framework for modelling the microplastic contamination in groundwater where the extent of contamination was ascertained by combining the movement of microplastic particles and the movement of associated additives plasticizers as groundwater is one of the important sources for drinking as well as irrigation potential impacts of microplastics contamination onto the human health and soil ecology is also discussed possible management strategies have also been summarized thus this review will provide a complete depiction and consequences of the microplastics contamination in groundwater and therefore serve as a starting point for future researchers in the area of groundwater microplastics graphical abstract image 1 keywords dlvo theory groundwater contamination health impacts lagrangian particles microplastic s modelling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater or subsurface water is one of the most important global natural resources of the total water available on the earth groundwater amounts to 1 69 of which only 0 76 water is fresh and hence utilizable shiklomanov 1993 despite being present in low quantity groundwater shares a significant amount of the daily water requirements in many countries for example india being the largest user of groundwater in the world is dependent on this resource for its 85 drinking needs and 60 of its irrigation requirements world bank report 2012 jain et al 2018 2021 malik and bhagwat 2021 considering the potential of groundwater it is of utmost importance to keep this resource safe and uncontaminated however in the present scenario various geogenic and anthropogenic contaminants are continuously mixing with the groundwater deteriorating its quality khatri and tyagi 2014 jain et al 2018 2021 singh et al 2021a the changing living standards and consumption patterns have introduced new contaminants also known as emerging contaminants for which origin pathways and health impacts remain unknown microplastics are one such emerging contaminants that have been reported in the groundwater panno et al 2019 re 2019 kim and lee 2020 considering their toxic potential microplastics are of immediate concern to human health and the environment ensign et al 2012 chua et al 2014 silva et al 2018 smith et al 2018 prata et al 2020 the term microplastic was first introduced in 2004 and later defined as the plastic particles of size in the range of 1 μm 5 mm thompson et al 2009 frias and nash 2019 these microplastic particles may be of primary and or secondary origin primary microplastics are purposefully manufactured in small sizes for various applications in the pharmaceuticals and cosmetic industries singh et al 2022 on the other hand secondary microplastics are the result of breakdown of large size plastics due to various abiotic and biotic means such as solar irradiation mechanical abrasion microbial action etc wagner and lambert 2018 even the bioplastics result in smaller particles upon degradation when disposed of in an unregulated manner and thus further add on to the pool of microplastics shruti and muniasamy 2019 these small size plastics may be in the form of fragments pellets beads fibres etc as the global use of plastics bioplastics is increasing plastic europe 2019 garside 2019 the increase in the number of secondary microplastics is evident nevertheless a significant amount of plastic waste is dumped in rivers and other surface water bodies geyer et al 2017 plastic europe 2019 the ocean lebreton et al 2017 horton et al 2017 and landfills which breakdown into smaller pieces by the action of biotic and abiotic factors and thereafter finds its way into the groundwater knowledge about the occurrence of microplastics in the subsurface environment groundwater is limited table 1 and hence research in this direction needs to be catalyzed consideration of microplastics contamination and its spatial extent in the groundwater is crucial since groundwater accounts for 25 of the global drinking water supply panno et al 2019 these small size plastic beads and fibres are reported to have deleterious health impacts ensign et al 2012 schirinzi et al 2017 deng et al 2017 smith et al 2018 prata et al 2020 there are three methods through which microplastics may pose health hazards viz 1 hazards caused by microplastic particles themselves upon ingestion 2 hazards due to various chemicals colours plasticizers and additives present in the microplastics and 3 hazards due to biofilm formation by microorganisms over microplastic particles who 2019 moreover once introduced into the aquifer system microplastic pollution also poses serious threat to groundwater ecology and soil environment thus placing it in the list of top ten environmental problems unep 2014 therefore to take appropriate action for minimizing this problem it is essential to understand the various processes and components which make up the microplastics pollution in recent years several studies have monitored the presence of microplastics in groundwater bouwman et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 ganesan et al 2019 selvam et al 2021 however these literatures are limited in explaining the source origin and the pathways through which the groundwater gets exposed to microplastics moreover the existing knowledge also fails to explain the fate transport and impacts of microplastics once they are introduced into the subsurface environment considering the above knowledge gaps and the diversity of scientific disciplines involved in understanding the fate transport and consequences of microplastic pollution it becomes imperative to review synthesize and correlate the existing knowledge hence in this study we have reviewed more than 500 research papers belonging to different disciplines by searching through google scholar pubmed researchgate and web of science with the following objectives a to understand various aspects of groundwater contamination due to microplastics and the sources responsible b to conceptualize the microplastic transport with analytical or numerical modelling through two pronged approach viz 1 modelling the physical movement of microplastics in groundwater and 2 modelling the movement of plasticizers and additives present on the surface of microplastics which leach out when these particles fibres come in contact with chemicals solvents groundwater c to understand the impacts of microplastic contaminated groundwater on the human health and the environment and d to discuss the preventive measures and upcoming technological interventions which hold the possibility of minimizing the microplastics pollution in groundwater thus the review attempts to illustrate in detail the sources of microplastic pollution in groundwater fate and transport of microplastics and associated additives in soil water matrix the direct and indirect impacts caused by microplastic exposure and the ways to minimize microplastics in groundwater the study will certainly be helpful in understanding one of the emerging contaminants viz microplastics and set a base for development of models for assessing groundwater risk and vulnerability due to microplastics 2 sources of microplastics contamination and transport pathways into the groundwater the presence of microplastics in surface water sources such as seas oceans rivers lakes is undoubtedly proved wright and kelly 2017 carbery et al 2018 karthik et al 2018 rezania et al 2018 wang et al 2018 robin et al 2020 ashwini and varghese 2020 since groundwater also forms a significant part of the hydrological cycle it is obvious to expect an interaction among the different hydrological systems resulting in declining groundwater quality due to the contamination in surface water sources thus geological processes such as sea water intrusion alfarrah and walraevens 2018 gopinath et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 and groundwater river lake interaction anderson and munter 1981 nizzetto et al 2016 a kooi et al 2018 liedermann et al 2018 can be considered as some of the possible sources of microplastics contamination in the groundwater in addition to this microplastics find their way into the soil through a variety of sources such as discharge from wastewater treatment plants outflows of septic tanks leachate from landfill sites and direct injection of contaminated water into the soil etc usepa 2008 re 2019 moreover the use of plastic mulching in agriculture results in microplastics through the weathering and breakdown of the plastic sheet under uv light exposure rillig 2012 liu et al 2018 the microplastic laden sludge obtained from the wastewater treatment plants which is invariably applied onto the soil li et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 also contaminates the top layers of the soil profile when the infiltrating water percolates through the cracks and voids of such contaminated soil it gets exposed to the microplastics and associated chemical moieties thus pushing the contaminants much deeper into the soil layers ultimately mixing it with groundwater municipal landfills are also one of the important sources of microplastic pollution as according to a study landfills have accumulated approximately 79 of the total virgin plastic produced till date globally geyer et al 2017 based on the age of landfills when the acidic or alkaline leachate remains in contact with the discarded plastic waste for a long period it results in the breakdown of these plastics into smaller particles along with the leaching of plasticizers and additives from the plastics surface when the microplastic laden leachate moves through the underlying soil and reaches the groundwater system it becomes the point source for microplastic pollution to understand various hydrological interactions and pathways which might be responsible for microplastics contamination in groundwater composition of microplastics in different sources table 2 is compared with the composition of microplastics found in the groundwater table 1 upon comparison polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyester pes polyamide pa and polyvinylchloride pvc were found to be the major types of microplastics present in the groundwater table 1 these also dominate the composition of microplastics occurring in surface water sources wastewater effluents and leachate emanating from the landfills table 2 a similar pattern can be observed when we look at the types of plasticizers and various additives found in the groundwater and surface water bodies that are directly affected by microplastic pollution table 3 a number of chemical moieties such as bisphenol a bpa benzotriazoles tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep benzophenones etc have been reported in the groundwater across the globe loos et al 2010 regnery et al 2011 stuart et al 2011 these moieties are of wide application in the manufacturing of plastics for various applications concurrent occurrence of these moieties in the surface water bodies basheer et al 2004 loos et al 2007 regnery and puttmann 2010 soils breedveld et al 2002 sanchez brunete et al 2011 and sediments zhang et al 2011 kameda et al 2011 cao et al 2012 depict their interaction with the groundwater table 3 thus various exchanges and theoretical pathways responsible for microplastics movement based on these interactions are explored in this section 2 1 microplastics transport through groundwater river interaction the groundwater and river interactions are being extensively studied through various methods such as modelling isotopic figure printing field experiments and temperature profiling hoeg et al 2000 krause et al 2012 rosenberry et al 2013 karan et al 2016 vrzel et al 2019 these studies illustrate that both the quantity and quality of surface water have an impact on groundwater quality and quantity chaubey and arora 2017 lewandowski et al 2020 rivers act as a transport medium for microplastics from the point of contamination sources nizzetto et al 2016 a kooi et al 2018 liedermann et al 2018 as river velocity varies continuously it has a direct influence on the river carrying capacity chien and wan 1999 yang et al 2007 ni et al 2014 in the locations where the river water becomes sluggish the contaminant load starts to deposit in the hyporheic zones toffaleti 1968 ackers and white 1973 this process of contaminant deposition in the hyporheic zone holds true for accumulation of microplastics at the river bed as well frei et al 2019 the hyporheic zone can be considered as a hot spot for surface and groundwater interactions interaction is multi directional in this zone and may occur at varied spatio temporal scales boano et al 2014 cardenas 2015 the direction of flow through the hyporheic zone depends upon the relative positions of the groundwater table and water level in the river since microplastics are the outcome of anthropogenic activities the uncontaminated groundwater can be considered free from microplastic and hence it is mostly the seepage of contaminated surface water which contributes to the plastic pollution in the subsurface water fig 1 illustrates the groundwater contamination from surface water sources as the groundwater level goes below the water level of the river the resulting hydraulic gradient directs the water to flow from river towards the groundwater the movement of water through the soil pores increases the velocity of seeping water thus pushing the microplastics inside the pores of the aquifer system which finally gets transported to the subsurface environment drummond et al 2020 though the physical movement of microplastics through the soil layer is very slow and may take years to reach groundwater the presence of various potentially toxic substances potss such as chemicals plasticizers antioxidants stabilizers slip additives monomers and oligomers facilitate the migration of the contaminants into the groundwater hahladakis et al 2018 owing to longer contact duration with pore water and large surface area of contact 2 2 microplastics transport through groundwater lake interaction lakes are considered as one of the important sources of freshwater however in comparison to rivers lakes are calmer and have longer residence time thus the contaminants entering the lake water get greater time to settle and accumulate onto the bed of the lakes thereby becoming part of the sediments microplastics have been reported in the sediments of lakes su et al 2016 yin et al 2019 liu et al 2019 these microplastics were found in the range of 11 to 3153 items kg dry wet in the sediment samples eriksen et al 2013 castañeda et al 2014 yonkos et al 2014 su et al 2016 microplastics having a size range 1 mm were found to be the most abundant fraction in sediments reaching over 50 su et al 2016 willis et al 2017 yin et al 2019 microscopic observations revealed four forms of microplastics in the lakes sediments viz foams fragments films and fibres among which the most common was the fragments the interactions between the lake and groundwater are bidirectional and it depends upon the season and relative water levels anderson and munter 1981 the reversal in the interactions between the lake and groundwater has an effect on the chemical characteristics of both the water bodies javadzadeh et al 2020 as the water seeps from the lake microplastics along with the contaminants move into the groundwater initially some of the microplastics get accumulated in the pores of aquifer material which later get transported to the groundwater with continuous movement of seeping water as the microplastics are chemically inert and take years to degrade it hinders the flow path and decreases the water exchange between lakes and groundwater the decreased inflow between the two water bodies decreases the dilution of other geogenic contaminants and hence the ionic balance of the lake and nearby groundwater gets changed once the microplastics occupy the pore spaces between the aquifer materials the additives and the plasticizers materials present in the microplastics get more time to react with the seeping water thus the seeping water mixed with additives and plasticizers upon reaching the groundwater contaminates the entire aquifer 2 3 microplastics transport through sea water groundwater interaction microplastics are ubiquitous in the marine environment their presence is recorded in the water column at the seabed and in the sediments of sea beaches barnes et al 2009 law et al 2010 browne et al 2011 rochman et al 2013 based on the density difference between seawater and plastic these microplastic particles undergo vertical redistribution courtene jones et al 2017 the presence of microplastics has also been reported in the salt prepared from the seawater karami et al 2017 peixoto et al 2019 selvam et al 2020 since microplastics are reported in all sizes and forms from seawater and sea salt it can be considered one of the important routes of microplastic pollution in groundwater the phenomenon of mixing seawater with the subsurface ground water sources is termed as seawater intrusion sea water intrusion is the natural process of mixing seawater with the groundwater resources but most often it is triggered by anthropogenic causes this phenomenon has been extensively reported in coastal aquifers alfarrah and walraevens 2018 gopinath et al 2019 chen et al 2019 wang et al 2020 a the fundamental cause of seawater intrusion is the intensive extraction of groundwater which results in decreased freshwater outflow towards the sea it causes the formation of drawdown cones and deepening of the water table below the mean sea level this creates high hydraulic gradients within the drawdown cones which attracts seawater into it and hence mixing of groundwater with seawater takes place it has already been reported that seawater intrusion has resulted in a high concentration of various contaminants in the groundwater aquifers near the coastal areas alfarrah and walraevens 2018 gopinath et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 similarly as microplastics are found in abundance in seas and oceans wright and kelly 2017 carbery et al 2018 karthik et al 2018 wang et al 2018 robin et al 2020 ashwini and varghese 2020 their occurrence in groundwater near coastal areas through seawater intrusion mechanism is of high possibility 2 4 microplastics transport through soil soil can get affected by plastics through various means such as plastic mulch films municipal solid waste sewage sludge fertilizers coated with plastics etc mccormick et al 2014 nizzetto et al 2016 b rodriguez seijo and pereira 2018 blasing and amelung 2018 liu et al 2018 hence it acts as one of the important sources of groundwater contamination ruimin et al 2020 discharge of wastewater and municipal sludge onto the soil is also a significant means of contaminating the groundwater li et al 2018 wastewater effluent and sludge are the important sources of primary microplastic contamination which originates from various cosmetic products such as facial scrubs toothpaste other personal care products etc these primary microplastics get escaped from the wastewater treatment plants thus ultimately finding a route to soil freshwater moreover the application of sludge in the agricultural areas is also increasing which can further catalyze the process of groundwater contamination yoshida et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 microplastics present in soil may get transported to groundwater through surface runoff and water infiltration kyrikou and briassoulis 2007 brodhagen et al 2015 steinmetz et al 2016 blasing and amelung 2018 hurley and nizzetto 2018 bioturbation and tillage operation are other mechanisms in the soil through which microplastics find their way up to the groundwater rillig 2012 liu et al 2018 a significant positive correlation has been seen between the rate of sludge applied to the soil and the concentration of microplastic particles in the soil zhang et al 2020 it is speculated that prolonged exposure of soil to the sewage sludge will push the microplastics towards the deeper layers of soil besides enhancing the concentration 2 5 microplastics transport from landfills leachate originating from the waste landfill sites represents one of the important sources of groundwater contamination hopewell et al 2009 duis and coors 2016 rodriguez seijo and pereira 2018 the origin of microplastics in the landfills can be traced through 1 direct dumping and 2 degradation of plastic waste in the landfills the direct dumping of microplastics in landfill takes place through the dumping of microbeads and micro particles in substances like toothpaste personal care products and pharmaceutical products the direct dumping of microplastics in landfills constitutes a small share viz 10 15 parfitt 2002 usepa 2008 al salem et al 2009 a large percentage of microplastics reach the landfill as secondary microplastics which results from the breakdown of single use plastic plastic bags bottles fishing nets etc rain water percolating through the landfill reacts with the chemical and biological components of the wastes resulting in leachate which is heavily loaded with microplastics sundt et al 2014 kilponen 2016 alimi et al 2018 the microplastic concentration of approximately 1 25 particles l has been reported in the landfill leachate he et al 2019 praagh et al also quantified the microplastics in leachate from nordic countries and found it to vary from 0 to 4 51 particles l praagh et al 2018 this leachate slowly seeps into the underground layers of the soil thus resulting in its contamination fresh water upon percolating through such contaminated soil may also become laden with microplastics which ultimately reach up to the underground aquifers further the biological activity is high in landfills and the presence of burrowing animals creates many vertical channels inside the landfill and aquifer bed below it schroder and hulse 1979 smallwood et al 1998 these channels further facilitate the movement of microplastics carried by the leachate down to the groundwater microplastics contamination in groundwater through landfill leachate holds importance as it is prone to carry various additives surfactants and other hazardous chemicals attached onto the surface of microplastics this is so because oils and fats which constitute a significant proportion of leachate contribute significantly to the leaching of additives such as phthalates from the surface of the plastics phthalate laden leachate plume contaminates the groundwater upon mixing several studies have reported the presence of phthalates in groundwater near landfill sites zhang et al 2009 liu et al 2010 sorensen et al 2015 the age of the landfill is another important parameter that influences the abundance size and composition of the microplastics in landfill leachate it has been reported that young and medium aged landfills were having more microplastics as compared to older landfills owing to increased production use and correspondingly more generation of plastic waste in recent decades su et al 2019 variation in the composition of microplastics in landfills of different ages might be attributed to the different lifetimes of the variety of microplastics and also their field of application 3 assessment of microplastics contamination in groundwater assessment of groundwater contamination is critical as it is difficult to monitor the underground processes the situation becomes more crucial when the sources of contamination are varied therefore it is necessary to track the movement of a contaminant in order to assess the degree of pollution the extent of microplastic contamination in groundwater can be estimated through two pronged approach viz 1 the movement of microplastic particles inside the groundwater and 2 the movement of plasticizers and additives which leaches from the surface of microplastics with the groundwater finally the net result of microplastics contamination is obtained by clubbing the movement in both processes 3 1 modelling the movement of microplastic particles in groundwater once microplastic particles get introduced into the subsurface environment their physical state and surface chemistry experience change besseling et al 2017 carr et al 2016 da costa et al 2016 microplastics undergo both aggregation and degradation processes these small plastic particles form aggregates with solid particles kaolin bentonite clay natural minerals and other colloidal particles pelley and tufenkji 2008 yang et al 2011 for example when the positively charged plastic particles come in contact with negatively charged fe2o3 owing to electrostatic interaction these get neutralized and form hetero aggregates thus increasing the diameter of the particles oriekhova and stoll 2018 however when the concentration of fe2o3 increases the aggregates so formed are attacked by the microorganisms and hence the net particle size experiences reduction oriekhova and stoll 2018 the aggregation and breakdown of microplastics result in the change in particle size and density which determines whether these microplastic particles will settle or remain in suspension within the groundwater lagarde et al 2016 the portion of microplastics which is neutral remains freely in suspension and moves in the aquifer along with the groundwater this movement of plastic particles can be described as a two phase solid fluid flow since microplastics are very small in size and hydrophobic these can be treated as lagrangian particles critchell and lambrechts 2016 cable et al 2017 ding et al 2019 jalon rojas et al 2019 by considering the microplastic particles as lagrangian the trajectory of particles can be traced considering both the inter particle collision and the collision between particle and aquifer walls wiberg and smith 1985 tanaka and tsuji 1991 niño et al 1994 mei and hu 1999 lee et al 2006 lin and chang 2016 fede and simonin 2018 the groundwater flow can be described using darcy s law as shown in equation 1 1 q k h x where q is the specific discharge k is the hydraulic conductivity and h x is the change in head per unit length of the soil column the average velocity of water through the soil column v can be computed using equation 2 2 v q n where q is the specific discharge and n is the porosity when the aquifer porous matrix has a large portion of dead end pores the velocity of pore water increases because of the decrease in effective porosity and in such a case effective velocity v e can be represented by equation 3 3 v e q n e where q is the specific discharge and n e is the effective porosity considering the microplastics as lagrangian particles which remain in suspension their position can be predicted using equations 4 and 5 4 d x m d t u m 5 d u m d t 3 ϑ c d r e m 4 d m 2 s v e u m where x m is the position of the microplastic particle u m denotes the velocity of microplastics ϑ is fluid viscosity d m represents the diameter of microplastic particles and s is the ratio of microplastic particle density to fluid density rem is the reynolds number of microplastic particles and cd is the drag coefficient as defined by equations 6 and 7 respectively 6 r e m d m v e u m ϑ 7 c d 24 r e m r e m 1 24 r e m 1 0 15 r e m 0 687 1 r e m 1000 0 44 r e m 1000 solving equations 2 7 using numerical techniques such as method of characteristics konikow 2010 lattice boltzmann method ding et al 2018 2019 and or mccormack equation keshari and koo 2002 keshari and koo 2007a b the position of microplastic particles in the soil matrix or microplastic plume in groundwater can be traced 3 2 modelling the movement of plasticizers and additives associated with microplastics hahladakis et al described various plasticizers chemicals and additives their nature and the process through which these leach out from the plastics or microplastics surfaces hahladakis et al 2018 based on the nature and migration pattern these additives can be divided into three groups as discussed below a the additives such as biocides and organic pigments have lower migration patterns thus their leaching process is relatively slow moreover these additives and pigments readily get adsorbed on the soil surface hadad et al 1996 xue et al 2020 which further hinders their movement since the quantity of leachate having these additives is insignificant these additives can be neglected for modelling however if leaching is significant in any certain environmental condition then modelling can be taken up based on the nature of additives as described in the following sections b chemicals and metals over the surface of microplastics constitute diaminodiphenylmethane mda dichloro methylenedianiline moca hydrazine etc which are hydrophilic and have the potential for dissolution in water the fraction of these additives and plasticizers gets absorbed onto the soil particles moliner and street 1989 yang et al 2019 and only a portion that remains as colloids in water moves through the soil or sediment column the movement of these additives and plasticizers as a colloidal solution through homogeneous aquifer can be described by accounting for advection dispersion and deposition kretzschmar et al 1997 grolimund et al 1998 the one dimensional advection dispersion taking into account the first order deposition in the homogeneous aquifer can be represented by equation 8 8 c t ρ b ε s t d 2 c x 2 v c x 9 ρ b ε s t k c where 10 k 3 1 v 2 d 10 η here c x t is the concentration of particles as a colloidal form in water s x t is the particle retained by the soil particles v is the effective velocity of particles d is the coefficient of hydrodynamic dispersion ρ b is bulk density of soil ε is the porosity of the soil and k is the particle deposition rate d 10 is the diameter of the particles since the aquifer system is never homogeneous the particle deposition rate shows variability because of the colloidal interactions taking place continuously between the contaminant and the soil particles thus the contaminants show a dual deposition rate tufenkji and elimelech 2004 b some particles experience faster deposition whereas others deposit at a slower rate thus the coefficient of deposition can be represented by the linear combination of normal or gaussian distribution of the two deposition rates as shown in equation 11 elimelech and o melia 1990 tufenkji et al 2003 11 p k f s l o w 1 σ s l o w 2 π exp 1 2 k k s l o w σ s l o w 2 f f a s t 1 σ f a s t 2 π exp 1 2 k k f a s t σ f a s t 2 where f s l o w and f f a s t are the fraction of particles associated with slow and fast deposition respectively k s l o w and k f a s t are the mean deposition rates associated with the slow and fast deposition σ s l o w and σ f a s t are the standard deviations thus the concentration of particles in solution c and concentration of particles that are retained s can be modified as shown in equations 12 and 13 12 c x c 0 0 exp k v x p k d k 13 s x t o c o ρ b 0 k e x p k v x p k d k chu et al illustrated that the removal efficiency varies with the ionic strength because of the repulsive electrostatic double layer interactions chu et al 2019 thus the removal efficiency η gets modified and can be represented as shown in equation 14 14 η α η o where α is the attachment efficiency and η is the efficiency of soil adsorption in the absence of double layer interaction η o can be represented by equation 15 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 a 15 η o 2 4 a s 1 3 n r 0 081 n p e 0 715 n v d w 0 052 0 55 a s n r 1 675 n a 0 125 0 22 n r 0 24 n g 1 11 n v d w 0 053 where nr npe na nvdw and ng are aspect ratio peclet number attraction number van der waals number and gravity number respectively the attachment efficiency arising out of colloidal interaction energy can be explained by dlvo theory redman et al 2004 bradford et al 2006 hoek and agarwal 2006 shen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 li et al 2017 the dlvo theory considers that interaction energy u between the contaminants and the soil particles is the sum of van der waals u v d w double layer interactions u d l and born repulsion u b r hogg et al 1966 ruckenstein and prieve 1976 gregory 1981 16 u u v d w u d l u b r 17 u v d w a a p 6 h 1 14 h λ 18 u b r a χ 6 7560 8 a p h 2 a p h 7 6 a p h h 7 19 u d l π ε ε o a p 2 ψ p ψ c 1 e k h 1 e k h ψ p 2 ψ c 2 ln 1 e 2 k h where a is the hamaker constant ap is the radius of microplastics h is the separation distance between microplastics and soil particles λ is the characteristic dielectric wavelength χ is the born collision parameter ε 0 and ε is the permittivity of free space and water ψp is zeta potential for plastics and ψc are the zeta potentials for soil κ is the inverse debye screening length the dlvo interaction energy u depends upon the ionic strength of groundwater thus at a fixed ionic strength and interaction energy the attachment efficiency can be determined using hahn s model hahn and o melia 2004 once the attachment efficiency α is determined the movement of additives in the subsurface environment can be modelled using equations 8 10 c additives like phthalates bisphenol a bpa bis 2 ethylhexyl adipate deha and alkylphenols which are not readily soluble in water but may get introduced in the groundwater in dissolved form with suitable solvents thomsen et al 2001 bi et al 2013 ibrahim et al 2014 these additives in their soluble forms are immiscible fluids since the density of these additives is lower than the water cao 2008 weir et al 2014 their movement can be described as a light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl these additives behave as conservative in water as these do not dissolve in water but these get adsorbed on the soil particles wang et al 2017 a willemsen et al 2019 hunter and uchrin 2000 thus considering these fluids solvent water as incompressible their movement through the porous media can be described by equation 20 20 δ ρ o s o φ δ t ρ o v o j o r o 21 δ ρ w s w φ δ t ρ w v w j w 0 the first term of equations 20 and 21 accounts for the accumulation of solvent and additives o the second term accounts for the movement of mass due to advection and the third term is due to non advective diffusion and dispersion r o represents the removal or addition of additives from soil to the solvent ⱷ represents the effective porosity ρ o s o and ρ w s w are the density and saturation of solvent and water respectively v w and v o denote the velocity of solvent and water respectively within the soil matrix 22 t h e t o t a l s a t u r a t i o n w i l l b e s o s w 1 considering both solvent and water to obey darcy s law the velocity can be expressed as shown in equations 23 and 24 leverett and lewis 1941 childs and collis george 1950 corey et al 1956 watson 1966 vachaud 1967 23 v o k k r o μ o p o ρ o g 24 v w k k r w μ w p w ρ w g where g is acceleration due to gravity μ o and μ w are the viscosity of solvent and water k is the intrinsic permeability k r o and k r w are the relative permeability of oil and water and p o and p w is the pressure of solvent and water in density dependent flows saturation is the function of capillary pressure abriola 1989 the capillary force in the soil or sediment matrix depends upon the pore size interfacial tensions and wettability and therefore it is determined by the distribution of fluid inside the pores since soil and fluid properties remain constant capillary pressure is determined by saturation abriola 1989 guérillot et al 2020 considering the fluids as incompressible the first term of equations 20 and 21 can be expressed in the form of capillary function pc as follows 25 φ ρ o s o t φ ρ o s o p c p c t 26 φ ρ w s w t φ ρ w s w p c p c t the non advective movement comprised of molecular diffusion and hydro dynamic dispersion can be described by fickian form as shown in equations 27 29 27 j o ρ o φ d o s o where do is the function of molecular diffusion and fluid velocity thus 28 j o φ ρ o d o s o p c p c t 29 j w φ ρ w d w s w p c p c t substituting equations 25 26 and 28 29 in equations 20 and 21 respectively it will take the following form 30 ρ o s o p c p c t ρ o v o φ ρ o d o s o p c p c t r o 31 φ ρ w s w p c p c t ρ w v w φ ρ w d w s w p c p c t 0 the resulting equations viz 30 and 31 can be solved by using buckley and leverrette method buckley and leverett 1942 black oil simulators chen 2001 implicit pressure explicit saturation method impesm sheldon and cardwell 1959 stone and garder 1961 etc for simulating the movement of additives inside the soil matrix thus by combining the movement of microplastic particles and their associated additives the extent of the microplastic plume can be determined in the groundwater this plume movement assessment is very important considering the wide scale dependency on the groundwater resources for drinking as well as irrigation consumption and or use of groundwater contaminated with microplastics poses adverse impacts not only on human health but also have ecological implications and thus it becomes necessary to trace their movements 4 implications of microplastics occurrence in groundwater groundwater is one of the important resources for drinking as well as irrigation microplastics laden ground water directly affects human health upon consumption and indirectly affects the soil and crops when used for irrigation toxicity also increases manifold due to the adhesive properties of microplastics which allows the adsorption of various chemicals additives heavy metals microorganisms etc the implications associated with groundwater microplastics can be categorized in the following sections 4 1 health hazards due to the consumption of groundwater laden with microplastics microplastics suspended in groundwater have easy access to the human body recent findings suggest that humans ingest approximately 5 g of microplastics in a week through various pathways which include groundwater as well senathirajah and palanisami 2019 mohajerani and karabatak 2020 these particles have bio accumulative potential in secondary organs after they get translocated from the gut smith et al 2018 moreover not only the microplastic particles rather various other chemicals in the form of plasticizers and additives added adsorbed in on to them further affect the human health adversely for example styrene which is used in styrofoam packaging is a known endocrine disrupting chemical rist et al 2018 similarly various organochlorine pesticides and persistent organic pollutants such as ddt are known to be adsorbed onto the microplastics ogata et al 2009 adjei et al 2014 thus not only the direct impacts but indirect impacts of microplastics are also of serious concern studies have reported the presence of phthalates and bisphenol a bpa which are the basic constituents of microplastics in the human body thompson et al 2009 the research in the area of impacts of microplastics ingestion in the human body is in a very nascent stage preliminary studies have shown that microplastics may result in genotoxicity carcinogenesis fibrosis exaggerated inflammatory response oxidative stress etc schirinzi et al 2017 deng et al 2017 fig 2 table 4 another serious impact may be due to the harmful microbes which might reach the human body through attached biofilm over the microplastics kirstein et al 2016 these may result in disturbances within the gut microflora infections and other serious disorders table 4 according to recent studies microplastics have the potential to cross the placental barrier ragusa et al 2021 which might result in various reproductive and teratogenic abnormalities swan et al 2005 swan 2008 lang et al 2008 nevertheless microplastics have been found in human saliva blood colon and stool as well confirming their ingestion through water and other sources schwabl et al 2019 ibrahim et al 2020 abbasi and turner 2021 leslie et al 2022 a summary of human health impacts associated with groundwater contaminated with microplastics is shown in table 4 4 2 microplastics as vectors of metals metalloids microplastics are known to adsorb various metals metalloids such as cadmium manganese lead arsenic copper zinc chromium etc on their surfaces brennecke et al 2016 gao et al 2019 selvam et al 2021 moreover metals are also added during the manufacturing process of plastics for various purposes such as pigmentation uv stabilization flame retardants etc campanale et al 2020 polyethylene terephthalate particles have been reported to accumulate lead cadmium and zinc abbasi et al 2020 likewise arsenic cadmium chromium and lead were found to be associated with high density polyethylene holmes et al 2012 jinhui et al 2019 mohsen et al 2019 the copper concentration of up to 80 9 500 ng g of polyethylene and polypropylene has been reported wang et al 2017 b since microplastics are organic polymers their affinity for metals is evident ashton et al 2010 usually it is the charged sites or the neutral regions on the microplastics surfaces that act as the hotspots for metals sorption ashton et al 2010 physico chemical properties of microplastics play an important role in the metal adsorption processes for example high surface area and high polarity promote sorption holmes et al 2014 also aged microplastics are more prone to adsorb metals compared to virgin microplastics brennecke et al 2016 as groundwater is often exposed to metals metalloids either of the geogenic origin or anthropogenic origin momot and synzynys 2005 vetrimurugan et al 2017 jain et al 2018 their interaction with microplastics is inevitable thus not only microplastics per se rather metals and metalloids adsorbed onto them also find their way to the human animal consumption route deleterious health impacts associated with metals are widely recognized khan et al 2008 rehman et al 2017 tepanosyan et al 2018 jain et al 2019 table 4 altered endocrine systems and abrupt hormonal responses have been reported in organisms due to the effects of microplastics laden with such pollutants rochman et al 2014 similar may be the effects on humans as well moreover metals adsorbed to the microplastic particles have also been shown to produce adverse effects on aquatic organisms and plant growth jinhui et al 2019 abbasi et al 2020 metals laden polyethylene terephthalate particles have been reported to remain associated with soil rhizosphere systems for a long time abbasi et al 2020 which might affect crop growth fig 2 4 3 microbial contamination through microplastics as microplastic particles reach up to the hyporheic zone of an aquifer through various interaction mechanisms between surface and groundwater these particles come in contact with several other constitutents hyporheic zone is a biogeochemically active zone enabling the nutrients exchange and stimulating activities of microbes lawrence et al 2013 therefore considerable interactions among the microplastic particles microbes and other inorganic constitutents are promoted in this zone fig 3 as a result microplastics get colonized by microorganisms present in this environment in a short span of time harrison et al 2014 a number of environmental factors influence this biofilm formation such as temperature presence of light and oxygen and presence of other chemical moieties in the vicinity hullar et al 2006 oberbeckmann et al 2016 moreover microplastics may alter the structure of the microbial biofilm and also act as source of carbon which further promote the microbial growth guasch et al 2022 fig 3 similar to the hyporheic zone microbial growth over microplastics is also possible in the wastewater treatment plants landfill sites and other non point sources of pollution as these sites are the sources of various microorganisms owing to being rich in organic moieties microplastics laden with microbes from these sites further contribute to the groundwater microplastics through seepage or direct discharge researchers have reported that diversity in microbial film formation varies with the variety of substrates as taxonomically different genera were observed in the microbial films developed over plastics glass organic materials etc hoellein et al 2014 mccormick et al 2014 oberbeckmann et al 2016 the most common families grown over microplastics were found to be pseudomonadaceae proteobacteria and campylobacteraceae genera belonging to these families include pseudomonas arcobacter aeromonas and aquabacterium mccormick et al 2014 these microbial communities have been detected to be colonizing over the microplastics occurring in wastewater treatment plants and hence these do have the potential to be mixed with the groundwater as well arcobacter spp is also a common member of the microbial community of landfill leachate and sewage merga et al 2014 stamps et al 2016 many of these species have the potential of pathogenesis and hence their occurrence in groundwater is of serious concern table 4 gene sequencing analyses have also confirmed that microplastics do function as carriers of various pathogens such as vibrio and arcobacter spp woo et al 2008 zettler et al 2013 harrison et al 2014 mccormick et al 2014 amaral zettler et al 2015 4 4 effects on soil and crop health due to the use of microplastics laden groundwater the impact on soil ecosystems due to the presence of microplastics has been explored the use of groundwater contaminated with microplastics for irrigation purposes can significantly affect the soil ecosystem and microbial activities therein huang et al 2019 the groundwater used in irrigation reaches up to the plants roots and hence the rhizosphere region being small in size the microplastics carried along with the groundwater often get accumulated in the rhizosphere region and affects various chemical and microbiological parameters in the vicinity fig 2 it has been shown that polyethylene microplastics have altered the enzymatic activities within the soil which resulted in a change in the soil microbial composition huang et al 2019 the presence of microplastics in soil for long duration after irrigation might also result in decreased soil bulk density machado et al 2018 it may result in more porosity in the soil structure resulting in increased soil water evaporation and ultimately soil drying wan et al 2019 alteration in the soil structure owing to drying will certainly affect soil aggregation which might pose serious consequences on soil aeration and root growth rillig et al 2019 plastics being rich in carbon content might also result in alteration in c n ratio of the soil which causes microbial immobilization effects on the microbial community and or on the rhizospheric symbionts could result in adverse impacts on the plant community as well there is also the possibility that hydrophobic contaminants present in soil layers might get attracted to the microplastic particles thus making themselves available for a longer period of time rummel et al 2017 miao et al 2019 rillig et al 2019 as crop growth is highly dependent upon the presence of diverse soil microbiota e g nitrogen fixing bacteria mycorrhiza etc heijden et al 2016 powell and rillig 2018 effects on these due to the microplastics and associated contaminants might result in reduced crop growth lowery and ursell 2019 upon further breakdown microplastics might get converted to nano plastics which could be able to make entry inside the roots thus creating alterations at the level of cells and molecules and might also result in oxidative stress navarro et al 2008 4 5 effects on subsurface ecology due to the presence of microplastics in groundwater subsurface ecology represents a diverse range of organisms often known as stygobites which are strict subterranean aquatic animals these species have a potential impact on the groundwater ecosystem services in terms of water purification bioremediation biogeochemical cycles and water filtration owing to their feeding patterns movement and excretion boulton et al 2008 moreover these underground organisms are one of the unique components of global biodiversity being endemic and having uncommon adaptations to their subterranean environment these organisms are important for understanding the evolutionary processes ecology and biodiversity danielopol et al 2000 danielopol and griebler 2008 ingestion of groundwater microplastics by these organisms might hamper their physiological processes growth life cycle patterns and subsequently the ecosystem services iannilli et al 2019 lorenzo et al 2019 another probable aspect is the transport of ingested microplastics by the stygobite community the ingested particles may be uptaken by their predators which may produce consequences for the entire food web iannilli et al 2019 though there are no such studies as of now but it may be a possibility considering the same in terrestrial ecosystems barboza et al 2018 horton and dixon 2018 5 possible ways to minimize microplastics contamination in groundwater the minimization of microplastics in groundwater needs a holistic approach both primary and secondary microplastics are needed to be targeted for the effective management of microplastic pollution singh et al 2021b reducing the production and use of primary microplastics is one step whereas safe disposal of used plastics and proper waste management is necessary for minimizing the secondary microplastics as indiscriminate and unscientific disposal is one of the major sources of plastic waste pollution singh et al 2022 sometimes bioplastics are referred to as an option for conventional plastics considering their biodegradable properties hoffman et al 2019 however there is enough evidence to support that bioplastics do instigate a variety of risks for human as well as other biotic species shruti and muniasamy 2019 nonetheless these also act as vectors of chemical contaminants just as conventional plastics do according to a study the sorption of phenanthrene an organic pollutant on the biodegradable plastic film polybutylene adipate co terephthalate pbat was much stronger than its sorption on the conventional plastics polyethylene and polystyrene zuo et al 2019 disposal of these bioplastics in unregulated manner results in microplastics in the similar manner and ultimately contaminates the groundwater therefore despite focusing on the alternatives it is important to develop strategies for minimizing the interaction of microplastic contaminated zones with surface groundwater resources a critical step in this direction is the identification of microplastic dominated zones that are at high risk of pollution as per the current knowledge most of the microplastic pollution is concentrated in oceans and seas barboza and gimenez 2015 galloway and lewis 2016 wright and kelly 2017 wang et al 2018 therefore groundwater resources in the nearby areas need to be identified as under high risk and suitable action needs to be undertaken in such areas excessive utilization of groundwater resources through pumping should be minimized as it accelerates the sea water intrusion deep groundwater wells need to be avoided and well location should also be significantly far from the coast consideration of geology is also an important concern as fractured bedrocks facilitate seawater intrusion park et al 2012 sebben et al 2015 hussain et al 2019 various physical surface sub surface and hydraulic barriers such as abstraction or artificial recharge may further help to minimize the sea water intrusion and hence microplastic contamination hussain et al 2019 the end use treatment options such as efficient filtration processes also need to be developed which can make the removal of microplastics easy it has been shown that biochar filters can efficiently remove the microplastic spheres of up to 10 μm in diameter with a removal efficiency as high as 95 wang et al 2020 b granular activated carbon gac filters have also been proved to be efficient in decreasing the concentration of microplastics in water up to 61 wang et al 2020c moreover gac filters were found to be more selective for small sized microplastics which is an added advantage such options can be employed for the removal of microplastics at the point of use curtailing the routine practices such as the application of wastewater sludge onto the soil might also help to prevent groundwater contamination application of sludge enhances the concentration of microplastics in soil which might further accelerate the movement of the same downwards nizzetto et al 2016 c ziajahromi et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 studies have shown that wastewater sludge can be effectively used for the formation of bricks which is an environmentally friendly process as well ukwatta et al 2016 mohajerani et al 2019 mohajerani and karabatak 2020 to minimize microplastic pollution through landfills proper lining of the landfills is crucial periodic monitoring is essential to track groundwater quality it is also important to place the drinking water wells far from the landfills to avoid mixing the contaminated plume with the underground water 6 conclusion and way forward protection of our natural resources is the key to a sustainable world in order to maintain the well being of human as well as the surrounding environment it is necessary to keep our natural resources safe and uncontaminated groundwater is one such natural resource that is considered safe and often consumed without any specific treatment however the presence of microscopic impurities such as microplastics renders its consumption quite dubious considering the deleterious impacts of microplastics onto human health and environment this review has summarized the various pathways and mechanisms through which groundwater gets contaminated with microplastics moreover the possible impacts posed by such contaminated groundwater are also discussed in detail realizing the fact that groundwater serves a quarter of the global drinking water supply apart from its use in irrigation its purity is of paramount importance moreover in developing countries where paucity of resources and lack of awareness makes it difficult to treat all the water before use the situation becomes more critical therefore the prime objective should be to minimize the causes which can lead to groundwater contamination based on this study it is evident that microplastics are ubiquitous entities and hence their entry into the various components of the ecosystem and thereby into the groundwater is certain therefore primary focus should be on defining the criteria for the suitable location and depth of the groundwater wells esp in high risk zones such as near oceans wastewater treatment plants and landfills further as underground processes cannot be monitored modelling approaches are the viable option in order to accurately estimate the contamination in this context it is important to further explore the various pathways and model the flow of microplastics in the groundwater the occurrence and concentration of microplastics at different water levels also need to be investigated the effect of geological and hydrological characteristics on the spread and impact of microplastics should also be ascertained nevertheless a holistic approach integrating plastic waste

11744,the presence of microplastics in various abiotic and biotic matrices has sought the attention of researchers across the globe despite being subsurface groundwater is also reported to be contaminated with microplastics however there is paucity of information regarding the major pathways responsible for microplastic contamination in groundwater further information is altogether lacking about the assessment methodologies for microplastics contamination in the subsurface zone therefore in this review paper we aim to provide insights into various interaction pathways among the surface and subsurface sources through which groundwater gets contaminated the novel feature of the review is that it also attempts to establish a conceptual framework for modelling the microplastic contamination in groundwater where the extent of contamination was ascertained by combining the movement of microplastic particles and the movement of associated additives plasticizers as groundwater is one of the important sources for drinking as well as irrigation potential impacts of microplastics contamination onto the human health and soil ecology is also discussed possible management strategies have also been summarized thus this review will provide a complete depiction and consequences of the microplastics contamination in groundwater and therefore serve as a starting point for future researchers in the area of groundwater microplastics graphical abstract image 1 keywords dlvo theory groundwater contamination health impacts lagrangian particles microplastic s modelling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater or subsurface water is one of the most important global natural resources of the total water available on the earth groundwater amounts to 1 69 of which only 0 76 water is fresh and hence utilizable shiklomanov 1993 despite being present in low quantity groundwater shares a significant amount of the daily water requirements in many countries for example india being the largest user of groundwater in the world is dependent on this resource for its 85 drinking needs and 60 of its irrigation requirements world bank report 2012 jain et al 2018 2021 malik and bhagwat 2021 considering the potential of groundwater it is of utmost importance to keep this resource safe and uncontaminated however in the present scenario various geogenic and anthropogenic contaminants are continuously mixing with the groundwater deteriorating its quality khatri and tyagi 2014 jain et al 2018 2021 singh et al 2021a the changing living standards and consumption patterns have introduced new contaminants also known as emerging contaminants for which origin pathways and health impacts remain unknown microplastics are one such emerging contaminants that have been reported in the groundwater panno et al 2019 re 2019 kim and lee 2020 considering their toxic potential microplastics are of immediate concern to human health and the environment ensign et al 2012 chua et al 2014 silva et al 2018 smith et al 2018 prata et al 2020 the term microplastic was first introduced in 2004 and later defined as the plastic particles of size in the range of 1 μm 5 mm thompson et al 2009 frias and nash 2019 these microplastic particles may be of primary and or secondary origin primary microplastics are purposefully manufactured in small sizes for various applications in the pharmaceuticals and cosmetic industries singh et al 2022 on the other hand secondary microplastics are the result of breakdown of large size plastics due to various abiotic and biotic means such as solar irradiation mechanical abrasion microbial action etc wagner and lambert 2018 even the bioplastics result in smaller particles upon degradation when disposed of in an unregulated manner and thus further add on to the pool of microplastics shruti and muniasamy 2019 these small size plastics may be in the form of fragments pellets beads fibres etc as the global use of plastics bioplastics is increasing plastic europe 2019 garside 2019 the increase in the number of secondary microplastics is evident nevertheless a significant amount of plastic waste is dumped in rivers and other surface water bodies geyer et al 2017 plastic europe 2019 the ocean lebreton et al 2017 horton et al 2017 and landfills which breakdown into smaller pieces by the action of biotic and abiotic factors and thereafter finds its way into the groundwater knowledge about the occurrence of microplastics in the subsurface environment groundwater is limited table 1 and hence research in this direction needs to be catalyzed consideration of microplastics contamination and its spatial extent in the groundwater is crucial since groundwater accounts for 25 of the global drinking water supply panno et al 2019 these small size plastic beads and fibres are reported to have deleterious health impacts ensign et al 2012 schirinzi et al 2017 deng et al 2017 smith et al 2018 prata et al 2020 there are three methods through which microplastics may pose health hazards viz 1 hazards caused by microplastic particles themselves upon ingestion 2 hazards due to various chemicals colours plasticizers and additives present in the microplastics and 3 hazards due to biofilm formation by microorganisms over microplastic particles who 2019 moreover once introduced into the aquifer system microplastic pollution also poses serious threat to groundwater ecology and soil environment thus placing it in the list of top ten environmental problems unep 2014 therefore to take appropriate action for minimizing this problem it is essential to understand the various processes and components which make up the microplastics pollution in recent years several studies have monitored the presence of microplastics in groundwater bouwman et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 ganesan et al 2019 selvam et al 2021 however these literatures are limited in explaining the source origin and the pathways through which the groundwater gets exposed to microplastics moreover the existing knowledge also fails to explain the fate transport and impacts of microplastics once they are introduced into the subsurface environment considering the above knowledge gaps and the diversity of scientific disciplines involved in understanding the fate transport and consequences of microplastic pollution it becomes imperative to review synthesize and correlate the existing knowledge hence in this study we have reviewed more than 500 research papers belonging to different disciplines by searching through google scholar pubmed researchgate and web of science with the following objectives a to understand various aspects of groundwater contamination due to microplastics and the sources responsible b to conceptualize the microplastic transport with analytical or numerical modelling through two pronged approach viz 1 modelling the physical movement of microplastics in groundwater and 2 modelling the movement of plasticizers and additives present on the surface of microplastics which leach out when these particles fibres come in contact with chemicals solvents groundwater c to understand the impacts of microplastic contaminated groundwater on the human health and the environment and d to discuss the preventive measures and upcoming technological interventions which hold the possibility of minimizing the microplastics pollution in groundwater thus the review attempts to illustrate in detail the sources of microplastic pollution in groundwater fate and transport of microplastics and associated additives in soil water matrix the direct and indirect impacts caused by microplastic exposure and the ways to minimize microplastics in groundwater the study will certainly be helpful in understanding one of the emerging contaminants viz microplastics and set a base for development of models for assessing groundwater risk and vulnerability due to microplastics 2 sources of microplastics contamination and transport pathways into the groundwater the presence of microplastics in surface water sources such as seas oceans rivers lakes is undoubtedly proved wright and kelly 2017 carbery et al 2018 karthik et al 2018 rezania et al 2018 wang et al 2018 robin et al 2020 ashwini and varghese 2020 since groundwater also forms a significant part of the hydrological cycle it is obvious to expect an interaction among the different hydrological systems resulting in declining groundwater quality due to the contamination in surface water sources thus geological processes such as sea water intrusion alfarrah and walraevens 2018 gopinath et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 and groundwater river lake interaction anderson and munter 1981 nizzetto et al 2016 a kooi et al 2018 liedermann et al 2018 can be considered as some of the possible sources of microplastics contamination in the groundwater in addition to this microplastics find their way into the soil through a variety of sources such as discharge from wastewater treatment plants outflows of septic tanks leachate from landfill sites and direct injection of contaminated water into the soil etc usepa 2008 re 2019 moreover the use of plastic mulching in agriculture results in microplastics through the weathering and breakdown of the plastic sheet under uv light exposure rillig 2012 liu et al 2018 the microplastic laden sludge obtained from the wastewater treatment plants which is invariably applied onto the soil li et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 also contaminates the top layers of the soil profile when the infiltrating water percolates through the cracks and voids of such contaminated soil it gets exposed to the microplastics and associated chemical moieties thus pushing the contaminants much deeper into the soil layers ultimately mixing it with groundwater municipal landfills are also one of the important sources of microplastic pollution as according to a study landfills have accumulated approximately 79 of the total virgin plastic produced till date globally geyer et al 2017 based on the age of landfills when the acidic or alkaline leachate remains in contact with the discarded plastic waste for a long period it results in the breakdown of these plastics into smaller particles along with the leaching of plasticizers and additives from the plastics surface when the microplastic laden leachate moves through the underlying soil and reaches the groundwater system it becomes the point source for microplastic pollution to understand various hydrological interactions and pathways which might be responsible for microplastics contamination in groundwater composition of microplastics in different sources table 2 is compared with the composition of microplastics found in the groundwater table 1 upon comparison polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyester pes polyamide pa and polyvinylchloride pvc were found to be the major types of microplastics present in the groundwater table 1 these also dominate the composition of microplastics occurring in surface water sources wastewater effluents and leachate emanating from the landfills table 2 a similar pattern can be observed when we look at the types of plasticizers and various additives found in the groundwater and surface water bodies that are directly affected by microplastic pollution table 3 a number of chemical moieties such as bisphenol a bpa benzotriazoles tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep benzophenones etc have been reported in the groundwater across the globe loos et al 2010 regnery et al 2011 stuart et al 2011 these moieties are of wide application in the manufacturing of plastics for various applications concurrent occurrence of these moieties in the surface water bodies basheer et al 2004 loos et al 2007 regnery and puttmann 2010 soils breedveld et al 2002 sanchez brunete et al 2011 and sediments zhang et al 2011 kameda et al 2011 cao et al 2012 depict their interaction with the groundwater table 3 thus various exchanges and theoretical pathways responsible for microplastics movement based on these interactions are explored in this section 2 1 microplastics transport through groundwater river interaction the groundwater and river interactions are being extensively studied through various methods such as modelling isotopic figure printing field experiments and temperature profiling hoeg et al 2000 krause et al 2012 rosenberry et al 2013 karan et al 2016 vrzel et al 2019 these studies illustrate that both the quantity and quality of surface water have an impact on groundwater quality and quantity chaubey and arora 2017 lewandowski et al 2020 rivers act as a transport medium for microplastics from the point of contamination sources nizzetto et al 2016 a kooi et al 2018 liedermann et al 2018 as river velocity varies continuously it has a direct influence on the river carrying capacity chien and wan 1999 yang et al 2007 ni et al 2014 in the locations where the river water becomes sluggish the contaminant load starts to deposit in the hyporheic zones toffaleti 1968 ackers and white 1973 this process of contaminant deposition in the hyporheic zone holds true for accumulation of microplastics at the river bed as well frei et al 2019 the hyporheic zone can be considered as a hot spot for surface and groundwater interactions interaction is multi directional in this zone and may occur at varied spatio temporal scales boano et al 2014 cardenas 2015 the direction of flow through the hyporheic zone depends upon the relative positions of the groundwater table and water level in the river since microplastics are the outcome of anthropogenic activities the uncontaminated groundwater can be considered free from microplastic and hence it is mostly the seepage of contaminated surface water which contributes to the plastic pollution in the subsurface water fig 1 illustrates the groundwater contamination from surface water sources as the groundwater level goes below the water level of the river the resulting hydraulic gradient directs the water to flow from river towards the groundwater the movement of water through the soil pores increases the velocity of seeping water thus pushing the microplastics inside the pores of the aquifer system which finally gets transported to the subsurface environment drummond et al 2020 though the physical movement of microplastics through the soil layer is very slow and may take years to reach groundwater the presence of various potentially toxic substances potss such as chemicals plasticizers antioxidants stabilizers slip additives monomers and oligomers facilitate the migration of the contaminants into the groundwater hahladakis et al 2018 owing to longer contact duration with pore water and large surface area of contact 2 2 microplastics transport through groundwater lake interaction lakes are considered as one of the important sources of freshwater however in comparison to rivers lakes are calmer and have longer residence time thus the contaminants entering the lake water get greater time to settle and accumulate onto the bed of the lakes thereby becoming part of the sediments microplastics have been reported in the sediments of lakes su et al 2016 yin et al 2019 liu et al 2019 these microplastics were found in the range of 11 to 3153 items kg dry wet in the sediment samples eriksen et al 2013 castañeda et al 2014 yonkos et al 2014 su et al 2016 microplastics having a size range 1 mm were found to be the most abundant fraction in sediments reaching over 50 su et al 2016 willis et al 2017 yin et al 2019 microscopic observations revealed four forms of microplastics in the lakes sediments viz foams fragments films and fibres among which the most common was the fragments the interactions between the lake and groundwater are bidirectional and it depends upon the season and relative water levels anderson and munter 1981 the reversal in the interactions between the lake and groundwater has an effect on the chemical characteristics of both the water bodies javadzadeh et al 2020 as the water seeps from the lake microplastics along with the contaminants move into the groundwater initially some of the microplastics get accumulated in the pores of aquifer material which later get transported to the groundwater with continuous movement of seeping water as the microplastics are chemically inert and take years to degrade it hinders the flow path and decreases the water exchange between lakes and groundwater the decreased inflow between the two water bodies decreases the dilution of other geogenic contaminants and hence the ionic balance of the lake and nearby groundwater gets changed once the microplastics occupy the pore spaces between the aquifer materials the additives and the plasticizers materials present in the microplastics get more time to react with the seeping water thus the seeping water mixed with additives and plasticizers upon reaching the groundwater contaminates the entire aquifer 2 3 microplastics transport through sea water groundwater interaction microplastics are ubiquitous in the marine environment their presence is recorded in the water column at the seabed and in the sediments of sea beaches barnes et al 2009 law et al 2010 browne et al 2011 rochman et al 2013 based on the density difference between seawater and plastic these microplastic particles undergo vertical redistribution courtene jones et al 2017 the presence of microplastics has also been reported in the salt prepared from the seawater karami et al 2017 peixoto et al 2019 selvam et al 2020 since microplastics are reported in all sizes and forms from seawater and sea salt it can be considered one of the important routes of microplastic pollution in groundwater the phenomenon of mixing seawater with the subsurface ground water sources is termed as seawater intrusion sea water intrusion is the natural process of mixing seawater with the groundwater resources but most often it is triggered by anthropogenic causes this phenomenon has been extensively reported in coastal aquifers alfarrah and walraevens 2018 gopinath et al 2019 chen et al 2019 wang et al 2020 a the fundamental cause of seawater intrusion is the intensive extraction of groundwater which results in decreased freshwater outflow towards the sea it causes the formation of drawdown cones and deepening of the water table below the mean sea level this creates high hydraulic gradients within the drawdown cones which attracts seawater into it and hence mixing of groundwater with seawater takes place it has already been reported that seawater intrusion has resulted in a high concentration of various contaminants in the groundwater aquifers near the coastal areas alfarrah and walraevens 2018 gopinath et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 similarly as microplastics are found in abundance in seas and oceans wright and kelly 2017 carbery et al 2018 karthik et al 2018 wang et al 2018 robin et al 2020 ashwini and varghese 2020 their occurrence in groundwater near coastal areas through seawater intrusion mechanism is of high possibility 2 4 microplastics transport through soil soil can get affected by plastics through various means such as plastic mulch films municipal solid waste sewage sludge fertilizers coated with plastics etc mccormick et al 2014 nizzetto et al 2016 b rodriguez seijo and pereira 2018 blasing and amelung 2018 liu et al 2018 hence it acts as one of the important sources of groundwater contamination ruimin et al 2020 discharge of wastewater and municipal sludge onto the soil is also a significant means of contaminating the groundwater li et al 2018 wastewater effluent and sludge are the important sources of primary microplastic contamination which originates from various cosmetic products such as facial scrubs toothpaste other personal care products etc these primary microplastics get escaped from the wastewater treatment plants thus ultimately finding a route to soil freshwater moreover the application of sludge in the agricultural areas is also increasing which can further catalyze the process of groundwater contamination yoshida et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 microplastics present in soil may get transported to groundwater through surface runoff and water infiltration kyrikou and briassoulis 2007 brodhagen et al 2015 steinmetz et al 2016 blasing and amelung 2018 hurley and nizzetto 2018 bioturbation and tillage operation are other mechanisms in the soil through which microplastics find their way up to the groundwater rillig 2012 liu et al 2018 a significant positive correlation has been seen between the rate of sludge applied to the soil and the concentration of microplastic particles in the soil zhang et al 2020 it is speculated that prolonged exposure of soil to the sewage sludge will push the microplastics towards the deeper layers of soil besides enhancing the concentration 2 5 microplastics transport from landfills leachate originating from the waste landfill sites represents one of the important sources of groundwater contamination hopewell et al 2009 duis and coors 2016 rodriguez seijo and pereira 2018 the origin of microplastics in the landfills can be traced through 1 direct dumping and 2 degradation of plastic waste in the landfills the direct dumping of microplastics in landfill takes place through the dumping of microbeads and micro particles in substances like toothpaste personal care products and pharmaceutical products the direct dumping of microplastics in landfills constitutes a small share viz 10 15 parfitt 2002 usepa 2008 al salem et al 2009 a large percentage of microplastics reach the landfill as secondary microplastics which results from the breakdown of single use plastic plastic bags bottles fishing nets etc rain water percolating through the landfill reacts with the chemical and biological components of the wastes resulting in leachate which is heavily loaded with microplastics sundt et al 2014 kilponen 2016 alimi et al 2018 the microplastic concentration of approximately 1 25 particles l has been reported in the landfill leachate he et al 2019 praagh et al also quantified the microplastics in leachate from nordic countries and found it to vary from 0 to 4 51 particles l praagh et al 2018 this leachate slowly seeps into the underground layers of the soil thus resulting in its contamination fresh water upon percolating through such contaminated soil may also become laden with microplastics which ultimately reach up to the underground aquifers further the biological activity is high in landfills and the presence of burrowing animals creates many vertical channels inside the landfill and aquifer bed below it schroder and hulse 1979 smallwood et al 1998 these channels further facilitate the movement of microplastics carried by the leachate down to the groundwater microplastics contamination in groundwater through landfill leachate holds importance as it is prone to carry various additives surfactants and other hazardous chemicals attached onto the surface of microplastics this is so because oils and fats which constitute a significant proportion of leachate contribute significantly to the leaching of additives such as phthalates from the surface of the plastics phthalate laden leachate plume contaminates the groundwater upon mixing several studies have reported the presence of phthalates in groundwater near landfill sites zhang et al 2009 liu et al 2010 sorensen et al 2015 the age of the landfill is another important parameter that influences the abundance size and composition of the microplastics in landfill leachate it has been reported that young and medium aged landfills were having more microplastics as compared to older landfills owing to increased production use and correspondingly more generation of plastic waste in recent decades su et al 2019 variation in the composition of microplastics in landfills of different ages might be attributed to the different lifetimes of the variety of microplastics and also their field of application 3 assessment of microplastics contamination in groundwater assessment of groundwater contamination is critical as it is difficult to monitor the underground processes the situation becomes more crucial when the sources of contamination are varied therefore it is necessary to track the movement of a contaminant in order to assess the degree of pollution the extent of microplastic contamination in groundwater can be estimated through two pronged approach viz 1 the movement of microplastic particles inside the groundwater and 2 the movement of plasticizers and additives which leaches from the surface of microplastics with the groundwater finally the net result of microplastics contamination is obtained by clubbing the movement in both processes 3 1 modelling the movement of microplastic particles in groundwater once microplastic particles get introduced into the subsurface environment their physical state and surface chemistry experience change besseling et al 2017 carr et al 2016 da costa et al 2016 microplastics undergo both aggregation and degradation processes these small plastic particles form aggregates with solid particles kaolin bentonite clay natural minerals and other colloidal particles pelley and tufenkji 2008 yang et al 2011 for example when the positively charged plastic particles come in contact with negatively charged fe2o3 owing to electrostatic interaction these get neutralized and form hetero aggregates thus increasing the diameter of the particles oriekhova and stoll 2018 however when the concentration of fe2o3 increases the aggregates so formed are attacked by the microorganisms and hence the net particle size experiences reduction oriekhova and stoll 2018 the aggregation and breakdown of microplastics result in the change in particle size and density which determines whether these microplastic particles will settle or remain in suspension within the groundwater lagarde et al 2016 the portion of microplastics which is neutral remains freely in suspension and moves in the aquifer along with the groundwater this movement of plastic particles can be described as a two phase solid fluid flow since microplastics are very small in size and hydrophobic these can be treated as lagrangian particles critchell and lambrechts 2016 cable et al 2017 ding et al 2019 jalon rojas et al 2019 by considering the microplastic particles as lagrangian the trajectory of particles can be traced considering both the inter particle collision and the collision between particle and aquifer walls wiberg and smith 1985 tanaka and tsuji 1991 niño et al 1994 mei and hu 1999 lee et al 2006 lin and chang 2016 fede and simonin 2018 the groundwater flow can be described using darcy s law as shown in equation 1 1 q k h x where q is the specific discharge k is the hydraulic conductivity and h x is the change in head per unit length of the soil column the average velocity of water through the soil column v can be computed using equation 2 2 v q n where q is the specific discharge and n is the porosity when the aquifer porous matrix has a large portion of dead end pores the velocity of pore water increases because of the decrease in effective porosity and in such a case effective velocity v e can be represented by equation 3 3 v e q n e where q is the specific discharge and n e is the effective porosity considering the microplastics as lagrangian particles which remain in suspension their position can be predicted using equations 4 and 5 4 d x m d t u m 5 d u m d t 3 ϑ c d r e m 4 d m 2 s v e u m where x m is the position of the microplastic particle u m denotes the velocity of microplastics ϑ is fluid viscosity d m represents the diameter of microplastic particles and s is the ratio of microplastic particle density to fluid density rem is the reynolds number of microplastic particles and cd is the drag coefficient as defined by equations 6 and 7 respectively 6 r e m d m v e u m ϑ 7 c d 24 r e m r e m 1 24 r e m 1 0 15 r e m 0 687 1 r e m 1000 0 44 r e m 1000 solving equations 2 7 using numerical techniques such as method of characteristics konikow 2010 lattice boltzmann method ding et al 2018 2019 and or mccormack equation keshari and koo 2002 keshari and koo 2007a b the position of microplastic particles in the soil matrix or microplastic plume in groundwater can be traced 3 2 modelling the movement of plasticizers and additives associated with microplastics hahladakis et al described various plasticizers chemicals and additives their nature and the process through which these leach out from the plastics or microplastics surfaces hahladakis et al 2018 based on the nature and migration pattern these additives can be divided into three groups as discussed below a the additives such as biocides and organic pigments have lower migration patterns thus their leaching process is relatively slow moreover these additives and pigments readily get adsorbed on the soil surface hadad et al 1996 xue et al 2020 which further hinders their movement since the quantity of leachate having these additives is insignificant these additives can be neglected for modelling however if leaching is significant in any certain environmental condition then modelling can be taken up based on the nature of additives as described in the following sections b chemicals and metals over the surface of microplastics constitute diaminodiphenylmethane mda dichloro methylenedianiline moca hydrazine etc which are hydrophilic and have the potential for dissolution in water the fraction of these additives and plasticizers gets absorbed onto the soil particles moliner and street 1989 yang et al 2019 and only a portion that remains as colloids in water moves through the soil or sediment column the movement of these additives and plasticizers as a colloidal solution through homogeneous aquifer can be described by accounting for advection dispersion and deposition kretzschmar et al 1997 grolimund et al 1998 the one dimensional advection dispersion taking into account the first order deposition in the homogeneous aquifer can be represented by equation 8 8 c t ρ b ε s t d 2 c x 2 v c x 9 ρ b ε s t k c where 10 k 3 1 v 2 d 10 η here c x t is the concentration of particles as a colloidal form in water s x t is the particle retained by the soil particles v is the effective velocity of particles d is the coefficient of hydrodynamic dispersion ρ b is bulk density of soil ε is the porosity of the soil and k is the particle deposition rate d 10 is the diameter of the particles since the aquifer system is never homogeneous the particle deposition rate shows variability because of the colloidal interactions taking place continuously between the contaminant and the soil particles thus the contaminants show a dual deposition rate tufenkji and elimelech 2004 b some particles experience faster deposition whereas others deposit at a slower rate thus the coefficient of deposition can be represented by the linear combination of normal or gaussian distribution of the two deposition rates as shown in equation 11 elimelech and o melia 1990 tufenkji et al 2003 11 p k f s l o w 1 σ s l o w 2 π exp 1 2 k k s l o w σ s l o w 2 f f a s t 1 σ f a s t 2 π exp 1 2 k k f a s t σ f a s t 2 where f s l o w and f f a s t are the fraction of particles associated with slow and fast deposition respectively k s l o w and k f a s t are the mean deposition rates associated with the slow and fast deposition σ s l o w and σ f a s t are the standard deviations thus the concentration of particles in solution c and concentration of particles that are retained s can be modified as shown in equations 12 and 13 12 c x c 0 0 exp k v x p k d k 13 s x t o c o ρ b 0 k e x p k v x p k d k chu et al illustrated that the removal efficiency varies with the ionic strength because of the repulsive electrostatic double layer interactions chu et al 2019 thus the removal efficiency η gets modified and can be represented as shown in equation 14 14 η α η o where α is the attachment efficiency and η is the efficiency of soil adsorption in the absence of double layer interaction η o can be represented by equation 15 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 a 15 η o 2 4 a s 1 3 n r 0 081 n p e 0 715 n v d w 0 052 0 55 a s n r 1 675 n a 0 125 0 22 n r 0 24 n g 1 11 n v d w 0 053 where nr npe na nvdw and ng are aspect ratio peclet number attraction number van der waals number and gravity number respectively the attachment efficiency arising out of colloidal interaction energy can be explained by dlvo theory redman et al 2004 bradford et al 2006 hoek and agarwal 2006 shen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 li et al 2017 the dlvo theory considers that interaction energy u between the contaminants and the soil particles is the sum of van der waals u v d w double layer interactions u d l and born repulsion u b r hogg et al 1966 ruckenstein and prieve 1976 gregory 1981 16 u u v d w u d l u b r 17 u v d w a a p 6 h 1 14 h λ 18 u b r a χ 6 7560 8 a p h 2 a p h 7 6 a p h h 7 19 u d l π ε ε o a p 2 ψ p ψ c 1 e k h 1 e k h ψ p 2 ψ c 2 ln 1 e 2 k h where a is the hamaker constant ap is the radius of microplastics h is the separation distance between microplastics and soil particles λ is the characteristic dielectric wavelength χ is the born collision parameter ε 0 and ε is the permittivity of free space and water ψp is zeta potential for plastics and ψc are the zeta potentials for soil κ is the inverse debye screening length the dlvo interaction energy u depends upon the ionic strength of groundwater thus at a fixed ionic strength and interaction energy the attachment efficiency can be determined using hahn s model hahn and o melia 2004 once the attachment efficiency α is determined the movement of additives in the subsurface environment can be modelled using equations 8 10 c additives like phthalates bisphenol a bpa bis 2 ethylhexyl adipate deha and alkylphenols which are not readily soluble in water but may get introduced in the groundwater in dissolved form with suitable solvents thomsen et al 2001 bi et al 2013 ibrahim et al 2014 these additives in their soluble forms are immiscible fluids since the density of these additives is lower than the water cao 2008 weir et al 2014 their movement can be described as a light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl these additives behave as conservative in water as these do not dissolve in water but these get adsorbed on the soil particles wang et al 2017 a willemsen et al 2019 hunter and uchrin 2000 thus considering these fluids solvent water as incompressible their movement through the porous media can be described by equation 20 20 δ ρ o s o φ δ t ρ o v o j o r o 21 δ ρ w s w φ δ t ρ w v w j w 0 the first term of equations 20 and 21 accounts for the accumulation of solvent and additives o the second term accounts for the movement of mass due to advection and the third term is due to non advective diffusion and dispersion r o represents the removal or addition of additives from soil to the solvent ⱷ represents the effective porosity ρ o s o and ρ w s w are the density and saturation of solvent and water respectively v w and v o denote the velocity of solvent and water respectively within the soil matrix 22 t h e t o t a l s a t u r a t i o n w i l l b e s o s w 1 considering both solvent and water to obey darcy s law the velocity can be expressed as shown in equations 23 and 24 leverett and lewis 1941 childs and collis george 1950 corey et al 1956 watson 1966 vachaud 1967 23 v o k k r o μ o p o ρ o g 24 v w k k r w μ w p w ρ w g where g is acceleration due to gravity μ o and μ w are the viscosity of solvent and water k is the intrinsic permeability k r o and k r w are the relative permeability of oil and water and p o and p w is the pressure of solvent and water in density dependent flows saturation is the function of capillary pressure abriola 1989 the capillary force in the soil or sediment matrix depends upon the pore size interfacial tensions and wettability and therefore it is determined by the distribution of fluid inside the pores since soil and fluid properties remain constant capillary pressure is determined by saturation abriola 1989 guérillot et al 2020 considering the fluids as incompressible the first term of equations 20 and 21 can be expressed in the form of capillary function pc as follows 25 φ ρ o s o t φ ρ o s o p c p c t 26 φ ρ w s w t φ ρ w s w p c p c t the non advective movement comprised of molecular diffusion and hydro dynamic dispersion can be described by fickian form as shown in equations 27 29 27 j o ρ o φ d o s o where do is the function of molecular diffusion and fluid velocity thus 28 j o φ ρ o d o s o p c p c t 29 j w φ ρ w d w s w p c p c t substituting equations 25 26 and 28 29 in equations 20 and 21 respectively it will take the following form 30 ρ o s o p c p c t ρ o v o φ ρ o d o s o p c p c t r o 31 φ ρ w s w p c p c t ρ w v w φ ρ w d w s w p c p c t 0 the resulting equations viz 30 and 31 can be solved by using buckley and leverrette method buckley and leverett 1942 black oil simulators chen 2001 implicit pressure explicit saturation method impesm sheldon and cardwell 1959 stone and garder 1961 etc for simulating the movement of additives inside the soil matrix thus by combining the movement of microplastic particles and their associated additives the extent of the microplastic plume can be determined in the groundwater this plume movement assessment is very important considering the wide scale dependency on the groundwater resources for drinking as well as irrigation consumption and or use of groundwater contaminated with microplastics poses adverse impacts not only on human health but also have ecological implications and thus it becomes necessary to trace their movements 4 implications of microplastics occurrence in groundwater groundwater is one of the important resources for drinking as well as irrigation microplastics laden ground water directly affects human health upon consumption and indirectly affects the soil and crops when used for irrigation toxicity also increases manifold due to the adhesive properties of microplastics which allows the adsorption of various chemicals additives heavy metals microorganisms etc the implications associated with groundwater microplastics can be categorized in the following sections 4 1 health hazards due to the consumption of groundwater laden with microplastics microplastics suspended in groundwater have easy access to the human body recent findings suggest that humans ingest approximately 5 g of microplastics in a week through various pathways which include groundwater as well senathirajah and palanisami 2019 mohajerani and karabatak 2020 these particles have bio accumulative potential in secondary organs after they get translocated from the gut smith et al 2018 moreover not only the microplastic particles rather various other chemicals in the form of plasticizers and additives added adsorbed in on to them further affect the human health adversely for example styrene which is used in styrofoam packaging is a known endocrine disrupting chemical rist et al 2018 similarly various organochlorine pesticides and persistent organic pollutants such as ddt are known to be adsorbed onto the microplastics ogata et al 2009 adjei et al 2014 thus not only the direct impacts but indirect impacts of microplastics are also of serious concern studies have reported the presence of phthalates and bisphenol a bpa which are the basic constituents of microplastics in the human body thompson et al 2009 the research in the area of impacts of microplastics ingestion in the human body is in a very nascent stage preliminary studies have shown that microplastics may result in genotoxicity carcinogenesis fibrosis exaggerated inflammatory response oxidative stress etc schirinzi et al 2017 deng et al 2017 fig 2 table 4 another serious impact may be due to the harmful microbes which might reach the human body through attached biofilm over the microplastics kirstein et al 2016 these may result in disturbances within the gut microflora infections and other serious disorders table 4 according to recent studies microplastics have the potential to cross the placental barrier ragusa et al 2021 which might result in various reproductive and teratogenic abnormalities swan et al 2005 swan 2008 lang et al 2008 nevertheless microplastics have been found in human saliva blood colon and stool as well confirming their ingestion through water and other sources schwabl et al 2019 ibrahim et al 2020 abbasi and turner 2021 leslie et al 2022 a summary of human health impacts associated with groundwater contaminated with microplastics is shown in table 4 4 2 microplastics as vectors of metals metalloids microplastics are known to adsorb various metals metalloids such as cadmium manganese lead arsenic copper zinc chromium etc on their surfaces brennecke et al 2016 gao et al 2019 selvam et al 2021 moreover metals are also added during the manufacturing process of plastics for various purposes such as pigmentation uv stabilization flame retardants etc campanale et al 2020 polyethylene terephthalate particles have been reported to accumulate lead cadmium and zinc abbasi et al 2020 likewise arsenic cadmium chromium and lead were found to be associated with high density polyethylene holmes et al 2012 jinhui et al 2019 mohsen et al 2019 the copper concentration of up to 80 9 500 ng g of polyethylene and polypropylene has been reported wang et al 2017 b since microplastics are organic polymers their affinity for metals is evident ashton et al 2010 usually it is the charged sites or the neutral regions on the microplastics surfaces that act as the hotspots for metals sorption ashton et al 2010 physico chemical properties of microplastics play an important role in the metal adsorption processes for example high surface area and high polarity promote sorption holmes et al 2014 also aged microplastics are more prone to adsorb metals compared to virgin microplastics brennecke et al 2016 as groundwater is often exposed to metals metalloids either of the geogenic origin or anthropogenic origin momot and synzynys 2005 vetrimurugan et al 2017 jain et al 2018 their interaction with microplastics is inevitable thus not only microplastics per se rather metals and metalloids adsorbed onto them also find their way to the human animal consumption route deleterious health impacts associated with metals are widely recognized khan et al 2008 rehman et al 2017 tepanosyan et al 2018 jain et al 2019 table 4 altered endocrine systems and abrupt hormonal responses have been reported in organisms due to the effects of microplastics laden with such pollutants rochman et al 2014 similar may be the effects on humans as well moreover metals adsorbed to the microplastic particles have also been shown to produce adverse effects on aquatic organisms and plant growth jinhui et al 2019 abbasi et al 2020 metals laden polyethylene terephthalate particles have been reported to remain associated with soil rhizosphere systems for a long time abbasi et al 2020 which might affect crop growth fig 2 4 3 microbial contamination through microplastics as microplastic particles reach up to the hyporheic zone of an aquifer through various interaction mechanisms between surface and groundwater these particles come in contact with several other constitutents hyporheic zone is a biogeochemically active zone enabling the nutrients exchange and stimulating activities of microbes lawrence et al 2013 therefore considerable interactions among the microplastic particles microbes and other inorganic constitutents are promoted in this zone fig 3 as a result microplastics get colonized by microorganisms present in this environment in a short span of time harrison et al 2014 a number of environmental factors influence this biofilm formation such as temperature presence of light and oxygen and presence of other chemical moieties in the vicinity hullar et al 2006 oberbeckmann et al 2016 moreover microplastics may alter the structure of the microbial biofilm and also act as source of carbon which further promote the microbial growth guasch et al 2022 fig 3 similar to the hyporheic zone microbial growth over microplastics is also possible in the wastewater treatment plants landfill sites and other non point sources of pollution as these sites are the sources of various microorganisms owing to being rich in organic moieties microplastics laden with microbes from these sites further contribute to the groundwater microplastics through seepage or direct discharge researchers have reported that diversity in microbial film formation varies with the variety of substrates as taxonomically different genera were observed in the microbial films developed over plastics glass organic materials etc hoellein et al 2014 mccormick et al 2014 oberbeckmann et al 2016 the most common families grown over microplastics were found to be pseudomonadaceae proteobacteria and campylobacteraceae genera belonging to these families include pseudomonas arcobacter aeromonas and aquabacterium mccormick et al 2014 these microbial communities have been detected to be colonizing over the microplastics occurring in wastewater treatment plants and hence these do have the potential to be mixed with the groundwater as well arcobacter spp is also a common member of the microbial community of landfill leachate and sewage merga et al 2014 stamps et al 2016 many of these species have the potential of pathogenesis and hence their occurrence in groundwater is of serious concern table 4 gene sequencing analyses have also confirmed that microplastics do function as carriers of various pathogens such as vibrio and arcobacter spp woo et al 2008 zettler et al 2013 harrison et al 2014 mccormick et al 2014 amaral zettler et al 2015 4 4 effects on soil and crop health due to the use of microplastics laden groundwater the impact on soil ecosystems due to the presence of microplastics has been explored the use of groundwater contaminated with microplastics for irrigation purposes can significantly affect the soil ecosystem and microbial activities therein huang et al 2019 the groundwater used in irrigation reaches up to the plants roots and hence the rhizosphere region being small in size the microplastics carried along with the groundwater often get accumulated in the rhizosphere region and affects various chemical and microbiological parameters in the vicinity fig 2 it has been shown that polyethylene microplastics have altered the enzymatic activities within the soil which resulted in a change in the soil microbial composition huang et al 2019 the presence of microplastics in soil for long duration after irrigation might also result in decreased soil bulk density machado et al 2018 it may result in more porosity in the soil structure resulting in increased soil water evaporation and ultimately soil drying wan et al 2019 alteration in the soil structure owing to drying will certainly affect soil aggregation which might pose serious consequences on soil aeration and root growth rillig et al 2019 plastics being rich in carbon content might also result in alteration in c n ratio of the soil which causes microbial immobilization effects on the microbial community and or on the rhizospheric symbionts could result in adverse impacts on the plant community as well there is also the possibility that hydrophobic contaminants present in soil layers might get attracted to the microplastic particles thus making themselves available for a longer period of time rummel et al 2017 miao et al 2019 rillig et al 2019 as crop growth is highly dependent upon the presence of diverse soil microbiota e g nitrogen fixing bacteria mycorrhiza etc heijden et al 2016 powell and rillig 2018 effects on these due to the microplastics and associated contaminants might result in reduced crop growth lowery and ursell 2019 upon further breakdown microplastics might get converted to nano plastics which could be able to make entry inside the roots thus creating alterations at the level of cells and molecules and might also result in oxidative stress navarro et al 2008 4 5 effects on subsurface ecology due to the presence of microplastics in groundwater subsurface ecology represents a diverse range of organisms often known as stygobites which are strict subterranean aquatic animals these species have a potential impact on the groundwater ecosystem services in terms of water purification bioremediation biogeochemical cycles and water filtration owing to their feeding patterns movement and excretion boulton et al 2008 moreover these underground organisms are one of the unique components of global biodiversity being endemic and having uncommon adaptations to their subterranean environment these organisms are important for understanding the evolutionary processes ecology and biodiversity danielopol et al 2000 danielopol and griebler 2008 ingestion of groundwater microplastics by these organisms might hamper their physiological processes growth life cycle patterns and subsequently the ecosystem services iannilli et al 2019 lorenzo et al 2019 another probable aspect is the transport of ingested microplastics by the stygobite community the ingested particles may be uptaken by their predators which may produce consequences for the entire food web iannilli et al 2019 though there are no such studies as of now but it may be a possibility considering the same in terrestrial ecosystems barboza et al 2018 horton and dixon 2018 5 possible ways to minimize microplastics contamination in groundwater the minimization of microplastics in groundwater needs a holistic approach both primary and secondary microplastics are needed to be targeted for the effective management of microplastic pollution singh et al 2021b reducing the production and use of primary microplastics is one step whereas safe disposal of used plastics and proper waste management is necessary for minimizing the secondary microplastics as indiscriminate and unscientific disposal is one of the major sources of plastic waste pollution singh et al 2022 sometimes bioplastics are referred to as an option for conventional plastics considering their biodegradable properties hoffman et al 2019 however there is enough evidence to support that bioplastics do instigate a variety of risks for human as well as other biotic species shruti and muniasamy 2019 nonetheless these also act as vectors of chemical contaminants just as conventional plastics do according to a study the sorption of phenanthrene an organic pollutant on the biodegradable plastic film polybutylene adipate co terephthalate pbat was much stronger than its sorption on the conventional plastics polyethylene and polystyrene zuo et al 2019 disposal of these bioplastics in unregulated manner results in microplastics in the similar manner and ultimately contaminates the groundwater therefore despite focusing on the alternatives it is important to develop strategies for minimizing the interaction of microplastic contaminated zones with surface groundwater resources a critical step in this direction is the identification of microplastic dominated zones that are at high risk of pollution as per the current knowledge most of the microplastic pollution is concentrated in oceans and seas barboza and gimenez 2015 galloway and lewis 2016 wright and kelly 2017 wang et al 2018 therefore groundwater resources in the nearby areas need to be identified as under high risk and suitable action needs to be undertaken in such areas excessive utilization of groundwater resources through pumping should be minimized as it accelerates the sea water intrusion deep groundwater wells need to be avoided and well location should also be significantly far from the coast consideration of geology is also an important concern as fractured bedrocks facilitate seawater intrusion park et al 2012 sebben et al 2015 hussain et al 2019 various physical surface sub surface and hydraulic barriers such as abstraction or artificial recharge may further help to minimize the sea water intrusion and hence microplastic contamination hussain et al 2019 the end use treatment options such as efficient filtration processes also need to be developed which can make the removal of microplastics easy it has been shown that biochar filters can efficiently remove the microplastic spheres of up to 10 μm in diameter with a removal efficiency as high as 95 wang et al 2020 b granular activated carbon gac filters have also been proved to be efficient in decreasing the concentration of microplastics in water up to 61 wang et al 2020c moreover gac filters were found to be more selective for small sized microplastics which is an added advantage such options can be employed for the removal of microplastics at the point of use curtailing the routine practices such as the application of wastewater sludge onto the soil might also help to prevent groundwater contamination application of sludge enhances the concentration of microplastics in soil which might further accelerate the movement of the same downwards nizzetto et al 2016 c ziajahromi et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 studies have shown that wastewater sludge can be effectively used for the formation of bricks which is an environmentally friendly process as well ukwatta et al 2016 mohajerani et al 2019 mohajerani and karabatak 2020 to minimize microplastic pollution through landfills proper lining of the landfills is crucial periodic monitoring is essential to track groundwater quality it is also important to place the drinking water wells far from the landfills to avoid mixing the contaminated plume with the underground water 6 conclusion and way forward protection of our natural resources is the key to a sustainable world in order to maintain the well being of human as well as the surrounding environment it is necessary to keep our natural resources safe and uncontaminated groundwater is one such natural resource that is considered safe and often consumed without any specific treatment however the presence of microscopic impurities such as microplastics renders its consumption quite dubious considering the deleterious impacts of microplastics onto human health and environment this review has summarized the various pathways and mechanisms through which groundwater gets contaminated with microplastics moreover the possible impacts posed by such contaminated groundwater are also discussed in detail realizing the fact that groundwater serves a quarter of the global drinking water supply apart from its use in irrigation its purity is of paramount importance moreover in developing countries where paucity of resources and lack of awareness makes it difficult to treat all the water before use the situation becomes more critical therefore the prime objective should be to minimize the causes which can lead to groundwater contamination based on this study it is evident that microplastics are ubiquitous entities and hence their entry into the various components of the ecosystem and thereby into the groundwater is certain therefore primary focus should be on defining the criteria for the suitable location and depth of the groundwater wells esp in high risk zones such as near oceans wastewater treatment plants and landfills further as underground processes cannot be monitored modelling approaches are the viable option in order to accurately estimate the contamination in this context it is important to further explore the various pathways and model the flow of microplastics in the groundwater the occurrence and concentration of microplastics at different water levels also need to be investigated the effect of geological and hydrological characteristics on the spread and impact of microplastics should also be ascertained nevertheless a holistic approach integrating plastic waste
