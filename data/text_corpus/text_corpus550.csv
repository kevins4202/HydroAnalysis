2750,the lack of an integrated approach to assess the quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater resources undesirably affects their sustainability and errors in users decisions in the optimal development of basins therefore to help to solve the problem of water resources sustainability assessment in various parts of the basin for the first time this article has presented a practical approach for the temporal spatial evaluation of surface water and groundwater resources the method presented in this study is based on investigating the behavior of sustainability indicators for surface water and groundwater in different years and separately for the sub basins and aquifers evaluation of water quality and quantity criteria provides the main components of the proposed approach using spatial clustering water quality and quantity evaluations were implemented focusing on drinking water and irrigation water uses in all sub basins of the zayandeh rood river basin in iran for the years 2006 and 2016 using groundwater footprint gf and integrated groundwater footprint igf the gf to area ratios gf a in the first and last years of the study period were 1 1 and 0 8 respectively while the igf a values were 8 9 and 7 3 in the drinking water use and 1 3 and 1 1 in the irrigation water use respectively in order to apply a perspective in investigating the sustainability of the basin surface water footprint sf and integrated surface water footprint isf indices are introduced in this study for the first time the sf a values in the study period were 2 2 and 1 8 respectively the isf a values were 3 8 and 3 3 in the drinking water use and 2 4 and 2 in the irrigation water use for 2006 and 2016 respectively values greater than or equal to one in the above indicators indicate water resources critical and unsustainable state the comparison of groundwater and surface water indices shows that despite the slight improvement of the average values of the indices in the whole basin some sub basins are still in critical condition therefore by using the k means algorithm the sub basins were clustered into three categories favorable unfavorable and critical in the mentioned years finally this research provides spatial planning based on water resources which provides a comprehensive approach to maintaining the sustainability of basin water resources proportional to each sub basin s capacity and baseline status in this way the factors affecting the status of the basin the effect of the plans implemented in previous years and the main priority of each sub basin to solve its problems are identified this information leads to the best planning for the sustainability of water resources and increasing social welfare based on the water

increasing population expanding agriculture and rural activities changing climate patterns and ensuring water supply during droughts have increased water demand in many parts of the world ahmed et al 2019 khan et al 2019 ardıçlıoglu and kuriqi 2019 this has posed a severe challenge to water managers and researchers around the world also the allocation of significant water resources to agriculture has put much pressure on rivers and aquifers accounting for 70 of the world s surface water and groundwater resources flammini et al 2014 kamrani et al 2020 achieng and zhu 2021 as an example of arid and semi arid countries agriculture in iran consumes 90 of the total allocated water moreover the negative water balance of groundwater due to over extraction from aquifers surface water transfer and droughts have caused severe water stress on iranian wetlands unfortunately iran s water resources are in critical condition according to the falkenmark water stress index moridi 2017 therefore integrated water resources management of around the world has become essential today as a result planning to improve the condition of the basins is essential due to their quantitative and qualitative potential indeed sustainable water resources management should be one of the top priorities of any water resources management system kourgialas et al 2018 furthermore development plans should also be considered as criteria for sustainable development considering social economic and environmental aspects abedzadeh et al 2020 water resources studies often fall into two general categories water quantity evaluation chiu et al 2020 luo et al 2020 faro et al 2019 wang et al 2020 and water quality evaluation al omran et al 2015 hoekstra et al 2011 mladenović ranisavljević and zerajic 2018 schoumans et al 2014 for example ramadan et al 2019 evaluated the quantity of water resources in the eastern nile basin and the demands of 11 african countries participating in the nile river water using different scenarios also some researchers have studied the relationship between land use and its impacts on water quality shrestha et al 2018 gu et al 2019 kawo and karuppannan 2018 investigated the status of drinking and irrigation water quality of ethiopia using zoning of groundwater data kawo and karuppannan 2018 this approach can hardly solve the challenges of sustainable water resources management some researchers have considered the quality and quantity of water resources separately or together ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 jia et al 2020 wang et al 2019 kourgialas et al 2018 for given an example cao et al 2021 presented the quantity and quality for water yield equivalent qqwye index to evaluate water resources in the upstream reservoir basin in china which provided more reliable results lin 2020 conducted a combined assessment of the quality and quantity of ethiopian aquifers with the help of the integrated groundwater footprint igf index in the zoning of the basin and reported this approach as a method for improving the macro water resources policy policy making from a comprehensive approach provides an aspect of spatial planning based on water resources for sustainable management at the basin level which can assess the condition of water resources in the basin using study area zoning as a branch of data mining spatial clustering is one of the most widely used methods for zoning studies data mining is exploring and analyzing large amounts of data utilizing supervised and unsupervised tools for discovering meaningful patterns and rules among data clustering is one of the standard techniques in data mining which has many applications due to the lack of need for previous knowledge about the problem for instance clustering in water science is often used to study and demonstrate the physical and chemical status of water resources in the study area to aid in modeling and to predict hydrological observations aytaç 2020 and risk assessment javadi et al 2020 wang et al 2020 rahmani et al 2019 using classical and fuzzy clustering javadi et al 2020 prepared the risk map of the qazvin aquifer in iran and showed that agricultural and industrial regions cover 70 of the areas with a high risk of chemical pollution aytaç 2020 spatially clustered the western basins of the black sea in turkey into eight clusters based on the hydrological response unit hru facilitating work for water researchers in future studies researchers have not paid much attention to spatial clustering in assessing the sustainability of water resources and it has often been used in the study of water quality and hydrological characteristics of basins at the same time this method can provide practical and effective results therefore the present study aims to evaluate the changes in the quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater resources of the zayandeh rood basin in two time steps 2006 2016 using spatial clustering of integrated surface water and groundwater footprints considering the importance of a comprehensive assessment this study introduces a new approach using the evaluation indices and clustering as one of the most widely used unsupervised pattern recognition methods besides to integrate the indices used for surface water and groundwater surface water footprint sf and integrated surface water footprint isf have been introduced for the first time simultaneous study of the surface and groundwater of a region can help the proper exploitation of the water resources abdolvandi et al 2013 accordingly the objectives of the present study are a assessment of groundwater sustainability in terms of integrated groundwater footprint for drinking water and irrigation water in 2006 and 2016 then comparing groundwater sustainability based on indicators calculated in the studied years b introducing and assessing a new index to evaluate the sustainability of surface water resources in terms of integrated surface water footprint for drinking water and irrigation then comparing surface water sustainability based on indicators calculated in the studied years c clustering calculated groundwater and surface water indices spatially in the zayandeh rood area aquifers and sub basins respectively and comparing spatial changes in sub basins to implement water management guidelines therefore the results of this novel approach can be used on a scale ranging from study subfields to national studies on drinking water industrial water and irrigation water uses around the world in fact the proposed methodology provides practical results and appropriate analysis for the sustainable management of river basins according to the capacity of water resources such a comprehensive approach is a great goal for water resources researchers which includes practical factors related to quantity and quality of water resources 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the zayandeh rood river basin with 16 sub basins and an area of 26 864 km2 is part of the gavkhooni watershed in the central plateau of iran the zayandeh rood basin is one of the most strategic basins in iran politically socially and economically in addition to supplying water to thousands of hectares of agricultural land it supplies drinking water to residents of four provinces in whole or in part and industries generally the zayandeh rood basin has an arid and semi arid climate but the western and northwestern parts of the basin are mountainous regions and the zayandeh rood river originates from these regions it should be noted that basin s river flow comes from mountainous areas heights and plains cover about 43 8 and 56 of the basin area respectively while the zayandeh rood dam lake constitutes 0 2 of the basin area ministry of energy of islamic republic of iran 2016 zayandab consulting engineers co iran 2016 fig 1 depicts the location of the zayandeh rood basin and its sub basins as part of the gavkhooni watershed the maximum and minimum transmissivity coefficients are in sub basin 14 damane daran with 2950 m2 day and sub basin 6 najaf abad with 11 m2 day respectively also the maximum aquifer storage coefficient is 26 7 in sub basin 2 isfahan borkhar and the minimum is negligible in sub basin 1 koohpayeh moreover the maximum saturated thickness of the aquifer is 136 5 m in sub basin 2 isfahan borkhar and the minimum is 32 m in sub basin 10 ben saman therefore according to discharge gradation and thickness the zayandeh rood basin aquifers yield is divided into three categories a weak aquifer yield aquifers 3 and 5 b average aquifer yield aquifers 1 4 7 9 10 11 12 13 15 and 16 and c strong aquifer yield aquifers 2 6 8 and 14 eventually aquifer 6 najaf abad has a robust yield ministry of energy of islamic republic of iran 2016 zayandab consulting engineers co iran 2016 most of the zayandeh rood basin s plains such as meymeh 5 moorcheh khort 3 carvan 7 and mahyar 8 are graben type and some others like najaf abad 6 are syncline type moreover ben saman 10 chehel khaneh 13 yan cheshmeh 15 and chelgerd 16 sub basins plains are generally created alongside fault line valleys and according to their erosion rate waterways are created in the mentioned plains the area and thickness of alluvium are limited the lenjanat 9 plain is structurally an anticline with a northwest southeast nw se strik also its strik is eroded koohpayeh 1 plain gavkhooni wetland and most parts of isfahan borkhar 2 and najaf abad 6 plains are peneplains from the perspective of groundwater quality most aquifers are chlorine type and bicarbonate type aquifers are found in the western part of the zayandeh rood basin it should be added that just tiny parts of aquifers 6 9 and 5 are sulfate type aquifers ministry of energy of islamic republic of iran 2016 also aquifer 8 mahyar with an average of 118 m has the deepest water level on the other hand the shallowest water level 65 m is on the border of aquifer 6 overall zayandeh rood basin s aquifers from the northwest to the southeast the water level of aquifers is decreasing ministry of energy of islamic republic of iran 2016 zareian 2021 fig 2 shows the flowchart of this study the main stage is the collection of relevant data due to the large volume of information required qualitative and quantitative data in 2006 and 2016 were collected for all sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin table 1 according to fig 2 this study included three main stages data collection and initial processing calculations interpretation and conclusion the steps of conducting this study were as follows i it was decided to use the groundwater footprint index gf and igf by examining the evaluation criteria of water resources ii the required data of the study years were collected from the relevant organizations and official reports iii after completing the studies on the primary indices and priorities of surface water sf and isf indices were developed to integrate the approaches and interpretations iv surface water data and information required were collected v the thresholds of schoeller and wilcox were determined to calculate igf and isf vi after calculating gf igf sf and isf in the drinking water and irrigation water use for the study years separately for all sub basins maps were created in the arcgis environment to provide an overview of the status of the study basin and sub basins and their changes in the study period vii the four indices were clustered for both years and all sub basins and their maps were created in the arcgis environment viii it was necessary to have land use maps in the study years to confirm the results of clustering and interpretations of the last stage that was received from the relevant organizations ix the values of the indices were compared and interpreted with the help of the maps of the calculation stage it was necessary to verify the results of the interpretation with the official reports of the relevant organizations land use maps and documents x similar in the previous step the results and spatial clustering maps were compared xi after reviewing analyzing and interpreting the maps the impact of various factors on the stability of surface and groundwater resources was well determined finally it should be noted that in cases where data are not available or have little accuracy climatic models can be used which fortunately the number of climate models used to estimate the current and future hydrological conditions continues to increase achieng and zhu 2019 in order to ensure the accuracy of the data official reports approved by iran s ministry of energy have been used and the last official report was presented in 2016 on the one hand from 2006 to 2016 considerable changes and developments have occurredin the zayandeh rood basin becuase industrial and agricultural activities have significantly increased moreover in these two years comprehensive and complete surveys have been carried out which helpthe engineers to applying these data in their relevent researches it should be mentioned that the studies for each sub basin were examined separately still due to the unavailability of the land use map of 2006 this map was prepared by remote sensing in the zayandeh rood basin and was analyzed for each sub basin by arcgis software 2 2 groundwater and surface water footprint indices gf is proposed to study the environmental sustainability of groundwater tork et al 2021 as indicated by eq 1 in table 2 kourgialas et al 2018 also presented the igf index to create a decision making tool that considers groundwater resources quality and quantity eq 2 in table 2 it should be noted that the e parameter was considered drainage in the gf formula by gleeson and wada 2012 however aquifer evaporation was added to this parameter in the present study to integrate the basin zoning studies we presented sf and isf indices on average the withdrawal of more than 20 of renewable water resources put much pressure on water resources while more than 40 of withdrawals create critical conditions fao 2011 therefore considering a critical threshold and a similar concept of groundwater indices eqs 3 and 4 in table 2 were introduced for sf and isf the dimensions of r e and c in sf and gf formulas are l3 t and their units are mcm year a represents the area with a unit of km2 aquifer area in groundwater studies and sub basin area in surface water studies therefore the dimensions of gf igf sf and isf indices are l2 with the unit of km2 and gf a igf a sf a and isf a indices are dimensionless it should be noted that c annual withdrawals in surface water formulas include interbasin water transfer surface water discharge downstream and water withdrawal for domestic industrial and irrigation use r recharge sources consists of the return water from uses drainage and wastewater and total surface water that includes plains and mountain runoff surface water discharge downstream and interbasin water transfer e also represents lakes evaporation the water stress sf a and gf a is obtained by dividing the indices of table 2 by area a larger and equal values to one included in this study while they were not defined in the literature indicate the critical condition of water resources and values less than one indicate its sustainability gleeson and wada 2012 water quantity indices express water shortage stress while integrated indices show the effect of quantity and quality on each other for example a higher isf indicates surface water resources with quality and or quantity stress and ultimately its unfavorable sustainability for water quality monitoring of irrigation and drinking water resources idw interpolation technique and thiessen polygonization technique in the arcgis software environment were used respectively and through this areas including more chemical parameters were calculated idw is one of the most popular types of deterministic methods for multivariate interpolation with a known scattered set of points acceptable thresholds of the schoeller for drinking purposes and wilcox for irrigation according to the general cultivation in the study area are listed in table 3 2 3 k means clustering of groundwater and surface water indices a cluster is a group of data with the most similarity k means technique works based on randomly selecting a point as the data center and finally calculating the distance of the data from the center of the cluster to reach the minimum distance and actually maximum similarity hashemy and monem 2012 some benefits of applying k means method are relatively simple to implement and scales to large data sets guarantees convergence and generalizes to clusters of different shapes and sizes such as elliptical clusters the distance criterion in the k means technique is the mahalanobis distance this distance was introduced by mahalanobis in 1936 feil 2006 and is defined as eq 5 for two data x and v 5 d 2 x v x v t m 1 x v where m represents the covariance matrix and t represents the vector transpose the k means clustering technique uses the davis and boldin validation index idb idb is a criterion based on the internal scattering and the distance between the clusters by separating n samples into g clusters in the classical and non fuzzy clustering method eq 6 shows the db index between the two clusters created 6 r jk σ j σ k μ j μ k j k 1 2 g k j where μj is the average distances of all samples located in the cluster j and σj is the amount of internal scattering of the cluster which is obtained from eq 7 7 σ j 1 n j x i c j x i μ j 2 where cj is a set of samples belonging to cluster j and nj is the number of its samples when the distance between two clusters is large and the internal scattering of the clusters is minimal the value of rjk reaches its lowest value idb is equal to the mean of rj where rj is the maximum distance of rjk obtained from comparing cluster j with other clusters eqs 8 and 9 8 r j max k 1 2 g k j r jk 9 i db 1 g i 1 g r j 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of groundwater footprint indices table 4 shows that during the study period many sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin have improved in terms of groundwater stress gf a status although in slight amounts and only sub basins 8 mahyar and 6 najaf abad have suffered more water shortage stress also only these two sub basins and sub basin 9 lenjanat have experienced poorer quality in the drinking water and irrigation water use despite the improvement of the gf a index the unfavorable value of igf a for the drinking water use of the lenjanat basin indicates a decline in the quality of drinking water of this sub basin in 2016 at the same time the favorable value of igf a in the irrigation water use indicates the appropriate amount of chemical parameters in the irrigation water of this sub basin with a decrease in withdrawal in 2016 sub basins 2 isfahan borkhar 3 moorcheh khort 4 alavije dahaqh and 5 meymeh also found a similar situation to lenjanat in the drinking water use equal values of gf a and igf a in the irrigation water use of these sub basins show that no pollutants have exceeded the allowable limit and the pollution components of eq 2 are zero although withdrawal is only one of the components of calculating the gf and igf it remarkably affects their values according to official statistics likewise withdrawal reduction in sub basins 11 chadegan 12 booeen miandasht 13 chehel khaneh and 14 damane daran which are located in the highlands of the basin and have abundant natural reserves of snow and rain has led to an improvement in their gf a and igf a values in 2016 and only a minimal number of pollutants remained in these sub basins ministry of energy of islamic republic of iran 2016 finally in 2016 although the quantity and average gf a in the whole basin improved from 1 1 to 0 8 due to the decrease in aquifer withdrawal especially in the irrigation use in many study sub basins its value is still close to one and has a critical situation the average igf a value in the irrigation water and drinking water uses also changed from 1 3 and 8 9 to 1 1 and 7 3 respectively indicating the severe stress of aquifer water quality in the drinking water use the spatial distribution of the calculated indices is illustrated in fig 3 3 2 clustering of groundwater quantity and quality indices a total of two three and four clusters in the spatial zoning of the gf a and igf a indices were investigated by the k means method and using matlab according to the idb values the three cluster mode was selected for further analysis thus the values from zero to one favorable values were assigned to the first cluster while those equal to and greater than one were assigned to unfavorable or critical clusters it should be noted that the smaller the idb value the more reliable the clustering performed which is shown in table 5 for the gf a and igf a indices the spatial zoning of the gf a igf a indices in the drinking water use and igf a in the irrigation water use are shown in fig 4 in contrast the spatial evaluation of the clustering results is presented in table 6 sub basins 2 3 4 5 6 and 8 in the eastern and central parts of the basin which are located at low altitude grounds and do not or slightly benefit from the presence of the zayandeh rood river rely on groundwater to meet the drinking water industrial water and irrigation water needs in the gf a clustering in 2006 they are identified in the unfavorable group where sub basin 3 moorche khort is located in the critical cluster although sub basin 1 koohpayeh covers the zayandeh rood river completely this causes much pollution of surface water resources due to the transfer of effluents from irrigation domestic and industrial activities of the upstream sub basins which infiltrates the aquifer and creates a critical situation for this sub basin ministry of energy of islamic republic of iran 2016 safavi et al 2016 the western and high altitude sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin which have more withdrawal from surface water resources include sub basins 16 chelgerd 10 ben saman 15 yan cheshmeh 11 chadegan 13 chehel khaneh 14 damane daran 12 booeen miandasht 7 carvan and 9 lenjanat and are clustered in the favorable group in the water quantity zoning of the aquifer other sub basins with gf a values are very close to one however the non fuzzy clustering approach is categorized as unfavorable and has improved over the study period analyzing the results of indices and factors causing changes in the basin is one of the essential aspects of quantity and quality evaluation of water resources which leads to recognizing harmful or improving factors of the status of water resources and thus sustainable development of the basin this approach helps researchers and exploiters in spatial planning based on water resources in the basin influential factors in analyzing the values of indices are precipitation infiltration withdrawal aquifer hydrographs and land use which well clarify the basin s conditions kourgialas et al 2018 fig 5 shows the changes in aquifer withdrawal for the irrigation water use during the study period indicating the effects of the irrigation water use on the sustainability of groundwater resources and aquifer level drop for example sub basins 7 14 and 11 and many others are located in favorable clusters in 2016 by decreasing the irrigation withdrawal fig 6 shows the land use map of sub basin 7 at the beginning and end of the study period as an example central brown areas indicating pastures and agricultural lands have declined sharply in 2016 sub basin 7 caravan in 2016 experienced a better situation than in 2006 with the reduction of irrigation water to 13 according to table 6 unlike sub basin 7 sub basin 6 najaf abad has created critical conditions for the quantity and quality of aquifers by the lack of proper managing increasing withdrawals and reducing rainfall in the basin area of farms equipped with pressurized irrigation systems which reduce the amount of returned water to zero has increased kamrani et al 2020 so on the one hand they prevent the reduction of withdrawal on the other hand return water and aquifer recharge are reduced sub basin 8 has a similar process to sub basin 6 and both have been assigned to the critical cluster of the gf a index the western and high altitude sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin show the improvement in conditions and were assigned to the favorable cluster of gf a for the reasons discussed earlier however the main point is the equal values of gf a and igf a of the drinking water use in the high altitude sub basins i e 7 13 12 14 11 10 16 and 15 this indicates that the chemical pollutants did not exceed the permissible limit and the dependence of igf a only on the quantity of groundwater resources in these sub basins the improvement of gf a also improved the igf a index of the drinking water use in the central sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin all sub basins have either improved or remained stable in their former cluster for the irrigation water use the igf a indices of most sub basins throughout the basin such as sub basin 2 isfahan borkhar have been transferred from critical to favorable cluster with the proper management of irrigation uses except for sub basins 6 and 8 which have remained constant in their cluster as the largest consumer of groundwater resources in the zayandeh rood basin agriculture significantly impacts on aquifers sustainability changes kamrani et al 2020 in 2016 with the increase in the use of applying modern irrigation systems and the reduction of water withdrawal in the irrigation water use most of the basin s aquifers are more sustainable than before for instance the land use map of sub basin 7 demonstrates irrigation consumption decreases however sub basins 6 and 8 which have a more critical situation in 2016 than in 2006 unlike other sub basins have not seen a significant change in their water consumption especially the high volume of irrigation withdrawal for example najaf abad irrigation withdrawal is more than 900 mcm in both years because unfortunately in sub basin 6 the farms area increased in 2016 therefore during these ten years abundant water withdrawal and precipitation reduction have caused a drop of 14 and 11 m in the water level in aquifers 6 and 8 respectively domestic and industrial water uses have not impacted basin s aquifers changes it should be noted lack of control and reduction of groundwater resources withdrawal to supply irrigation water in sub basins such as sub basins 6 8 and 9 will significantly increase the pressure on the aquifer moreover with the increase of phosphate nitrogen fertilizers and improper drainage and wastewater discharge into water bodies the concentration of chemical parameters has increased resulting in water quality reduction in 2016 3 3 evaluation of surface water footprint indices the values of the sf a and isf a indices for 2006 and 2016 are shown in table 7 in almost all study sub basins the isf a and sf a values for drinking water and irrigation water uses are equal for each sub basin according to eq 4 this indicates the absence of chemical pollution in the study sub basins and the effect of quantity stress on isf a of the drinking water and irrigation water uses on the other hand the very long distance of the isf a index of the drinking water use in sub basin 1 koohpayeh from the allowable limit despite the small amount of quantity stress indicates serious chemical problems high area of pollution and various pollutants in this basin due to the entry of municipal industrial and agricultural effluents however this index has been adjusted in the irrigation water use showing more compatibility with the region s irrigation needs comparing the sf a and isf a values in 2006 and 2016 shows that in all study sub basins except for 9 lenjanat 15 yan cheshmeh and 12 booeen miandasht which exerted a decrease in the indices due to major withdrawals and effective changes in the amount of surface inflows and outflows during the study period the sf a index has improved which in turn has led to an improvement in isf a in both drinking water and irrigation water uses it should be noted that calculating the average value of the indices over the whole basin has been reported only for the overall evaluation of the quality and quantity of water resources in the zayandeh rood basin although the average isf a values for drinking water and irrigation water use over the whole basin have improved from 3 8 and 2 4 in 2006 to 3 3 and 2 in 2016 respectively it still indicates poor water quality in the zayandeh rood basin even improving the sf a index from 2 2 to 1 8 cannot change the unfavorable water quality conditions fig 7 compares the sf a and isf a indices of the drinking water and irrigation water uses 3 4 clustering of surface water footprint indices table 8 and fig 8 show the clustering results of surface water indices fig 8 shows that sub basins with geographically close to each other exert relatively similar behaviors according to fig 8 only sub basins 3 5 11 and 13 were removed from the critical cluster of sf a in 2016 due to the control and reduction of surface water outflow according to official reports of surface water balance zayandab consulting engineers co iran 2016 also sub basins 3 and 5 rely on groundwater to meet their needs without much surface water withdrawal according to table 9 comprehensible monitoring of the whole basin and study sub basins condition is obtained in the study period with the help of the spatial clustering approach unfortunately in 2006 no sub basins had good water quantity conditions and only sub basins 10 9 and 1 had non critical conditions for example sub basin 14 damane daran is one of the western and relatively high altitude sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin which can be cultivated as rain fed due to the benefit of natural snow reserves and surface water resources in 2016 rainfed cultivation decreased with decreasing rainfall and subsequently surface water resources withdrawal increased on the other hand this year with a significant decrease in surface water outflow although sf a of the sub basin improved from 1 6 to 1 2 this sub basin has remained in the unfavorable cluster the study results show that using spatial clustering and water resources sustainability studies provides water resources managers with a comprehensive view to have a correct understanding of basin conditions for long term policy making to improve water resources conditions proportional to the region s capacity this approach saves time and money for managers and researchers by preventing studies and projects with short term effectiveness and limited to only a part of the basin problems it should be noted that the effective and efficient study of water resources sustainability requires the selection of appropriate and comprehensive indices the sf a and isf a indices presented in this study and gf a and igf a indices provide an integrated view of the basin 4 implications and limitations by using the proposed approach in this research it is possible to know the status of quantity and quality of surface and groundwater resources in different parts of the river basins this information helps a lot in effective planning and management of each sub basin as well as the entire watershed the most important application of these results is the prioritization of sub basins based on the criticality of their water resources condition according to these results managers and decision makers can design long term and short term plans to solve the problems also this approach can address some important points and questions is the main problem of each study area is related to water quantity or water quality which water sources are more important in each sub basin surface water sources or groundwater based on the answers to these questions many development plans can be defined for each part of the river basin which greatly contributes to the social welfare and health of the residents of each region one of the most important results of this study is helping to provide construction and agricultural plans in accordance with the water resource capacity of the watershed and the main problem of each study area for example according to the water resource capacity of each study area it is possible to decide whether the development of service projects or the development of agricultural activities is better which plants with what water demand are suitable for cultivation in the study area are they resistant to salt and other chemical parameters or not what industries can be set up in this basin industries with high water demand such as steel factories or service and administrative offices is there a need to build a dam and spend a lot of money on this basin or not in addition by examining the results of the present approach the effectiveness of the implemented projects during the study period is fully determined however this study has also some limitations need to be addressed in the further work incomplete information and lack of data are important limitations which could lead to the uncertain results especially in some areas it was not possible to access information due to security and political issues although it has been tried to validate the results with current situation of different sub basins one of the solutions for this limitation is the using of computing and software techniques for modelling and forecasting the water resources data rajaee et al 2019 pandey et al 2020 afan et al 2021 band et al 2021 gholami et al 2015 taormina et al 2012 5 conclusion with increasing stresses in the quantity and quality of water resources around the world indices for assessing the sustainability of water resources have become more needed than ever especially indices that can simultaneously assess the quality and quantity of water resources the present study introduces sf a and isf a along with gf a and igf a to examine the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater resources in 2006 and 2016 and their clustering using k means clustering in the sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin iran the results of the indicators of each sector groundwater and surface water as well as their clustering results were compared in the studied years by combining the results of surface water and groundwater assessments as complementary a broad perspective can be provided to users this work investigates the situation of basins with the help of sustainability indices and spatial monitoring using various analysis tools such as land use mapping this can be a significant step toward conducting spatial planning studies based on water resources thus comprehensive results are obtained for managing study basins regarding their quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater furthermore the proposed comprehensive view leads to identifying the main harmful or improving factors in the state of water resources and implementing appropriate action for example sub basins 6 and 8 which their water need often met by groundwater resources in 2016 have still been in critical conditions in terms of water quantity and water quality of groundwater resources due to not reducing the water withdrawal also in sub basin 9 which has sufficient surface and groundwater resources due to the increase in agricultural activities on the bank of the zayandeh rood river the quality of water resources has become critical and worse than before water use management especially in the irrigation water use is one of the main factors known for surface water and groundwater sustainability this study showed the effects of quality and quantity stresses of water resources on each other and their results on the sustainability of surface water groundwater in the basin for example although the high altitude areas of the basin such as sub basins 14 15 and 16 have abundant surface water resources and are often free of chemicals significant surface water withdrawals in these areas make their isf a values in the critical cluster due to the water shortage stress with the help of the results of the current approach especially spatial clustering watershed managers and decision makers can make comprehensive decisions with a long term and sustainable approach at different scales of the basins they can also prioritize problem solving based on different spatial segments of the basin quality challenges or quantity challenges of surface water groundwater resources finally it is suggested to use the fuzzy clustering method to increase the accuracy of the results in future studies in fact due to the variability and uncertainty of some parameters using fuzzy mathematics could enhance the clustering results also the proposed methodology can be applied for future conditions if predictions of climate models are provided credit authorship contribution statement soheila najafi neysiani investigation methodology software

2750,the lack of an integrated approach to assess the quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater resources undesirably affects their sustainability and errors in users decisions in the optimal development of basins therefore to help to solve the problem of water resources sustainability assessment in various parts of the basin for the first time this article has presented a practical approach for the temporal spatial evaluation of surface water and groundwater resources the method presented in this study is based on investigating the behavior of sustainability indicators for surface water and groundwater in different years and separately for the sub basins and aquifers evaluation of water quality and quantity criteria provides the main components of the proposed approach using spatial clustering water quality and quantity evaluations were implemented focusing on drinking water and irrigation water uses in all sub basins of the zayandeh rood river basin in iran for the years 2006 and 2016 using groundwater footprint gf and integrated groundwater footprint igf the gf to area ratios gf a in the first and last years of the study period were 1 1 and 0 8 respectively while the igf a values were 8 9 and 7 3 in the drinking water use and 1 3 and 1 1 in the irrigation water use respectively in order to apply a perspective in investigating the sustainability of the basin surface water footprint sf and integrated surface water footprint isf indices are introduced in this study for the first time the sf a values in the study period were 2 2 and 1 8 respectively the isf a values were 3 8 and 3 3 in the drinking water use and 2 4 and 2 in the irrigation water use for 2006 and 2016 respectively values greater than or equal to one in the above indicators indicate water resources critical and unsustainable state the comparison of groundwater and surface water indices shows that despite the slight improvement of the average values of the indices in the whole basin some sub basins are still in critical condition therefore by using the k means algorithm the sub basins were clustered into three categories favorable unfavorable and critical in the mentioned years finally this research provides spatial planning based on water resources which provides a comprehensive approach to maintaining the sustainability of basin water resources proportional to each sub basin s capacity and baseline status in this way the factors affecting the status of the basin the effect of the plans implemented in previous years and the main priority of each sub basin to solve its problems are identified this information leads to the best planning for the sustainability of water resources and increasing social welfare based on the water

increasing population expanding agriculture and rural activities changing climate patterns and ensuring water supply during droughts have increased water demand in many parts of the world ahmed et al 2019 khan et al 2019 ardıçlıoglu and kuriqi 2019 this has posed a severe challenge to water managers and researchers around the world also the allocation of significant water resources to agriculture has put much pressure on rivers and aquifers accounting for 70 of the world s surface water and groundwater resources flammini et al 2014 kamrani et al 2020 achieng and zhu 2021 as an example of arid and semi arid countries agriculture in iran consumes 90 of the total allocated water moreover the negative water balance of groundwater due to over extraction from aquifers surface water transfer and droughts have caused severe water stress on iranian wetlands unfortunately iran s water resources are in critical condition according to the falkenmark water stress index moridi 2017 therefore integrated water resources management of around the world has become essential today as a result planning to improve the condition of the basins is essential due to their quantitative and qualitative potential indeed sustainable water resources management should be one of the top priorities of any water resources management system kourgialas et al 2018 furthermore development plans should also be considered as criteria for sustainable development considering social economic and environmental aspects abedzadeh et al 2020 water resources studies often fall into two general categories water quantity evaluation chiu et al 2020 luo et al 2020 faro et al 2019 wang et al 2020 and water quality evaluation al omran et al 2015 hoekstra et al 2011 mladenović ranisavljević and zerajic 2018 schoumans et al 2014 for example ramadan et al 2019 evaluated the quantity of water resources in the eastern nile basin and the demands of 11 african countries participating in the nile river water using different scenarios also some researchers have studied the relationship between land use and its impacts on water quality shrestha et al 2018 gu et al 2019 kawo and karuppannan 2018 investigated the status of drinking and irrigation water quality of ethiopia using zoning of groundwater data kawo and karuppannan 2018 this approach can hardly solve the challenges of sustainable water resources management some researchers have considered the quality and quantity of water resources separately or together ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 jia et al 2020 wang et al 2019 kourgialas et al 2018 for given an example cao et al 2021 presented the quantity and quality for water yield equivalent qqwye index to evaluate water resources in the upstream reservoir basin in china which provided more reliable results lin 2020 conducted a combined assessment of the quality and quantity of ethiopian aquifers with the help of the integrated groundwater footprint igf index in the zoning of the basin and reported this approach as a method for improving the macro water resources policy policy making from a comprehensive approach provides an aspect of spatial planning based on water resources for sustainable management at the basin level which can assess the condition of water resources in the basin using study area zoning as a branch of data mining spatial clustering is one of the most widely used methods for zoning studies data mining is exploring and analyzing large amounts of data utilizing supervised and unsupervised tools for discovering meaningful patterns and rules among data clustering is one of the standard techniques in data mining which has many applications due to the lack of need for previous knowledge about the problem for instance clustering in water science is often used to study and demonstrate the physical and chemical status of water resources in the study area to aid in modeling and to predict hydrological observations aytaç 2020 and risk assessment javadi et al 2020 wang et al 2020 rahmani et al 2019 using classical and fuzzy clustering javadi et al 2020 prepared the risk map of the qazvin aquifer in iran and showed that agricultural and industrial regions cover 70 of the areas with a high risk of chemical pollution aytaç 2020 spatially clustered the western basins of the black sea in turkey into eight clusters based on the hydrological response unit hru facilitating work for water researchers in future studies researchers have not paid much attention to spatial clustering in assessing the sustainability of water resources and it has often been used in the study of water quality and hydrological characteristics of basins at the same time this method can provide practical and effective results therefore the present study aims to evaluate the changes in the quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater resources of the zayandeh rood basin in two time steps 2006 2016 using spatial clustering of integrated surface water and groundwater footprints considering the importance of a comprehensive assessment this study introduces a new approach using the evaluation indices and clustering as one of the most widely used unsupervised pattern recognition methods besides to integrate the indices used for surface water and groundwater surface water footprint sf and integrated surface water footprint isf have been introduced for the first time simultaneous study of the surface and groundwater of a region can help the proper exploitation of the water resources abdolvandi et al 2013 accordingly the objectives of the present study are a assessment of groundwater sustainability in terms of integrated groundwater footprint for drinking water and irrigation water in 2006 and 2016 then comparing groundwater sustainability based on indicators calculated in the studied years b introducing and assessing a new index to evaluate the sustainability of surface water resources in terms of integrated surface water footprint for drinking water and irrigation then comparing surface water sustainability based on indicators calculated in the studied years c clustering calculated groundwater and surface water indices spatially in the zayandeh rood area aquifers and sub basins respectively and comparing spatial changes in sub basins to implement water management guidelines therefore the results of this novel approach can be used on a scale ranging from study subfields to national studies on drinking water industrial water and irrigation water uses around the world in fact the proposed methodology provides practical results and appropriate analysis for the sustainable management of river basins according to the capacity of water resources such a comprehensive approach is a great goal for water resources researchers which includes practical factors related to quantity and quality of water resources 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the zayandeh rood river basin with 16 sub basins and an area of 26 864 km2 is part of the gavkhooni watershed in the central plateau of iran the zayandeh rood basin is one of the most strategic basins in iran politically socially and economically in addition to supplying water to thousands of hectares of agricultural land it supplies drinking water to residents of four provinces in whole or in part and industries generally the zayandeh rood basin has an arid and semi arid climate but the western and northwestern parts of the basin are mountainous regions and the zayandeh rood river originates from these regions it should be noted that basin s river flow comes from mountainous areas heights and plains cover about 43 8 and 56 of the basin area respectively while the zayandeh rood dam lake constitutes 0 2 of the basin area ministry of energy of islamic republic of iran 2016 zayandab consulting engineers co iran 2016 fig 1 depicts the location of the zayandeh rood basin and its sub basins as part of the gavkhooni watershed the maximum and minimum transmissivity coefficients are in sub basin 14 damane daran with 2950 m2 day and sub basin 6 najaf abad with 11 m2 day respectively also the maximum aquifer storage coefficient is 26 7 in sub basin 2 isfahan borkhar and the minimum is negligible in sub basin 1 koohpayeh moreover the maximum saturated thickness of the aquifer is 136 5 m in sub basin 2 isfahan borkhar and the minimum is 32 m in sub basin 10 ben saman therefore according to discharge gradation and thickness the zayandeh rood basin aquifers yield is divided into three categories a weak aquifer yield aquifers 3 and 5 b average aquifer yield aquifers 1 4 7 9 10 11 12 13 15 and 16 and c strong aquifer yield aquifers 2 6 8 and 14 eventually aquifer 6 najaf abad has a robust yield ministry of energy of islamic republic of iran 2016 zayandab consulting engineers co iran 2016 most of the zayandeh rood basin s plains such as meymeh 5 moorcheh khort 3 carvan 7 and mahyar 8 are graben type and some others like najaf abad 6 are syncline type moreover ben saman 10 chehel khaneh 13 yan cheshmeh 15 and chelgerd 16 sub basins plains are generally created alongside fault line valleys and according to their erosion rate waterways are created in the mentioned plains the area and thickness of alluvium are limited the lenjanat 9 plain is structurally an anticline with a northwest southeast nw se strik also its strik is eroded koohpayeh 1 plain gavkhooni wetland and most parts of isfahan borkhar 2 and najaf abad 6 plains are peneplains from the perspective of groundwater quality most aquifers are chlorine type and bicarbonate type aquifers are found in the western part of the zayandeh rood basin it should be added that just tiny parts of aquifers 6 9 and 5 are sulfate type aquifers ministry of energy of islamic republic of iran 2016 also aquifer 8 mahyar with an average of 118 m has the deepest water level on the other hand the shallowest water level 65 m is on the border of aquifer 6 overall zayandeh rood basin s aquifers from the northwest to the southeast the water level of aquifers is decreasing ministry of energy of islamic republic of iran 2016 zareian 2021 fig 2 shows the flowchart of this study the main stage is the collection of relevant data due to the large volume of information required qualitative and quantitative data in 2006 and 2016 were collected for all sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin table 1 according to fig 2 this study included three main stages data collection and initial processing calculations interpretation and conclusion the steps of conducting this study were as follows i it was decided to use the groundwater footprint index gf and igf by examining the evaluation criteria of water resources ii the required data of the study years were collected from the relevant organizations and official reports iii after completing the studies on the primary indices and priorities of surface water sf and isf indices were developed to integrate the approaches and interpretations iv surface water data and information required were collected v the thresholds of schoeller and wilcox were determined to calculate igf and isf vi after calculating gf igf sf and isf in the drinking water and irrigation water use for the study years separately for all sub basins maps were created in the arcgis environment to provide an overview of the status of the study basin and sub basins and their changes in the study period vii the four indices were clustered for both years and all sub basins and their maps were created in the arcgis environment viii it was necessary to have land use maps in the study years to confirm the results of clustering and interpretations of the last stage that was received from the relevant organizations ix the values of the indices were compared and interpreted with the help of the maps of the calculation stage it was necessary to verify the results of the interpretation with the official reports of the relevant organizations land use maps and documents x similar in the previous step the results and spatial clustering maps were compared xi after reviewing analyzing and interpreting the maps the impact of various factors on the stability of surface and groundwater resources was well determined finally it should be noted that in cases where data are not available or have little accuracy climatic models can be used which fortunately the number of climate models used to estimate the current and future hydrological conditions continues to increase achieng and zhu 2019 in order to ensure the accuracy of the data official reports approved by iran s ministry of energy have been used and the last official report was presented in 2016 on the one hand from 2006 to 2016 considerable changes and developments have occurredin the zayandeh rood basin becuase industrial and agricultural activities have significantly increased moreover in these two years comprehensive and complete surveys have been carried out which helpthe engineers to applying these data in their relevent researches it should be mentioned that the studies for each sub basin were examined separately still due to the unavailability of the land use map of 2006 this map was prepared by remote sensing in the zayandeh rood basin and was analyzed for each sub basin by arcgis software 2 2 groundwater and surface water footprint indices gf is proposed to study the environmental sustainability of groundwater tork et al 2021 as indicated by eq 1 in table 2 kourgialas et al 2018 also presented the igf index to create a decision making tool that considers groundwater resources quality and quantity eq 2 in table 2 it should be noted that the e parameter was considered drainage in the gf formula by gleeson and wada 2012 however aquifer evaporation was added to this parameter in the present study to integrate the basin zoning studies we presented sf and isf indices on average the withdrawal of more than 20 of renewable water resources put much pressure on water resources while more than 40 of withdrawals create critical conditions fao 2011 therefore considering a critical threshold and a similar concept of groundwater indices eqs 3 and 4 in table 2 were introduced for sf and isf the dimensions of r e and c in sf and gf formulas are l3 t and their units are mcm year a represents the area with a unit of km2 aquifer area in groundwater studies and sub basin area in surface water studies therefore the dimensions of gf igf sf and isf indices are l2 with the unit of km2 and gf a igf a sf a and isf a indices are dimensionless it should be noted that c annual withdrawals in surface water formulas include interbasin water transfer surface water discharge downstream and water withdrawal for domestic industrial and irrigation use r recharge sources consists of the return water from uses drainage and wastewater and total surface water that includes plains and mountain runoff surface water discharge downstream and interbasin water transfer e also represents lakes evaporation the water stress sf a and gf a is obtained by dividing the indices of table 2 by area a larger and equal values to one included in this study while they were not defined in the literature indicate the critical condition of water resources and values less than one indicate its sustainability gleeson and wada 2012 water quantity indices express water shortage stress while integrated indices show the effect of quantity and quality on each other for example a higher isf indicates surface water resources with quality and or quantity stress and ultimately its unfavorable sustainability for water quality monitoring of irrigation and drinking water resources idw interpolation technique and thiessen polygonization technique in the arcgis software environment were used respectively and through this areas including more chemical parameters were calculated idw is one of the most popular types of deterministic methods for multivariate interpolation with a known scattered set of points acceptable thresholds of the schoeller for drinking purposes and wilcox for irrigation according to the general cultivation in the study area are listed in table 3 2 3 k means clustering of groundwater and surface water indices a cluster is a group of data with the most similarity k means technique works based on randomly selecting a point as the data center and finally calculating the distance of the data from the center of the cluster to reach the minimum distance and actually maximum similarity hashemy and monem 2012 some benefits of applying k means method are relatively simple to implement and scales to large data sets guarantees convergence and generalizes to clusters of different shapes and sizes such as elliptical clusters the distance criterion in the k means technique is the mahalanobis distance this distance was introduced by mahalanobis in 1936 feil 2006 and is defined as eq 5 for two data x and v 5 d 2 x v x v t m 1 x v where m represents the covariance matrix and t represents the vector transpose the k means clustering technique uses the davis and boldin validation index idb idb is a criterion based on the internal scattering and the distance between the clusters by separating n samples into g clusters in the classical and non fuzzy clustering method eq 6 shows the db index between the two clusters created 6 r jk σ j σ k μ j μ k j k 1 2 g k j where μj is the average distances of all samples located in the cluster j and σj is the amount of internal scattering of the cluster which is obtained from eq 7 7 σ j 1 n j x i c j x i μ j 2 where cj is a set of samples belonging to cluster j and nj is the number of its samples when the distance between two clusters is large and the internal scattering of the clusters is minimal the value of rjk reaches its lowest value idb is equal to the mean of rj where rj is the maximum distance of rjk obtained from comparing cluster j with other clusters eqs 8 and 9 8 r j max k 1 2 g k j r jk 9 i db 1 g i 1 g r j 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of groundwater footprint indices table 4 shows that during the study period many sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin have improved in terms of groundwater stress gf a status although in slight amounts and only sub basins 8 mahyar and 6 najaf abad have suffered more water shortage stress also only these two sub basins and sub basin 9 lenjanat have experienced poorer quality in the drinking water and irrigation water use despite the improvement of the gf a index the unfavorable value of igf a for the drinking water use of the lenjanat basin indicates a decline in the quality of drinking water of this sub basin in 2016 at the same time the favorable value of igf a in the irrigation water use indicates the appropriate amount of chemical parameters in the irrigation water of this sub basin with a decrease in withdrawal in 2016 sub basins 2 isfahan borkhar 3 moorcheh khort 4 alavije dahaqh and 5 meymeh also found a similar situation to lenjanat in the drinking water use equal values of gf a and igf a in the irrigation water use of these sub basins show that no pollutants have exceeded the allowable limit and the pollution components of eq 2 are zero although withdrawal is only one of the components of calculating the gf and igf it remarkably affects their values according to official statistics likewise withdrawal reduction in sub basins 11 chadegan 12 booeen miandasht 13 chehel khaneh and 14 damane daran which are located in the highlands of the basin and have abundant natural reserves of snow and rain has led to an improvement in their gf a and igf a values in 2016 and only a minimal number of pollutants remained in these sub basins ministry of energy of islamic republic of iran 2016 finally in 2016 although the quantity and average gf a in the whole basin improved from 1 1 to 0 8 due to the decrease in aquifer withdrawal especially in the irrigation use in many study sub basins its value is still close to one and has a critical situation the average igf a value in the irrigation water and drinking water uses also changed from 1 3 and 8 9 to 1 1 and 7 3 respectively indicating the severe stress of aquifer water quality in the drinking water use the spatial distribution of the calculated indices is illustrated in fig 3 3 2 clustering of groundwater quantity and quality indices a total of two three and four clusters in the spatial zoning of the gf a and igf a indices were investigated by the k means method and using matlab according to the idb values the three cluster mode was selected for further analysis thus the values from zero to one favorable values were assigned to the first cluster while those equal to and greater than one were assigned to unfavorable or critical clusters it should be noted that the smaller the idb value the more reliable the clustering performed which is shown in table 5 for the gf a and igf a indices the spatial zoning of the gf a igf a indices in the drinking water use and igf a in the irrigation water use are shown in fig 4 in contrast the spatial evaluation of the clustering results is presented in table 6 sub basins 2 3 4 5 6 and 8 in the eastern and central parts of the basin which are located at low altitude grounds and do not or slightly benefit from the presence of the zayandeh rood river rely on groundwater to meet the drinking water industrial water and irrigation water needs in the gf a clustering in 2006 they are identified in the unfavorable group where sub basin 3 moorche khort is located in the critical cluster although sub basin 1 koohpayeh covers the zayandeh rood river completely this causes much pollution of surface water resources due to the transfer of effluents from irrigation domestic and industrial activities of the upstream sub basins which infiltrates the aquifer and creates a critical situation for this sub basin ministry of energy of islamic republic of iran 2016 safavi et al 2016 the western and high altitude sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin which have more withdrawal from surface water resources include sub basins 16 chelgerd 10 ben saman 15 yan cheshmeh 11 chadegan 13 chehel khaneh 14 damane daran 12 booeen miandasht 7 carvan and 9 lenjanat and are clustered in the favorable group in the water quantity zoning of the aquifer other sub basins with gf a values are very close to one however the non fuzzy clustering approach is categorized as unfavorable and has improved over the study period analyzing the results of indices and factors causing changes in the basin is one of the essential aspects of quantity and quality evaluation of water resources which leads to recognizing harmful or improving factors of the status of water resources and thus sustainable development of the basin this approach helps researchers and exploiters in spatial planning based on water resources in the basin influential factors in analyzing the values of indices are precipitation infiltration withdrawal aquifer hydrographs and land use which well clarify the basin s conditions kourgialas et al 2018 fig 5 shows the changes in aquifer withdrawal for the irrigation water use during the study period indicating the effects of the irrigation water use on the sustainability of groundwater resources and aquifer level drop for example sub basins 7 14 and 11 and many others are located in favorable clusters in 2016 by decreasing the irrigation withdrawal fig 6 shows the land use map of sub basin 7 at the beginning and end of the study period as an example central brown areas indicating pastures and agricultural lands have declined sharply in 2016 sub basin 7 caravan in 2016 experienced a better situation than in 2006 with the reduction of irrigation water to 13 according to table 6 unlike sub basin 7 sub basin 6 najaf abad has created critical conditions for the quantity and quality of aquifers by the lack of proper managing increasing withdrawals and reducing rainfall in the basin area of farms equipped with pressurized irrigation systems which reduce the amount of returned water to zero has increased kamrani et al 2020 so on the one hand they prevent the reduction of withdrawal on the other hand return water and aquifer recharge are reduced sub basin 8 has a similar process to sub basin 6 and both have been assigned to the critical cluster of the gf a index the western and high altitude sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin show the improvement in conditions and were assigned to the favorable cluster of gf a for the reasons discussed earlier however the main point is the equal values of gf a and igf a of the drinking water use in the high altitude sub basins i e 7 13 12 14 11 10 16 and 15 this indicates that the chemical pollutants did not exceed the permissible limit and the dependence of igf a only on the quantity of groundwater resources in these sub basins the improvement of gf a also improved the igf a index of the drinking water use in the central sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin all sub basins have either improved or remained stable in their former cluster for the irrigation water use the igf a indices of most sub basins throughout the basin such as sub basin 2 isfahan borkhar have been transferred from critical to favorable cluster with the proper management of irrigation uses except for sub basins 6 and 8 which have remained constant in their cluster as the largest consumer of groundwater resources in the zayandeh rood basin agriculture significantly impacts on aquifers sustainability changes kamrani et al 2020 in 2016 with the increase in the use of applying modern irrigation systems and the reduction of water withdrawal in the irrigation water use most of the basin s aquifers are more sustainable than before for instance the land use map of sub basin 7 demonstrates irrigation consumption decreases however sub basins 6 and 8 which have a more critical situation in 2016 than in 2006 unlike other sub basins have not seen a significant change in their water consumption especially the high volume of irrigation withdrawal for example najaf abad irrigation withdrawal is more than 900 mcm in both years because unfortunately in sub basin 6 the farms area increased in 2016 therefore during these ten years abundant water withdrawal and precipitation reduction have caused a drop of 14 and 11 m in the water level in aquifers 6 and 8 respectively domestic and industrial water uses have not impacted basin s aquifers changes it should be noted lack of control and reduction of groundwater resources withdrawal to supply irrigation water in sub basins such as sub basins 6 8 and 9 will significantly increase the pressure on the aquifer moreover with the increase of phosphate nitrogen fertilizers and improper drainage and wastewater discharge into water bodies the concentration of chemical parameters has increased resulting in water quality reduction in 2016 3 3 evaluation of surface water footprint indices the values of the sf a and isf a indices for 2006 and 2016 are shown in table 7 in almost all study sub basins the isf a and sf a values for drinking water and irrigation water uses are equal for each sub basin according to eq 4 this indicates the absence of chemical pollution in the study sub basins and the effect of quantity stress on isf a of the drinking water and irrigation water uses on the other hand the very long distance of the isf a index of the drinking water use in sub basin 1 koohpayeh from the allowable limit despite the small amount of quantity stress indicates serious chemical problems high area of pollution and various pollutants in this basin due to the entry of municipal industrial and agricultural effluents however this index has been adjusted in the irrigation water use showing more compatibility with the region s irrigation needs comparing the sf a and isf a values in 2006 and 2016 shows that in all study sub basins except for 9 lenjanat 15 yan cheshmeh and 12 booeen miandasht which exerted a decrease in the indices due to major withdrawals and effective changes in the amount of surface inflows and outflows during the study period the sf a index has improved which in turn has led to an improvement in isf a in both drinking water and irrigation water uses it should be noted that calculating the average value of the indices over the whole basin has been reported only for the overall evaluation of the quality and quantity of water resources in the zayandeh rood basin although the average isf a values for drinking water and irrigation water use over the whole basin have improved from 3 8 and 2 4 in 2006 to 3 3 and 2 in 2016 respectively it still indicates poor water quality in the zayandeh rood basin even improving the sf a index from 2 2 to 1 8 cannot change the unfavorable water quality conditions fig 7 compares the sf a and isf a indices of the drinking water and irrigation water uses 3 4 clustering of surface water footprint indices table 8 and fig 8 show the clustering results of surface water indices fig 8 shows that sub basins with geographically close to each other exert relatively similar behaviors according to fig 8 only sub basins 3 5 11 and 13 were removed from the critical cluster of sf a in 2016 due to the control and reduction of surface water outflow according to official reports of surface water balance zayandab consulting engineers co iran 2016 also sub basins 3 and 5 rely on groundwater to meet their needs without much surface water withdrawal according to table 9 comprehensible monitoring of the whole basin and study sub basins condition is obtained in the study period with the help of the spatial clustering approach unfortunately in 2006 no sub basins had good water quantity conditions and only sub basins 10 9 and 1 had non critical conditions for example sub basin 14 damane daran is one of the western and relatively high altitude sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin which can be cultivated as rain fed due to the benefit of natural snow reserves and surface water resources in 2016 rainfed cultivation decreased with decreasing rainfall and subsequently surface water resources withdrawal increased on the other hand this year with a significant decrease in surface water outflow although sf a of the sub basin improved from 1 6 to 1 2 this sub basin has remained in the unfavorable cluster the study results show that using spatial clustering and water resources sustainability studies provides water resources managers with a comprehensive view to have a correct understanding of basin conditions for long term policy making to improve water resources conditions proportional to the region s capacity this approach saves time and money for managers and researchers by preventing studies and projects with short term effectiveness and limited to only a part of the basin problems it should be noted that the effective and efficient study of water resources sustainability requires the selection of appropriate and comprehensive indices the sf a and isf a indices presented in this study and gf a and igf a indices provide an integrated view of the basin 4 implications and limitations by using the proposed approach in this research it is possible to know the status of quantity and quality of surface and groundwater resources in different parts of the river basins this information helps a lot in effective planning and management of each sub basin as well as the entire watershed the most important application of these results is the prioritization of sub basins based on the criticality of their water resources condition according to these results managers and decision makers can design long term and short term plans to solve the problems also this approach can address some important points and questions is the main problem of each study area is related to water quantity or water quality which water sources are more important in each sub basin surface water sources or groundwater based on the answers to these questions many development plans can be defined for each part of the river basin which greatly contributes to the social welfare and health of the residents of each region one of the most important results of this study is helping to provide construction and agricultural plans in accordance with the water resource capacity of the watershed and the main problem of each study area for example according to the water resource capacity of each study area it is possible to decide whether the development of service projects or the development of agricultural activities is better which plants with what water demand are suitable for cultivation in the study area are they resistant to salt and other chemical parameters or not what industries can be set up in this basin industries with high water demand such as steel factories or service and administrative offices is there a need to build a dam and spend a lot of money on this basin or not in addition by examining the results of the present approach the effectiveness of the implemented projects during the study period is fully determined however this study has also some limitations need to be addressed in the further work incomplete information and lack of data are important limitations which could lead to the uncertain results especially in some areas it was not possible to access information due to security and political issues although it has been tried to validate the results with current situation of different sub basins one of the solutions for this limitation is the using of computing and software techniques for modelling and forecasting the water resources data rajaee et al 2019 pandey et al 2020 afan et al 2021 band et al 2021 gholami et al 2015 taormina et al 2012 5 conclusion with increasing stresses in the quantity and quality of water resources around the world indices for assessing the sustainability of water resources have become more needed than ever especially indices that can simultaneously assess the quality and quantity of water resources the present study introduces sf a and isf a along with gf a and igf a to examine the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater resources in 2006 and 2016 and their clustering using k means clustering in the sub basins of the zayandeh rood basin iran the results of the indicators of each sector groundwater and surface water as well as their clustering results were compared in the studied years by combining the results of surface water and groundwater assessments as complementary a broad perspective can be provided to users this work investigates the situation of basins with the help of sustainability indices and spatial monitoring using various analysis tools such as land use mapping this can be a significant step toward conducting spatial planning studies based on water resources thus comprehensive results are obtained for managing study basins regarding their quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater furthermore the proposed comprehensive view leads to identifying the main harmful or improving factors in the state of water resources and implementing appropriate action for example sub basins 6 and 8 which their water need often met by groundwater resources in 2016 have still been in critical conditions in terms of water quantity and water quality of groundwater resources due to not reducing the water withdrawal also in sub basin 9 which has sufficient surface and groundwater resources due to the increase in agricultural activities on the bank of the zayandeh rood river the quality of water resources has become critical and worse than before water use management especially in the irrigation water use is one of the main factors known for surface water and groundwater sustainability this study showed the effects of quality and quantity stresses of water resources on each other and their results on the sustainability of surface water groundwater in the basin for example although the high altitude areas of the basin such as sub basins 14 15 and 16 have abundant surface water resources and are often free of chemicals significant surface water withdrawals in these areas make their isf a values in the critical cluster due to the water shortage stress with the help of the results of the current approach especially spatial clustering watershed managers and decision makers can make comprehensive decisions with a long term and sustainable approach at different scales of the basins they can also prioritize problem solving based on different spatial segments of the basin quality challenges or quantity challenges of surface water groundwater resources finally it is suggested to use the fuzzy clustering method to increase the accuracy of the results in future studies in fact due to the variability and uncertainty of some parameters using fuzzy mathematics could enhance the clustering results also the proposed methodology can be applied for future conditions if predictions of climate models are provided credit authorship contribution statement soheila najafi neysiani investigation methodology software

2751,confluences are widespread in natural rivers where pollutants sediment and fish tend to accumulate especially separation zone and studying their three dimensional 3d structure can provide guidance for improving river environmental health in the current study a flume experiment was conducted and a 3d confluence model was built three turbulent models were compared based on the experimental results which confirmed the applicability of the rng k ε model the effects of junction angles and flow ratios on the formation and evolution of secondary flow and separation zone were investigated by the established model the results indicated that the separation zone with low flow velocity high turbulence kinetic energy and low pressure is formed downstream of the junction while two secondary flows form on the sides of the shear plane downstream the shapes of the separation zone and secondary flow at the confluence were defined in a new way the secondary flow formation process is reversed within the separation zone and highly complicated when the junction angle and flow ratio change this study can provide a scientific basis for the utilization of confluences to improve water quality and aquatic animal ecology at natural river confluences keywords confluence secondary flow separation zone turbulent kinetic energy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river confluences are usually characterized with complex hydrodynamics which are the primary nodes and critical features of river systems a confluence is often associated

ginney 2001 rice et al 2006 shen et al 2016 in addition understanding the flow patterns at confluences is of major practical significance because they affect the supersaturated total dissolved gas downstream of high dams shen et al 2016 2019 2021 some hypotheses have been proposed regarding the topographic changes at confluence including large flow velocities strong turbulence shear layer

rhoads 2015 and three dimensional 3d models e g wang et al 2008 in these studies turbulence is represented with the standard k ε model mcguirk and rodi 1979 the rng k ε model bradbrook et al 2001 the k ω model huang et al 2002 zhang et al 2009 the rsm model liang and huai 2008 and the les model by ramos et al 2019a here we compared three turbulence models for asymmetric junctions in section 3 2 the occurrence of helical cells at confluences has been attributed to the unbalanced between centrifugal force and pressure gradient forces which is similar to the generation of helical motion in meander bends rhoads 2020 yuan et al 2022 secondary flow can change the distribution of velocity and shear stress thus affecting the exchange and transport of energy momentum heat and mass in the flow field yan et al 2011 vinuesa et al 2015 chen et al 2017 vinuesa et al 2018 jing et al 2020 prandtl 1953 divided the secondary flows into two types the first is caused by transverse pressure gradient in meandering rivers the second type exists in the straight open channel and is caused by the anisotropy of reynolds shear stress colombini 1993 lane et al 2000 studied the representation of secondary circulation in river channel confluences by numerical simulation they found problems in inferring vertical velocities from secondary circulation cells identified using these methods at confluences szupiany et al 2012 measured primary and secondary flow velocity components with an acoustic doppler current profilers adcp and they found that flow in large rivers possesses small curvatures thus preventing the formation of strong secondary currents chen et al 2017 employed a 3d numerical model to estimate the secondary flow under different junction angles and flow ratios and found that there are two secondary flow circulations at confluences shaheed et al 2019 compared two turbulence models standard k ε and realizable k ε and found that the standard k ε model show better performance in curved channels and realizable k ε model show better performance at confluences ramos et al 2019a studied four large eddy simulation les methods and examined the accuracy of the predictions of the secondary flow it was noted that an oversimplification of the numerical treatment of the free surface leads to a decreased accuracy of the predicted secondary flow and the turbulent kinetic energy yan et al 2020 stated that the realizable k ε model can predict smaller flow features such as secondary flows in bend flow and found that the number position and strength of the secondary flow varies with flow distribution and flow velocity moradi et al 2019 applied a newly established method to adcp data obtained for secondary flow identification at two river confluences they found that the increase of the lateral velocity gradient and depth results in higher relative differences in secondary velocities yuan et al 2021 observed dual counter rotating cells during high flow conditions and a single secondary cell in low flow conditions at the confluence of yangtze river and poyang lake recently the study of secondary flow in curves pein et al 2018 gepner et al 2020 somsook et al 2020 guo et al 2020 and confluence areas shaheed et al 2019 horna munoz et al 2020 has gradually attracted the attention of scholars the separation zone is of particular importance for fish habitat and feeding since it has low velocity circulation flows that benefit the phytoplankton and zooplankton liao et al 2003 zhang et al 2015 prechtel et al 2018 it is common knowledge that the separation zone has a complex 3d flow structure shumate 1998 huang 2000 wang 2009 mignot et al 2011 schindfessel et al 2015 the separation zone is a preferential location for sediment deposition attributed to its insufficient downstream transport of momentum best and reid 1984 hager 1987 ribeiro et al 201a b best and reid 1984 carried out an experimental study on the confluence at various junction angles to analyze the relationships between the scale of the separation zone the momentum ratio and the flow ratio they defined the shape of the separation zone wang et al 2008 assessed the influence of the flow ratio on the helical flow structure at y shaped junctions by the rng k ε model but the flow structure of the separation zone and the secondary flow patterns were not investigated schindfessel et al 2017 studied the influence of the cross sectional shape on the separation zone in a 90 open channel confluence based on les model and found that the separation zone in non rectangular channels are different due to the lateral flow which might reduce the local momentum deficit kisi et al 2019 estimated dimension width and length of the separation zone by techniques of gene expression programming gep multivariate adaptive regression spline mars m5 tree and dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system denfis the accuracy of these methods was compared and analyzed in summary various studies have been performed on the separation zone and the secondary flow at river confluences but the research on the factors affecting secondary flow and separation zone needs further investigation numerous studies have focused on modeling the separation zone but these models could be further improved the relationships between factors such as junction angle and flow ratio need to be better understood the effects of junction angle 30 45 60 90 120 and flow ratio 0 46 1 0 2 0 on separation zone and secondary flow were examined numerically in this study the various turbulence models need to be further compared to improve hydrodynamic simulation at confluences a comparison of various turbulent models the standard k ε model the rsm model the rng k ε model was explored in this paper to systematically analyze the influence of various confluent patterns on the flow field 45 working conditions with various flow ratios and junction angles were analyzed in detail the novelties of the present work are i the detailed analysis of the relationship between junction angle flow ratio and secondary flow ii the proposed definition of the separation zone and the secondary flow based on their characteristic values and iii the investigation of the inversion process of the secondary flow at river confluences the experiment approaches mathematical model and application of the model in this paper are organized as follows section 2 provides the experiment and a synopsis of the 3d numerical simulation model section 3 provides the model validation results with five key residual criteria describes the formation of the separation zone and secondary flow and discusses the factors a summary of the findings is outlined in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental approach 2 1 1 design of the flume experimental device the experimental flume device is shown in fig 1 a the whole flume system consists of a main stream flume a tributary flume and downstream flume the tributary flume is situated on the right bank of the main stream the junction angle between the two is 45 the main stream flume and tributary flume are composed of organic glass with a slope of 0 1 the water supply system is composed of the main stream water supply tank the tributary water supply tank the water pipe and the submersible pump and all of them form an one way flow system with the tail water tank a triangular weir is put in place in the inlet of the main stream to measure the inlet flow rate and calm down the inflow a backwater cell is located in the outlet section of the main stream flume to control the water depth acoustic doppler velocimeter adv is used to measure velocity in the x y and z three directions as shown in fig 1 b the accuracy of velocity measurement is 0 01 the measurement volume is about 90 mm3 and the sampling rate is 200 hz the sampling duration at each point is about 2 min to ensure the stability of the measurement 2 1 2 experimental cases and measuring points the distribution of measurement points in the horizontal plane is illustrated in fig 1 c the experimental conditions are given in table 1 the adv was used to measure velocity in the y and z three directions the table lists the flow ratio of the tributary to the main stream the origin of the coordinate system is taken at the bottom of the flume at corner a1 the area from section a to section n is the area with significant 3d characteristics near the separation zone moreover 5 points uniformly distributed in the vertical direction are located in the planes of a6a z 0 160 m a6b z 0 115 m a6c z 0 085 m a6d z 0 055 m and a6e z 0 010 m as shown in fig 1 d 2 2 mathematical model 2 2 1 hydrodynamic equations a 3d model that applies the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations was developed to simulate the hydrodynamics at the confluences as follows 1 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i x j ρ ν ν t u i x j ρ g 3 ν t c μ k 2 ε where ρ kg m3 is the fluid density t s is the time u i m s is the flow velocity of each direction p pa is the pressure ν m2 s is the molecular kinematic coefficient ν t m2 s is the eddy viscosity coefficient g m s2 is the acceleration of gravity c μ is an empirical constant which was calculated as 0 085 by yakhot and orszag 1986 k m2 s2 is the turbulent kinetic energy and ε is the turbulent dissipation rate considering the confluence of the tributary the water flow will be greatly curved 2 2 2 turbulence model to assess the performance of different turbulence models in predicting the behavior of secondary flows the standard k ε model the rsm model and the rng k ε model were compared and applied in this study the presentation of the rng model standard k ε model and the rsm model are all placed in appendix 2 2 3 discretization and solving method the finite volume method to solve the coupled unsteady governing equations has been set up using the openfoam software the method of parallel computation was adopted the pimple algorithm osama and huckaby 2009 which merged the simple and piso in the pimplefoam solver was utlized to solve the equation an advantage of this technique is that it is computationally efficient for transient incompressible cases with large time steps the smoothsolver algorithm form openfoam was used to solve implicit matrices for velocity turbulence kinetic energy turbulence dissipation rate and other variables 2 2 4 domain meshes and boundary conditions the computational domain meshes and boundary conditions consistent with the experiment as shown in fig 2 the boundary condition of inlet 1 in the main stream inlet 2 in the tributary and outlet were fixed as velocity velocity and zerogradient respectively the values under different initial condition were displayed in table 2 the method of rigid lid hypothesis is adopted for water surface profile of the main stream and tributary the water depth is assumed constant 0 213 m over the domain in the numerical simulation which is consistent with laboratory experiments of shen et al 2019 2021 and is appropriate for low froude number simulation over short distances the constant depth assumption mainly considers the following factors a the change of the water depth in this experiment is very small from 0 211 m to 0 213 m and the width of the flume in the simulation is larger than the depth b the end of the main stream flume is arranged with a backwater barrier of 0 08 m which alleviates variation of flow depth c the water depth is insensitive to flow ratios between the tributary and main stream according to the experimental results of shen et al 2019 the structured and unstructured grids were both used in which the structured rectangular grids were used in upstream and downstream areas while the unstructured parallelogram grids were used in the junction area fig 2d rectangular grid is easy to organize the data structure simple program design and suitable for the pimple algorithm of this model with high processing efficiency the parallelogram grid can connect the main stream and the tributary which is convenient to control the mesh density and easy to modify and adapt the total number of calculating grids is 1050663 to improve the precision and resolution of the calculation results finer grids were imposed close to the junction and the walls where significant gradients are expected as reported by shen et al 2019 the mesh convergence had been done and the aforementioned meshes had been defined after a mesh sensitivity analysis of the results the size of a single cell in upstream and downstream areas is 12 mm 12 mm 15 mm while the size of a single cell close to the flume boundary is 12 mm 10 mm 12 mm the boundary condition of inlet 1 inlet 2 and outlet are configured as velocity velocity and zerogradient respectively the main stream and tributary surface are both set as atmospheric pressure fig 2a the wall function method is used for wall boundary conditions as follows 4 u y y 11 63 1 κ ln e y y 11 63 5 u μ c u 1 4 k 1 2 τ w ρ 6 y ρ μ c u 1 4 k 1 2 y u where u and y are both dimensionless parameters and represent velocity and distance is the karman constant and has value of 0 41 e is the experiment constant and the value is 9 81 y m is the distance between the node and the wall τ w is wall shear stress k is the turbulent kinetic energy at calculation note μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity 3 results and discussion 3 1 results observed in experiment experimental results of the longitudinal velocity distribution u v velocity field in three horizontal planes of the three cases case 1 case3 and case5 are shown in fig 3 a the velocity field of the tributary is superimposed on the velocity field of the main stream maximum velocity 0 23 m s of case 1 appears in the longitudinal plane y 0 4 m and in the middle layer z 0 085 m the minimum velocity in each case appears in the longitudinal plane y 0 1 m it can be seen that the velocity deflected at the junction but no significant separation zone was observed due to the sparse arrangement of measurement points which were studied carefully by means of numerical simulation and the model was validated by the experimental data in addition experimental results of the transverse velocity distribution v w velocity field are presented in fig 3 b it indicates that there are lateral velocities that gradually form two secondary flows in opposite directions clockwise and counterclockwise on the same cross section the formation of the secondary flow with counter clockwise was due to the mutual deflection between the tributary and the main stream as the flow ratio increases while the other one was a result of the flow spinning between the merged flows and the separation zone as reported by chen et al 2017 in addition experimental data show that the water depth varies mildly from 0 211 m to 0 213 m 3 2 validation and comparison of turbulence models fig 4 compares the simulation results of the longitudinal distribution of the flow field in the horizontal plane z 0 05 m of case 3 under three turbulence models and the red arrows are the experimental data fig 5 shows the simulation results of the lateral distribution of the flow field in the cross section x 3 7 m of case 4 under three turbulence models fig 4 shows that the simulation results of the rsm model and the rng k ε model are similar compared with the standard k ε model the simulated values of the combined velocity of the two models in x and y directions are closer to the experimental data fig 5 shows that the rng k ε model gets a better agreement with experimental data than the rsm model previously a comparison of the realizable k ε and standard k ε turbulence model in curved channels and river confluences by shaheed et al 2019 showed better performance of the realizable k ε model at confluence and the standard k ε in curved channels we will compare the rng k ε model and the realizable k ε model in the future fig 6 compare the simulation results and experiment results of the flow field distribution of case 7b at the separation zone z 0 16 m with the rng k ε model which shows a good agreement between experiment and simulation as shown in fig 4 d h and fig 4 i m five sections x 0 7 m x 0 2 m x 1 0 m x 3 7 m and x 6 2 m in fig 4 a fig 4 b and fig 4 h were compared the results show that except the section x 0 7 m the standard k ε model shows the biggest relative error while the rng k ε model shows the smallest relative error this may be due to the fact that the flow did not bend until the two currents met by modifying the turbulent viscosity and considering the influence of rotation and swirl flow the rng k ε model can deal with the flow with high strain rate and large streamline bending more accurately anderson 2007 and can better simulate the bending phenomenon of longitudinal flow caused by the secondary flow in the cross section than standard k ε model as shown in fig 5 a and fig 5 b the flow field distribution of the standard k ε model on the cross section is quite chaotic although this model can simulate the effect of secondary flow its flow trend is not represented by an orderly flow line however the rsm model and rng k ε model can obviously represent the secondary circulation of case 4 in two different directions at the cross section of x 3 7 m the circulation near the tributary is clockwise and the circulation on the opposite side of the channel is counterclockwise this observation was inconsistent with bradbrook et al 2000 who reported that only a single secondary flow was formed in asymmetrical confluence we believe that this is mainly due to the different flow ratios the flow fields of the two models are relatively similar in the cross section although for the secondary flow near the tributary side the simulation results of the rng k ε model are more consistent with the experimental values than those of the rsm model fig 5 c w the rng k ε model better captures the secondary circulation characteristics than the rsm model to be more precise quantitative assessment of the validation for the three turbulent models is performed the key residual criteria of bias mean square error mse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae absolute maximum error ame methods introduced by neil et al 2013 are used to validate the velocity in horizontal plane and cross section which are shown in table 5 the data displayed in table 3 and table 4 were used to calculate the error statistics shown in table 5 and fig 7 the smaller the value absolute value for bias is the closer to the experiment the model is therefore the best model in the three is the rng k ε model for both horizontal plane and cross section considering the rationality economy convergence and precision of the calculation this paper selects the rng k ε model as the turbulent flow model in addition a quantile quantile plot with confidence intervals is used to further evaluate the applicability of the three models as shown in fig 7 it can be seen that it fits better in the cross section than the horizontal plane the data in the horizontal plane are shown as right skewed data 3 3 the three dimensional characteristic at confluences numerical simulations of the flow field at confluences with five different junction angles 30 45 60 90 and 120 and seven different flow ratios 0 11 0 19 0 24 0 36 0 46 1 0 and 2 0 were carried out as shown in table 2 taking case 6b as an example fig 8 shows the 3d distribution of the flow field at the confluence the calculation results indicate that the flow field at the confluence presents a complex 3d characteristic and the six distinct regions can be observed at the confluence as the numerical modeling reported by bradbrook et al 2001 biron et al 2004 constantinescu et al 2011 2014 2016 which are consistent with those of best 1987 as shown in fig 8 f when the tributary enters the main stream its direction changes immediately resulting a surface radial flow to be induced by the centrifugal force the separation zone is generated by the pressure gradient forces as observed by shaheed et al 2019 in river bends there is a similarity in the flow structure between river bends and the confluence according to rhoads and kenworthy 1995 this similarity is mainly due to the presence of helical cells downstream of the confluences as shown in fig 8 a d fig 9 shows the distribution of k and pressure p at the confluence of case 6b as shown in fig 9 c e the k near the tributary is stronger than in the other zones of the section and the difference decreases as the longitudinal distance increases the k near the bottom and the edge of the flume is greater than that in the center of the flume the k in the upper reaches of the confluence is smaller than that in the lower reaches of the confluence as shown in fig 9 b d f the vertical pressure is evenly distributed which might be possible that the observed even vertical distribution of pressure is an artifact of the rigid lid assumption an area of low pressure is observed in the separation zone near the tributary side in the lower reaches of the separation zone the pressure decreases gradually as the longitudinal distance increases 3 4 formation and evolution of the separation zone 3 4 1 definition of characteristic values of the separation zone the top resistance effect of the tributary on the main stream can push the other side of the main stream towards the junction forming a low velocity high turbulence intensity negative pressure reflux vortex area near the downstream of the junction at the tributary side namely the separation zone when the flow is kept separate from the inner wall of the confluence channel its return flow will extend to downstream so the separation zone with horizontal circulation will be generated at the point of flow separation best and reid 1984 first defined the shape index of the separation zone as the ratio of the maximum length to the width of the separation zone however determining the separation zone based on the flow field in the horizontal plane yielded different results than doing so based on the depth averaged velocity which proved the existence of complex 3d geometry and flow field of the separation zone schindfessel et al 2017 consequently the preferable method to characterize the dimensions of the separation zone should be carefully selected yang et al 2009 in this paper each horizontal plane is defined separately that is the ratio of the maximum length of the maximum width in each horizontal plane represents the shape index of the separation zone in the horizontal plane as shown in fig 10 the velocity value method is adopted to define the separation zone that is the surface intersecting the flume wall is considered as the boundary of the separation zone which is connected by the points where the components of all the velocity vectors in the flow field along the length of the groove are exactly equal to zero the experimental velocity data in the separation zone has been used to validate the model as shown in fig 6 on this basis the separation zone length l is defined as the length of the straight line intercepted by the boundary line of a particular water depth the separation zone width w is defined as the maximum vertical distance from the boundary line to the sidewall a represents the length of the downstream channel b represents the width of the main stream the shape indicators mainly contain the characteristic values of the separation zone l w and the maximum length dimension is l a and the maximum width dimension is w b 3 4 2 formation and evolution of the separation zone under various junction angles and flow ratios fig 10 and fig 11 show the variations in the flow field and the characteristic values of the separation zone under different junction angles and flow ratios the characteristic values in the separation zone are exhibited in table 6 and table 7 the two figures show that for constant flow ratio the transverse velocity component and the horizontal area of the separation zone increase with the junction angle while for constant junction angle the horizontal area of the separation zone increases with the flow ratio as shown in fig 10 a b and fig 11 a when the junction angle is 45 or 60 although the velocity in the separation zone is very slow a separation zone can be seen when the confluence angle is 90 or 120 the shape of the separation zone is obvious and the backflow phenomenon at 120 is more prominent than that at 90 as the junction angle increases the values of l w and w l all show increasing trends as the elevation above the bed increases both l and w increase but w l decreases fig 10a 10b as shown in fig 10 c d and fig 11 b when the junction angle is fixed the increase in the flow ratio leads to increases in the transverse velocity component of the tributary flowing into the main stream indicating that the flow ratio has a large influence on the shape of the separation zone however it seem to be that this influence is still weaker than that of the junction angle when the flow ratio is 0 46 the streamline bends downstream and the separation zone is small and an obvious backflow phenomenon within the extent does not occur when the flow ratio is 1 the separation zone can be obviously seen and the velocity w in the z direction of the separation zone is significantly greater than that outside the separation zone when the flow ratio increases to 2 the separation zone has a prominent shape and a small backflow zone occurs as the flow ratio increases the values of l w and w l all exhibit increasing trends fig 10c 10d in addition the separation zone was filled with fluid having a lateral velocity and a strong downstream velocity component which directing it into separation as a consequence the width of the separation zone reduces in sections farther downstream shumate 1998 huang 2000 mignot et al 2011 schindfessel et al 2015 3 5 formation and evolution of secondary flow 3 5 1 definition of characteristic values of secondary flow the concept of the secondary flow strength is used to evaluate the dissipation rate of the secondary flow at the confluence or in the channel bend which is defined by mosonyi and goetz 1973 as follows 7 i sp v 2 d a u 2 d a where u is the mean longitudinal velocity v is the mean lateral velocity in each of the available cells and da is the cross section of the cell in an ideal straight flume the direction of the flow is mainly along the main stream excluding the disturbance of external factors at the most a secondary flow is not produced but the original uni directional flow in the main stream is pushed by the lateral tributary flow which produces a force that deviates the flow from the main stream direction and results in a secondary flow at the confluence bradbrook 2001 as priegohernández and riveratrejo 2016 and sukhodolov et al 2017 reported the behavior of secondary flows shows a rotational effect in the same cross section as the flow increases the secondary flow becomes more prominent the formation of secondary flow requires special hydraulic conditions and occurs only in local areas with the gradual replenishment and superposition mixing of the vertical flow the strength of the secondary flow gradually decreases until it disappears which agrees with the viewpoint obtained by bradbrook et al 2000 and chen et al 2017 as the longitudinal distance flow ratio or confluence angle increases the positions and relative positions of these two secondary flows in the cross section gradually move to study whether this movement has regularity a new definition of the shape index of the secondary flow within the cross section was proposed as shown in fig 12 o1 represents the first secondary flow near the tributary side o 2 represents the second secondary flow near the opposite side a 1 represents the distance from o 1 to the wall b 1 represents the distance from o 1 to the surface a 2 represents the distance from o2 to the wall and b 2 represents the distance from o 2 to the surface c represents the distance from o 1 to o2 ar a 1 a 2 represents the horizontal space ratio and br b 1 b 2 represents the vertical space ratio 3 5 2 formation and evolution of secondary flow to study the patterns of the secondary flow based on time and flow conditions at the confluence it is necessary in order to understand the formation mechanism and the evolution of secondary flow fig 13 shows the distribution of secondary flows within the separation zone and in the cross sections located at x 0 3 m x 0 5 m x 0 8 m x 1 0 m x 1 2 m and x 1 5 m the formation of the secondary flow as well as the reversal of its direction of rotation can be visualized from fig 12 the reversal or rotation appears to be associated with the momentum transfer across the channel fig 12c d strong secondary circulation develops locally near the bottom and contributes to upwelling downstream of a discordant confluence as described by bradbrook et al 2001 o 1 gradually changes from a clockwise rotation to a counterclockwise rotation and o 2 gradually changes from a counterclockwise rotation to a clockwise rotation as shown in fig 13 a there are two secondary flows distributed within the cross section x 0 3 m o 1 is clockwise and o 2 is counterclockwise the first secondary flow is located near the edge of the sidewall in the separation zone where the longitudinal velocity u is very small almost zero the center of o 2 in this section is located at the bottom of the flume and the flow is mostly from the tributary side to the opposite side at the cross section of x 0 5 m fig 13b o 1 is still in the separation zone with a deviation of 0 04 m to the left the velocity near the bottom flows from the opposite side to the tributary side encounters o 1 and the velocity increases and gradually forms a vortex which makes the extent of o 2 increase at the cross section of x 0 8 m fig 13c the flow velocity from the opposite side to the tributary side gradually occupies most of the cross sectional area subsequently o 1 disappears and its flow velocity within the separation zone remains small but it changes from a combined velocity of v and w to a velocity in the negative direction of v o 2 also gradually disappears and is replaced by the velocity in the negative direction of v at the cross section of x 1 0 m fig 13d the velocity from the opposite side to the tributary side has an increasing deviation when it encounters the sidewall of the tributary when approaching the surface of the water affected by the lateral flow from the tributary the velocity is deflected toward the opposite side and a new o 1 trend is gradually formed as shown in fig 12 f 3 5 3 effect of junction angles on secondary flow fig 14 shows the flow field distribution in different cross sections of the confluence under different junction angles 30 45 60 90 and 120 when the flow ratio is 0 36 the characteristic values of the secondary flow under different junction angles are exhibited in table 8 as showed in fig 12 a and fig 14 as the junction angle increases the strength of the two secondary flows on the cross section increases gradually the reason is that as the junction angle increases a greater centrifugal force is generated at the confluence area together with a greater pressure gradient perpendicular to the main stream direction it results in the greater strength of the secondary flow as penna et al 2018 and yuan et al 2022 said the larger the junction angle the greater the flow deflection at the tributary s entrance into the post confluence channel which could enhance the secondary circulation due to the entrance of the tributary flow to the main stream and the increase of the transverse velocity in the junction the numerator of eq 12 significantly increases the secondary flow strength in the main stream increases dramatically which is similar to a river bend confluence observed by rasool et al 2016 our study differs from rasool in that we found that the secondary flow intensity reached maximum value in the downstream while rasool et al 2016 found a maximum value at the junction zone it can be seen that o 1 gradually moves up to the left and o 2 gradually moves down to the left in the downstream direction fig 14a e as the distance between the cross section and the downstream end decreases the secondary flow intensity decreases o 1 gradually move up to the left and o 2 gradually move down to the left along the downstream direction for x 10 m o 1 has almost disappeared in each junction angle and o 2 of the 30 junction angle has disappeared the influence distance of the secondary flow on the area downstream of the junction is relatively long a clockwise rotation of o 2 still occurs near the sidewall at the exit section the velocity profile indicates that the maximum convection transport occurs in the center of the flume and the flow velocity near the wall is the smallest the horizontal and vertical velocity differences also result in the horizontal and vertical diffusion but such diffusion can be ignored in relation to the influence of the tributary to the main stream as shown in fig 12 a as the junction angle increases a 1 a 2 b 2 c and ar on each cross section gradually increase and b 1 and br gradually decrease which shows that o 1 gradually moves upward as the junction angle increases o 2 gradually moves downward as the junction angle increases and the vortex centers of the two secondary flows grow farther apart this phenomenon is due primarily to the greater lateral velocity and secondary flow intensity at large junction angles caused by the tributary flowing into the main stream the shear layer moves away from the side of the tributary farther away the trend of o 1 moving to the right is stronger than that of o 2 while the tendency of o 2 moving upward is stronger than that of o 1 3 5 4 effects of flow ratios on the secondary flow fig 15 shows the flow field distribution in the cross sections of the confluence at various flow ratios 0 46 1 0 and 2 0 when the junction angle is 45 the characteristic values of the secondary flow under different flow ratios are exhibited in table 9 a double helix structure of two different directions is formed at the lower reaches as the flow ratio increases the intensities of the two secondary flows on the cross section gradually increase o 1 gradually moves toward the left and o 2 gradually moves toward the lower left as the longitudinal distance increases the intensities of the two secondary flows in the cross section gradually decrease o 1 gradually moves upward to the left and o 2 gradually moves upward to the right at the cross section of x 10 m o 1 of case 5b with a flow ratio of 0 46 has disappeared and o 2 of case 7b with a flow ratio of 2 0 has disappeared the changes of the two secondary flows under the various flow ratios are not consistent with the intensity of o 1 increases as the flow ratio increases and the intensity of o 2 initially increases and then decreases as the flow ratio increases this phenomenon is mainly because the greater the flow ratio the greater the lateral momentum from the tributary and the greater the intensity of the secondary flow the shear layer moves away from the side of the tributary when the flow ratio is lower than 1 o 2 increases as the flow ratio increases when the flow ratio is greater than 1 o 2 decreases slightly as the flow ratio increases as the transverse momentum mainly contributes to the development of o 1 at this stage yuan et al 2016 found that the shear layer was distorted when the tributary channel had a higher flow rate than the main channel which affected the shape and intensity of the secondary flows as shown in fig 15 the variation of each characteristic value on the cross sections of x 2 m and x 6 m shows that as the longitudinal distance increases a 1 and ar gradually increase and a 2 b 1 b 2 c br gradually decrease o 1 is gradually moving upward to the left o 2 is gradually moving upward to the left the distance between the whirlpool centers of the two secondary flows decreases and the trend of upward movement of o 2 is stronger than that of o 1 as the flow ratio increases a 1 a 2 b 2 and c on each cross section gradually increase b 1 and br gradually decrease and ar gradually decreases at cross section x 2 m but ar increases gradually at cross section x 6 m 4 conclusions the hydrodynamic characteristics at the confluence especially the formation and evolution of secondary flow and separation zone under variable junction angles and flow ratios are studied via a flume experiment and a 3d confluence model the calculation and experimental results reveal the hydrodynamic mechanism the formation and the evolution of the secondary flow and the separation zone at confluences specifically the rng k ε model has a better agreement with experimental data than the standard k ε model and the rsm model in the confluence model the separation zone has a complex 3d shape with low velocity high turbulence kinetic energy and low pressure two secondary flows that rotate counterclockwise and clockwise are formed at the right and left sides of the shear plane downstream of the separation zone respectively the one on the left side changes from counterclockwise to clockwise and the one on the right side changes from clockwise to counterclockwise a greater junction angle or flow ratio corresponds to a larger separation zone and greater secondary flow intensity the dimensions of the separation zone and secondary flow were redefined by characteristic values as the junction angle increases the l and w all show increasing trends both l and w increase but w l decreases a 1 a 2 b 2 c ar gradually increase and b 1 br gradually decrease from the bottom to the surface as the flow ratio increases a 1 a 2 b 2 c gradually increase b 1 br gradually decrease from the bottom to the surface but ar gradually decreases in section x 2 m while increases in section x 6 m this study provides a scientific basis for the optimization and regulation of water flow at the confluence it serves as a theoretical foundation for the water quality prediction and ecological environment protection at confluences clearly other factors such as the bed morphology ramos et al 2019b bed roughness stream gradient and sediment could also affect the flow

2751,confluences are widespread in natural rivers where pollutants sediment and fish tend to accumulate especially separation zone and studying their three dimensional 3d structure can provide guidance for improving river environmental health in the current study a flume experiment was conducted and a 3d confluence model was built three turbulent models were compared based on the experimental results which confirmed the applicability of the rng k ε model the effects of junction angles and flow ratios on the formation and evolution of secondary flow and separation zone were investigated by the established model the results indicated that the separation zone with low flow velocity high turbulence kinetic energy and low pressure is formed downstream of the junction while two secondary flows form on the sides of the shear plane downstream the shapes of the separation zone and secondary flow at the confluence were defined in a new way the secondary flow formation process is reversed within the separation zone and highly complicated when the junction angle and flow ratio change this study can provide a scientific basis for the utilization of confluences to improve water quality and aquatic animal ecology at natural river confluences keywords confluence secondary flow separation zone turbulent kinetic energy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river confluences are usually characterized with complex hydrodynamics which are the primary nodes and critical features of river systems a confluence is often associated with significant changes of flow dynamics best 1987 ramamurthy et al 1994 park and johnson 1998 bradbrook et al 2000 weber et al 2001 ribeiro et al 2012b lewis et al 2020 bahmanpouri et al 2022

ginney 2001 rice et al 2006 shen et al 2016 in addition understanding the flow patterns at confluences is of major practical significance because they affect the supersaturated total dissolved gas downstream of high dams shen et al 2016 2019 2021 some hypotheses have been proposed regarding the topographic changes at confluence including large flow velocities strong turbulence shear layer

k ω model huang et al 2002 zhang et al 2009 the rsm model liang and huai 2008 and the les model by ramos et al 2019a here we compared three turbulence models for asymmetric junctions in section 3 2 the occurrence of helical cells at confluences has been attributed to the unbalanced between centrifugal force and pressure gradient forces which is similar to the generation of helical motion in meander bends rhoads 2020 yuan et al 2022 secondary flow can change the distribution of velocity and shear stress thus affecting the exchange and transport of energy momentum heat and mass in the flow field yan et al 2011 vinuesa et al 2015 chen et al 2017 vinuesa et al 2018 jing et al 2020 prandtl 1953 divided the secondary flows into two types the first is caused by transverse pressure gradient in meandering rivers the second type exists in the straight open channel and is caused by the anisotropy of reynolds shear stress colombini 1993 lane et al 2000 studied the representation of secondary circulation in river channel confluences by numerical simulation they found problems in inferring vertical velocities from secondary circulation cells identified using these methods at confluences szupiany et al 2012 measured primary and secondary flow velocity components with an acoustic doppler current profilers adcp and they found that flow in large rivers possesses small curvatures thus preventing the formation of strong secondary currents chen et al 2017 employed a 3d numerical model to estimate the secondary flow under different junction angles and flow ratios and found that there are two secondary flow circulations at confluences shaheed et al 2019 compared two turbulence models standard k ε and realizable k ε and found that the standard k ε model show better performance in curved channels and realizable k ε model show better performance at confluences ramos et al 2019a studied four large eddy simulation les methods and examined the accuracy of the predictions of the secondary flow it was noted that an oversimplification of the numerical treatment of the free surface leads to a decreased accuracy of the predicted secondary flow and the turbulent kinetic energy yan et al 2020 stated that the realizable k ε model can predict smaller flow features such as secondary flows in bend flow and found that the number position and strength of the secondary flow varies with flow distribution and flow velocity moradi et al 2019 applied a newly established method to adcp data obtained for secondary flow identification at two river confluences they found that the increase of the lateral velocity gradient and depth results in higher relative differences in secondary velocities yuan et al 2021 observed dual counter rotating cells during high flow conditions and a single secondary cell in low flow conditions at the confluence of yangtze river and poyang lake recently the study of secondary flow in curves pein et al 2018 gepner et al 2020 somsook et al 2020 guo et al 2020 and confluence areas shaheed et al 2019 horna munoz et al 2020 has gradually attracted the attention of scholars the separation zone is of particular importance for fish habitat and feeding since it has low velocity circulation flows that benefit the phytoplankton and zooplankton liao et al 2003 zhang et al 2015 prechtel et al 2018 it is common knowledge that the separation zone has a complex 3d flow structure shumate 1998 huang 2000 wang 2009 mignot et al 2011 schindfessel et al 2015 the separation zone is a preferential location for sediment deposition attributed to its insufficient downstream transport of momentum best and reid 1984 hager 1987 ribeiro et al 201a b best and reid 1984 carried out an experimental study on the confluence at various junction angles to analyze the relationships between the scale of the separation zone the momentum ratio and the flow ratio they defined the shape of the separation zone wang et al 2008 assessed the influence of the flow ratio on the helical flow structure at y shaped junctions by the rng k ε model but the flow structure of the separation zone and the secondary flow patterns were not investigated schindfessel et al 2017 studied the influence of the cross sectional shape on the separation zone in a 90 open channel confluence based on les model and found that the separation zone in non rectangular channels are different due to the lateral flow which might reduce the local momentum deficit kisi et al 2019 estimated dimension width and length of the separation zone by techniques of gene expression programming gep multivariate adaptive regression spline mars m5 tree and dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system denfis the accuracy of these methods was compared and analyzed in summary various studies have been performed on the separation zone and the secondary flow at river confluences but the research on the factors affecting secondary flow and separation zone needs further investigation numerous studies have focused on modeling the separation zone but these models could be further improved the relationships between factors such as junction angle and flow ratio need to be better understood the effects of junction angle 30 45 60 90 120 and flow ratio 0 46 1 0 2 0 on separation zone and secondary flow were examined numerically in this study the various turbulence models need to be further compared to improve hydrodynamic simulation at confluences a comparison of various turbulent models the standard k ε model the rsm model the rng k ε model was explored in this paper to systematically analyze the influence of various confluent patterns on the flow field 45 working conditions with various flow ratios and junction angles were analyzed in detail the novelties of the present work are i the detailed analysis of the relationship between junction angle flow ratio and secondary flow ii the proposed definition of the separation zone and the secondary flow based on their characteristic values and iii the investigation of the inversion process of the secondary flow at river confluences the experiment approaches mathematical model and application of the model in this paper are organized as follows section 2 provides the experiment and a synopsis of the 3d numerical simulation model section 3 provides the model validation results with five key residual criteria describes the formation of the separation zone and secondary flow and discusses the factors a summary of the findings is outlined in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental approach 2 1 1 design of the flume experimental device the experimental flume device is shown in fig 1 a the whole flume system consists of a main stream flume a tributary flume and downstream flume the tributary flume is situated on the right bank of the main stream the junction angle between the two is 45 the main stream flume and tributary flume are composed of organic glass with a slope of 0 1 the water supply system is composed of the main stream water supply tank the tributary water supply tank the water pipe and the submersible pump and all of them form an one way flow system with the tail water tank a triangular weir is put in place in the inlet of the main stream to measure the inlet flow rate and calm down the inflow a backwater cell is located in the outlet section of the main stream flume to control the water depth acoustic doppler velocimeter adv is used to measure velocity in the x y and z three directions as shown in fig 1 b the accuracy of velocity measurement is 0 01 the measurement volume is about 90 mm3 and the sampling rate is 200 hz the sampling duration at each point is about 2 min to ensure the stability of the measurement 2 1 2 experimental cases and measuring points the distribution of measurement points in the horizontal plane is illustrated in fig 1 c the experimental conditions are given in table 1 the adv was used to measure velocity in the y and z three directions the table lists the flow ratio of the tributary to the main stream the origin of the coordinate system is taken at the bottom of the flume at corner a1 the area from section a to section n is the area with significant 3d characteristics near the separation zone moreover 5 points uniformly distributed in the vertical direction are located in the planes of a6a z 0 160 m a6b z 0 115 m a6c z 0 085 m a6d z 0 055 m and a6e z 0 010 m as shown in fig 1 d 2 2 mathematical model 2 2 1 hydrodynamic equations a 3d model that applies the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations was developed to simulate the hydrodynamics at the confluences as follows 1 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i x j ρ ν ν t u i x j ρ g 3 ν t c μ k 2 ε where ρ kg m3 is the fluid density t s is the time u i

empirical constant which was calculated as 0 085 by yakhot and orszag 1986 k m2 s2 is the turbulent kinetic energy and ε is the turbulent dissipation rate considering the confluence of the tributary the water flow will be greatly curved 2 2 2 turbulence model to assess the performance of different turbulence models in predicting the behavior of secondary flows the standard k ε model the rsm model and the rng k ε model were compared and applied in this study the presentation of the rng model standard k ε model and the rsm model are all placed in appendix 2 2 3 discretization and solving method the finite volume method to solve the coupled unsteady governing equations has been set up using the openfoam software the method of parallel computation was adopted the pimple algorithm osama and huckaby 2009 which merged the simple and piso in the pimplefoam solver was utlized to solve the equation an advantage of this technique is that it is computationally efficient for transient incompressible cases with large time steps the smoothsolver algorithm form openfoam was used to solve implicit matrices for velocity turbulence kinetic energy turbulence dissipation rate and other variables 2 2 4 domain meshes and boundary conditions the computational domain meshes and boundary conditions consistent with the experiment as shown in fig 2 the boundary condition of inlet 1 in the main stream inlet 2 in the tributary and outlet were fixed as velocity velocity and zerogradient respectively the values under different initial condition were displayed in table 2 the method of rigid lid hypothesis is adopted for water surface profile of the main stream and tributary the water depth is assumed constant 0 213 m over the domain in the numerical simulation which is consistent with laboratory experiments of shen et al 2019 2021 and is appropriate for low froude number simulation over short distances the constant depth assumption mainly considers the following factors a the change of the water depth in this experiment is very small from 0 211 m to 0 213 m and the width of the flume in the simulation is larger than the depth b the end of the main stream flume is arranged with a backwater barrier of 0 08 m which alleviates variation of flow depth c the water depth is insensitive to flow ratios between the tributary and main stream according to the experimental results of shen et al 2019 the structured and unstructured grids were both used in which the structured rectangular grids were used in upstream and downstream areas while the unstructured parallelogram grids were used in the junction area fig 2d rectangular grid is easy to organize the data structure simple program design and suitable for the pimple algorithm of this model with high processing efficiency the parallelogram grid can connect the main stream and the tributary which is convenient to control the mesh density and easy to modify and adapt the total number of calculating grids is 1050663 to improve the precision and resolution of the calculation results finer grids were imposed close to the junction and the walls where significant gradients are expected as reported by shen et al 2019 the mesh convergence had been done and the aforementioned meshes had been defined after a mesh sensitivity analysis of the results the size of a single cell in upstream and downstream areas is 12 mm 12 mm 15 mm while the size of a single cell close to the flume boundary is 12 mm 10 mm 12 mm the boundary condition of inlet 1 inlet 2 and outlet are configured as velocity velocity and zerogradient respectively the main stream and tributary surface are both set as atmospheric pressure fig 2a the wall function method is used for wall boundary conditions as follows 4 u y y 11 63 1 κ ln e y y 11 63 5 u μ c u 1 4 k 1 2 τ w ρ 6 y ρ μ c u 1 4 k 1 2 y u where u and y are both dimensionless parameters and represent velocity and distance is the karman constant and has value of 0 41 e is the experiment constant and the value is 9 81 y m is the distance between the node and the wall τ w is wall shear stress k is the turbulent kinetic energy at calculation note μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity 3 results and discussion 3 1 results observed in experiment experimental results of the longitudinal velocity distribution u v velocity field in three horizontal planes of the three cases case 1 case3 and case5 are shown in fig 3 a the velocity field of the tributary is superimposed on the velocity field of the main stream maximum velocity 0 23 m s of case 1 appears in the longitudinal plane y 0 4 m and in the middle layer z 0 085 m the minimum velocity in each case appears in the longitudinal plane y 0 1 m it can be seen that the velocity deflected at the junction but no significant separation zone was observed due to the sparse arrangement of measurement points which were studied carefully by means of numerical simulation and the model was validated by the experimental data in addition experimental results of the transverse velocity distribution v w velocity field are presented in fig 3 b it indicates that there are lateral velocities that gradually form two secondary flows in opposite directions clockwise and counterclockwise on the same cross section the formation of the secondary flow with counter clockwise was due to the mutual deflection between the tributary and the main stream as the flow ratio increases while the other one was a result of the flow spinning between the merged flows and the separation zone as reported by chen et al 2017 in addition experimental data show that the water depth varies mildly from 0 211 m to 0 213 m 3 2 validation and comparison of turbulence models fig 4 compares the simulation results of the longitudinal distribution of the flow field in the horizontal plane z 0 05 m of case 3 under three turbulence models and the red arrows are the experimental data fig 5 shows the simulation results of the lateral distribution of the flow field in the cross section x 3 7 m of case 4 under three turbulence models fig 4 shows that the simulation results of the rsm model and the rng k ε model are similar compared with the standard k ε model the simulated values of the combined velocity of the two models in x and y directions are closer to the experimental data fig 5 shows that the rng k ε model gets a better agreement with experimental data than the rsm model previously a comparison of the realizable k ε and standard k ε turbulence model in curved channels and river confluences by shaheed et al 2019 showed better performance of the realizable k ε model at confluence and the standard k ε in curved channels we will compare the rng k ε model and the realizable k ε model in the future fig 6 compare the simulation results and experiment results of the flow field distribution of case 7b at the separation zone z 0 16 m with the rng k ε model which shows a good agreement between experiment and simulation as shown in fig 4 d h and fig 4 i m five sections x 0 7 m x 0 2 m x 1 0 m x 3 7 m and x 6 2 m in fig 4 a fig 4 b and fig 4 h were compared the results show that except the section x 0 7 m the standard k ε model shows the biggest relative error while the rng k ε model shows the smallest relative error this may be due to the fact that the flow did not bend until the two currents met by modifying the turbulent viscosity and considering the influence of rotation and swirl flow the rng k ε model can deal with the flow with high strain rate and large streamline bending more accurately anderson 2007 and can better simulate the bending phenomenon of longitudinal flow caused by the secondary flow in the cross section than standard k ε model as shown in fig 5 a and fig 5 b the flow field distribution of the standard k ε model on the cross section is quite chaotic although this model can simulate the effect of secondary flow its flow trend is not represented by an orderly flow line however the rsm model and rng k ε model can obviously represent the secondary circulation of case 4 in two different directions at the cross section of x 3 7 m the circulation near the tributary is clockwise and the circulation on the opposite side of the channel is counterclockwise this observation was inconsistent with bradbrook et al 2000 who reported that only a single secondary flow was formed in asymmetrical confluence we believe that this is mainly due to the different flow ratios the flow fields of the two models are relatively similar in the cross section although for the secondary flow near the tributary side the simulation results of the rng k ε model are more consistent with the experimental values than those of the rsm model fig 5 c w the rng k ε model better captures the secondary circulation characteristics than the rsm model to be more precise quantitative assessment of the validation for the three turbulent models is performed the key residual criteria of bias mean square error mse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae absolute maximum error ame methods introduced by neil et al 2013 are used to validate the velocity in horizontal plane and cross section which are shown in table 5 the data displayed in table 3 and table 4 were used to calculate the error statistics shown in table 5 and fig 7 the smaller the value absolute value for bias is the closer to the experiment the model is therefore the best model in the three is the rng k ε model for both horizontal plane and cross section considering the rationality economy convergence and precision of the calculation this paper selects the rng k ε model as the turbulent flow model in addition a quantile quantile plot with confidence intervals is used to further evaluate the applicability of the three models as shown in fig 7 it can be seen that it fits better in the cross section than the horizontal plane the data in the horizontal plane are shown as right skewed data 3 3 the three dimensional characteristic at confluences numerical simulations of the flow field at confluences with five different junction angles 30 45 60 90 and 120 and seven different flow ratios 0 11 0 19 0 24 0 36 0 46 1 0 and 2 0 were carried out as shown in table 2 taking case 6b as an example fig 8 shows the 3d distribution of the flow field at the confluence the calculation results indicate that the flow field at the confluence presents a complex 3d characteristic and the six distinct regions can be observed at the confluence as the numerical modeling reported by bradbrook et al 2001 biron et al 2004 constantinescu et al 2011 2014 2016 which are consistent with those of best 1987 as shown in fig 8 f when the tributary enters the main stream its direction changes immediately resulting a surface radial flow to be induced by the centrifugal force the separation zone is generated by the pressure gradient forces as observed by shaheed et al 2019 in river bends there is a similarity in the flow structure between river bends and the confluence according to rhoads and kenworthy 1995 this similarity is mainly due to the presence of helical cells downstream of the confluences as shown in fig 8 a d fig 9 shows the distribution of k and pressure p at the confluence of case 6b as shown in fig 9 c e the k near the tributary is stronger than in the other zones of the section and the difference decreases as the longitudinal distance increases the k near the bottom and the edge of the flume is greater than that in the center of the flume the k in the upper reaches of the confluence is smaller than that in the lower reaches of the confluence as shown in fig 9 b d f the vertical pressure is evenly distributed which might be possible that the observed even vertical distribution of pressure is an artifact of the rigid lid assumption an area of low pressure is observed in the separation zone near the tributary side in the lower reaches of the separation zone the pressure decreases gradually as the longitudinal distance increases 3 4 formation and evolution of the separation zone 3 4 1 definition of characteristic values of the separation zone the top resistance effect of the tributary on the main stream can push the other side of the main stream towards the junction forming a low velocity high turbulence intensity negative pressure reflux vortex area near the downstream of the junction at the tributary side namely the separation zone when the flow is kept separate from the inner wall of the confluence channel its return flow will extend to downstream so the separation zone with horizontal circulation will be generated at the point of flow separation best and reid 1984 first defined the shape index of the separation zone as the ratio of the maximum length to the width of the separation zone however determining the separation zone based on the flow field in the horizontal plane yielded different results than doing so based on the depth averaged velocity which proved the existence of complex 3d geometry and flow field of the separation zone schindfessel et al 2017 consequently the preferable method to characterize the dimensions of the separation zone should be carefully selected yang et al 2009 in this paper each horizontal plane is defined separately that is the ratio of the maximum length of the maximum width in each horizontal plane represents the shape index of the separation zone in the horizontal plane as shown in fig 10 the velocity value method is adopted to define the separation zone that is the surface intersecting the flume wall is considered as the boundary of the separation zone which is connected by the points where the components of all the velocity vectors in the flow field along the length of the groove are exactly equal to zero the experimental velocity data in the separation zone has been used to validate the model as shown in fig 6 on this basis the separation zone length l is defined as the length of the straight line intercepted by the boundary line of a particular water depth the separation zone width w is defined as the maximum vertical distance from the boundary line to the sidewall a represents the length of the downstream channel b represents the width of the main stream the shape indicators mainly contain the characteristic values of the separation zone l w and the maximum length dimension is l a and the maximum width dimension is w b 3 4 2 formation and evolution of the separation zone under various junction angles and flow ratios fig 10 and fig 11 show the variations in the flow field and the characteristic values of the separation zone under different junction angles and flow ratios the characteristic values in the separation zone are exhibited in table 6 and table 7 the two figures show that for constant flow ratio the transverse velocity component and the horizontal area of the separation zone increase with the junction angle while for constant junction angle the horizontal area of the separation zone increases with the flow ratio as shown in fig 10 a b and fig 11 a when the junction angle is 45 or 60 although the velocity in the separation zone is very slow a separation zone can be seen when the confluence angle is 90 or 120 the shape of the separation zone is obvious and the backflow phenomenon at 120 is more prominent than that at 90 as the junction angle increases the values of l w and w l all show increasing trends as the elevation above the bed increases both l and w increase but w l decreases fig 10a 10b as shown in fig 10 c d and fig 11 b when the junction angle is fixed the increase in the flow ratio leads to increases in the transverse velocity component of the tributary flowing into the main stream indicating that the flow ratio has a large influence on the shape of the separation zone however it seem to be that this influence is still weaker than that of the junction angle when the flow ratio is 0 46 the streamline bends downstream and the separation zone is small and an obvious backflow phenomenon within the extent does not occur when the flow ratio is 1 the separation zone can be obviously seen and the velocity w in the z direction of the separation zone is significantly greater than that outside the separation zone when the flow ratio increases to 2 the separation zone has a prominent shape and a small backflow zone occurs as the flow ratio increases the values of l w and w l all exhibit increasing trends fig 10c 10d in addition the separation zone was filled with fluid having a lateral velocity and a strong downstream velocity component which directing it into separation as a consequence the width of the separation zone reduces in sections farther downstream shumate 1998 huang 2000 mignot et al 2011 schindfessel et al 2015 3 5 formation and evolution of secondary flow 3 5 1 definition of characteristic values of secondary flow the concept of the secondary flow strength is used to evaluate the dissipation rate of the secondary flow at the confluence or in the channel bend which is defined by mosonyi and goetz 1973 as follows 7 i sp v 2 d a u 2 d a where u is the mean longitudinal velocity v is the mean lateral velocity in each of the available cells and da is the cross section of the cell in an ideal straight flume the direction of the flow is mainly along the main stream excluding the disturbance of external factors at the most a secondary flow is not produced but the original uni directional flow in the main stream is pushed by the lateral tributary flow which produces a force that deviates the flow from the main stream direction and results in a secondary flow at the confluence bradbrook 2001 as priegohernández and riveratrejo 2016 and sukhodolov et al 2017 reported the behavior of secondary flows shows a rotational effect in the same cross section as the flow increases the secondary flow becomes more prominent the formation of secondary flow requires special hydraulic conditions and occurs only in local areas with the gradual replenishment and superposition mixing of the vertical flow the strength of the secondary flow gradually decreases until it disappears which agrees with the viewpoint obtained by bradbrook et al 2000 and chen et al 2017 as the longitudinal distance flow ratio or confluence angle increases the positions and relative positions of these two secondary flows in the cross section gradually move to study whether this movement has regularity a new definition of the shape index of the secondary flow within the cross section was proposed as shown in fig 12 o1 represents the first secondary flow near the tributary side o 2 represents the second secondary flow near the opposite side a 1 represents the distance from o 1 to the wall b 1 represents the distance from o 1 to the surface a 2 represents the distance from o2 to the wall and b 2 represents the distance from o 2 to the surface c represents the distance from o 1 to o2 ar a 1 a 2 represents the horizontal space ratio and br b 1 b 2 represents the vertical space ratio 3 5 2 formation and evolution of secondary flow to study the patterns of the secondary flow based on time and flow conditions at the confluence it is necessary in order to understand the formation mechanism and the evolution of secondary flow fig 13 shows the distribution of secondary flows within the separation zone and in the cross sections located at x 0 3 m x 0 5 m x 0 8 m x 1 0 m x 1 2 m and x 1 5 m the formation of the secondary flow as well as the reversal of its direction of rotation can be visualized from fig 12 the reversal or rotation appears to be associated with the momentum transfer across the channel fig 12c d strong secondary circulation develops locally near the bottom and contributes to upwelling downstream of a discordant confluence as described by bradbrook et al 2001 o 1 gradually changes from a clockwise rotation to a counterclockwise rotation and o 2 gradually changes from a counterclockwise rotation to a clockwise rotation as shown in fig 13 a there are two secondary flows distributed within the cross section x 0 3 m o 1 is clockwise and o 2 is counterclockwise the first secondary flow is located near the edge of the sidewall in the separation zone where the longitudinal velocity u is very small almost zero the center of o 2 in this section is located at the bottom of the flume and the flow is mostly from the tributary side to the opposite side at the cross section of x 0 5 m fig 13b o 1 is still in the separation zone with a deviation of 0 04 m to the left the velocity near the bottom flows from the opposite side to the tributary side encounters o 1 and the velocity increases and gradually forms a vortex which makes the extent of o 2 increase at the cross section of x 0 8 m fig 13c the flow velocity from the opposite side to the tributary side gradually occupies most of the cross sectional area subsequently o 1 disappears and its flow velocity within the separation zone remains small but it changes from a combined velocity of v and w to a velocity in the negative direction of v o 2 also gradually disappears and is replaced by the velocity in the negative direction of v at the cross section of x 1 0 m fig 13d the velocity from the opposite side to the tributary side has an increasing deviation when it encounters the sidewall of the tributary when approaching the surface of the water affected by the lateral flow from the tributary the velocity is deflected toward the opposite side and a new o 1 trend is gradually formed as shown in fig 12 f 3 5 3 effect of junction angles on secondary flow fig 14 shows the flow field distribution in different cross sections of the confluence under different junction angles 30 45 60 90 and 120 when the flow ratio is 0 36 the characteristic values of the secondary flow under different junction angles are exhibited in table 8 as showed in fig 12 a and fig 14 as the junction angle increases the strength of the two secondary flows on the cross section increases gradually the reason is that as the junction angle increases a greater centrifugal force is generated at the confluence area together with a greater pressure gradient perpendicular to the main stream direction it results in the greater strength of the secondary flow as penna et al 2018 and yuan et al 2022 said the larger the junction angle the greater the flow deflection at the tributary s entrance into the post confluence channel which could enhance the secondary circulation due to the entrance of the tributary flow to the main stream and the increase of the transverse velocity in the junction the numerator of eq 12 significantly increases the secondary flow strength in the main stream increases dramatically which is similar to a river bend confluence observed by rasool et al 2016 our study differs from rasool in that we found that the secondary flow intensity reached maximum value in the downstream while rasool et al 2016 found a maximum value at the junction zone it can be seen that o 1 gradually moves up to the left and o 2 gradually moves down to the left in the downstream direction fig 14a e as the distance between the cross section and the downstream end decreases the secondary flow intensity decreases o 1 gradually move up to the left and o 2 gradually move down to the left along the downstream direction for x 10 m o 1 has almost disappeared in each junction angle and o 2 of the 30 junction angle has disappeared the influence distance of the secondary flow on the area downstream of the junction is relatively long a clockwise rotation of o 2 still occurs near the sidewall at the exit section the velocity profile indicates that the maximum convection transport occurs in the center of the flume and the flow velocity near the wall is the smallest the horizontal and vertical velocity differences also result in the horizontal and vertical diffusion but such diffusion can be ignored in relation to the influence of the tributary to the main stream as shown in fig 12 a as the junction angle increases a 1 a 2 b 2 c and ar on each cross section gradually increase and b 1 and br gradually decrease which shows that o 1 gradually moves upward as the junction angle increases o 2 gradually moves downward as the junction angle increases and the vortex centers of the two secondary flows grow farther apart this phenomenon is due primarily to the greater lateral velocity and secondary flow intensity at large junction angles caused by the tributary flowing into the main stream the shear layer moves away from the side of the tributary farther away the trend of o 1 moving to the right is stronger than that of o 2 while the tendency of o 2 moving upward is stronger than that of o 1 3 5 4 effects of flow ratios on the secondary flow fig 15 shows the flow field distribution in the cross sections of the confluence at various flow ratios 0 46 1 0 and 2 0 when the junction angle is 45 the characteristic values of the secondary flow under different flow ratios are exhibited in table 9 a double helix structure of two different directions is formed at the lower reaches as the flow ratio increases the intensities of the two secondary flows on the cross section gradually increase o 1 gradually moves toward the left and o 2 gradually moves toward the lower left as the longitudinal distance increases the intensities of the two secondary flows in the cross section gradually decrease o 1 gradually moves upward to the left and o 2 gradually moves upward to the right at the cross section of x 10 m o 1 of case 5b with a flow ratio of 0 46 has disappeared and o 2 of case 7b with a flow ratio of 2 0 has disappeared the changes of the two secondary flows under the various flow ratios are not consistent with the intensity of o 1 increases as the flow ratio increases and the intensity of o 2 initially increases and then decreases as the flow ratio increases this phenomenon is mainly because the greater the flow ratio the greater the lateral momentum from the tributary and the greater the intensity of the secondary flow the shear layer moves away from the side of the tributary when the flow ratio is lower than 1 o 2 increases as the flow ratio increases when the flow ratio is greater than 1 o 2 decreases slightly as the flow ratio increases as the transverse momentum mainly contributes to the development of o 1 at this stage yuan et al 2016 found that the shear layer was distorted when the tributary channel had a higher flow rate than the main channel which affected the shape and intensity of the secondary flows as shown in fig 15 the variation of each characteristic value on the cross sections of x 2 m and x 6 m shows that as the longitudinal distance increases a 1 and ar gradually increase and a 2 b 1 b 2 c br gradually decrease o 1 is gradually moving upward to the left o 2 is gradually moving upward to the left the distance between the whirlpool centers of the two secondary flows decreases and the trend of upward movement of o 2 is stronger than that of o 1 as the flow ratio increases a 1 a 2 b 2 and c on each cross section gradually increase b 1 and br gradually decrease and ar gradually decreases at cross section x 2 m but ar increases gradually at cross section x 6 m 4 conclusions the hydrodynamic characteristics at the confluence especially the formation and evolution of secondary flow and separation zone under variable junction angles and flow ratios are studied via a flume experiment and a 3d confluence model the calculation and experimental results reveal the hydrodynamic mechanism the formation and the evolution of the secondary flow and the separation zone at confluences specifically the rng k ε model has a better agreement with experimental data than the standard k ε model and the rsm model in the confluence model the separation zone has a complex 3d shape with low velocity high turbulence kinetic energy and low pressure two secondary flows that rotate counterclockwise and clockwise are formed at the right and left sides of the shear plane downstream of the separation zone respectively the one on the left side changes from counterclockwise to clockwise and the one on the right side changes from clockwise to counterclockwise a greater junction angle or flow ratio corresponds to a larger separation zone and greater secondary flow intensity the dimensions of the separation zone and secondary flow were redefined by characteristic values as the junction angle increases the l and w all show increasing trends both l and w increase but w l decreases a 1 a 2 b 2 c ar gradually increase and b 1 br gradually decrease from the bottom to the surface as the flow ratio increases a 1 a 2 b 2 c gradually increase b 1 br gradually decrease from the bottom to the surface but ar gradually decreases in section x 2 m while increases in section x 6 m this study provides a scientific basis for the optimization and regulation of water flow at the confluence it serves as a theoretical foundation for the water quality prediction and ecological environment protection at confluences clearly other factors such as the bed morphology ramos et al 2019b bed roughness stream gradient and sediment could also affect the flow

2752,in recent years among renewable energies the geothermal resource exploitation shows a constant growth specifically in countries engaged in co2 emissions reduction and dependent on energy from abroad the low temperature geothermal energy geo exchange for air conditioning of buildings represents a cost effective and green solution in closed loop systems borehole heat exchangers bhe are coupled with ground source heat pumps gshp constituting the key component of the heating ventilation air conditioning hvac system therefore the design of the bhe and the correct interpretation of in situ thermal response tests trt are essential to supply the building energy demand to support the design modflow usg connected linear network cln and drain return flow drt packages are adapted and improved to reproduce the operation of one or more bhe in aquifers and to analyze the trt the improvements are compared with a previously developed numerical model and two different analytical solutions infinite line source and moving line source by imposing a constant heat rate injection into the aquifer the results show good agreement between the new approach and previous ones discrepancy

procedure 1 introduction eu legislation evolved significantly to achieve the eu paris agreement commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by setting through ec 2018 2001 directive the share of renewable energy by 2030 equal to 32 of final energy consumption as buildings are responsible for around 36 of energy consumption and for 34 of co2 emissions in europe european comission 2021 in 2016 through the clean energy for all europeans package it was possible to target the efficiency improvement of new and existing buildings by requiring an annual increase in the heating and cooling use of renewables of about 1 3 since ground source heat pump gshp and groundwater heat pump gwhp systems are among the cleanest and most energy efficient heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems for buildings the exploitation of this technology has been expanding all over the world in recent years chae et al 2022 farabi asl et al 2019 jodeiri et al 2022 lyu et al 2020 sakellari and lundqvist 2003 according to the last pre pandemic statistical report by gse italian energy services manager in 2019 in italy 3392 terajoules of thermal energy were produced by exploiting gshp or gwhp systems although it represents only 0 15 of the total consumed thermal energy it increases at a yearly rate of 1 5 gshp systems are coupled to the ground by means of a closed loop ground heat exchanger the latter can either be composed of vertical u shape pipes called borehole heat exchangers bhes or of horizontal pipes where a non freezing fluid water mixed to glycol solution is circulated to absorb heat from the ground during the cold season and inject it during the warm one lyu et al 2020 on the other hand gwhp systems are based on injecting and extracting wells open loop system similar to those generally used for pump treat systems antelmi et al 2020b except that in this case water is used to produce energy the coefficient of performance cop of these systems reaches higher values than conventional air source heat pumps since the ground is often cooler in summer and warmer in winter than the air temperature li et al 2014 gshp systems performance and design is highly dependent on the heat transfer capability between the bhe and the subsoil and thus the estimate of the thermal subsoil properties is essential pambou et al 2022 the execution of the so called thermal response test trt on subsoil is always recommended for a better hvac system design and sometimes it is also mandatory e g in lombardy region italy a trt is required regione lombardia 2010 for gshp systems with heat rate greater than 50 kw this test is performed to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity of the soil λeff and the borehole thermal resistance rb gehlin 2002 spitler and gehlin 2015 zhang et al 2014 it is carried out on a pilot bhe connected to a testing unit and is performed by supplying a constant heat rate to the circulating fluid by means of an electrical resistance naldi and zanchini 2019 inlet and outlet fluid temperatures are recorded throughout the test along with water flow rate electrical power related to the thermal resistance and external air temperature blasi and menichetti 2012 stated that the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity is equal to 15 when the test is conducted with a duration of about 20 h whereas it is reduced to 5 for a test lasting about 50 h the presence of groundwater flow could complicate the assessment of the thermal conductivity so that performing the test over 72 h is suggested indeed over that time the available literature suggests that the ground response to the thermal excitation achieves a steady state condition for all aquifers that have been studied antelmi et al 2021 beier 2021 nieto et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 different approaches can be applied to the analysis of the experimental data recorded during the trt both simplified analytical models banks 2012 carlslaw and jaeger 1959 diao et al 2004 molina giraldo et al 2011 pasquier and lamarche 2022 and more complex numerical models allowing to include more elements that influence test results casasso et al 2017 casasso and sethi 2014 zong et al 2021 due to their simple mathematical formulation and to the limited number of input parameters the analytical models of the infinite line source ils and the moving line source mls are the most common approaches adopted for the interpretation of trt data carlslaw and jaeger 1959 diao et al 2004 both models assume the gshp system as an infinite linear heat source exchanging heat with the homogeneous and isotropic surrounding ground with a constant heat flux per unit length bandos et al 2009 eskilson 1987 man et al 2010 zeng et al 2002 the difference between the two models is that the ils assumes pure conduction in the ground whereas the mls also considers the advection term due to groundwater flow therefore the ils model application is restricted to the geological sites where groundwater flow is absent or negligible otherwise a more suitable solution is the mls diao et al 2004 sutton et al 2003 wagner et al 2013 in the end applying both the ils and mls only an effective value of the thermal conductivity for the entire depth of the bhe is obtained neglecting the variation along the vertical caused by a heterogeneous lithostratigraphy numerical models represent a more complex but potentially more precise solution to evaluate the correct aquifer thermal parameters attard et al 2020 fujii et al 2005 giordano et al 2021 they need more input parameters derived from a specific conceptual site model csm but they are flexible tools able to simulate non ideal conditions e g heterogeneous soils realistic surface boundary conditions geothermal gradients etc and relevant physical processes namely beside conduction advection and thermal dispersion these tools coupled with suitable parameter estimation procedures provide more accurate results antelmi et al 2020a dalla santa et al 2022 galgaro et al 2021 when reproducing a bhe in a numerical model the main components involved are characterized by different dimensions from millimetres pipe thickness to meters aquifer angelotti et al 2014a when a fully 3 d approach is applied the multiple spatial scales lead to numerical models affected by high computational loads angelotti et al 2014b developed a 3 d numerical finite difference model by means of modflow code coupled to mt3dms of a single bhe by turning its circular section to an equivalent square one although the numerical model was validated for different groundwater flow velocities its applicability was limited due to the large number of model domain cells that did not allow to represent more than one bhe marcotte and pasquier 2008 simulating the thermal behaviour of a vertical bhe implemented a 3 d finite element numerical model through the comsol code by exploiting the symmetry of the problem they were able to halve the number of cells and partially reduce the computational burden the reduction of the cells number for aquifer and bhe representation was also achieved using a 1 d shonder and beck 1999 and a 2 d numerical modelling approach berberich et al 1994 wagner and clauser 2005 or alternatively by applying a reduced order numerical approach that couples a 1 d description of the vertical pipes heat transfer with a 3 d description of the aquifer signorelli et al 2007 the latter created a finite element model of a bhe system in the fractured geological formation which is suitable to simulate coupled hydraulic and thermal processes under non steady conditions the authors used synthetic trt data from the numerical model to evaluate the sensitivity of the ils model analysis to test duration borehole length groundwater velocity and subsurface heterogeneity the model implemented 3 d elements reproducing the porous matrix around the bhe and 1 d pipe elements for the bhe implementation the heat transfer between the circulating fluid and the aquifer was simulated as a thermal resistance related to the velocity dependent heat transfer coefficient of the fluid a similar method is used also in lamarche et al 2010 to compare different empirical and theoretical approaches for the evaluation of the borehole resistance the authors implemented a 3 d numerical model in comsol reproducing the borehole by means of 1 d finite elements using the traditional advective equation another study developed in comsol is the one by bozzoli et al 2011 where a two step parameter estimation procedure tspep for the evaluation of the grout and soil thermal conductivities is validated using both simulated and experimental data as for the previous studies heat transport in the bhe was simulated through 1 d equations while heat transfer in the hydrogeological domain through 3 d equations brunetti et al 2017 šimůnek et al 2016 adopted the coupling of a 2 d domain to implement the aquifer and a 1 d domain for the bhe in the hydrus code the two domains were connected by a robin boundary condition which enabled the simulation of heat transfer between the bhe and the surrounding soil the proposed numerical trt was validated against experimental data collected in two sites in japan similar studies about pseudo 3 d models for the simulation of gshp operation are reported in al khoury et al 2005 florides et al 2012 raymond et al 2011 the aim of the present study is to provide an updated simple improved and expeditious numerical tool to analyse in situ trt through modflow specifically the version modflow usg a widely used code for modelling environmental problems in groundwater the novelty of the updated tool is the introduction into the cln package of new characteristic elements of a bhe such as the thickness and the thermal conductivity of the u pipe and the internal convective heat transfer coefficient another important improvement is the option to couple the connected linear network cln and drain return flow drt packages to simulate the heat carrier fluid circulating in the bhe and injecting a constant heat rate into the ground this allows to simulate a trt and to validate the cln approach comparing it with the available constant heat rate analytical solutions these enhancements are key to reproduce each thermal resistance between the circulating fluid and the aquifer thus accurately reproducing the heat transfer nearby the bhe through a 1 d approach for the fluid therefore besides providing an effective method to simulate and analyse a trt the proposed tool without the drt package can be used to expeditiously simulate the typical operation heating cooling of a gshp system consisting of multiple bhe avoiding numerical convergence problems in the present paper different numerical models at constant heat rate injection are developed featuring four spatial discretizations and a sensitivity analysis on groundwater velocity is performed each model is then tested against common analytical models ils and mls and compared with the numerical models discussed in angelotti et al 2014a 2 material and methods a synthetic numerical model of a single bhe with hydrogeological and thermal properties adapted from angelotti et al 2014a is implemented in modflow usg by applying the approach tested in antelmi et al 2021 the graphical user interface is groundwater vista 7 0 esi inc the cln package has been updated in some programming features compared to the version package discussed in antelmi et al 2021 whereas the drt package is specifically adapted to create a constant heat rate injection in aquifer such as in trt execution a complete description of the package modification is presented in the next pages 2 1 modflow usg and cln modflow usg panday et al 2013 is an open access numerical code for modeling groundwater flow the main advantage over previous versions of modflow is the control volume finite difference cvfd approach which is a generalization of the finite difference approach that allows the use of unstructured grids the other characteristic that distinguishes modflow usg is the solution of tightly coupled processes that interact with groundwater flow thus every equation of the model is solved in one matrix avoiding convergence problems specifically the cln package simulates one dimensional features such as pipes wells karst conduits or streams that interact with groundwater flow since its release modflow usg has been expanded to include solute and heat transport such features are available as open access software usg transport panday 2020 the heat transport package is well suited for simulating geothermal plants impacts and cln package is well suited to simulate a bhe as it was demonstrated by antelmi et al 2021 in previous works the numerical modeling of bhe with modflow mt3dms was faced for the first time by angelotti et al 2014a that paper aimed to prove the capability of these codes to model bhes with a good accuracy and to fully discuss the influence of groundwater flow on the energy performance of bhes and on the aquifer temperature distribution the u pipe geometry the thermal carrier fluid flow and aquifer temperature distribution were explicitly reproduced for the first time going beyond previous applications of numerical codes the main challenge was to correctly reproduce the bhe in a homogeneous aquifer through a square or rectangular grid classic finite difference grid of modflow 2000 to this purpose the u shape pipe was represented by a square section requiring a very fine horizontal and vertical discretization minimum cell size 0 37 cm the pipe size was derived on the assumption of conserving the total thermal resistance per unit length between circular section and square one in specific the total thermal resistance was calculated as the sum of a convective resistance and of a conductive one an extensive validation of the numerical model solutions was provided comparing them with the analytical mls solution assimilating the u pipe to an infinite line source and varying the groundwater velocity the heat exchange rate was not imposed as a boundary condition but resulted from the interaction between the bhe and the surrounding porous medium the simulation results provided an evaluation of the temperature perturbation in the aquifer improving the energy exchange estimation and providing a quantitative assessment of the heat rate increase due to groundwater flow cln elements can be vertical horizontal or inclined and can have rectangular or circular shaped cross sectional geometries their connection for flow and transport to groundwater flow gwf cells occurs through analytic equations that include skin efficiency factor considerations modflow usg accommodates vertical horizontal or angled cln elements groundwater vistas allows for input of cln as a cln well or a cln polyline the former is vertical and used to represent vertical conduits e g a well while cln polylines can be implemented at any angle e g hydraulic pipes in the current implementation the cln polyline is used to connect 2 vertical cln wells to reproduce the real geometry u shape pipe of the bhe fig 1 additional enhancements have been applied to the bhe simulation process since the discussions in antelmi et al 2021 specifically three characteristic parameters of the bhe are introduced in the numerical code the u pipe i e high density polyethylene thickness the u pipe thermal conductivity the internal convective heat transfer coefficient when the aim of the numerical simulation is to describe what happens into the bhe and the cells strictly surrounding it these parameters need to be considered the enhancement improves the accuracy of the numerical representation of the bhe and the heat transport between groundwater and bhe the net thermal resistance between aquifer and bhe is a sum of 2 resistances the conductive resistance offered by the bhe pipe wall and the convective one related to the bhe circulating fluid the latter is depending on the convective heat transfer coefficient that is linked to the inner diameter of the bhe tube to the fluid flow rate and regime laminar or turbulent another enhancement to the modflow usg software specific for the implementation of bhes and the simulation of a trt was to provide appropriate boundary conditions to the inlet and outlet of the bhe tube as discussed below 2 2 boundary conditions for the bhe modflow usg includes several packages to provide boundary conditions to a simulation these boundary conditions can be applied to the gwf and or the cln domains for instance a flow rate and a temperature may be provided at the inlet of the bhe tube and the code will compute the flow rate and temperature at the outlet for a bhe the outflow rate will be equal to the inflow rate which may be applied as an outflow boundary condition if the flow in the bhe tube is at steady state conditions a reference head is required for a unique solution to the flow in the bhe tube thus a prescribed source flux may be provided at the inflow end at the outflow end a reference head may be provided to allow the bhe fluid to exit it can be any value above the top of the model domain such that the tube remains fully saturated at the outlet point typical operation of a trt requires a constant heat rate injection thus the temperature at the outlet of the bhe is at a constant differential from the temperature at the inlet the drt package available in modflow usg transport was modified to accommodate this condition this package was developed to extract water from cells characterized as a drain and re inject all or part of it into another cell this feature was expanded for use with solute and heat transport problems it allows to link the solute concentration or temperature extracted from the drain cell which can be the cln cell representing the borehole outlet with that of re injected water into the cln cell representing the borehole inlet by using the bhe outlet as a drain cell and the bhe inlet as a re injection cell it is possible to create a closed loop circuit as in a trt or in the common operation of a bhe since a reference head is required in the bhe for a steady state solution an option is provided which allows for extraction of water under a cauchy boundary condition which provides the reference head in the drt package file the reference head and the return flow rate are then set by the user and supplied to the bhe outlet and inlet cln nodes respectively to provide the appropriate flow within the bhe tube this case is called the ghb q condition and is identified by providing a negative conductance factor in the drt package input file panday et al 2013 the value is converted to positive internally in the code a temperature difference δt can then be forced between the outflow and inflow such that the system operates under a constant heat rate the heating power actually depends on the mass flow rate of the heat transfer fluid on its heat capacity per unit mass and on the temperature difference δt since the mass flow rate and the heat capacity are constant over time δt is the only quantity that must be forced to remain constant during the simulation this requirement can be satisfied within the drt input file where a fixed temperature increase can be added to the drained temperature before reapplying the water flow rate at the return flow location this procedure allows an automatic implementation of the δt thus overcoming the method adopted so far with modflow mt3dms which required the simulation to be interrupted many times to manually adjust this parameter therefore to properly use the drt package the following information must be introduced into the input data file the node number of the inlet and outlet cell of the bhe the elevation of the water level for the ghb q condition the flux rate applied to the return flow node and the fixed temperature increase at the bhe inlet node 2 3 numerical model implementation three main features are essential to numerically reproduce a conventional trt the real pipe circular section of the bhe he circulation of the fluid inside the bhe a constant heat rate injection into the ground during the test when the numerical code involves only rectangular or square cells such as modflow and mt3dms the circular geometry of the bhe must be approximated through an equivalence with a square or rectangular one angelotti et al used this approach with good results angelotti et al 2014a although with a big effort in terms of computational load and implementation times running the numerical model for one specific groundwater flow velocity required more than 1 day for an expert user and a significant effort to find the right combination of numerical solver parameters to achieve convergence in specific each square section of the bhe pipe consisted of 36 cells reproducing the heat carrier fluid surrounded by 0 37 cm cells representing the hdpe the u shaped elbow was implemented through two outer horizontal layers with a thickness of 0 37 cm and one in the center of 3 36 cm differently in the present study the bhe is implemented in accordance with the approach proposed and validated by antelmi et al 2021 by means of three analytical elements two cln wells representing the inlet and outlet pipes and one horizontal cln polyline implementing the elbow of the u tube since all these elements are circular this approach better reproduces the real geometry of the system while the unstructured grid approach allows to use a coarse grid more details in subsection 2 4 furthermore as already mentioned in subsection 2 1 the new version of cln package specifically updated for this study allows the user to include the hdpe thickness although cln elements are 1d together with the hdpe thermal conductivity and the convective heat transfer coefficient the solver used for the numerical simulations is the sparse matrix solver sms which includes a total variation diminishing tvd scheme to control numerical dispersion in the advection term an adaptive time stepping solution was selected automatically adapting the time step length to satisfy the courant number constraints the computational time of each simulation is lower than 1 min for any groundwater flow velocity intel r core tm i9 9900k cpu 3 60 ghz in angelotti et al 2014a the authors simulated the constant heat rate operation of the bhe maintaining the heat carrier fluid circulation by means of constant head ch condition at the inlet and outlet of the u pipe and subdividing the total duration of the trt into multiple simulations during each simulation the inlet fluid temperature was defined as a function of the outlet fluid temperature at the last time step of the previous simulation using the equation 1 t in n t out n 1 q m c w where q w is the constant heat rate injected into the ground m kg s is the mass flow rate into the bhe and cw j kg k is the specific heat capacity of the heat carrier fluid this manual methodology caused a high computational load and a significant loss of time to adapt each simulation differently the new procedure here discussed leads to a rapid automatic approach using the drt package for both circulating the heat carrier fluid and maintaining a constant heat rate injection during the test the user needs to specify the flow rate circulating in the pipe table 1 the inlet and the outlet u tube nodes where water is injected and extracted and the temperature difference to add to the fluid before its re injection in order to maintain a constant heat rate of 40 w m the case study implemented in modflow usg corresponds to the synthetic model discussed in angelotti et al 2014a it includes a bhe in a homogeneous saturated sandy and non dispersive aquifer the bhe features are provided in table 1 the presence of the borehole filling material does not significantly influence neither the energy exchange nor the temperature profile into the aquifer alberti et al 2017 2016 therefore the thermal properties of the grout material are assumed equal to the surrounding soil in both models the dimensions of the modeling domain are equal to angelotti et al 2014a whereas the grid discretization is different the quadtree refinement is used fig 2 to refine the cells only in the proximity of the bhe as already applied in antelmi et al 2021 the groundwater flow direction is set through a constant head condition applied to the right and left boundaries cells and it results in west to east the same boundary condition is assigned to set a constant unperturbed temperature equal to 11 8 c corresponding to the unperturbed temperature used in angelotti et al 2014a the thermal dispersion term is set equal to zero since dispersion is generally neglected for the heat transport in aquifer and is not even implemented into analytical solutions hydrological and thermal properties of the model from angelotti et al 2014a are listed in table 2 2 4 grid sensitivity analysis for different darcy velocities the added value of this research depends not only on the innovations to the drt and cln packages in modflow usg but also crucially on the different grid refinements tested to achieve the best solution under different velocity regimes a total of 16 different models are implemented combining 4 minimum cell size values and 4 darcy velocities numerical model s nomenclature and characteristics are listed in table 3 the horizontal grid is characterized by a local refinement around the bhe implemented through a quadtree approach with a minimum cell size inside the refinement box ranging from 0 5 cm fig 3 a to 50 cm fig 3d and a maximum one outside the box ranging between 32 cm fig 3a and 100 cm fig 3c d quadtree refinement is a straightforward way to focus resolution in areas of interest implementing a finer grid with different levels of detail panday et al 2013 the user can specify a maximum number of seven concentric zones where the starting grid of the model is refined with a degree of detail increasing with the number of the zones antelmi et al 2021 the two cln wells are implemented in two different adjacent cells to avoid numerical issues and as they do not need to be placed at the grid nodes but can be placed at any coordinate it is possible to maintain a pipe to pipe centers distance of 6 cm for any grid geometry each model consists of 20 layers with a thickness of 9 or 10 m for a total thickness of 200 m clearly the model thickness was set greater than the bhe length 100 m to avoid any influence of the bottom boundary condition which is a no flow and no energy exchange type the first layer and the one containing the cln polyline the tube elbow thickness is about 1 m the refinement in correspondence of these two layers proved to be fundamental to apply the 40 w m required thermal power the applied groundwater flow velocities values vary from 0 to 10 5 m s to reproduce the typical range of velocities in hydrogeological natural systems the trt usually lasts no more than 72 h but here longer durations are simulated up to 60 days this is consistent with the study performed by angelotti et al 2014a where the duration was chosen to achieve steady state conditions in the aquifer temperature field 2 5 numerical model validation brunetti et al 2017 brunetti et al 2017 the numerical model is validated by comparison with analytical results obtained from ils and mls approaches as done in angelotti et al 2014a to verify the accuracy and validate the 16 numerical trt simulated in modflow usg a comparison between the two approaches was conducted in terms of aquifer temperature values downstream of the bhe temperature values are recorded at different time steps implementing 11 observation wells distributed at distances ranging from 0 2 m to 5 8 m from bhe center fig 4 each monitoring well has a depth that reaches to the elbow of the heat exchanger according to the choice of angelotti et al 2014a temperatures refer to a representative depth of 35 m the validation process aims to evaluate the divergence between numerical and analytical results in energy terms through 4 steps 1 evaluation through the numerical model of the aquifer temperature values in correspondence of 11 monitoring wells fig 4 at different time steps tsub num xi y 0 tk 2 evaluation through the analytical models ils mls of the aquifer temperature values downstream of the bhe tsub an xi y 0 tk 3 computation of the deviation between numerical and analytical solution in terms of root mean squared error rmse at every time step 4 minimization of the rmse through the fminsearch matlab function using the specific heat rate in the ils mls model as the minimization parameter the achieved thermal power per unit length named qfit along with the one simulated numerically qnum allows to calculate an index of accuracy δq of the numerical model as in angelotti et al 2014a to evaluate the efficiency of the heat exchange of the new approach thus further supporting the use of this tool for the typical operation of a bhe the same index is here calculated as 2 δ q q fit q num q num 100 for a complete view of the new suggested approach the results are also discussed in terms of heat carrier fluid mean temperature and aquifer temperature highlighting their dependence on the horizontal discretization and on the groundwater flow velocity implemented extracting the temperature at the bhe inlet and outlet nodes and computing the arithmetic mean for each time step the mean fluid temperature tf is calculated as 3 t f t k t in t k t out t k 2 finally the results of the validation process are shown and compared with those achieved in angelotti et al 2014a through the ma models table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 heat carrier fluid mean temperature grid sensitivity analysis for different darcy velocities the simulations were run under transient regime with different durations according to the different groundwater flow as explained in subsection 2 4 from the results an estimate of the heat carrier fluid temperature along the bhe depth of the aquifer temperature downstream of the bhe and of the temperature variations during test time were obtained the exchanged energy between bhe and aquifer was maintained constant and equal to 4000 w by the regulation of inlet and outlet cells at the first layer of the u shape pipe the heat carrier fluid temperature analysis along the bhe depth is essential to understand how the energy exchange between bhe and ground layers varies along the vertical in fig 5 the trend of the heat carrier fluid temperature tf as a function of time is shown for darcy velocity equal to 10 5 m s a 10 6 m s b 10 7 m s c and null d due to the change in horizontal grid discretization around the bhe for a given groundwater flow velocity e g 10 7 m s fig 5c lower fluid temperatures are found as the minimum cell size increases considering the models cln 5 fig 5a related to darcy velocity equal to 10 5 m s at the end of the simulation tf assumes values equal to 20 4 17 8 15 9 and 15 7 c respectively for minimum cell size equal to 0 5 6 25 and 50 cm on the other hand as a result of the change in the plume shape around the bhe for a given minimum cell size e g 0 5 cm fluid temperatures increase as the darcy velocity decreases clearly the dependence of the mean fluid temperature on the grid refinement is non physical while the dependence on the darcy velocity is physically based table 4 shows the main results heat carrier fluid mean temperature tf difference between inlet and outlet fluid temperature δt from bhe specific heat rate qnum and variation from the design value of 40 w m at the last time step of each simulation despite the strong dependence of the heat carrier fluid temperatures on the horizontal discretization the average heat rate per unit length qnum exchanged during the entire simulation differs by a few percentage points from the one imposed by the drt package a maximum deviation of 3 8 is obtained for the cln 50 5 model related to the greatest minimum cell size equal to 50 cm and to the maximum darcy velocity the heat carrier fluid temperature distribution along the vertical at the last time step for each numerical model depending on flow velocity is observed in fig 6 the graphs display the temperatures of the delivery pipe on the decreasing branch of the curve right side and the ones of the return pipe on the increasing one left side as expected the analysis confirms the behaviors described above models with finer grids are characterized by higher temperatures i e cln 0 5 and cln 6 when a higher groundwater flow is implemented at the same spatial discretization temperatures are lower i e cln 5 and cln 6 the correct behavior of heat carrier fluid temperature as a function of depth should exhibit a decrease both during the descent and the ascent phases for any groundwater flow velocities the fig 6 shows that the models with groundwater flow velocity equal to 0 m s and 10 7m s for each grid discretization implemented simulate the correct temperature distribution in the bhe on the contrary models with darcy velocity equal to 10 5 and 10 6 m s simulate heat transport less accurately for 25 and 50 cm size cases in detail temperature values along the return pipe stop decreasing as they proceed towards the ground level assuming in some cases a constant temperature value cln 25 6 and cln 50 6 or in other cases a progressively slightly increasing value cln 25 5 and cln 50 5 an explanation to this behavior can be achieved looking at the grid spacing the heat exchange in the cln domain is affected by temperatures calculated in gwf cells outside the cln cells area located around the bhe therefore the implementation of different horizontal discretization leads to a different number of gwf cells between the delivery and return pipes of the u shaped bhe as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 for models with a minimum cell size of 0 5 cm 12 cells are present between the inlet and outlet pipes cells whereas for the remaining models these cln nodes are placed into two adjacent gwf cells the presence of multiple cells between the two pipes provides an accurate interpolation between adjacent cells able to detect the temperature increase occurring in that specific portion of the domain thus the cln nodes that identify the return pipe are in contact with colder cells than those around the delivery pipe exchanging heat with the gwf domain nearby this progressively decreases the heat carrier fluid temperature and provides a correct distribution of fluid temperature along the depth on the other hand when the u pipe extreme cells are adjacent fig 7b the heat exchange occurs between a very warm cell inlet and a very cold one outlet hindering an accurate simulation of the temperature distribution among nodes inside the bhe as expected the behavior is more emphasized as the minimum cell size and the groundwater flow velocity increase 3 2 aquifer temperature grid sensitivity analysis for different darcy velocities the horizontal thermal aquifer profile is reported in fig 8 where temperature values are extracted at difference distances downgradient from the bhe in correspondence of 11 observation points shown in fig 4 at the last time step of each simulation this allows to analyze the groundwater thermal perturbation around the bhe the constant heat rate injection for each simulation is defined in table 4 qnum the graphs show that as groundwater flow increases i e cln 5 and cln 6 the thermal plume moves downstream more quickly perturbating the aquifer even in the area farthest from the u tube models with groundwater flow velocity equal to 10 7 and 0 m s i e cln 7 and cln 0 show higher temperatures around the bhe and a less extended thermal plume which leads to the natural groundwater temperature in the first meters downstream the horizontal grid discretization exerts an influence on aquifer temperatures which is greater in the first 3 m downstream and in models characterized by a higher groundwater velocity in detail models more affected by the spatial discretization are those with minimum cell size equal to 25 and 50 cm cln 25 5 cln 25 6 cln 50 5 and cln 50 6 when groundwater flow velocity decreases the influence of the horizontal grid discretization is detectable only with models with a minimum cell size of 50 cm cln 50 7 and cln 50 0 inside the gwf domain the heat exchange computed between adjacent cells is strictly related to the resolution of the model grid as discussed for the heat carrier fluid temperature results when the domain grid is highly refined the heat exchange between adjacent nodes is more precise thus maintaining higher temperatures around the bhe and simulating an accurate thermal plume regardless of the darcy velocity implemented in the model in contrast in wider grids nodes are placed at greater distances so temperature values are averaged over larger cells therefore these models are associated with globally lower aquifer temperatures near the bhe especially for advection dominated models 3 3 validation against analytical solution to assess the robustness of the new numerical modeling approach a comparison with analytical solutions is performed such as discussed in literature as already described in subsection 2 5 ils and mls analytical solutions are implemented to perform a comparison both with the purely conductive and the advective case in terms of aquifer temperatures fig 8 and equivalent exchanged heat rate table 5 the constant input heat rate value set in each analytical solution is the exchanged amount by the corresponding numerical model shown in table 4 as qnum this choice allows to compare groundwater temperatures when numerical model and analytical solution have the exact same value of input heat rate in fig 9 the aquifer temperature values are considered at the same domain points between numerical and analytical solution from 20 cm to 6 m downgradient of the bhe for different groundwater flows the results are shown at the last time step of each simulation based on different groundwater flow velocities for models with a minimum cell size of 0 5 cm and 6 cm fig 9a b a good agreement is achieved between the analytical and numerical temperature profiles for each groundwater flow velocity with deviations lower than 0 2 c in absolute value in contrast models with a minimum cell size of 25 cm and 50 cm fig 9c d are associated with greater deviations in particular in fig 9c higher errors are achieved near the bhe for higher darcy velocities cln 25 5 and cln 25 6 fig 8d shows larger deviations for all groundwater velocities with greater errors associated with velocity of 10 5 and 10 6 m s the maximum deviation equal to 1 4 c is registered for model cln 50 6 these results are in accordance with those discussed in subsection 3 2 the main deviations between analytical and numerical results were found in cln 25 5 cln 25 6 and cln 50 models less accurate in the first 2 m downstream of the bhe because of the wider grid discretization table 5 shows the results of the validation process in terms of qfit and index of accuracy δq previously defined eq 2 as expected cln 0 5 and cln 6 models accurately simulate the constant heat rate injection results regardless of the groundwater flow value implemented producing a maximum relative discrepancy between qnum and qfit in absolute terms equal to 1 3 in energy terms models with a minimum cell size equal to 0 5 cm and 6 cm show an excellent agreement with the analytical solution both in the purely conductive case and in the advective ones on the other hand cln 25 and cln 50 models show higher percentage errors for groundwater flow velocity equal to 10 5 and 10 6 m s with a maximum overestimation equal to 27 4 therefore for the same models a better agreement with the analytical solution is highlighted when the transport is mainly conductive furthermore the results in table 5 show that cln 0 5 and cln 6 models reach a better agreement with the analytical solution than ma model for all the analyzed groundwater velocities the improvement is more noteworthy for the high darcy cases namely 10 6 and 10 5 m s therefore the new approach confirms and improves the results shown in angelotti et al 2014a although the simulation runtimes with the new techniques are shorter although the validation process has shown errors below 5 even for cln 25 7 cln 25 0 and cln 50 0 models the most suitable models for the trt numerical simulation regardless of darcy velocity are the ones with a minimum cell size equal to 0 5 and 6 cm indeed the use of minimum cell sizes ensures both to keep the heat rate constant over the time and to accurately simulate the heat exchange inside the aquifer and the u pipe 4 conclusions over the past decade progress achieved in numerical codes for simulating groundwater flow in porous media and related processes led to an increasing use of numerical models as alternative tools to analytical ones for thermal response tests interpretation and typical bhe simulation starting from the results discussed in antelmi et al 2021 this study upgrades the modflow usg cln package in order to improve its capability in simulating bhe and mainly focusing on the possibility to implement a numerical trt into the control volume finite difference this has been achieved using a new approach based on cln and drt packages to support the study the proposed methodology is tested considering the detailed numerical model described in angelotti et al 2014a and well known analytical models ils and mls in the present study 16 numerical models are implemented by combining four different darcy velocities ranging from 0 to 10 5 m s representing a broad range of groundwater velocities in aquifers and four minimum cell sizes in the horizontal grid discretization around the bhe ranging from 0 5 to 50 cm quadtree refinement around the bhe a special tool to refine grid available for modflow usg is implemented to lighten the computational load each model implements a uniform non dispersive geologic medium with the same hydrogeologic and thermal properties defined in angelotti et al 2014a where a vertical bhe consisting of a single hdpe u tube is implemented the results show that the new approach correctly simulates a constant heat rate operation typical of a trt procedure maintaining constant the exchanged heat rate between the bhe and the surrounding aquifer over the time for the more refined grid models the average heat rate corresponding to the entire simulation deviates less than 2 from the design heat rate imposed by the drt package nevertheless the implementation of coarse grids can lead to an underestimation of the heat carrier fluid mean temperature and in the case of higher darcy velocities to an approximate heat exchange between the bhe and the aquifer moreover coarser grids tend to distort the profile of the thermal plume that develops in the first 2 3 m downstream of the u pipe these results suggest that for darcy velocities higher than 10 6 m s the grid refinement around the borehole radius should be on the order of 6 cm to accurately investigate the thermal behavior of the aquifer in the first 3 m surrounding the bhe when conducting a trt simulation in case of lower velocities a grid size of 25 cm can be adequate in fact the validation process proved that models with minimum cell sizes of 0 5 and 6 cm accurately simulate constant heat rate operation both in the purely conductive case and for groundwater velocities between 10 7 and 10 5 m s while less stringent refinements do not work optimally when the advective component is prevalent by way of contrast when the aim of the study is mostly to assess the thermal impact in the aquifer beyond 3 m downstream of the bhe a refinement in between 25 and 50 cm is appropriate moreover since the comparison with the results discussed in angelotti et al 2014a showed for fine grids lower errors for all the darcy velocities analyzed a trt implementation or a bhe standard operation in modflow usg allows quicker more efficient and accurate simulations than those performed in previous studies with modflow and mt3dms overall the results achieved confirm the issues discussed in al khoury et al 2005 florides et al 2012 lamarche et al 2010 raymond et al 2011 signorelli et al 2007 the implementation of a pseudo 3d model lightens considerably the computational load of numerical models representing gshp systems while guaranteeing a good accuracy in the results and providing the further possibility to implement the operation of many bhes within the same modeling domain future developments of this study will result in applying the proposed method to the simulation of real world tests either conventional or innovative enhanced trt to demonstrate its potential as a reliable trt interpretation tool as the installation of gshp systems will become more frequent according to the decarbonization processes progressing in europe the results of the modeling approach presented will provide efficient and reliable support in optimizing the design of geothermal borefields finally having lightened the computational load and demonstrated the good accuracy of the results from now on it will be possible to apply modflow usg to forecast the thermal impact of multiple geothermal plants at community urban scale where many bhes are operating as in the major european cities these energy systems are continuously growing this will represent an important tool to identify potential overlapping of thermal plumes allowing the regulatory authorities to manage this underground energy resource in a sustainable way avoiding its over exploitation over the foreseeable future credit authorship contribution statement sara barbieri

2752,in recent years among renewable energies the geothermal resource exploitation shows a constant growth specifically in countries engaged in co2 emissions reduction and dependent on energy from abroad the low temperature geothermal energy geo exchange for air conditioning of buildings represents a cost effective and green solution in closed loop systems borehole heat exchangers bhe are coupled with ground source heat pumps gshp constituting the key component of the heating ventilation air conditioning hvac system therefore the design of the bhe and the correct interpretation of in

procedure 1 introduction eu legislation evolved significantly to achieve the eu paris agreement commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by setting through ec 2018 2001 directive the share of renewable energy by 2030 equal to 32 of final energy consumption as buildings are responsible for around 36 of energy consumption and for 34 of co2 emissions in europe european comission 2021 in 2016 through the clean energy for all europeans package it was possible to target the efficiency improvement of new and existing buildings by requiring an annual increase in the heating and cooling use of renewables of about 1 3 since ground source heat pump gshp and groundwater heat pump gwhp systems are among the cleanest and most energy efficient heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems

heat from the ground during the cold season and inject it during the warm one lyu et al 2020 on the other hand gwhp systems are based on injecting and extracting wells open loop system similar to those generally used for pump treat systems antelmi et al 2020b except that in this case water is used to produce energy the coefficient of performance cop of these systems reaches higher values than conventional air source heat pumps since the ground is often cooler in summer and warmer in winter than the air temperature li et al 2014 gshp systems performance and design is highly dependent on the heat transfer capability between the bhe and the subsoil and thus the estimate of the thermal subsoil properties is essential pambou et al 2022 the execution of the so called thermal response test trt on subsoil is always recommended for a better hvac system design and sometimes it is also mandatory e g in lombardy region italy a trt is required regione lombardia 2010 for gshp systems with heat rate greater than 50 kw this test is performed to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity of the soil λeff and the borehole thermal resistance rb gehlin 2002 spitler and gehlin 2015 zhang et al 2014 it is carried out on a pilot bhe connected to a testing unit and is performed by supplying a constant heat rate to the circulating fluid by means of an electrical resistance naldi and zanchini 2019 inlet and outlet fluid temperatures are recorded throughout the test along with water flow rate electrical power related to the thermal resistance and external air temperature blasi and menichetti 2012 stated that the standard deviation of the thermal conductivity is equal to 15 when the test is conducted with a duration of about 20 h whereas it is reduced to 5 for a test lasting about 50 h the presence of groundwater flow could complicate the assessment of the thermal conductivity so that performing the test over 72 h is suggested indeed over that time the available literature suggests that the ground response to the thermal excitation achieves a steady state condition for all aquifers that have been studied antelmi et al 2021 beier 2021 nieto et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 different approaches can be applied to the analysis of the experimental data recorded during the trt both simplified analytical models banks 2012 carlslaw and jaeger 1959 diao et al 2004 molina giraldo et al 2011 pasquier and lamarche 2022 and more complex numerical models allowing to include more elements that influence test results casasso et al 2017 casasso and sethi 2014 zong et al 2021 due to their simple mathematical formulation and to the limited number of input parameters the analytical models of the infinite line source ils and the moving line source mls are the most common approaches adopted for the interpretation of trt data carlslaw and jaeger 1959 diao et al 2004 both models assume the gshp system as an infinite linear heat source exchanging heat with the homogeneous and isotropic surrounding ground with a constant heat flux per unit length bandos et al 2009 eskilson 1987 man et al 2010 zeng et al 2002 the difference between the two models is that the ils assumes pure conduction in the ground whereas the mls also considers the advection term due to groundwater flow therefore the ils model application is restricted to the geological sites where groundwater flow is absent or negligible otherwise a more suitable solution is the mls diao et al 2004 sutton et al 2003 wagner et al 2013 in the end applying both the ils and mls only an effective value of the thermal conductivity for the entire depth of the bhe is obtained neglecting the variation along the vertical caused by a heterogeneous lithostratigraphy numerical models represent a more complex but potentially more precise solution to evaluate the correct aquifer thermal parameters attard et al 2020 fujii et al 2005 giordano et al 2021 they need more input parameters derived from a specific conceptual site model csm but they are flexible tools able to simulate non ideal conditions e g heterogeneous soils realistic surface boundary conditions geothermal gradients etc and relevant physical processes namely beside conduction advection and thermal dispersion these tools coupled with suitable parameter estimation procedures provide more accurate results antelmi et al 2020a dalla santa et al 2022 galgaro et al 2021 when reproducing a bhe in a numerical model the main components involved are characterized by different dimensions from millimetres pipe thickness to meters aquifer angelotti et al 2014a when a fully 3 d approach is applied the multiple spatial scales lead to numerical models affected by high computational loads angelotti et al 2014b developed a 3 d numerical finite difference model by means of modflow code coupled to mt3dms of a single bhe by turning its circular section to an equivalent square one although the numerical model was validated for different groundwater flow velocities its applicability was limited due to the large number of model domain cells that did not allow to represent more than one bhe marcotte and pasquier 2008 simulating the thermal behaviour of a vertical bhe implemented a 3 d finite element numerical model through the comsol code by exploiting the symmetry of the problem they were able to halve the number of cells and partially reduce the computational burden the reduction of the cells number for aquifer and bhe representation was also achieved using a 1 d shonder and beck 1999 and a 2 d numerical modelling approach berberich et al 1994 wagner and clauser 2005 or alternatively by applying a reduced order numerical approach that couples a 1 d description of the vertical pipes heat transfer with a 3 d description of the aquifer signorelli et al 2007 the latter created a finite element model of a bhe system in the fractured geological formation which is suitable to simulate coupled hydraulic and thermal processes under non steady conditions the authors used synthetic trt data from the numerical model to evaluate the sensitivity of the ils model analysis to test duration borehole length groundwater velocity and subsurface heterogeneity the model implemented 3 d elements reproducing the porous matrix around the bhe and 1 d pipe elements for the bhe implementation the heat transfer between the circulating fluid and the aquifer was simulated as a thermal resistance related to the velocity dependent heat transfer coefficient of the fluid a similar method is used also in lamarche et al 2010 to compare different empirical and theoretical approaches for the evaluation of the borehole resistance the authors implemented a 3 d numerical model in comsol reproducing the borehole by means of 1 d finite elements using the traditional advective equation another study developed in comsol is the one by bozzoli et al 2011 where a two step parameter estimation procedure tspep for the evaluation of the grout and soil thermal conductivities is validated using both simulated and experimental data as for the previous studies heat transport in the bhe was simulated through 1 d equations while heat transfer in the hydrogeological domain through 3 d equations brunetti et al 2017 šimůnek et al 2016 adopted the coupling of a 2 d domain to implement the aquifer and a 1 d domain for the bhe in the hydrus code the two domains were connected by a robin boundary condition which enabled the simulation of heat transfer between the bhe and the surrounding soil the proposed numerical trt was validated against experimental data collected in two sites in japan similar studies about pseudo 3 d models for the simulation of gshp operation are reported in al khoury et al 2005 florides et al 2012 raymond et al 2011 the aim of the present study is to provide an updated simple improved and expeditious numerical tool to analyse in situ trt through modflow specifically the version modflow usg a widely used code for modelling environmental problems in groundwater the novelty of the updated tool is the introduction into the cln package of new characteristic elements of a bhe such as the thickness and the thermal conductivity of the u pipe and the internal convective heat transfer coefficient another important improvement is the option to couple the connected linear network cln and drain return flow drt packages to simulate the heat carrier fluid circulating in the bhe and injecting a constant heat rate into the ground this allows to simulate a trt and to validate the cln approach comparing it with the available constant heat rate analytical solutions these enhancements are key to reproduce each thermal resistance between the circulating fluid and the aquifer thus accurately reproducing the heat transfer nearby the bhe through a 1 d approach for the fluid therefore besides providing an effective method to simulate and analyse a trt the proposed tool without the drt package can be used to expeditiously simulate the typical operation heating cooling of a gshp system consisting of multiple bhe avoiding numerical convergence problems in the present paper different numerical models at constant heat rate injection are developed featuring four spatial discretizations and a sensitivity analysis on groundwater velocity is performed each model is then tested against common analytical models ils and mls and compared with the numerical models discussed in angelotti et al 2014a 2 material and methods a synthetic numerical model of a single bhe with hydrogeological and thermal properties adapted from angelotti et al 2014a is implemented in modflow usg by applying the approach tested in antelmi et al 2021 the graphical user interface is groundwater vista 7 0 esi inc the cln package has been updated in some programming features compared to the version package discussed in antelmi et al 2021 whereas the drt package is specifically adapted to create a constant heat rate injection in aquifer such as in trt execution a complete description of the package modification is presented in the next pages 2 1 modflow usg and cln modflow usg panday et al 2013 is an open access numerical code for modeling groundwater flow the main advantage over previous versions of modflow is the control volume finite difference cvfd approach which is a generalization of the finite difference approach that allows the use of unstructured grids the other characteristic that distinguishes modflow usg is the solution of tightly coupled processes that interact with groundwater flow thus every equation of the model is solved in one matrix avoiding convergence problems specifically the cln package simulates one dimensional features such as pipes wells karst conduits or streams that interact with groundwater flow since its release modflow usg has been expanded to include solute and heat transport such features are available as open access software usg transport panday 2020 the heat transport package is well suited for simulating geothermal plants impacts and cln package is well suited to simulate a bhe as it was demonstrated by antelmi et al 2021 in previous works the numerical modeling of bhe with modflow mt3dms was faced for the first time by angelotti et al 2014a that paper aimed to prove the capability of these codes to model bhes with a good accuracy and to fully discuss the influence of groundwater flow on the energy performance of bhes and on the aquifer temperature distribution the u pipe geometry the thermal carrier fluid flow and aquifer temperature distribution were explicitly reproduced for the first time going beyond previous applications of numerical codes the main challenge was to correctly reproduce the bhe in a homogeneous aquifer through a square or rectangular grid classic finite difference grid of modflow 2000 to this purpose the u shape pipe was represented by a square section requiring a very fine horizontal and vertical discretization minimum cell size 0 37 cm the pipe size was derived on the assumption of conserving the total thermal resistance per unit length between circular section and square one in specific the total thermal resistance was calculated as the sum of a convective resistance and of a conductive one an extensive validation of the numerical model solutions was provided comparing them with the analytical mls solution assimilating the u pipe to an infinite line source and varying the groundwater velocity the heat exchange rate was not imposed as a boundary condition but resulted from the interaction between the bhe and the surrounding porous medium the simulation results provided an evaluation of the temperature perturbation in the aquifer improving the energy exchange estimation and providing a quantitative assessment of the heat rate increase due to groundwater flow cln elements can be vertical horizontal or inclined and can have rectangular or circular shaped cross sectional geometries their connection for flow and transport to groundwater flow gwf cells occurs through analytic equations that include skin efficiency factor considerations modflow usg accommodates vertical horizontal or angled cln elements groundwater vistas allows for input of cln as a cln well or a cln polyline the former is vertical and used to represent vertical conduits e g a well while cln polylines can be implemented at any angle e g hydraulic pipes in the current implementation the cln polyline is used to connect 2 vertical cln wells to reproduce the real geometry u shape pipe of the bhe fig 1 additional enhancements have been applied to the bhe simulation process since the discussions in antelmi et al 2021 specifically three characteristic parameters of the bhe are introduced in the numerical code the u pipe i e high density polyethylene thickness the u pipe thermal conductivity the internal convective heat transfer coefficient when the aim of the numerical simulation is to describe what happens into the bhe and the cells strictly surrounding it these parameters need to be considered the enhancement improves the accuracy of the numerical representation of the bhe and the heat transport between groundwater and bhe the net thermal resistance between aquifer and bhe is a sum of 2 resistances the conductive resistance offered by the bhe pipe wall and the convective one related to the bhe circulating fluid the latter is depending on the convective heat transfer coefficient that is linked to the inner diameter of the bhe tube to the fluid flow rate and regime laminar or turbulent another enhancement to the modflow usg software specific for the implementation of bhes and the simulation of a trt was to provide appropriate boundary conditions to the inlet and outlet of the bhe tube as discussed below 2 2 boundary conditions for the bhe modflow usg includes several packages to provide boundary conditions to a simulation these boundary conditions can be applied to the gwf and or the cln domains for instance a flow rate and a temperature may be provided at the inlet of the bhe tube and the code will compute the flow rate and temperature at the outlet for a bhe the outflow rate will be equal to the inflow rate which may be applied as an outflow boundary condition if the flow in the bhe tube is at steady state conditions a reference head is required for a unique solution to the flow in the bhe tube thus a prescribed source flux may be provided at the inflow end at the outflow end a reference head may be provided to allow the bhe fluid to exit it can be any value above the top of the model domain such that the tube remains fully saturated at the outlet point typical operation of a trt requires a constant heat rate injection thus the temperature at the outlet of the bhe is at a constant differential from the temperature at the inlet the drt package available in modflow usg transport was modified to accommodate this condition this package was developed to extract water from cells characterized as a drain and re inject all or part of it into another cell this feature was expanded for use with solute and heat transport problems it allows to link the solute concentration or temperature extracted from the drain cell which can be the cln cell representing the borehole outlet with that of re injected water into the cln cell representing the borehole inlet by using the bhe outlet as a drain cell and the bhe inlet as a re injection cell it is possible to create a closed loop circuit as in a trt or in the common operation of a bhe since a reference head is required in the bhe for a steady state solution an option is provided which allows for extraction of water under a cauchy boundary condition which provides the reference head in the drt package file the reference head and the return flow rate are then set by the user and supplied to the bhe outlet and inlet cln nodes respectively to provide the appropriate flow within the bhe tube this case is called the ghb q condition and is identified by providing a negative conductance factor in the drt package input file panday et al 2013 the value is converted to positive internally in the code a temperature difference δt can then be forced between the outflow and inflow such that the system operates under a constant heat rate the heating power actually depends on the mass flow rate of the heat transfer fluid on its heat capacity per unit mass and on the temperature difference δt since the mass flow rate and the heat capacity are constant over time δt is the only quantity that must be forced to remain constant during the simulation this requirement can be satisfied within the drt input file where a fixed temperature increase can be added to the drained temperature before reapplying the water flow rate at the return flow location this procedure allows an automatic implementation of the δt thus overcoming the method adopted so far with modflow mt3dms which required the simulation to be interrupted many times to manually adjust this parameter therefore to properly use the drt package the following information must be introduced into the input data file the node number of the inlet and outlet cell of the bhe the elevation of the water level for the ghb q condition the flux rate applied to the return flow node and the fixed temperature increase at the bhe inlet node 2 3 numerical model implementation three main features are essential to numerically reproduce a conventional trt the real pipe circular section of the bhe he circulation of the fluid inside the bhe a constant heat rate injection into the ground during the test when the numerical code involves only rectangular or square cells such as modflow and mt3dms the circular geometry of the bhe must be approximated through an equivalence with a square or rectangular one angelotti et al used this approach with good results angelotti et al 2014a although with a big effort in terms of computational load and implementation times running the numerical model for one specific groundwater flow velocity required more than 1 day for an expert user and a significant effort to find the right combination of numerical solver parameters to achieve convergence in specific each square section of the bhe pipe consisted of 36 cells reproducing the heat carrier fluid surrounded by 0 37 cm cells representing the hdpe the u shaped elbow was implemented through two outer horizontal layers with a thickness of 0 37 cm and one in the center of 3 36 cm differently in the present study the bhe is implemented in accordance with the approach proposed and validated by antelmi et al 2021 by means of three analytical elements two cln wells representing the inlet and outlet pipes and one horizontal cln polyline implementing the elbow of the u tube since all these elements are circular this approach better reproduces the real geometry of the system while the unstructured grid approach allows to use a coarse grid more details in subsection 2 4 furthermore as already mentioned in subsection 2 1 the new version of cln package specifically updated for this study allows the user to include the hdpe thickness although cln elements are 1d together with the hdpe thermal conductivity and the convective heat transfer coefficient the solver used for the numerical simulations is the sparse matrix solver sms which includes a total variation diminishing tvd scheme to control numerical dispersion in the advection term an adaptive time stepping solution was selected automatically adapting the time step length to satisfy the courant number constraints the computational time of each simulation is lower than 1 min for any groundwater flow velocity intel r core tm i9 9900k cpu 3 60 ghz in angelotti et al 2014a the authors simulated the constant heat rate operation of the bhe maintaining the heat carrier fluid circulation by means of constant head ch condition at the inlet and outlet of the u pipe and subdividing the total duration of the trt into multiple simulations during each simulation the inlet fluid temperature was defined as a function of the outlet fluid temperature at the last time step of the previous simulation using the equation 1 t in n t out n 1 q m c w where q w is the constant heat rate injected into the ground m kg s is the mass flow rate into the bhe and cw j kg k is the specific heat capacity of the heat carrier fluid this manual methodology caused a high computational load and a significant loss of time to adapt each simulation differently the new procedure here discussed leads to a rapid automatic approach using the drt package for both circulating the heat carrier fluid and maintaining a constant heat rate injection during the test the user needs to specify the flow rate circulating in the pipe table 1 the inlet and the outlet u tube nodes where water is injected and extracted and the temperature difference to add to the fluid before its re injection in order to maintain a constant heat rate of 40 w m the case study implemented in modflow usg corresponds to the synthetic model discussed in angelotti et al 2014a it includes a bhe in a homogeneous saturated sandy and non dispersive aquifer the bhe features are provided in table 1 the presence of the borehole filling material does not significantly influence neither the energy exchange nor the temperature profile into the aquifer alberti et al 2017 2016 therefore the thermal properties of the grout material are assumed equal to the surrounding soil in both models the dimensions of the modeling domain are equal to angelotti et al 2014a whereas the grid discretization is different the quadtree refinement is used fig 2 to refine the cells only in the proximity of the bhe as already applied in antelmi et al 2021 the groundwater flow direction is set through a constant head condition applied to the right and left boundaries cells and it results in west to east the same boundary condition is assigned to set a constant unperturbed temperature equal to 11 8 c corresponding to the unperturbed temperature used in angelotti et al 2014a the thermal dispersion term is set equal to zero since dispersion is generally neglected for the heat transport in aquifer and is not even implemented into analytical solutions hydrological and thermal properties of the model from angelotti et al 2014a are listed in table 2 2 4 grid sensitivity analysis for different darcy velocities the added value of this research depends not only on the innovations to the drt and cln packages in modflow usg but also crucially on the different grid refinements tested to achieve the best solution under different velocity regimes a total of 16 different models are implemented combining 4 minimum cell size values and 4 darcy velocities numerical model s nomenclature and characteristics are listed in table 3 the horizontal grid is characterized by a local refinement around the bhe implemented through a quadtree approach with a minimum cell size inside the refinement box ranging from 0 5 cm fig 3 a to 50 cm fig 3d and a maximum one outside the box ranging between 32 cm fig 3a and 100 cm fig 3c d quadtree refinement is a straightforward way to focus resolution in areas of interest implementing a finer grid with different levels of detail panday et al 2013 the user can specify a maximum number of seven concentric zones where the starting grid of the model is refined with a degree of detail increasing with the number of the zones antelmi et al 2021 the two cln wells are implemented in two different adjacent cells to avoid numerical issues and as they do not need to be placed at the grid nodes but can be placed at any coordinate it is possible to maintain a pipe to pipe centers distance of 6 cm for any grid geometry each model consists of 20 layers with a thickness of 9 or 10 m for a total thickness of 200 m clearly the model thickness was set greater than the bhe length 100 m to avoid any influence of the bottom boundary condition which is a no flow and no energy exchange type the first layer and the one containing the cln polyline the tube elbow thickness is about 1 m the refinement in correspondence of these two layers proved to be fundamental to apply the 40 w m required thermal power the applied groundwater flow velocities values vary from 0 to 10 5 m s to reproduce the typical range of velocities in hydrogeological natural systems the trt usually lasts no more than 72 h but here longer durations are simulated up to 60 days this is consistent with the study performed by angelotti et al 2014a where the duration was chosen to achieve steady state conditions in the aquifer temperature field 2 5 numerical model validation brunetti et al 2017 brunetti et al 2017 the numerical model is validated by comparison with analytical results obtained from ils and mls approaches as done in angelotti et al 2014a to verify the accuracy and validate the 16 numerical trt simulated in modflow usg a comparison between the two approaches was conducted in terms of aquifer temperature values downstream of the bhe temperature values are recorded at different time steps implementing 11 observation wells distributed at distances ranging from 0 2 m to 5 8 m from bhe center fig 4 each monitoring well has a depth that reaches to the elbow of the heat exchanger according to the choice of angelotti et al 2014a temperatures refer to a representative depth of 35 m the validation process aims to evaluate the divergence between numerical and analytical results in energy terms through 4 steps 1 evaluation through the numerical model of the aquifer temperature values in correspondence of 11 monitoring wells fig 4 at different time steps tsub num xi y 0 tk 2 evaluation through the analytical models ils mls of the aquifer temperature values downstream of the bhe tsub an xi y 0 tk 3 computation of the deviation between numerical and analytical solution in terms of root mean squared error rmse at every time step 4 minimization of the rmse through the fminsearch matlab function using the specific heat rate in the ils mls model as the minimization parameter the achieved thermal power per unit length named qfit along with the one simulated numerically qnum allows to calculate an index of accuracy δq of the numerical model as in angelotti et al 2014a to evaluate the efficiency of the heat exchange of the new approach thus further supporting the use of this tool for the typical operation of a bhe the same index is here calculated as 2 δ q q fit q num q num 100 for a complete view of the new suggested approach the results are also discussed in terms of heat carrier fluid mean temperature and aquifer temperature highlighting their dependence on the horizontal discretization and on the groundwater flow velocity implemented extracting the temperature at the bhe inlet and outlet nodes and computing the arithmetic mean for each time step the mean fluid temperature tf is calculated as 3 t f t k t in t k t out t k 2 finally the results of the validation process are shown and compared with those achieved in angelotti et al 2014a through the ma models table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 heat carrier fluid mean temperature grid sensitivity analysis for different darcy velocities the simulations were run under transient regime with different durations according to the different groundwater flow as explained in subsection 2 4 from the results an estimate of the heat carrier fluid temperature along the bhe depth of the aquifer temperature downstream of the bhe and of the temperature variations during test time were obtained the exchanged energy between bhe and aquifer was maintained constant and equal to 4000 w by the regulation of inlet and outlet cells at the first layer of the u shape pipe the heat carrier fluid temperature analysis along the bhe depth is essential to understand how the energy exchange between bhe and ground layers varies along the vertical in fig 5 the trend of the heat carrier fluid temperature tf as a function of time is shown for darcy velocity equal to 10 5 m s a 10 6 m s b 10 7 m s c and null d due to the change in horizontal grid discretization around the bhe for a given groundwater flow velocity e g 10 7 m s fig 5c lower fluid temperatures are found as the minimum cell size increases considering the models cln 5 fig 5a related to darcy velocity equal to 10 5 m s at the end of the simulation tf assumes values equal to 20 4 17 8 15 9 and 15 7 c respectively for minimum cell size equal to 0 5 6 25 and 50 cm on the other hand as a result of the change in the plume shape around the bhe for a given minimum cell size e g 0 5 cm fluid temperatures increase as the darcy velocity decreases clearly the dependence of the mean fluid temperature on the grid refinement is non physical while the dependence on the darcy velocity is physically based table 4 shows the main results heat carrier fluid mean temperature tf difference between inlet and outlet fluid temperature δt from bhe specific heat rate qnum and variation from the design value of 40 w m at the last time step of each simulation despite the strong dependence of the heat carrier fluid temperatures on the horizontal discretization the average heat rate per unit length qnum exchanged during the entire simulation differs by a few percentage points from the one imposed by the drt package a maximum deviation of 3 8 is obtained for the cln 50 5 model related to the greatest minimum cell size equal to 50 cm and to the maximum darcy velocity the heat carrier fluid temperature distribution along the vertical at the last time step for each numerical model depending on flow velocity is observed in fig 6 the graphs display the temperatures of the delivery pipe on the decreasing branch of the curve right side and the ones of the return pipe on the increasing one left side as expected the analysis confirms the behaviors described above models with finer grids are characterized by higher temperatures i e cln 0 5 and cln 6 when a higher groundwater flow is implemented at the same spatial discretization temperatures are lower i e cln 5 and cln 6 the correct behavior of heat carrier fluid temperature as a function of depth should exhibit a decrease both during the descent and the ascent phases for any groundwater flow velocities the fig 6 shows that the models with groundwater flow velocity equal to 0 m s and 10 7m s for each grid discretization implemented simulate the correct temperature distribution in the bhe on the contrary models with darcy velocity equal to 10 5 and 10 6 m s simulate heat transport less accurately for 25 and 50 cm size cases in detail temperature values along the return pipe stop decreasing as they proceed towards the ground level assuming in some cases a constant temperature value cln 25 6 and cln 50 6 or in other cases a progressively slightly increasing value cln 25 5 and cln 50 5 an explanation to this behavior can be achieved looking at the grid spacing the heat exchange in the cln domain is affected by temperatures calculated in gwf cells outside the cln cells area located around the bhe therefore the implementation of different horizontal discretization leads to a different number of gwf cells between the delivery and return pipes of the u shaped bhe as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 for models with a minimum cell size of 0 5 cm 12 cells are present between the inlet and outlet pipes cells whereas for the remaining models these cln nodes are placed into two adjacent gwf cells the presence of multiple cells between the two pipes provides an accurate interpolation between adjacent cells able to detect the temperature increase occurring in that specific portion of the domain thus the cln nodes that identify the return pipe are in contact with colder cells than those around the delivery pipe exchanging heat with the gwf domain nearby this progressively decreases the heat carrier fluid temperature and provides a correct distribution of fluid temperature along the depth on the other hand when the u pipe extreme cells are adjacent fig 7b the heat exchange occurs between a very warm cell inlet and a very cold one outlet hindering an accurate simulation of the temperature distribution among nodes inside the bhe as expected the behavior is more emphasized as the minimum cell size and the groundwater flow velocity increase 3 2 aquifer temperature grid sensitivity analysis for different darcy velocities the horizontal thermal aquifer profile is reported in fig 8 where temperature values are extracted at difference distances downgradient from the bhe in correspondence of 11 observation points shown in fig 4 at the last time step of each simulation this allows to analyze the groundwater thermal perturbation around the bhe the constant heat rate injection for each simulation is defined in table 4 qnum the graphs show that as groundwater flow increases i e cln 5 and cln 6 the thermal plume moves downstream more quickly perturbating the aquifer even in the area farthest from the u tube models with groundwater flow velocity equal to 10 7 and 0 m s i e cln 7 and cln 0 show higher temperatures around the bhe and a less extended thermal plume which leads to the natural groundwater temperature in the first meters downstream the horizontal grid discretization exerts an influence on aquifer temperatures which is greater in the first 3 m downstream and in models characterized by a higher groundwater velocity in detail models more affected by the spatial discretization are those with minimum cell size equal to 25 and 50 cm cln 25 5 cln 25 6 cln 50 5 and cln 50 6 when groundwater flow velocity decreases the influence of the horizontal grid discretization is detectable only with models with a minimum cell size of 50 cm cln 50 7 and cln 50 0 inside the gwf domain the heat exchange computed between adjacent cells is strictly related to the resolution of the model grid as discussed for the heat carrier fluid temperature results when the domain grid is highly refined the heat exchange between adjacent nodes is more precise thus maintaining higher temperatures around the bhe and simulating an accurate thermal plume regardless of the darcy velocity implemented in the model in contrast in wider grids nodes are placed at greater distances so temperature values are averaged over larger cells therefore these models are associated with globally lower aquifer temperatures near the bhe especially for advection dominated models 3 3 validation against analytical solution to assess the robustness of the new numerical modeling approach a comparison with analytical solutions is performed such as discussed in literature as already described in subsection 2 5 ils and mls analytical solutions are implemented to perform a comparison both with the purely conductive and the advective case in terms of aquifer temperatures fig 8 and equivalent exchanged heat rate table 5 the constant input heat rate value set in each analytical solution is the exchanged amount by the corresponding numerical model shown in table 4 as qnum this choice allows to compare groundwater temperatures when numerical model and analytical solution have the exact same value of input heat rate in fig 9 the aquifer temperature values are considered at the same domain points between numerical and analytical solution from 20 cm to 6 m downgradient of the bhe for different groundwater flows the results are shown at the last time step of each simulation based on different groundwater flow velocities for models with a minimum cell size of 0 5 cm and 6 cm fig 9a b a good agreement is achieved between the analytical and numerical temperature profiles for each groundwater flow velocity with deviations lower than 0 2 c in absolute value in contrast models with a minimum cell size of 25 cm and 50 cm fig 9c d are associated with greater deviations in particular in fig 9c higher errors are achieved near the bhe for higher darcy velocities cln 25 5 and cln 25 6 fig 8d shows larger deviations for all groundwater velocities with greater errors associated with velocity of 10 5 and 10 6 m s the maximum deviation equal to 1 4 c is registered for model cln 50 6 these results are in accordance with those discussed in subsection 3 2 the main deviations between analytical and numerical results were found in cln 25 5 cln 25 6 and cln 50 models less accurate in the first 2 m downstream of the bhe because of the wider grid discretization table 5 shows the results of the validation process in terms of qfit and index of accuracy δq previously defined eq 2 as expected cln 0 5 and cln 6 models accurately simulate the constant heat rate injection results regardless of the groundwater flow value implemented producing a maximum relative discrepancy between qnum and qfit in absolute terms equal to 1 3 in energy terms models with a minimum cell size equal to 0 5 cm and 6 cm show an excellent agreement with the analytical solution both in the purely conductive case and in the advective ones on the other hand cln 25 and cln 50 models show higher percentage errors for groundwater flow velocity equal to 10 5 and 10 6 m s with a maximum overestimation equal to 27 4 therefore for the same models a better agreement with the analytical solution is highlighted when the transport is mainly conductive furthermore the results in table 5 show that cln 0 5 and cln 6 models reach a better agreement with the analytical solution than ma model for all the analyzed groundwater velocities the improvement is more noteworthy for the high darcy cases namely 10 6 and 10 5 m s therefore the new approach confirms and improves the results shown in angelotti et al 2014a although the simulation runtimes with the new techniques are shorter although the validation process has shown errors below 5 even for cln 25 7 cln 25 0 and cln 50 0 models the most suitable models for the trt numerical simulation regardless of darcy velocity are the ones with a minimum cell size equal to 0 5 and 6 cm indeed the use of minimum cell sizes ensures both to keep the heat rate constant over the time and to accurately simulate the heat exchange inside the aquifer and the u pipe 4 conclusions over the past decade progress achieved in numerical codes for simulating groundwater flow in porous media and related processes led to an increasing use of numerical models as alternative tools to analytical ones for thermal response tests interpretation and typical bhe simulation starting from the results discussed in antelmi et al 2021 this study upgrades the modflow usg cln package in order to improve its capability in simulating bhe and mainly focusing on the possibility to implement a numerical trt into the control volume finite difference this has been achieved using a new approach based on cln and drt packages to support the study the proposed methodology is tested considering the detailed numerical model described in angelotti et al 2014a and well known analytical models ils and mls in the present study 16 numerical models are implemented by combining four different darcy velocities ranging from 0 to 10 5 m s representing a broad range of groundwater velocities in aquifers and four minimum cell sizes in the horizontal grid discretization around the bhe ranging from 0 5 to 50 cm quadtree refinement around the bhe a special tool to refine grid available for modflow usg is implemented to lighten the computational load each model implements a uniform non dispersive geologic medium with the same hydrogeologic and thermal properties defined in angelotti et al 2014a where a vertical bhe consisting of a single hdpe u tube is implemented the results show that the new approach correctly simulates a constant heat rate operation typical of a trt procedure maintaining constant the exchanged heat rate between the bhe and the surrounding aquifer over the time for the more refined grid models the average heat rate corresponding to the entire simulation deviates less than 2 from the design heat rate imposed by the drt package nevertheless the implementation of coarse grids can lead to an underestimation of the heat carrier fluid mean temperature and in the case of higher darcy velocities to an approximate heat exchange between the bhe and the aquifer moreover coarser grids tend to distort the profile of the thermal plume that develops in the first 2 3 m downstream of the u pipe these results suggest that for darcy velocities higher than 10 6 m s the grid refinement around the borehole radius should be on the order of 6 cm to accurately investigate the thermal behavior of the aquifer in the first 3 m surrounding the bhe when conducting a trt simulation in case of lower velocities a grid size of 25 cm can be adequate in fact the validation process proved that models with minimum cell sizes of 0 5 and 6 cm accurately simulate constant heat rate operation both in the purely conductive case and for groundwater velocities between 10 7 and 10 5 m s while less stringent refinements do not work optimally when the advective component is prevalent by way of contrast when the aim of the study is mostly to assess the thermal impact in the aquifer beyond 3 m downstream of the bhe a refinement in between 25 and 50 cm is appropriate moreover since the comparison with the results discussed in angelotti et al 2014a showed for fine grids lower errors for all the darcy velocities analyzed a trt implementation or a bhe standard operation in modflow usg allows quicker more efficient and accurate simulations than those performed in previous studies with modflow and mt3dms overall the results achieved confirm the issues discussed in al khoury et al 2005 florides et al 2012 lamarche et al 2010 raymond et al 2011 signorelli et al 2007 the implementation of a pseudo 3d model lightens considerably the computational load of numerical models representing gshp systems while guaranteeing a good accuracy in the results and providing the further possibility to implement the operation of many bhes within the same modeling domain future developments of this study will result in applying the proposed method to the simulation of real world tests either conventional or innovative enhanced trt to demonstrate its potential as a reliable trt interpretation tool as the installation of gshp systems will become more frequent according to the decarbonization processes progressing in europe the results of the modeling approach presented will provide efficient and reliable support in optimizing the design of geothermal borefields finally having lightened the computational load and demonstrated the good accuracy of the results from now on it will be possible to apply modflow usg to forecast the thermal impact of multiple geothermal plants at community urban scale where many bhes are operating as in the major european cities these energy systems are continuously growing this will represent an important tool to identify potential overlapping of thermal plumes allowing the regulatory authorities to manage this underground energy resource in a sustainable way avoiding its over exploitation over the foreseeable future credit authorship contribution statement sara barbieri

2753,flooding is a major natural hazard that poses serious threats to lives and property safety but changes in the multidimensional behavior of global floods magnitude frequency and duration are still not well understood additionally a quantitative assessment of drivers that control multidimensional flood changes across the globe is currently unavailable here we provided a global analysis of multidimensional flood changes and then developed a new attribution framework to quantify these changes to driving factors regarding heavy rainfall antecedent wetness conditions and snowmelt changes the global assessment indicates that multidimensional floods tended to decrease during 1960 2014 attribution analysis suggested that the dominant mechanism controlling flood magnitude changes was antecedent wetness but flood frequency and duration changes were primarily driven by heavy rainfall notably the increases in multidimensional flooding were mainly caused by the increasing heavy rainfall primarily for maximum 30 day rainfall while the decreases generally followed decreasing antecedent wetness conditions snowmelt mainly controlled the decrease in multidimensional floods for the stations in high latitude regions in addition atmospheric circulation variation water storage changes catchment characteristics and dams had considerable impacts on flood changes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters worldwide resulting in more than half a million deaths over the past 30 years cred 2015 doocy et al 2013 gu et al 2020 lee et al 2018 any changes in riverine floods would significantly impact the design of flood protection measures and flood risk assessment blöschl et al 2019 although their significance for life safety and economic development is evident the reliable evaluation of global flood changes and their drivers remains challenging berghuijs et al 2019 kundzewicz et al 2017 sharma et al 2018 these facts highlight the necessity of understanding how and why floods change over time mallakpour and villarini 2015 significant progress has been made in the investigations of flood changes in different regions such as north america archfield et al 2016 hodgkins et al 2019 mallakpour and villarini 2015 musselman et al 2018 slater and villarini 2016 villarini et al 2009 europe hannaford et al 2013 hodgkins et al 2017 africa tramblay et al 2020 australia liu and zhang 2017 liu et al 2018 and asia delgado et al 2010 but there is still limited knowledge about global flood changes as previous regional studies have often used different strategies to select stations it is difficult to draw solid conclusions regarding the worldwide pattern of flood changes furthermore flood changes vary not only by region but also by the multidimensional behavior of floods e g the flood magnitude frequency and duration for example mallakpour and villarini 2015 suggested that the flood magnitude had not become more extensive but flood frequency tended to be higher across the central united states in the limited global assessments of riverine flood changes do et al 2017 milly et al 2002 slater et al 2021 only the block maxima approach bma has been adopted to extract flood magnitudes it should be noted that there are some limitations in using the bma alone as follows 1 only changes in the flood magnitude can be assessed and 2 the bma is fixed to select one flood event for a given period even though multiple floods may occur within the corresponding period liu et al 2017a the peaks over threshold sampling technique pot which identifies flood events using an optimized threshold value allows the collection of multiple floods within one year and the extraction of the frequency and duration of floods archfield et al 2016 previously based on simulated runoff from satellite microwave and water balance model outputs najibi and devineni 2018 made a global assessment of the frequency and duration of simulated floods however najibi and devineni 2018 stated that there is a certain level of epistemic uncertainty in their results which are limited by imprecision in estimating floods from remote sensing and model outputs hence multidimensional changes in riverine floods are not yet well established across the globe based on the clausius clapeyron relationship global warming will enhance the moisture holding ability of the atmosphere fowler et al 2021 sillmann et al 2013 as a result increases in heavy rainfall e g annual maximum daily rainfall have been observed in many regions around the globe asadieh and krakauer 2015 yu et al 2022 however previous studies have shown little evidence of increases in flood magnitude but have instead indicated that flood decreases were more prevalent than increases in many regions archfield et al 2016 do et al 2017 mallakpour and villarini 2015 sharma et al 2018 therefore there is an urgent need to understand why the increases in extreme rainfall have not resulted in flood increases ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko and nathan 2019 recently an increasing number of studies have focused on the dominant mechanisms of flood generation in many regions berghuijs et al 2019 berghuijs et al 2016 mao et al 2019 stein et al 2020 these studies indicated that heavy rainfall antecedent wetness conditions and snowmelt are essential in flood generating mechanisms however a framework to attribute flood changes to these mechanisms is still lacking and hence the quantitative causes of flood changes remain largely unknown although some studies have attempted to explain the causes of flood changes do et al 2020a duethmann et al 2015 blöschl et al 2019 they generally focused on a specific region and or without a quantitative evaluation to the best of our knowledge no previous study has quantified the response of flood change to multiple driving mechanisms across the globe especially for multidimensional flood changes at thousands of hydrological stations in addition to the abovementioned factors flood changes are also regulated by catchment characteristics such as vegetation coverage urbanization and dams hettiarachchi et al 2018 johnson et al 2016 liu et al 2021a additionally variations in atmospheric circulation can lead to storm mechanism changes and changes in catchment wetness states gu et al 2019a lu et al 2013 wasko et al 2015 large scale anthropogenic activities such as dam construction mallakpour and villarini 2015 have significantly impacted the hydrological cycle possibly even surpassing climate change impacts in some regions liu et al 2017a b liu et al 2021b sharma et al 2018 although these factors have been individually known to contribute to regional hydrological changes their effects on global flood changes remain to be explored hence as suggested by sharma et al 2018 further effort is required to systematically investigate the possible causes underlying flood changes over a large spatial scale therefore the main objectives of this study are to 1 examine the changes in multidimensional floods across the globe 2 develop a flood attribution framework and apply it to quantify the dominant mechanism of multidimensional flood changes and 3 investigate the impacts of atmospheric circulation catchment characteristics and dams on multidimensional flood changes 2 data 2 1 hydrological data the selection of abundant high quality streamflow data is crucial for the detection and attribution of hydrological changes sheng and wang 2012 however limited by the amount of available hydrological data most studies concerning flood changes are restricted to regional and national scales here we synthesized a global dataset consisting of 22 330 gauging stations with daily streamflow data fig 1 which was compiled from the following eight national and international sources 1 9180 stations from the national water information system of the us https waterdata usgs gov nwis and gages ii database falcone et al 2010 2 4628 stations from the global runoff data centre grdc https grdc bafg de 3 3029 stations from the

1596375699841 http 113 57 190 228 8001 web report riverreport http slt gd gov cn http www jxssw gov cn considering the temporal coverage of hydrological data and meteorological data as shown in section 2 2 we selected the streamflow dataset covering the period of 1960 2014 as the primary dataset for the subsequent analyses given that the streamflow datasets were obtained from different sources we performed a series of operations to control the quality of the daily streamflow 1 all daily observations identified as suspicious were set as missing data two criteria were used to classify the reliability of observations at each station observations less than 0 were flagged as suspected and b observations with more than ten consecutive equal values greater than 0 were flagged as suspected gudmundsson et al 2019 2 years with more than 10 missing daily observations were deleted for each station do et al 2017 3 stations with less than 30 years of observations during 1960 2014 were discarded 4 stations with more than 10 missing observations were discarded 5 to homogenize the spatial distribution of stations across the globe for continents with the highest station densities i e america only stations with at least 54 year records were considered as a result dataset a retained 6 108 stations meeting these requirements with a mean record length of 48 4 years during 1960 2014 to investigate the impacts of data gaps on the results slater and villarini 2017 other two gap criteria were applied to replace operation 2 i e stations with more than 5 and 20 missing observations were deleted as a result 5 555 and 6 156 stations met these requirements with mean missing percentages of 2 6 and 4 2 respectively these two datasets were named dataset b and dataset c respectively 2 2 meteorological data and catchment characteristics the heavy rainfall antecedent wetness conditions snowmelt and catchment characteristics of each catchment were extracted to assess their impacts on flood changes the daily rainfall soil moisture and snowmelt datasets covering the period of 1948 2014 with 0 25 spatial resolution were sourced from nasa global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 data products rodell et al 2004 in addition a series of catchment characteristics were used to investigate other factors that may affect the flood change i e causality analysis land cover normalized difference vegetation index ndvi population reservoir capacity topographic slope surface elevation and soil texture detailed information on the catchment characteristics is summarized in table 1 note that the meteorological data and catchment characteristics of each catchment were calculated as the mean values for the entire contributing area which were extracted using the shapefiles of the catchment boundary additionally dams were taken from the global reservoir and dams grand dataset https wp geog mcgill ca hydrolab grand which includes 14 573 large dams with a capacity larger than 0 1 km2 of which 8 189 dams were completed operational during 1960 2014 it is worth mentioning that many larger dams may not be included in the grand dataset although this dataset was integrated from various studies the number of dams in each catchment was determined based on the shapefiles of the catchment boundary if there was one or more flood control dam within the catchment boundary of a hydrological station we considered it a dam affected station and this designation was used to assess the role of dams in the multidimensional changes in floods 2 3 grace data the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite pair provide global monthly terrestrial water storage change twsc data which has been deemed valuable for a wide variety of applications such as groundwater monitoring niu et al 2014 flood forecasting reager et al 2014 and drought monitoring long et al 2014 grace data are expressed in equivalent centimeters of water thickness with a spatial resolution of 0 5 and have been available since 2002 although the temporal coverage of grace is relatively limited these data may provide valuable information for hydrological simulations and predictions slater and villarini 2016 the grace dataset was processed by the jet propulsion laboratory to provide improved signal recovery and the product can be downloaded from the grace tellus website https grace jpl nasa gov data get data the relationship of twsc with flood changes was assessed using the coverage periods of twsc that is from 2003 to 2016 2 4 atmospheric circulation data to analyze the potential effects of atmospheric circulation on flood changes we obtained the complete meteorological reanalysis dataset from the japanese 55 year reanalysis jar 55 projected by the japan meteorological agency jma during 1958 2019 kobayashi et al 2015 we selected the monthly horizontal wind and geopotential height at 850 hpa with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 and the total column of water vapor flux with a spatial resolution of 1 25 1 25 which are available on the ncar ucar website https rda ucar edu datasets ds628 1 access 3 methods 3 1 flood sampling we applied bma and pot sampling to obtain the series of flood magnitude frequency and duration data based on the observed daily streamflow data bma sampling extracted the flood magnitude with the maximum values of streamflow pot sampling obtained the flood frequency and duration by accounting for flood events over a threshold which helped capture widespread flood events that were not constrained by the time they occurred using several flood series extracted by different flood thresholds with averages of 3 2 1 and 0 5 flood events per year liu and zhang 2017 found that flood thresholds have limited impacts on the results of flood changes to extract sufficient flood events and avoid counting the same events twice following mallakpour and villarini 2016 we used an average of two flood events per year and a two week time window to ascertain the flood thresholds for each station to investigate the impacts of threshold selection on the results other thresholds were also considered i e one flood event per year three flood events per year and four flood events per year 3 2 trend analysis the mann kendall test was used to detect the trend of flood magnitude at the 5 significance level through a two sided test kendall 1975 mann 1945 the poisson regression model was applied to examine the trend of flood frequency and duration since these data are discrete and bounded at zero to investigate whether the percentage of stations showing significant increases decreases was significant we used a field significance resampling method that combines the trends test with bootstrap sampling do et al 2017 ishak et al 2013 westra et al 2013 the detailed procedure is described as follows 1 the dataset was resampled with a replacement time series of floods to set up a new dataset with the same length but a different year order 2 the trend test was applied to examine the resampled flood at the 5 significance level and determine the percentage of stations showing significant increasing and decreasing trends 3 the above two steps were repeated 3000 times to obtain the distribution of the percentage of stations with significant trends representing the null hypothesis distribution 4 the 95th percentile of the percentage distribution was calculated which represents the percentage of stations showing significant trends by random chance at the 5 significance level the percentage of stations showing significant trends evaluated using the observed datasets was compared to the 95th percentile of the percentage distribution assessed using the resampled datasets the null hypothesis of no change obtained from the bootstrap sampling procedure was rejected when the former was larger than the latter implying that the observed percentage was not simply due to random chance but significant at the 5 significance level do et al 2017 additionally the moving blocks bootstrap method was applied to avoid autocorrelation among different stations kiktev et al 2003 considering that autocorrelation varies at different stations the optimal lock length is selected based on the individual time series by using an automatic block length selection code from politis and white 2004 3 3 attribution framework for multidimensional flood changes our attribution framework can be summarized in three steps first based on the generating mechanisms of floods we selected several driving factors that may lead to changes in multidimensional floods section 3 3 1 second we applied all subset regression to determine the best regression equation and predictor variables section 3 3 2 of flood changes finally we combined the controlled experiments with two trend attribution equations to quantify the contributions of driving mechanisms to multidimensional flood changes section 3 3 3 it should be noted that the simulations for flood magnitude are developed based on the linear regression while those for flood frequency and duration are based on the poisson regression since the flood frequency is the count data with a discrete nature mallakpour and villarini 2016 3 3 1 definition of the driving mechanisms flood generating mechanisms mainly include heavy rainfall antecedent wetness conditions and snowmelt berghuijs et al 2016 here we quantified the responses of flood changes to changes in these driving factors several driving factors were used to represent these three mechanisms table 2 1 annual maximum 1 day 7 day and 30 day rainfall as proxies for heavy rainfall 2 annual mean maximum continuous 90 day rainfall 30 day soil moisture 90 day soil moisture as antecedent wetness conditions do et al 2020b and 3 the annual maximum 1 day and 7 day snowmelt as snowmelt conditions berghuijs et al 2016 hock 2003 the values of driving factors were obtained from data extracted from grid data with a 0 25 spatial resolution using the shapefile of the catchment boundary 3 3 2 determination of the best regression equation and predictor variables to quantify the dominant drivers of flood change we performed the all subsets regression method combined with a trend attribution equation to quantify the drivers of flood trends all subset regression was used to obtain the best regression equation and select a final set of predictor variables from all candidate variables in table 2 all subset regression can execute all possible models with different combinations of predictor variables 256 combinations for the eight driving factors the regression residuals were used to investigate the normality and autocorrelations duethmann et al 2015 models with predictors showing high multicollinearity variance inflation factors larger than 10 were not considered draper and smith 1998 duethmann et al 2015 as the determination coefficient r 2 always increases with predictor variables we applied the adjusted r 2 to assess the performance of different models the model with the largest adjusted r 2 but without high multicollinearity was selected as the best regression model 4 calculation of the contributions the selected best regression model was applied to simulate floods based on controlled experiments for each experiment one driving factor from the average over the study period and other factors from the whole period were used in the simulation the times of the controlled experiments were equal to the numbers of predictor variables in the regression models sen s slope and poisson regression were used to calculate the trends of the simulated flood magnitude and duration and flood frequency respectively based on the controlled experiments we could evaluate the contribution of each driving factor to the flood trend by the following equation 1 contribution i trend ctr trend i where contribution i is the contribution of the ith driving factor selected from table 2 to the flood trend trend trl is the trend of the simulated flood that considers all driving factors and trend i is the trend of the simulated flood based on the ith experiment additionally another attribution equation developed by sun et al 2017 was also applied to attribute the flood trend 2 contribution i k i n trend k n 2 trend i n 1 where k i n trend k is the sum of the trends of the simulated floods in all experiments except the ith experiment for brevity attribution equations 3 and 4 were called methods a and b respectively we assessed the performance of these two methods by comparing the trends of the simulated floods the sum of the contributions of each driving factor to the trends of observed floods using r 2 the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and the kling gupta efficiency kge then we selected the better method to quantify the contribution of each driving factor to flood change the driving factor with the largest contribution is considered the dominant driver for each station shown in section 4 2 5 results 5 1 global pattern of flood trends global floods tended to decrease in magnitude frequency and duration during 1960 2014 fig 2 the numbers of stations showing significantly decreasing trends sdt in multidimensional floods were larger than those showing significantly increasing trends sit overall the percentages of stations showing sit for the flood magnitude frequency and duration are 8 4 513 stations 7 9 485 stations and 9 2 564 stations while those showing sdt are 11 1 676 stations 9 3 566 stations and 10 8 662 stations respectively owing to randomness a certain percentage of stations will show significant trends archfield et al 2016 therefore we applied bootstrap sampling to test the field significance of the percentages of stations showing significant trends fig 3 the percentages of stations showing significant trends for flood magnitude frequency and duration all rejected the null hypothesis of no changes in floods implying that the changes were not random and were significant at the 5 significance level global floods did not change uniformly and varied over different regions an increasing trend in multidimensional floods was observed over northeastern western europe central north america southern brazil and northern australia in contrast consistent decreasing trends in multidimensional floods were sporadically distributed in western america eastern brazil southern australia and northern china these results indicate that flood magnitude was generally connected to flood frequency and duration implying that regional floods tended to be larger more frequent and last longer in some regions while they were smaller less frequent and shorter in other areas generally the results are not sensitive to different thresholds for extracting floods and the spatial patterns of stations showing significant trends are similar at different thresholds fig s1 the percentages of stations showing significant trends have no distinct difference in flood frequency at different thresholds for example the percentages of stations showing sit are 7 8 7 9 8 7 and 8 5 for the flood frequency with thresholds based on 1 2 3 and 4 peaks per year respectively for the flood duration the percentages of stations showing sit tended to slightly increase with the increase of the threshold from 8 4 based on four peaks per year to 9 5 based on one peak per year whereas that the percentage showing sdt declined with the increase of the threshold from 10 1 to 10 9 these results indicate that the selection of the thresholds has some effect on trend analyses of floods however its impacts are limited in addition we also examined the flood trends based on datasets a c to investigate the sensitivity of the results to the selection of gap criteria fig 2 and figs s2 s3 similar percentages and spatial patterns of stations showing significant trends are found in the results using datasets a c with different selections of gap criteria suggesting that the selection of gap criteria had limited impacts on the results in terms of flood change 5 2 quantifying dominant drivers of flood trends to increase the robustness of the results we performed attribution analysis mainly among the stations showing significant trends in floods to assess the performance of the best models selected by all subset regression we evaluated the adjusted r 2 between the observed and simulated floods for each station fig 4 a c the mean values of the adjusted r 2 are 0 30 0 31 and 0 384 for the flood magnitude frequency and duration respectively to further evaluate the trend attribution performance the sum of the contributions of all driving factors was compared to the observed trends fig 4d f generally the performance of method b was better than that of method a hence we applied method b in flood attribution the values of nse based on method b are 0 527 0 595 and 0 712 for the flood magnitude frequency and duration respectively these results highlight that the developed framework performs well and has a reasonable performance in the simulation and attribution of flood change fig 5 shows the contributions of the dominant factors to the trends in flood magnitude for the stations showing significant increasing decreasing trends the dominant factors are defined as the driving factors that provide the largest contributions to flood change the changes in floods that cannot be explained by the considered explanatory factors were regarded as dominated by other factors the antecedent wetness conditions using max rain90 max soil30 and max soil90 as proxies were the primary drivers of the flood magnitude changes which controlled flood magnitude changes at 48 3 of stations with significant increasing decreasing trends fig 5d f among these three proxies max soil90 dominated the decreasing increasing flood magnitude for 11 5 9 4 of stations antecedent wetness conditions reduced flood magnitude in eastern brazil and southern australia while enhancing it in northeastern north america europe and southern brazil heavy rainfall using max rain90 max soil30 and max soil 90 as the proxies was dominant for the second largest proportion of stations showing a significant trend which controlled flood magnitude changes at 34 1 of stations fig 5a c among these three proxies maxrain30 dominated the flood magnitude changes at most stations and provided dominant contributions to decreasing increasing the flood magnitude for 13 9 12 5 of stations fig 5c in contrast maxrain1 had limited impacts on flood magnitude changes with dominant contributions to decreasing increasing the flood magnitude at only 2 2 2 4 of stations snowmelt has a wide influence on global floods for example 30 0 of stations with flood magnitudes were affected by snowmelt fig s4h nevertheless the stations with flood magnitude changes dominated by snowmelt are limited accounting for only 9 3 fig 5g h generally the snowmelt change tended to decrease the flood magnitude which was mainly observed in the high latitude regions the number of stations with snowmelt change decreasing flood magnitude was 4 7 times larger than that with snowmelt change increasing flood magnitude figs 6 7 show the dominant driving factors of trends in flood frequency and duration for the stations showing significant increasing decreasing trends the primary mechanism of flood frequency change was heavy rainfall which controlled flood frequency change in 43 3 of stations in contrast the primary mechanism of flood frequency change was antecedent wetness conditions flood duration controlling 51 3 of stations followed by heavy rainfall controlling 34 3 of stations overall heavy rainfall increased multidimensional floods at more stations while antecedent wetness conditions tended to decrease multidimensional floods at more stations fig 8 in particular heavy rainfall was the dominant mechanism for the increase in flood magnitude frequency and duration which controlled flood increases at 21 6 28 6 and 21 1 of stations respectively in contrast antecedent wetness conditions were the dominant mechanisms for decreasing flood magnitude frequency and duration which controlled flood decreases at 30 5 28 6 and 30 8 of stations respectively although heavy rainfall tended to increase floods the positive impacts were generally smaller than the negative impacts of antecedent wetness conditions worldwide as a result global multidimensional floods were more likely to decrease rather than increase in addition to focusing on the stations with significant trends in floods we also investigated the causes of floods at these stations with not significant trends figs s7 s10 similar to the results for the stations with significant trends the heavy rainfall tended to increase floods for the stations with not significant trends and the antecedent wetness conditions had larger impact on decreasing floods nevertheless the other factors contributed much more to the flood change at the stations with not significant trends than those with significant trends this is because the magnitude of the slope is not robust for the stations with not significant trends in floods which leads to relatively larger uncertainties in the attribution fig s11 furthermore the sensitivity of the attribution results under different flood thresholds was examined fig 6 and figs s12 s14 generally the selection of flood thresholds has limited impacts on the results of global attribution the dominant factors of the flood frequency at different thresholds share similar spatial patterns and the primary mechanism of global flood frequency change at different thresholds was heavy rainfall primarily for maximum 30 day rainfall nevertheless there are some changes in the proportion of stations dominated by each factor for example the percentages of stations dominated by soilmoist90 increased from 18 8 to 22 8 for flood thresholds of one peak per year to four peaks per year these results indicate that the impacts of antecedent wetness conditions tend to increase with the increase in the flood threshold nevertheless the dominant factors of flood change at different thresholds have no noticeable difference with similar spatial patterns and dominant percentages overall the decreases in multidimensional floods are mainly caused by the decreasing antecedent wetness conditions while the increases are led by the increasing heavy rainfall the dominant mechanisms for the flood magnitude and duration change were the antecedent wetness conditions rather than heavy rainfall however for the flood frequency heavy rainfall mainly in maxrain30 was the primary driving factor additionally snowmelt specifically controlled decreasing floods for the stations over high latitude regions 5 3 other factors impact flood trends in addition to the abovementioned driving factors other factors may also have impacts on flood changes such as atmospheric circulation controlling both the heavy and antecedent wetness conditions water storage changes catchment characteristics and dams limited by the data characteristics we only qualitatively investigated the roles of the listed factors in flood changes changes in atmospheric circulation would transform the dominant mechanism of storms lu et al 2013 by changing the heavy rainfall frequency and antecedent soil moisture conditions mallakpour and villarini 2016 which may further result in flood changes liu et al 2018 here we examined the annual and seasonal trends in the geopotential height horizontal wind at 850 hpa and total column of water vapor flux to investigate the possible impacts of atmospheric circulation changes on floods figs 9 11 as we know prevailing westerlies prevailing winds from west to the east in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60 play a crucial role in controlling climatic changes in europe laurian et al 2010 quan et al 2014 during winter a major flood season over western europe fig s15 england and its adjacent seas were covered by an anomalous low pressure center while the north atlantic ocean was controlled by an abnormal high pressure center fig 9g the intensive horizontal pressure gradient force enhanced the prevailing westerlies fig 9h and transported warmer and wetter moisture from the atlantic to northern europe fig 10c fig 11d additionally the low pressure center is accompanied by an updraft which promotes moisture convergence and triggers more moisture condensation najibi et al 2019 as a result significantly increasing trends in floods were detected in england fig 2 which were also found in previous regional studies blöschl et al 2019 in contrast eastern europe was covered by an anomalous high pressure center driving weaker prevailing westerlies and inhibiting moisture transport which further caused a decreasing trend in floods australia was controlled by an abnormal northerly wind resulting in the warm wet wind from the pacific covering northern australia while a dry heat wind from the arid inland covers southern australia as a result distinct north south differences in flood trends were detected across australia fig 2 see also liu and zhang 2017 the detected consistent spatiotemporal patterns regarding the relationships between variations in atmospheric circulation and flood trends confirm that shifts in atmospheric circulation have a significant influence on flood changes the liquid water equivalent thickness measured by grace can be regarded as a proxy for terrestrial water storage change twsc slater and villarini 2016 here we compared the trends in twsc with those in floods during the period covered by grace i e 2003 2016 generally the flood changes in magnitude frequency and duration were consistent with the trends in twsc fig 12 significantly increasing trends in floods were observed in the middle part of north america northern europe and eastern australia where regional twsc also showed increasing trends conversely significantly decreasing trends in floods over eastern brazil southeastern brazil and northern china were also in line with the trends in twsc these results indicate that water storage changes are an essential driver of flood changes however the flood trends are different from those of twsc in some regions such as southern africa this is because flood changes are impacted by many drivers in addition to water storage changes in addition the water storage changes were assessed at annual and seasonal scales while the flood changes may be more related to short term changes in heavy rainfall slater and villarini 2016 it should be noted that due to the limited record length of the grace satellite the grace and flood trends herein are based on the period from 2003 to 2016 nevertheless the spatial pattern of the flood trends shown in fig 12 was broadly similar to that observed from 1960 to 2014 fig 2 to investigate the influence of dams on multidimensional flood changes we summarized the percentages of stations showing significant increasing and decreasing trends among the stations that included one or more dams completed operational from 1960 to 2014 i e dam affected stations the bootstrap sampling approach was used to examine the significance level of the percentages fig 13 interestingly the percentages of dam affected stations with significant decreasing trends in multidimensional floods were all significant at the 5 significance level while those with significant increasing trends were all not significant these results indicated that the increases decreases were were not random in the dam affected stations suggesting that dams have an essential impact on decreasing multidimensional floods in addition the dams had differentiated impacts on the flood magnitude frequency and duration the percentages of dam affected stations showing sdt were more than four times larger than those showing sit for the flood magnitude for the flood frequency and duration however the ratios dropped to approximately two times these results indicate that dams are important for reducing the flood magnitude while they have relatively smaller impacts on the flood frequency and duration additionally the effects of dams on floods are restricted by the distance of the dam from the outlet for example the percentage of stations showing sdt in the flood magnitude among near dam impacted stations was larger than that among far dam impacted stations fig s16 to investigate the impacts of other catchment characteristics on flood trends we mainly focused on flood changes at the stations that had no large dams in the following analyses we stratified these stations into three groups containing an equal number of stations i e third quantiles based on the values of each characteristic and then counted the percentages of stations showing significant trends for each group fig 14 fig s17 and fig s18 decreasing multidimensional floods tended to occur in relatively dry regions the percentage of stations showing sdt among the stations with the first third of the aridity index is approximately twice as high as that among stations with the last two thirds fig 14 a fig s17a and fig s18a concerning the catchment area significantly decreasing trends in multidimensional floods were more likely to occur in large catchments where twsc and evapotranspiration played more critical roles ivancic and shaw 2015 particularly under a globally warming climate additionally the detected coverage area of storm events showed generally decreasing trends which would further intensify the decreasing trends in large catchments chang et al 2016 wasko et al 2016 with the increase in elevation the percentage of stations showing sit sdt in multidimensional floods tended to decline rise regions with larger slopes tended to have fewer stations showing sit however this relationship may be caused by the slope having multicollinearity with other factors with variance inflation factors being larger than 2 fig s19 for example there were strong negative correlations of the slope with the snowfall fraction fig s20 at high latitudes the percentages of stations showing significant increases in multidimensional floods were all clearly larger than those at low latitudes which was an observation that is supported by the increasingly wet conditions at high latitudes such as in northern europe stahl et al 2010 stahl et al 2012 and northern asia tananaev et al 2016 additionally climate model simulations from the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 have also projected that wetting conditions at high latitudes will continue in the future greve et al 2018 urbanization not only changes the catchment permeability and roughness sharma et al 2018 but also modifies the rainfall intensity gu et al 2019b as a result the percentages of stations showing sit increase with the increase in the urbanized fraction generally stations showing sit in multidimensional floods are more likely to occur in catchments with low elevation higher latitudes low ndvi high seasonality low slopes and or high urbanization in contrast stations with sdt in multidimensional floods are usually in catchments with high aridity indices high elevation low latitudes low climate seasonality and or low urbanization fig 14 fig s17 and fig s18 these results indicate that catchment characteristics play an essential regulatory role in flood changes 6 discussion and conclusions although the impacts of flood disasters have risen in recent decades tanoue et al 2016 the question of whether floods with different dimensions e g magnitude frequency and duration are increasing remains largely unanswered at the global level in europe both increasing and decreasing trends were found blöschl et al 2019 in the central united states a greater frequency but not a larger magnitude of floods has been detected mallakpour and villarini 2015 however little evidence for increasing trends in flood frequency was found in other regions around the globe therefore the results of this study provide a systematic update to flood changes worldwide based on comparing existing global assessments do et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2019 the key progress resulting from this study is the consideration of multidimensional flood behaviors more importantly this study provides the first quantitative evaluation of the dominant mechanisms driving multidimensional flood changes across the globe at the global scale multidimensional floods have tended to decrease in the past 55 years i e the flood magnitude has decreased the frequency has decreased and the duration has become shorter in general sensitivity analysis shows that the screening criteria of datasets and the selection of thresholds have limited impacts on the results for the flood magnitude more stations showed sdt than sit which is consistent with the results of previous studies do et al 2017 kundzewicz et al 2014 however our finding that the flood frequency has decreased is not in line with regional results for example mallakpour and villarini 2015 found that floods have become more frequent in the central united states this is because they focused on regional floods with different amounts of hydrological stations implying that the regional flood changes cannot represent the global case it is worth noting that the multidimensional flood changes have no significant trend at most hydrological stations which is similar to previous studies blöschl et al 2019 do et al 2017 mallakpour and villarini 2015 for example blöschl et al 2019 suggested that european river floods have both increasing and decreasing trends with less than 30 of stations showing significant trends at the 10 significance level at the regional scale both increasing and decreasing trends were found in floods which verified the argument of blöschl et al 2019 regarding both increasing and decreasing european riverine floods the spatial patterns in the signs of trends are generally consistent across multidimensional floods with floods showing a larger magnitude greater frequency and longer duration in some regions but a smaller magnitude reduced frequency and shorter duration in others this finding largely agrees with a previous study gudmundsson et al 2019 which showed that the entire streamflow distribution was changing upward or downward in different regions worldwide it is worth mentioning that the observed multidimensional flood trends may not continue in the future since these changes were caused by both climate variability and human activities rather than persistent climate change hodgkins et al 2017 villarini and wasko 2021 in addition since the observed trends depend on the recording period the changing features of global floods may differ if the recording period is changed berghuijs et al 2017 hall et al 2014 nonetheless our results are broadly consistent with previous studies in terms of regional floods and projected climate changes for example previous studies have reported increasing floods in northern europe bloeschl et al 2017 and northern australia liu and zhang 2017 while a tendency toward decreasing floods was found in western north america whitfield 2001 and southern australia liu and zhang 2017 in addition global climate models from the cmip5 ensemble suggest that wetting conditions with global warming are projected in many regions such as northern north america southern brazil and northern europe greve et al 2018 in contrast increasing drying conditions have been detected in southern north america eastern brazil the northern mediterranean southern arica and southern australia greve et al 2018 these results from isolated regional flood studies and global climate projections are broadly consistent with our findings by developing a new attribution framework for multidimensional flood change this study highlights the global patterns of the dominant mechanisms of flood trends flood magnitude and duration changes were primarily driven by antecedent wetness conditions max soil90 in particular while rainfall frequency changes were mainly caused by heavy rainfall maxrain30 in particular previous studies have reported an apparent spatiotemporal mismatch between the annual maximum rainfall and flood changes that is more increases in maximum daily rainfall and a lack of corresponding increases in floods do et al 2017 min et al 2011 the results in this study show that the stations with flood magnitudes dominated by maxrain1 account for less than 5 which is far less than that controlled by antecedent wetness conditions this implies that the maximum daily rainfall has limited impacts on flood changes in addition we found that the decrease in floods was mainly driven by the antecedent wetness conditions while the increases in floods were generally caused by the increasing heavy rainfall however since the negative impacts of antecedent wetness conditions were usually larger than the positive heavy rainfall the global multidimensional floods tended to decrease instead of increase hence the results of this study provide a quantitative clarification of why the flood magnitude does not increase with increasing rainfall extremes do et al 2020a sharma et al 2018 the main limitation of this study is the uneven distribution of stations worldwide and differing temporal coverages of streamflow records at different stations which may have affected the results of the regional and global assessment to a certain degree in addition owing to the lack of long term observations we provided a simple analysis of catchment characteristics and dam impacts on flood changes without further considering them in the quantitative attribution framework lastly uncertainties and errors also exist in the simulation and attribution based on linear regression for example the linear regression without a zero bound constraint may lead to unrealistic negative values in some catchments nevertheless this study presented unprecedented insight into multidimensional flood behaviors and provided a first quantitative evaluation of the dominant mechanisms of change in multidimensional floods across the globe credit authorship contribution statement jianyu liu

2753,flooding is a major natural hazard that poses serious threats to lives and property safety but changes in the multidimensional behavior of global floods magnitude frequency and duration are still not well understood additionally a quantitative assessment of drivers that control multidimensional flood changes across the globe is currently unavailable here we provided a global analysis of multidimensional flood changes and then developed a new attribution framework to quantify these changes to driving factors regarding heavy rainfall antecedent wetness conditions and snowmelt changes the global assessment indicates that multidimensional floods tended to decrease during 1960 2014 attribution analysis suggested that the dominant mechanism controlling flood magnitude changes was antecedent wetness but flood frequency and duration changes were primarily driven by heavy rainfall notably the increases in multidimensional flooding were mainly caused by the increasing heavy rainfall primarily for maximum 30 day rainfall while the decreases generally followed decreasing antecedent wetness conditions snowmelt mainly controlled the decrease in multidimensional floods for the stations in high latitude regions in addition atmospheric circulation variation water storage changes catchment characteristics and dams had considerable impacts on flood changes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters worldwide resulting in more than half a million deaths over the past 30 years cred 2015 doocy et al 2013 gu et al 2020 lee et al 2018 any changes in riverine floods would significantly impact the design of flood protection measures and flood risk assessment blöschl et al 2019 although their significance for life safety and economic development is evident the reliable evaluation of global flood changes and their drivers remains challenging berghuijs et al 2019 kundzewicz et al 2017 sharma et al 2018 these facts highlight the necessity of understanding how and why floods change over time mallakpour and villarini 2015 significant progress has been made in the investigations of flood changes in different regions such as north america archfield et al 2016 hodgkins et al 2019 mallakpour and villarini 2015 musselman et al 2018 slater and villarini 2016 villarini et al 2009 europe hannaford et al 2013 hodgkins et al 2017 africa tramblay et al 2020 australia liu and zhang 2017 liu et al 2018 and asia delgado et al 2010 but there is still limited knowledge about global flood changes as previous regional studies have often used different strategies to select stations it is difficult to draw solid conclusions regarding the worldwide pattern of flood changes furthermore flood changes vary not only by region but also by the multidimensional behavior of floods e g the flood magnitude frequency and duration for example mallakpour and villarini 2015 suggested that the flood magnitude had not become more extensive but flood frequency tended to be higher across the central united states in the limited global assessments of riverine flood changes do et al 2017 milly et al 2002 slater et al 2021 only the block maxima approach bma has been adopted to extract flood magnitudes it should be noted that there are some limitations in using the bma alone as follows 1 only changes in the flood magnitude can be assessed and 2 the bma is fixed to select one flood event for a given period even though multiple floods may occur within the corresponding period liu et al 2017a the peaks over threshold sampling technique pot which identifies flood events using an optimized threshold value allows the collection of multiple floods within one year and the extraction of the frequency and duration of floods archfield et al 2016 previously based on simulated runoff from satellite microwave and water balance model outputs najibi and devineni 2018 made a global assessment of the frequency and duration of simulated floods however najibi and devineni 2018 stated that there is a certain level of epistemic uncertainty in their results which are limited by imprecision in estimating floods from remote sensing and model outputs hence multidimensional changes in riverine floods are not yet well established across the globe based on the clausius clapeyron relationship global warming will enhance the moisture holding ability of the atmosphere fowler et al 2021 sillmann et al 2013 as a result increases in heavy rainfall e g annual maximum daily rainfall have been observed in many regions around the globe asadieh and krakauer 2015 yu et al 2022 however previous studies have shown little evidence of increases in flood magnitude but have instead indicated that flood decreases were more prevalent than increases in many regions archfield et al 2016 do et al 2017 mallakpour and villarini 2015 sharma et al 2018 therefore there is an urgent need to understand why the increases in extreme rainfall have not resulted in flood increases ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko and nathan 2019 recently an increasing number of studies have focused on the dominant mechanisms of flood generation in many regions berghuijs et al 2019 berghuijs et al 2016 mao et al 2019 stein et al 2020 these studies indicated that heavy rainfall antecedent wetness conditions and snowmelt are essential in flood generating mechanisms however a framework to attribute flood changes to these mechanisms is still lacking and hence the quantitative causes of flood changes remain largely unknown although some studies have attempted to explain the causes of flood changes do et al 2020a duethmann et al 2015 blöschl et al 2019 they generally focused on a specific region and or without a quantitative evaluation to the best of our knowledge no previous study has quantified the response of flood change to multiple driving mechanisms across the globe especially for multidimensional flood changes at thousands of hydrological stations in addition to the abovementioned factors flood changes are also regulated by catchment characteristics such as vegetation coverage urbanization and dams hettiarachchi et al 2018 johnson et al 2016 liu et al 2021a additionally variations in atmospheric circulation can lead to storm mechanism changes and changes in catchment wetness states gu et al 2019a lu et al 2013 wasko et al 2015 large scale anthropogenic activities such as dam construction mallakpour and villarini 2015 have significantly impacted the hydrological cycle possibly even surpassing climate change impacts in some regions liu et al 2017a b liu et al 2021b sharma et al 2018 although these factors have been individually known to contribute to regional hydrological changes their effects on global flood changes remain to be explored hence as suggested by sharma et al 2018 further effort is required to systematically investigate the possible causes underlying flood changes over a large spatial scale therefore the main objectives of this study are to 1 examine the changes in multidimensional floods across the globe 2 develop a flood attribution framework and apply it to quantify the dominant mechanism of multidimensional flood changes and 3 investigate the impacts of atmospheric circulation catchment characteristics and dams on multidimensional flood changes 2 data 2 1 hydrological data the selection of abundant high quality streamflow data is crucial for the detection and attribution of hydrological changes sheng and wang 2012 however limited by the amount of available hydrological data most studies concerning flood changes are restricted to regional and national scales here we synthesized a global dataset consisting of 22 330 gauging stations with daily streamflow data fig 1 which was compiled from the following eight national and international sources 1 9180 stations from the national water information system of the us https waterdata usgs gov nwis and gages ii database falcone et al 2010 2 4628 stations from the global runoff data centre grdc https grdc bafg de 3 3029 stations from the

section 2 2 we selected the streamflow dataset covering the period of 1960 2014 as the primary dataset for the subsequent analyses given that the streamflow datasets were obtained from different sources we performed a series of operations to control the quality of the daily streamflow 1 all daily observations identified as suspicious were set as missing data two criteria were used to classify the reliability of observations at each station observations less than 0 were flagged as suspected and b observations with more than ten consecutive equal values greater than 0 were flagged as suspected gudmundsson et al 2019 2 years with more than 10 missing daily observations were deleted for each station do et al 2017 3 stations with less than 30 years of observations during 1960 2014 were discarded 4 stations with more than 10 missing observations were discarded 5 to homogenize the spatial distribution of stations across the globe for continents with the highest station densities i e america only stations with at least 54 year records were considered as a result dataset a retained 6 108 stations meeting these requirements with a mean record length of 48 4 years during 1960 2014 to investigate the impacts of data gaps on the results slater and villarini 2017 other two gap criteria were applied to replace operation 2 i e stations with more than 5 and 20 missing observations were deleted as a result 5 555 and 6 156 stations met these requirements with mean missing percentages of 2 6 and 4 2 respectively these two datasets were named dataset b and dataset c respectively 2 2 meteorological data and catchment characteristics the heavy rainfall antecedent wetness conditions snowmelt and catchment characteristics of each catchment were extracted to assess their impacts on flood changes the daily rainfall soil moisture and snowmelt datasets covering the period of 1948 2014 with 0 25 spatial resolution were sourced from nasa global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 data products rodell et al 2004 in addition a series of catchment characteristics were used to investigate other factors that may affect the flood change i e causality analysis land cover normalized difference vegetation index ndvi population reservoir capacity topographic slope surface elevation and soil texture detailed information on the catchment characteristics is summarized in table 1 note that the meteorological data and catchment characteristics of each catchment were calculated as the mean values for the entire contributing area which were extracted using the shapefiles of the catchment boundary additionally dams were taken from the global reservoir and dams grand dataset https wp geog mcgill ca hydrolab grand which includes 14 573 large dams with a capacity larger than 0 1 km2 of which 8 189 dams were completed operational during 1960 2014 it is worth mentioning that many larger dams may not be included in the grand dataset although this dataset was integrated from various studies the number of dams in each catchment was determined based on the shapefiles of the catchment boundary if there was one or more flood control dam within the catchment boundary of a hydrological station we considered it a dam affected station and this designation was used to assess the role of dams in the multidimensional changes in floods 2 3 grace data the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite pair provide global monthly terrestrial water storage change twsc data which has been deemed valuable for a wide variety of applications such as groundwater monitoring niu et al 2014 flood forecasting reager et al 2014 and drought monitoring long et al 2014 grace data are expressed in equivalent centimeters of water thickness with a spatial resolution of 0 5 and have been available since 2002 although the temporal coverage of grace is relatively limited these data may provide valuable information for hydrological simulations and predictions slater and villarini 2016 the grace dataset was processed by the jet propulsion laboratory to provide improved signal recovery and the product can be downloaded from the grace tellus website https grace jpl nasa gov data get data the relationship of twsc with flood changes was assessed using the coverage periods of twsc that is from 2003 to 2016 2 4 atmospheric circulation data to analyze the potential effects of atmospheric circulation on flood changes we obtained the complete meteorological reanalysis dataset from the japanese 55 year reanalysis jar 55 projected by the japan meteorological agency jma during 1958 2019 kobayashi et al 2015 we selected the monthly horizontal wind and geopotential height at 850 hpa with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 and the total column of water vapor flux with a spatial resolution of 1 25 1 25 which are available on the ncar ucar website https rda ucar edu datasets ds628 1 access 3 methods 3 1 flood sampling we applied bma and pot sampling to obtain the series of flood magnitude frequency and duration data based on the observed daily streamflow data bma sampling extracted the flood magnitude with the maximum values of streamflow pot sampling obtained the flood frequency and duration by accounting for flood events over a threshold which helped capture widespread flood events that were not constrained by the time they occurred using several flood series extracted by different flood thresholds with averages of 3 2 1 and 0 5 flood events per year liu and zhang 2017 found that flood thresholds have limited impacts on the results of flood changes to extract sufficient flood events and avoid counting the same events twice following mallakpour and villarini 2016 we used an average of two flood events per year and a two week time window to ascertain the flood thresholds for each station to investigate the impacts of threshold selection on the results other thresholds were also considered i e one flood event per year three flood events per year and four flood events per year 3 2 trend analysis the mann kendall test was used to detect the trend of flood magnitude at the 5 significance level through a two sided test kendall 1975 mann 1945 the poisson regression model was applied to examine the trend of flood frequency and duration since these data are discrete and bounded at zero to investigate whether the percentage of stations showing significant increases decreases was significant we used a field significance resampling method that combines the trends test with bootstrap sampling do et al 2017 ishak et al 2013 westra et al 2013 the detailed procedure is described as follows 1 the dataset was resampled with a replacement time series of floods to set up a new dataset with the same length but a different year order 2 the trend test was applied to examine the resampled flood at the 5 significance level and determine the percentage of stations showing significant increasing and decreasing trends 3 the above two steps were repeated 3000 times to obtain the distribution of the percentage of stations with significant trends representing the null hypothesis distribution 4 the 95th percentile of the percentage distribution was calculated which represents the percentage of stations showing significant trends by random chance at the 5 significance level the percentage of stations showing significant trends evaluated using the observed datasets was compared to the 95th percentile of the percentage distribution assessed using the resampled datasets the null hypothesis of no change obtained from the bootstrap sampling procedure was rejected when the former was larger than the latter implying that the observed percentage was not simply due to random chance but significant at the 5 significance level do et al 2017 additionally the moving blocks bootstrap method was applied to avoid autocorrelation among different stations kiktev et al 2003 considering that autocorrelation varies at different stations the optimal lock length is selected based on the individual time series by using an automatic block length selection code from politis and white 2004 3 3 attribution framework for multidimensional flood changes our attribution framework can be summarized in three steps first based on the generating mechanisms of floods we selected several driving factors that may lead to changes in multidimensional floods section 3 3 1 second we applied all subset regression to determine the best regression equation and predictor variables section 3 3 2 of flood changes finally we combined the controlled experiments with two trend attribution equations to quantify the contributions of driving mechanisms to multidimensional flood changes section 3 3 3 it should be noted that the simulations for flood magnitude are developed based on the linear regression while those for flood frequency and duration are based on the poisson regression since the flood frequency is the count data with a discrete nature mallakpour and villarini 2016 3 3 1 definition of the driving mechanisms flood generating mechanisms mainly include heavy rainfall antecedent wetness conditions and snowmelt berghuijs et al 2016 here we quantified the responses of flood changes to changes in these driving factors several driving factors were used to represent these three mechanisms table 2 1 annual maximum 1 day 7 day and 30 day rainfall as proxies for heavy rainfall 2 annual mean maximum continuous 90 day rainfall 30 day soil moisture 90 day soil moisture as antecedent wetness conditions do et al 2020b and 3 the annual maximum 1 day and 7 day snowmelt as snowmelt conditions berghuijs et al 2016 hock 2003 the values of driving factors were obtained from data extracted from grid data with a 0 25 spatial resolution using the shapefile of the catchment boundary 3 3 2 determination of the best regression equation and predictor variables to quantify the dominant drivers of flood change we performed the all subsets regression method combined with a trend attribution equation to quantify the drivers of flood trends all subset regression was used to obtain the best regression equation and select a final set of predictor variables from all candidate variables in table 2 all subset regression can execute all possible models with different combinations of predictor variables 256 combinations for the eight driving factors the regression residuals were used to investigate the normality and autocorrelations duethmann et al 2015 models with predictors showing high multicollinearity variance inflation factors larger than 10 were not considered draper and smith 1998 duethmann et al 2015 as the determination coefficient r 2 always increases with predictor variables we applied the adjusted r 2 to assess the performance of different models the model with the largest adjusted r 2 but without high multicollinearity was selected as the best regression model 4 calculation of the contributions the selected best regression model was applied to simulate floods based on controlled experiments for each experiment one driving factor from the average over the study period and other factors from the whole period were used in the simulation the times of the controlled experiments were equal to the numbers of predictor variables in the regression models sen s slope and poisson regression were used to calculate the trends of the simulated flood magnitude and duration and flood frequency respectively based on the controlled experiments we could evaluate the contribution of each driving factor to the flood trend by the following equation 1 contribution i trend ctr trend i where contribution i is the contribution of the ith driving factor selected from table 2 to the flood trend trend trl is the trend of the simulated flood that considers all driving factors and trend i is the trend of the simulated flood based on the ith experiment additionally another attribution equation developed by sun et al 2017 was also applied to attribute the flood trend 2 contribution i k i n trend k n 2 trend i n 1 where k i n trend k is the sum of the trends of the simulated floods in all experiments except the ith experiment for brevity attribution equations 3 and 4 were called methods a and b respectively we assessed the performance of these two methods by comparing the trends of the simulated floods the sum of the contributions of each driving factor to the trends of observed floods using r 2 the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and the kling gupta efficiency kge then we selected the better method to quantify the contribution of each driving factor to flood change the driving factor with the largest contribution is considered the dominant driver for each station shown in section 4 2 5 results 5 1 global pattern of flood trends global floods tended to decrease in magnitude frequency and duration during 1960 2014 fig 2 the numbers of stations showing significantly decreasing trends sdt in multidimensional floods were larger than those showing significantly increasing trends sit overall the percentages of stations showing sit for the flood magnitude frequency and duration are 8 4 513 stations 7 9 485 stations and 9 2 564 stations while those showing sdt are 11 1 676 stations 9 3 566 stations and 10 8 662 stations respectively owing to randomness a certain percentage of stations will show significant trends archfield et al 2016 therefore we applied bootstrap sampling to test the field significance of the percentages of stations showing significant trends fig 3 the percentages of stations showing significant trends for flood magnitude frequency and duration all rejected the null hypothesis of no changes in floods implying that the changes were not random and were significant at the 5 significance level global floods did not change uniformly and varied over different regions an increasing trend in multidimensional floods was observed over northeastern western europe central north america southern brazil and northern australia in contrast consistent decreasing trends in multidimensional floods were sporadically distributed in western america eastern brazil southern australia and northern china these results indicate that flood magnitude was generally connected to flood frequency and duration implying that regional floods tended to be larger more frequent and last longer in some regions while they were smaller less frequent and shorter in other areas generally the results are not sensitive to different thresholds for extracting floods and the spatial patterns of stations showing significant trends are similar at different thresholds fig s1 the percentages of stations showing significant trends have no distinct difference in flood frequency at different thresholds for example the percentages of stations showing sit are 7 8 7 9 8 7 and 8 5 for the flood frequency with thresholds based on 1 2 3 and 4 peaks per year respectively for the flood duration the percentages of stations showing sit tended to slightly increase with the increase of the threshold from 8 4 based on four peaks per year to 9 5 based on one peak per year whereas that the percentage showing sdt declined with the increase of the threshold from 10 1 to 10 9 these results indicate that the selection of the thresholds has some effect on trend analyses of floods however its impacts are limited in addition we also examined the flood trends based on datasets a c to investigate the sensitivity of the results to the selection of gap criteria fig 2 and figs s2 s3 similar percentages and spatial patterns of stations showing significant trends are found in the results using datasets a c with different selections of gap criteria suggesting that the selection of gap criteria had limited impacts on the results in terms of flood change 5 2 quantifying dominant drivers of flood trends to increase the robustness of the results we performed attribution analysis mainly among the stations showing significant trends in floods to assess the performance of the best models selected by all subset regression we evaluated the adjusted r 2 between the observed and simulated floods for each station fig 4 a c the mean values of the adjusted r 2 are 0 30 0 31 and 0 384 for the flood magnitude frequency and duration respectively to further evaluate the trend attribution performance the sum of the contributions of all driving factors was compared to the observed trends fig 4d f generally the performance of method b was better than that of method a hence we applied method b in flood attribution the values of nse based on method b are 0 527 0 595 and 0 712 for the flood magnitude frequency and duration respectively these results highlight that the developed framework performs well and has a reasonable performance in the simulation and attribution of flood change fig 5 shows the contributions of the dominant factors to the trends in flood magnitude for the stations showing significant increasing decreasing trends the dominant factors are defined as the driving factors that provide the largest contributions to flood change the changes in floods that cannot be explained by the considered explanatory factors were regarded as dominated by other factors the antecedent wetness conditions using max rain90 max soil30 and max soil90 as proxies were the primary drivers of the flood magnitude changes which controlled flood magnitude changes at 48 3 of stations with significant increasing decreasing trends fig 5d f among these three proxies max soil90 dominated the decreasing increasing flood magnitude for 11 5 9 4 of stations antecedent wetness conditions reduced flood magnitude in eastern brazil and southern australia while enhancing it in northeastern north america europe and southern brazil heavy rainfall using max rain90 max soil30 and max soil 90 as the proxies was dominant for the second largest proportion of stations showing a significant trend which controlled flood magnitude changes at 34 1 of stations fig 5a c among these three proxies maxrain30 dominated the flood magnitude changes at most stations and provided dominant contributions to decreasing increasing the flood magnitude for 13 9 12 5 of stations fig 5c in contrast maxrain1 had limited impacts on flood magnitude changes with dominant contributions to decreasing increasing the flood magnitude at only 2 2 2 4 of stations snowmelt has a wide influence on global floods for example 30 0 of stations with flood magnitudes were affected by snowmelt fig s4h nevertheless the stations with flood magnitude changes dominated by snowmelt are limited accounting for only 9 3 fig 5g h generally the snowmelt change tended to decrease the flood magnitude which was mainly observed in the high latitude regions the number of stations with snowmelt change decreasing flood magnitude was 4 7 times larger than that with snowmelt change increasing flood magnitude figs 6 7 show the dominant driving factors of trends in flood frequency and duration for the stations showing significant increasing decreasing trends the primary mechanism of flood frequency change was heavy rainfall which controlled flood frequency change in 43 3 of stations in contrast the primary mechanism of flood frequency change was antecedent wetness conditions flood duration controlling 51 3 of stations followed by heavy rainfall controlling 34 3 of stations overall heavy rainfall increased multidimensional floods at more stations while antecedent wetness conditions tended to decrease multidimensional floods at more stations fig 8 in particular heavy rainfall was the dominant mechanism for the increase in flood magnitude frequency and duration which controlled flood increases at 21 6 28 6 and 21 1 of stations respectively in contrast antecedent wetness conditions were the dominant mechanisms for decreasing flood magnitude frequency and duration which controlled flood decreases at 30 5 28 6 and 30 8 of stations respectively although heavy rainfall tended to increase floods the positive impacts were generally smaller than the negative impacts of antecedent wetness conditions worldwide as a result global multidimensional floods were more likely to decrease rather than increase in addition to focusing on the stations with significant trends in floods we also investigated the causes of floods at these stations with not significant trends figs s7 s10 similar to the results for the stations with significant trends the heavy rainfall tended to increase floods for the stations with not significant trends and the antecedent wetness conditions had larger impact on decreasing floods nevertheless the other factors contributed much more to the flood change at the stations with not significant trends than those with significant trends this is because the magnitude of the slope is not robust for the stations with not significant trends in floods which leads to relatively larger uncertainties in the attribution fig s11 furthermore the sensitivity of the attribution results under different flood thresholds was examined fig 6 and figs s12 s14 generally the selection of flood thresholds has limited impacts on the results of global attribution the dominant factors of the flood frequency at different thresholds share similar spatial patterns and the primary mechanism of global flood frequency change at different thresholds was heavy rainfall primarily for maximum 30 day rainfall nevertheless there are some changes in the proportion of stations dominated by each factor for example the percentages of stations dominated by soilmoist90 increased from 18 8 to 22 8 for flood thresholds of one peak per year to four peaks per year these results indicate that the impacts of antecedent wetness conditions tend to increase with the increase in the flood threshold nevertheless the dominant factors of flood change at different thresholds have no noticeable difference with similar spatial patterns and dominant percentages overall the decreases in multidimensional floods are mainly caused by the decreasing antecedent wetness conditions while the increases are led by the increasing heavy rainfall the dominant mechanisms for the flood magnitude and duration change were the antecedent wetness conditions rather than heavy rainfall however for the flood frequency heavy rainfall mainly in maxrain30 was the primary driving factor additionally snowmelt specifically controlled decreasing floods for the stations over high latitude regions 5 3 other factors impact flood trends in addition to the abovementioned driving factors other factors may also have impacts on flood changes such as atmospheric circulation controlling both the heavy and antecedent wetness conditions water storage changes catchment characteristics and dams limited by the data characteristics we only qualitatively investigated the roles of the listed factors in flood changes changes in atmospheric circulation would transform the dominant mechanism of storms lu et al 2013 by changing the heavy rainfall frequency and antecedent soil moisture conditions mallakpour and villarini 2016 which may further result in flood changes liu et al 2018 here we examined the annual and seasonal trends in the geopotential height horizontal wind at 850 hpa and total column of water vapor flux to investigate the possible impacts of atmospheric circulation changes on floods figs 9 11 as we know prevailing westerlies prevailing winds from west to the east in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60 play a crucial role in controlling climatic changes in europe laurian et al 2010 quan et al 2014 during winter a major flood season over western europe fig s15 england and its adjacent seas were covered by an anomalous low pressure center while the north atlantic ocean was controlled by an abnormal high pressure center fig 9g the intensive horizontal pressure gradient force enhanced the prevailing westerlies fig 9h and transported warmer and wetter moisture from the atlantic to northern europe fig 10c fig 11d additionally the low pressure center is accompanied by an updraft which promotes moisture convergence and triggers more moisture condensation najibi et al 2019 as a result significantly increasing trends in floods were detected in england fig 2 which were also found in previous regional studies blöschl et al 2019 in contrast eastern europe was covered by an anomalous high pressure center driving weaker prevailing westerlies and inhibiting moisture transport which further caused a decreasing trend in floods australia was controlled by an abnormal northerly wind resulting in the warm wet wind from the pacific covering northern australia while a dry heat wind from the arid inland covers southern australia as a result distinct north south differences in flood trends were detected across australia fig 2 see also liu and zhang 2017 the detected consistent spatiotemporal patterns regarding the relationships between variations in atmospheric circulation and flood trends confirm that shifts in atmospheric circulation have a significant influence on flood changes the liquid water equivalent thickness measured by grace can be regarded as a proxy for terrestrial water storage change twsc slater and villarini 2016 here we compared the trends in twsc with those in floods during the period covered by grace i e 2003 2016 generally the flood changes in magnitude frequency and duration were consistent with the trends in twsc fig 12 significantly increasing trends in floods were observed in the middle part of north america northern europe and eastern australia where regional twsc also showed increasing trends conversely significantly decreasing trends in floods over eastern brazil southeastern brazil and northern china were also in line with the trends in twsc these results indicate that water storage changes are an essential driver of flood changes however the flood trends are different from those of twsc in some regions such as southern africa this is because flood changes are impacted by many drivers in addition to water storage changes in addition the water storage changes were assessed at annual and seasonal scales while the flood changes may be more related to short term changes in heavy rainfall slater and villarini 2016 it should be noted that due to the limited record length of the grace satellite the grace and flood trends herein are based on the period from 2003 to 2016 nevertheless the spatial pattern of the flood trends shown in fig 12 was broadly similar to that observed from 1960 to 2014 fig 2 to investigate the influence of dams on multidimensional flood changes we summarized the percentages of stations showing significant increasing and decreasing trends among the stations that included one or more dams completed operational from 1960 to 2014 i e dam affected stations the bootstrap sampling approach was used to examine the significance level of the percentages fig 13 interestingly the percentages of dam affected stations with significant decreasing trends in multidimensional floods were all significant at the 5 significance level while those with significant increasing trends were all not significant these results indicated that the increases decreases were were not random in the dam affected stations suggesting that dams have an essential impact on decreasing multidimensional floods in addition the dams had differentiated impacts on the flood magnitude frequency and duration the percentages of dam affected stations showing sdt were more than four times larger than those showing sit for the flood magnitude for the flood frequency and duration however the ratios dropped to approximately two times these results indicate that dams are important for reducing the flood magnitude while they have relatively smaller impacts on the flood frequency and duration additionally the effects of dams on floods are restricted by the distance of the dam from the outlet for example the percentage of stations showing sdt in the flood magnitude among near dam impacted stations was larger than that among far dam impacted stations fig s16 to investigate the impacts of other catchment characteristics on flood trends we mainly focused on flood changes at the stations that had no large dams in the following analyses we stratified these stations into three groups containing an equal number of stations i e third quantiles based on the values of each characteristic and then counted the percentages of stations showing significant trends for each group fig 14 fig s17 and fig s18 decreasing multidimensional floods tended to occur in relatively dry regions the percentage of stations showing sdt among the stations with the first third of the aridity index is approximately twice as high as that among stations with the last two thirds fig 14 a fig s17a and fig s18a concerning the catchment area significantly decreasing trends in multidimensional floods were more likely to occur in large catchments where twsc and evapotranspiration played more critical roles ivancic and shaw 2015 particularly under a globally warming climate additionally the detected coverage area of storm events showed generally decreasing trends which would further intensify the decreasing trends in large catchments chang et al 2016 wasko et al 2016 with the increase in elevation the percentage of stations showing sit sdt in multidimensional floods tended to decline rise regions with larger slopes tended to have fewer stations showing sit however this relationship may be caused by the slope having multicollinearity with other factors with variance inflation factors being larger than 2 fig s19 for example there were strong negative correlations of the slope with the snowfall fraction fig s20 at high latitudes the percentages of stations showing significant increases in multidimensional floods were all clearly larger than those at low latitudes which was an observation that is supported by the increasingly wet conditions at high latitudes such as in northern europe stahl et al 2010 stahl et al 2012 and northern asia tananaev et al 2016 additionally climate model simulations from the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 have also projected that wetting conditions at high latitudes will continue in the future greve et al 2018 urbanization not only changes the catchment permeability and roughness sharma et al 2018 but also modifies the rainfall intensity gu et al 2019b as a result the percentages of stations showing sit increase with the increase in the urbanized fraction generally stations showing sit in multidimensional floods are more likely to occur in catchments with low elevation higher latitudes low ndvi high seasonality low slopes and or high urbanization in contrast stations with sdt in multidimensional floods are usually in catchments with high aridity indices high elevation low latitudes low climate seasonality and or low urbanization fig 14 fig s17 and fig s18 these results indicate that catchment characteristics play an essential regulatory role in flood changes 6 discussion and conclusions although the impacts of flood disasters have risen in recent decades tanoue et al 2016 the question of whether floods with different dimensions e g magnitude frequency and duration are increasing remains largely unanswered at the global level in europe both increasing and decreasing trends were found blöschl et al 2019 in the central united states a greater frequency but not a larger magnitude of floods has been detected mallakpour and villarini 2015 however little evidence for increasing trends in flood frequency was found in other regions around the globe therefore the results of this study provide a systematic update to flood changes worldwide based on comparing existing global assessments do et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2019 the key progress resulting from this study is the consideration of multidimensional flood behaviors more importantly this study provides the first quantitative evaluation of the dominant mechanisms driving multidimensional flood changes across the globe at the global scale multidimensional floods have tended to decrease in the past 55 years i e the flood magnitude has decreased the frequency has decreased and the duration has become shorter in general sensitivity analysis shows that the screening criteria of datasets and the selection of thresholds have limited impacts on the results for the flood magnitude more stations showed sdt than sit which is consistent with the results of previous studies do et al 2017 kundzewicz et al 2014 however our finding that the flood frequency has decreased is not in line with regional results for example mallakpour and villarini 2015 found that floods have become more frequent in the central united states this is because they focused on regional floods with different amounts of hydrological stations implying that the regional flood changes cannot represent the global case it is worth noting that the multidimensional flood changes have no significant trend at most hydrological stations which is similar to previous studies blöschl et al 2019 do et al 2017 mallakpour and villarini 2015 for example blöschl et al 2019 suggested that european river floods have both increasing and decreasing trends with less than 30 of stations showing significant trends at the 10 significance level at the regional scale both increasing and decreasing trends were found in floods which verified the argument of blöschl et al 2019 regarding both increasing and decreasing european riverine floods the spatial patterns in the signs of trends are generally consistent across multidimensional floods with floods showing a larger magnitude greater frequency and longer duration in some regions but a smaller magnitude reduced frequency and shorter duration in others this finding largely agrees with a previous study gudmundsson et al 2019 which showed that the entire streamflow distribution was changing upward or downward in different regions worldwide it is worth mentioning that the observed multidimensional flood trends may not continue in the future since these changes were caused by both climate variability and human activities rather than persistent climate change hodgkins et al 2017 villarini and wasko 2021 in addition since the observed trends depend on the recording period the changing features of global floods may differ if the recording period is changed berghuijs et al 2017 hall et al 2014 nonetheless our results are broadly consistent with previous studies in terms of regional floods and projected climate changes for example previous studies have reported increasing floods in northern europe bloeschl et al 2017 and northern australia liu and zhang 2017 while a tendency toward decreasing floods was found in western north america whitfield 2001 and southern australia liu and zhang 2017 in addition global climate models from the cmip5 ensemble suggest that wetting conditions with global warming are projected in many regions such as northern north america southern brazil and northern europe greve et al 2018 in contrast increasing drying conditions have been detected in southern north america eastern brazil the northern mediterranean southern arica and southern australia greve et al 2018 these results from isolated regional flood studies and global climate projections are broadly consistent with our findings by developing a new attribution framework for multidimensional flood change this study highlights the global patterns of the dominant mechanisms of flood trends flood magnitude and duration changes were primarily driven by antecedent wetness conditions max soil90 in particular while rainfall frequency changes were mainly caused by heavy rainfall maxrain30 in particular previous studies have reported an apparent spatiotemporal mismatch between the annual maximum rainfall and flood changes that is more increases in maximum daily rainfall and a lack of corresponding increases in floods do et al 2017 min et al 2011 the results in this study show that the stations with flood magnitudes dominated by maxrain1 account for less than 5 which is far less than that controlled by antecedent wetness conditions this implies that the maximum daily rainfall has limited impacts on flood changes in addition we found that the decrease in floods was mainly driven by the antecedent wetness conditions while the increases in floods were generally caused by the increasing heavy rainfall however since the negative impacts of antecedent wetness conditions were usually larger than the positive heavy rainfall the global multidimensional floods tended to decrease instead of increase hence the results of this study provide a quantitative clarification of why the flood magnitude does not increase with increasing rainfall extremes do et al 2020a sharma et al 2018 the main limitation of this study is the uneven distribution of stations worldwide and differing temporal coverages of streamflow records at different stations which may have affected the results of the regional and global assessment to a certain degree in addition owing to the lack of long term observations we provided a simple analysis of catchment characteristics and dam impacts on flood changes without further considering them in the quantitative attribution framework lastly uncertainties and errors also exist in the simulation and attribution based on linear regression for example the linear regression without a zero bound constraint may lead to unrealistic negative values in some catchments nevertheless this study presented unprecedented insight into multidimensional flood behaviors and provided a first quantitative evaluation of the dominant mechanisms of change in multidimensional floods across the globe credit authorship contribution statement jianyu liu

2754,stormwater systems will likely require major upgrades due to increases in peak flows caused by the combined effects of urbanization densification urban infill and climate change recently the real time control rtc of storages has been considered as a means to reduce peak flows and potentially avoid major infrastructure upgrades this paper introduces a rtc approach the target flow control tfc approach which is able to maintain system outflows at or below specified target flows e g existing system capacity the key features of the approach are that it does not require calibration to catchment specific data as is the case for existing approaches and is only based on storage level information measured in real time during rainfall events this makes the approach generally applicable to different catchments and able to respond to future changes in rainfall due to land use and or climate change the tfc approach is tested on a simple two storage system for 750 design rainfall events from a range of climates event durations rainfall intensities and temporal patterns using a practically achievable control time step of 30 s results show that the tfc approach can achieve the desired target flows effectively with 95 of the experiments having less than 10 errors in target flows this is an exciting achievement given the tfc approach does not require calibration and only requires measurable storage level information the outcomes highlight the potential of the tfc approach as a practical rtc approach that can maximize the effectiveness of existing stormwater conveyance systems by maintaining stormwater system outflows at desired target flows thereby potentially avoiding stormwater infrastructure upgrades due to land use and climate change keywords stormwater management real time control urban flooding data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urbanization densification and climate change are likely to increase urban flooding and stress on current stormwater systems locatelli et al 2017 van der bruggen et al 2010 pandey et al 2003 this is because the extent of impervious areas is likely to increase due to the impact of urbanization and densification li et al 2017 leading to higher runoff volumes and peak flow rates burns et al 2012 in addition climate change is likely to result in an increase in extreme climate events including high intensity rainfall events sharma et al 2018 leading to a further increase in runoff peak flow rates wasko and sharma 2015 therefore the capacity of current stormwater systems is unlikely to be able to accommodate these projected increases in future peak runoffs and potentially expensive infrastructure upgrades will be required recently real time control has been considered to be an effective way to deal with increasing runoff peak flow rates campisano et al 2017 shishegar et al 2018 and thus reduce the stress on stormwater systems kerkez et al 2016 real time control can not only help with urban flood mitigation bilodeau et al 2018 mullapudi et al 2018 chang et al 2014 but can also provide opportunities to achieve co benefits including the provision of non potable stormwater xu et al 2018 xu et al 2020 campisano et al 2017 water quality improvement muschalla et al 2014 sharior et al 2019 shen et al 2020 and the ability to meet the requirements of an ecological and environmental flow regime xu et al 2018 xu et al 2020 for urban flood mitigation the most straightforward approach to real time control is to empty the storage before a predicted rainfall event in order to utilize the available storage capacity as retention storage xu et al 2018 campisano et al 2017 schubert et al 2017 however the ability of this control strategy to reduce peak flows deteriorates rapidly when the total runoff volume exceeds system storage volume liang et al 2019 when the storage is full it loses the ability to reduce runoff peak flow rates to deal with this limitation a number of real time control strategies have been developed to control the storage during rainfall events to offset the runoff peak flow rates ibrahim 2020 li 2020 lund et al 2020 mullapudi et al 2020 sadler et al 2020 real time control strategies during rainfall events can generally be grouped into two categories 1 predictive control and 2 reactive control lund et al 2018 for predictive control control schemes are generally developed based on forecast temporal patterns of future rainfall events they are tailored to specific events using optimization algorithms thereby maximizing the peak flow reductions that can be achieved for particular events di matteo et al 2019a liang et al 2019 liang et al 2021 however this requires knowledge of the temporal patterns of upcoming rainfall events di matteo et al 2019a liang et al 2019 liang et al 2021 which makes it challenging to implement in practice for reactive control control rules that can be applied to different events are developed by calibration to a range of design rainfall events meneses et al 2018 sharior et al 2019 li 2020 using either manual schmitt et al 2020 ibrahim 2020 or optimization dong et al 2017 li 2020 approaches these rules translate available information such as storage levels flow rates and rainfall information into control strategies and thus require these inputs to be measured in real time during storm events chang et al 2014 while reactive control overcomes the limitation of predictive control of requiring knowledge of the temporal pattern of future rainfall events by only requiring information that can be measured easily during the rainfall event itself it has the disadvantage of requiring calibration thus the performance of reactive control strategies can be impacted significantly by the calibration process as well as the data used for calibration for example calibration data are generally catchment specific making it difficult to apply control strategies that have been tuned to particular catchment conditions to catchments with different physical or climatic properties without a significant reduction in performance schmitt et al 2020 in addition as control strategies are generally static muschalla et al 2014 sadler et al 2020 if underlying rainfall runoff processes are altered in response to climate change strategies calibrated on historical data are likely to perform poorly and would need to be recalibrated in order to deal with future rainfalls or to be adapted using approaches such as reinforcement learning mullapudi et al 2020 consequently while existing reactive control approaches have demonstrated the potential of using real time control for urban flood mitigation they rely on calibration to site specific data and are therefore not generally applicable across a wide range of catchments and climates to overcome these shortcomings the objectives of this technical note are 1 to introduce a reactive control approach that does not require calibration and can therefore be applied to a wide range of catchments and under changing conditions in real time without knowledge of future rainfall events 2 to test the effectiveness of the proposed control approach in a simulated modelling environment using a wide range of rainfall events covering multiple climates rainfall durations intensities and temporal patterns to illustrate the ability of the approach to cater to a wide range of catchment and climatic conditions without the need for calibration it should be noted that the contribution of this technical note is focused on introducing the proposed reactive control approach and testing the hypothesis that it can be used to achieve desired maximum system peak flows downstream of a two storage system under a wide range of rainfall and climatic conditions without requiring calibration and without any information on the rainfall event to which it is responding relying on real time measurements of storage level instead ancillary issues such as testing the performance of the approach on more complex systems testing the ability of the approach to cater to a range of flow objectives in addition to peak flow reduction and developing appropriate methods for sizing storages to avoid overflow are beyond the scope of this technical contribution 2 methodology 2 1 proposed target flow control approach the urban flooding problem addressed is the exceedance of the capacity of a stormwater conveyance system at a point of interest such that the peak flow in the system at that location qpeak is greater than its flow capacity qcapacity qpeak qcapacity the concept underpinning the proposed target flow control tfc approach is to temporarily detain any excess flow with the aid of storage and to control the outflow of this storage in real time during a storm event to maintain the peak of the controlled storage outflow qout t at the capacity of the stormwater system qpeak qcapacity for as long as possible by doing this the storage outflow can be maximized and thereby the storage volume utilized effectively consequently the flow target of the tfc approach is set as the stormwater conveyance system capacity qtarget qcapacity the controlled storage outflow qout t is a function of the orifice opening percentage ot and the storage level at time t ht the maximum storage outflow qmax t is the uncontrolled storage outflow with the orifice fully open and is a function of the storage level at time t ht based on the maximum storage outflow qmax t the proposed control strategy adjusts the controlled storage outflow at time t qout t such that it satisfies the following conditions if qmax t qtarget then qout t qtarget if qmax t qtarget then qout t qmax t to ensure the controlled storage outflow equals the system flow target qout t qtarget when the maximum storage outflow is larger than the system flow target qmax t qtarget the tfc approach uses the following equation which is a re arranged version of the orifice equation reader harris and sattary 1990 reader harris et al 1995 to adjust the opening percentage of the storage outlet orifice at time t ot based on the storage level at time t ht as follows also see fig 1 1 o t q target c d a orifice 2 g h t where c d is the orifice discharge coefficient a orifice is the area of the orifice i e the storage outlet g is the gravitational constant and h t is the storage level at time t as storage levels can be measured in real time during a rainfall event very easily by using low cost pressure sensors the orifice opening can be adjusted accordingly and thus the tfc approach does not require calibration fig 2 illustrates how the tfc approach is able to maintain storage outflows at the target flow qtarget for rainfall events with various temporal patterns as can be seen the storage outflow is controlled during the rainfall event based on storage level with the aid of equation 1 and the outflow is always maintained at or below the target flow stormwater conveyance system capacity red lines fig 2g and h the orifice is kept fully open when the maximum outflow does not exceed the target flow qtarget but once the maximum outflow exceeds the target flow qtarget the orifice is adjusted to be partially open based on real time storage level information green lines fig 2c and d by doing this regardless of the rainfall event the tfc approach is able to ensure storage outflows are maintained at or below the target flow black lines fig 2g and h provided the tank volume is sufficiently large therefore utilizing the maximum capacity of the existing stormwater conveyance system with the help of the tfc approach storage outflows are maintained at the stormwater conveyance system capacity for as long as possible which eliminates unnecessary usage of storage volume for example the retention storage volume is used before the capacity is exceeded and as a result the required storage volume can be minimized 2 2 implementation of the tfc approach to test the effectiveness of the proposed target flow control tfc approach it is implemented using the simulation approach shown in fig 3 as part of this approach the target flow qtarget is derived from the stormwater conveyance system capacity and the control time step δt is pre determined before the application of the tfc approach which would be based on the capabilities of the selected control infrastructure e g hardware and software in practice for the first time step t control time step δt the storage level ht is measured and retrieved in real time with the aid of sensors in the storage next the maximum outflow qmax t is calculated with the aid of the orifice equation based on the real time storage level ht information and a 100 open orifice opening percentage fully open if the maximum outflow qmax t is larger than the target flow qtarget the orifice opening percentage ot is calculated and updated using the real time storage level ht and the target flow qtarget using

used to determine design rainfall events based on australian rainfall and runoff 2019 arr 2019 ball et al 2016 the ten recommended rainfall temporal patterns from arr 2019 are taken into consideration as storm temporal patterns are likely to have a significant influence on peak flows the temporal resolution of these storm temporal patterns changes depending on event duration ranging from 5 mins for 30 min duration to 1 hr for 24 hr duration these design rainfall events were obtained for three cities with different climates adelaide melbourne and sydney resulting in a total of 750 rainfall events each of the rainfall events has a corresponding system flow target qtarget which is taken to be the capacity of the stormwater conveyance system when the tfc approach is used these system flow targets

fig 4 the quartiles of the target flows are shown by the coloured box and whisker plots using the scale on the left and the quartiles of the percentage errors are shown by the grey box and whisker plots using the scale on the right as can be seen from fig 4 for a wide range of rainfalls and corresponding target flows the tfc approach performs well for all trials 20 error with 95 of the target flow errors being less than 10 the performance of the tfc approach improves when the duration of rainfall increases fig 4 for example the mean target flow errors are reduced from around 8 for 30 min rainfall in adelaide to around 1 for 24 hr rainfall in adelaide with the 2kl storage fig 4a for the three selected cities the target flows for adelaide and melbourne are similar while the target flows for sydney are much higher however the target flow errors are always generally small and have no significant differences between the selected cities for example the mean target flow of 1 aep 30 min duration rainfall increases significantly from 6 9 l s in adelaide blue box fig 4a to 13 8 l s in sydney blue box fig 4c with the same 2kl storage but the target flow errors are both around 10 black box fig 4a and c it should be noted that although most target flow errors are less than 10 there are still some relatively higher errors that are close to 20 for example the maximum 20 target flow error for all trials occurs for 1 aep 60 min rainfall in adelaide with 2kl storage fig 4a however when the storage volume is increased from 2kl to 10kl and the target flow is reduced accordingly the error is always less than 10 fig 4d f the results suggest that the tfc approach which only uses information on current tank water levels is able to perform well for a wide range of rainfalls without requiring any calibration this highlights that the proposed approach is able to overcome the shortcomings of existing calibrated reactive control schemes as their performance would not be able to deal with changes in future rainfall patterns caused by climate change 4 2 analysis of results this section examines two typical control strategies simple and complex resulting from the application of the tfc approach to maintaining storage outflow at the system target flows qtarget as the operation of the tfc approach is based on real time measurements of storage level ht two examples are selected based on differences in the way storage levels change over time for the 2kl storage for example 1 simple the storage level simply rises to the maximum storage level and then falls to zero for example 2 complex the storage level rises and falls several times during the rainfall event in order to clearly illustrate the impact of the control scheme as well as how it works plots of system inflow orifice opening percentage storage level and system outflow are provided and discussed example 1 simple variation in storage level for example 1 the storage level first increases as the system inflow is larger than the target flow qtarget fig 5 a and e from t 18 min based on the required orifice opening percentage calculated by equation 1 the actual orifice opening percentage is set to be partially open to achieve the system target flow fig 5c from t 18 min to t 38 min the actual orifice opening percentage is adjusted gradually from 100 fully open to 40 open fig 5c at t 38 min the inflow rate of the storage equals the target flow resulting in the maximum storage level fig 5e after that the storage level falls from its maximum level to zero because of the decreasing storage level the orifice opening percentage is adjusted gradually from 40 to 100 fully open t 60 min fig 5c in order to maintain the storage outflow at the target flow for as long as possible based on eq 1 fig 5g this demonstrates the ability of the proposed tfc approach to perform as expected fig 2c and d example 2 complex variation in storage level for example 2 the storage level increases from t 2 h to 4 h fig 5f as the inflow is larger than the target flow and as a result the orifice opening percentage is gradually reduced from 100 open fully open to 36 open fig 5d in accordance with eq 1 to maintain the outflow at the target flow fig 5h the storage level reaches its maximum at t 4 h fig 5f and from t 4 h to 7 h the storage level decreases from its maximum level to a local minimum value 60 of the maximum level fig 5f during this time period the orifice opening percentage increases from 36 open to 42 open in response to the changes in storage level after that between t 7 h to 8 h the storage level rises again to a local maximum value 70 of the maximum level fig 5f and the orifice opening percentage is decreased accordingly from 42 open to 39 open fig 5d by following the same procedure and adjusting the orifice opening percentage based on the change of storage level between the local maximum and minimum values the storage outflow is always maintained at or below the target flow as desired thus the results indicate that the proposed tfc approach is able to achieve the target flow with the aid of eq 1 irrespective of the complexity of the temporal variation of the incoming rainfall without requiring any calibration to local conditions 5 discussion 5 1 practicality of the implementation of the tfc approach with the aid of low cost sensors storage levels can be measured in real time to enable the required orifice opening percentage to be calculated in accordance with eq 1 consequently the tfc approach can be implemented easily in practice using current technology this is in contrast to predictive control schemes which rely on forecasts of the magnitude and temporal variation of incoming rainfall events which can be highly uncertain especially for small time and spatial scales di matteo et al 2019a liang et al 2019 in this study a 30 s control time step is used and the results show that the tfc approach provides good performance 95 of the trials having less than a 10 target flow error for a wide range of rainfall events this is a reasonable assumption of a practically feasible control time step using currently available control technology an electric actuator can be connected to the orifice system to achieve the desired opening closing times and thus meet the requirement of a small control time step cui et al 2017 ma et al 2021 depending on the required torque electric actuators are able to operate from fully closed to fully open in the range from 6 s to 58 s om series quarter turn electrical actuator operation manual for example the electric actuator om f manufactured by process systems can operate a 100 mm orifice 90 mm orifice is assumed in the case study from fully open to fully closed in 16 s in addition most changes in the orifice opening percentage for one control time step are less than 10 of the full range which corresponds to a 1 6 s operating time this is very short compared to the 30 s control time step used in the computational experiments presented in this paper therefore for this study it is practically feasible to use a 30 s control time step for implementing the proposed tfc approach 5 2 practical benefits of the tfc approach the tfc approach has a number of practical benefits first as the approach can be used to maintain peak stormwater runoff below the capacity of existing stormwater conveyance infrastructure it can extend the lifespan of this infrastructure and avoid or delay costly pipe upgrades second the approach can be adapted to achieve a range of other stormwater management objectives such as adaptation to the impacts of climate change wu et al 2020 culley et al 2021 bennett et al 2021 and improvement of water quality and stormwater harvesting campisano et al 2017 muschalla et al 2014 shen et al 2020 for example during non storm periods the storage outlet could be closed and the harvested stormwater used for multiple purposes xu et al 2020 including water supply dandy et al 2019 di matteo et al 2019b or achieving the downstream environmental flow requirements shen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 for street scale storages by detaining stormwater in the storage for a particular length of time downstream water quality can be improved sharior et al 2019 especially by integrating storages with bioretention systems shen et al 2020 5 3 future research future research should be undertaken to increase the performance generality and practicality of the proposed approach this includes i testing the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a larger scale case study with multiple storages in parallel and in series ii developing an optimization framework to identify required design storage volumes so as to identify the optimal balance between minimizing required storage volumes and hence costs and ensuring storages do not overflow iii testing the ability of the tfc approach to achieve a range of other hydraulic and environmental objectives iv testing and evaluating the tfc approach using physical experiments and v developing regional storage size guidelines by running continuous simulations 6 conclusion this study introduces the target flow control tfc approach which is a reactive control approach that maintains stormwater system outflows at or below pre determined target flows without the need for calibration to catchment specific data this is achieved by adjusting the storage orifice opening percentage based on real time storage level information using the orifice equation the utility of the proposed tfc approach was tested using 750 different rainfall events from a range of climates from three australian capital cities adelaide melbourne and sydney and with a wide range of rainfall durations from 30 mins to 24 h rainfall intensities from frequent to rare and temporal patterns the experiments demonstrate that the tfc approach can achieve system flow targets effectively for the wide range of rainfall conditions investigated with an error of less than 10 for 95 of the 750 trials considered the above performance was achieved with a control time step of 30 s which can be easily achieved with existing control technologies while the performance of the tfc approach needs to be tested on more complex systems it shows great potential in practical benefits as the tfc approach is able to maintain system outflows at or below target flows stormwater storages can be applied to maximize utilization of the downstream capacity of existing stormwater conveyance systems in addition as the approach does not require calibration to specific local conditions and only relies on real time storage level information it is applicable to a wide range of catchments and will not be impacted by land use and climate change

2754,stormwater systems will likely require major upgrades due to increases in peak flows caused by the combined effects of urbanization densification urban infill and climate change recently the real time control rtc of storages has been considered as a means to reduce peak flows and potentially avoid major infrastructure upgrades this paper introduces a rtc approach the target flow control tfc approach which is able to maintain system outflows at or below specified target flows e g existing system capacity the key features of the approach are that it does not require calibration to catchment specific data as is the case for existing approaches and is only based on storage level information measured in real time during rainfall events this makes the approach generally applicable to different catchments and able to respond to future changes in rainfall due to land use and or climate change the tfc approach is tested on a simple two storage system for 750 design rainfall events from a range of climates event durations rainfall intensities and temporal patterns using a practically achievable control time step of 30 s results show that the tfc approach can achieve the desired target flows effectively with 95 of the experiments having less than 10 errors in target flows this is an exciting achievement given the tfc approach does not require calibration and only requires measurable storage level information the outcomes highlight the potential of the tfc approach as a practical rtc approach that can maximize the effectiveness of existing stormwater conveyance systems by maintaining stormwater system outflows at desired target flows thereby potentially avoiding stormwater infrastructure upgrades due to land use and climate change keywords stormwater management real time control urban flooding data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urbanization densification and climate change are likely to increase urban flooding and stress on current stormwater systems locatelli et al 2017 van der bruggen et al 2010 pandey et al 2003 this is because the extent of impervious areas is likely to increase due to the impact of urbanization and densification li et al 2017 leading to higher runoff volumes and peak flow rates burns et al 2012 in addition climate change is likely to result in an increase in extreme climate events including high intensity rainfall events sharma et al 2018 leading to a further increase in runoff peak flow rates wasko and sharma 2015 therefore the capacity of current stormwater systems is unlikely to be able to accommodate these projected increases in future peak runoffs and potentially expensive infrastructure upgrades will be required recently real time control has been considered to be an effective way to deal with increasing runoff peak flow rates campisano et al 2017 shishegar et al 2018 and thus reduce the stress on stormwater systems kerkez et al 2016 real time control can not only help with urban flood mitigation bilodeau et al 2018 mullapudi et al 2018 chang et al 2014 but can also provide opportunities to achieve co benefits including the provision of non potable stormwater xu et al 2018 xu et al 2020 campisano et al 2017 water quality improvement muschalla et al 2014 sharior et al 2019 shen et al 2020 and the ability to meet the requirements of an ecological and environmental flow regime xu et al 2018 xu et al 2020 for urban flood mitigation the most straightforward approach to real time control is to empty the storage before a predicted rainfall event in order to utilize the available storage capacity as retention storage xu et al 2018 campisano et al 2017 schubert et al 2017 however the ability of this control strategy to reduce peak flows deteriorates rapidly when the total runoff volume exceeds system storage volume liang et al 2019 when the storage is full it loses the ability to reduce runoff peak flow rates to deal with this limitation a number of real time control strategies have been developed to control the storage during rainfall events to offset the runoff peak flow rates ibrahim 2020 li 2020 lund et al 2020 mullapudi et al 2020 sadler et al 2020 real time control strategies during rainfall events can generally be grouped into two categories 1 predictive control and 2 reactive control lund et al 2018 for predictive control control schemes are generally developed based on forecast temporal patterns of future rainfall events they are tailored to specific events using optimization algorithms thereby maximizing the peak flow reductions that can be achieved for particular events di matteo et al 2019a liang et al 2019 liang et al 2021 however this requires knowledge of the temporal patterns of upcoming rainfall events di matteo et al 2019a liang et al 2019 liang et al 2021 which makes it challenging to implement in practice for reactive control control rules that can be applied to different events are developed by calibration to a range of design rainfall events meneses et al 2018 sharior et al 2019 li 2020 using either manual schmitt et al 2020 ibrahim 2020 or optimization dong et al 2017 li 2020 approaches these rules translate available information such as storage levels flow rates and rainfall information into control strategies and thus require these inputs to be measured in real time during storm events chang et al 2014 while reactive control overcomes the limitation of predictive control of requiring knowledge of the temporal pattern of future rainfall events by only requiring information that can be measured easily during the rainfall event itself it has the disadvantage of requiring calibration thus the performance of reactive control strategies can be impacted significantly by the calibration process as well as the data used for calibration for example calibration data are generally catchment specific making it difficult to apply control strategies that have been tuned to particular catchment conditions to catchments with different physical or climatic properties without a significant reduction in performance schmitt et al 2020 in addition as control strategies are generally static muschalla et al 2014 sadler et al 2020 if underlying rainfall runoff processes are altered in response to climate change strategies calibrated on historical data are likely to perform poorly and would need to be recalibrated in order to deal with future rainfalls or to be adapted using approaches such as reinforcement learning mullapudi et al 2020 consequently while existing reactive control approaches have demonstrated the potential of using real time control for urban flood mitigation they rely on calibration to site specific data and are therefore not generally applicable across a wide range of catchments and climates to overcome these shortcomings the objectives of this technical note are 1 to introduce a reactive control approach that does not require calibration and can therefore be applied to a wide range of catchments and under changing conditions in real time without knowledge of future rainfall events 2 to test the effectiveness of the proposed control approach in a simulated modelling environment using a wide range of rainfall events covering multiple climates rainfall durations intensities and temporal patterns to illustrate the ability of the approach to cater to a wide range of catchment and climatic conditions without the need for calibration it should be noted that the contribution of this technical note is focused on introducing the proposed reactive control approach and testing the hypothesis that it can be used to achieve desired maximum system peak flows downstream of a two storage system under a wide range of rainfall and climatic conditions without requiring calibration and without any information on the rainfall event to which it is responding relying on real time measurements of storage level instead ancillary issues such as testing the performance of the approach on more complex systems testing the ability of the approach to cater to a range of flow objectives in addition to peak flow reduction and developing appropriate methods for sizing storages to avoid overflow are beyond the scope of this technical contribution 2 methodology 2 1 proposed target flow control approach the urban flooding problem addressed is the exceedance of the capacity of a stormwater conveyance system at a point of interest such that the peak flow in the system at that location qpeak is greater than its flow capacity qcapacity qpeak qcapacity the concept underpinning the proposed target flow control tfc approach is to temporarily detain any excess flow with the aid of storage and to control the outflow of this storage in real time during a storm event to maintain the peak of the controlled storage outflow qout t at the capacity of the stormwater system qpeak qcapacity for as long as possible by doing this the storage outflow can be maximized and thereby the storage volume utilized effectively consequently the flow target of the tfc approach is set as the stormwater conveyance system capacity qtarget qcapacity the controlled storage outflow qout t is a function of the orifice opening percentage ot and the storage level at time t ht the maximum storage outflow qmax t is the uncontrolled storage outflow with the orifice fully open and is a function of the storage level at time t ht based on the maximum storage outflow qmax t the proposed control strategy adjusts the controlled storage outflow at time t qout t such that it satisfies the following conditions if qmax t qtarget then qout t qtarget if qmax t qtarget then qout t qmax t to ensure the controlled storage outflow equals the system flow target qout t qtarget when the maximum storage outflow is larger than the system flow target qmax t qtarget the tfc approach uses the following equation which is a re arranged version of the orifice equation reader harris and sattary 1990 reader harris et al 1995 to adjust the opening percentage of the storage outlet orifice at time t ot based on the storage level at time t ht as follows also see fig 1 1 o t q target c d a orifice 2 g h t where c d is the orifice discharge coefficient a orifice is the area of the orifice i e the storage outlet g is the gravitational constant and h t is the storage level at time t as storage levels can be measured in real time during a rainfall event very easily by using low cost pressure sensors the orifice opening can be adjusted accordingly and thus the tfc approach does not require calibration fig 2 illustrates how the tfc approach is able to maintain storage outflows at the target flow qtarget for rainfall events with various temporal patterns as can be seen the storage outflow is controlled during the rainfall event based on storage level with the aid of equation 1 and the outflow is always maintained at or below the target flow stormwater conveyance system capacity red lines fig 2g and h the orifice is kept fully open when the maximum outflow does not exceed the target flow qtarget but once the maximum outflow exceeds the target flow qtarget the orifice is adjusted to be partially open based on real time storage level information green lines fig 2c and d by doing this regardless of the rainfall event the tfc approach is able to ensure storage outflows are maintained at or below the target flow black lines fig 2g and h provided the tank volume is sufficiently large therefore utilizing the maximum capacity of the existing stormwater conveyance system with the help of the tfc approach storage outflows are maintained at the stormwater conveyance system capacity for as long as possible which eliminates unnecessary usage of storage volume for example the retention storage volume is used before the capacity is exceeded and as a result the required storage volume can be minimized 2 2 implementation of the tfc approach to test the effectiveness of the proposed target flow control tfc approach it is implemented using the simulation approach shown in fig 3 as part of this approach the target flow qtarget is derived from the stormwater conveyance system capacity and the control time step δt is pre determined before the application of the tfc approach which would be based on the capabilities of the selected control infrastructure e g hardware and software in practice for the first time step t control time step δt the storage level ht is measured and retrieved in real time with the aid of sensors in the storage next the maximum outflow qmax t is calculated with the aid of the orifice equation based on the real time storage level ht information and a 100 open orifice opening percentage fully open if the maximum outflow qmax t is larger than the target flow qtarget the orifice opening percentage ot is calculated and updated using the real time storage level ht and the target flow qtarget using equation 1 if the maximum storage outflow qmax t is less than or equal to the pre determined target flow qtarget the orifice opening percentage ot is set to 100 open fully open to achieve the maximum storage outflow qmax t for the next time step t t δt the orifice opening percentage ot is determined using the same procedure and this cycle continues until the end of the rainfall event by applying this approach the storage outflow qout t can have the best chance of being maintained at or below the pre determined target flow qtarget which is the stormwater conveyance system capacity 3 case study

orifice opening percentage storage level and system outflow are provided and discussed example 1 simple variation in storage level for example 1 the storage level first increases as the system inflow is larger than the target flow qtarget fig 5 a and e from t 18 min based on the required orifice opening percentage calculated by equation 1 the actual orifice opening percentage is set to be partially open to achieve the system target flow fig 5c from t 18 min to t 38 min the actual orifice opening percentage is adjusted gradually from 100 fully open to 40 open fig 5c at t 38 min the inflow rate of the storage equals the target flow resulting in the maximum storage level fig 5e after that the storage level falls from its maximum level to zero because of the decreasing storage level the orifice opening percentage is adjusted gradually from 40 to 100 fully open t 60 min fig 5c in order to maintain the storage outflow at the target flow for as long as possible based on eq 1 fig 5g this demonstrates the ability of the proposed tfc approach to perform as expected fig 2c and d example 2 complex variation in storage level for example 2 the storage level increases from t 2 h to 4 h fig 5f as the inflow is larger than the target flow and as a result the orifice opening percentage is gradually reduced from 100 open fully open to 36 open fig 5d in accordance with eq 1 to maintain the outflow at the target flow fig 5h the storage level reaches its maximum at t 4 h fig 5f and from t 4 h to 7 h the storage level decreases from its maximum level to a local minimum value 60 of the maximum level fig 5f during this time period the orifice opening percentage increases from 36 open to 42 open in response to the changes in storage level after that between t 7 h to 8 h the storage level rises again to a local maximum value 70 of the maximum level fig 5f and the orifice opening percentage is decreased accordingly from 42 open to 39 open fig 5d by following the same procedure and adjusting the orifice opening percentage based on the change of storage level between the local maximum and minimum values the storage outflow is always maintained at or below the target flow as desired thus the results indicate that the proposed tfc approach is able to achieve the target flow with the aid of eq 1 irrespective of the complexity of the temporal variation of the incoming rainfall without requiring any calibration to local conditions 5 discussion 5 1 practicality of the implementation of the tfc approach with the aid of low cost sensors storage levels can be measured in real time to enable the required orifice opening percentage to be calculated in accordance with eq 1 consequently the tfc approach can be implemented easily in practice using current technology this is in contrast to predictive control schemes which rely on forecasts of the magnitude and temporal variation of incoming rainfall events which can be highly uncertain especially for small time and spatial scales di matteo et al 2019a liang et al 2019 in this study a 30 s control time step is used and the results show that the tfc approach provides good performance 95 of the trials having less than a 10 target flow error for a wide range of rainfall events this is a reasonable assumption of a practically feasible control time step using currently available control technology an electric actuator can be connected to the orifice system to achieve the desired opening closing times and thus meet the requirement of a small control time step cui et al 2017 ma et al 2021 depending on the required torque electric actuators are able to operate from fully closed to fully open in the range from 6 s to 58 s om series quarter turn electrical actuator operation manual for example the electric actuator om f manufactured by process systems can operate a 100 mm orifice 90 mm orifice is assumed in the case study from fully open to fully closed in 16 s in addition most changes in the orifice opening percentage for one control time step are less than 10 of the full range which corresponds to a 1 6 s operating time this is very short compared to the 30 s control time step used in the computational experiments presented in this paper therefore for this study it is practically feasible to use a 30 s control time step for implementing the proposed tfc approach 5 2 practical benefits of the tfc approach the tfc approach has a number of practical benefits first as the approach can be used to maintain peak stormwater runoff below the capacity of existing stormwater conveyance infrastructure it can extend the lifespan of this infrastructure and avoid or delay costly pipe upgrades second the approach can be adapted to achieve a range of other stormwater management objectives such as adaptation to the impacts of climate change wu et al 2020 culley et al 2021 bennett et al 2021 and improvement of water quality and stormwater harvesting campisano et al 2017 muschalla et al 2014 shen et al 2020 for example during non storm periods the storage outlet could be closed and the harvested stormwater used for multiple purposes xu et al 2020 including water supply dandy et al 2019 di matteo et al 2019b or achieving the downstream environmental flow requirements shen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 for street scale storages by detaining stormwater in the storage for a particular length of time downstream water quality can be improved sharior et al 2019 especially by integrating storages with bioretention systems shen et al 2020 5 3 future research future research should be undertaken to increase the performance generality and practicality of the proposed approach this includes i testing the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a larger scale case study with multiple storages in parallel and in series ii developing an optimization framework to identify required design storage volumes so as to identify the optimal balance between minimizing required storage volumes and hence costs and ensuring storages do not overflow iii testing the ability of the tfc approach to achieve a range of other hydraulic and environmental objectives iv testing and evaluating the tfc approach using physical experiments and v developing regional storage size guidelines by running continuous simulations 6 conclusion this study introduces the target flow control tfc approach which is a reactive control approach that maintains stormwater system outflows at or below pre determined target flows without the need for calibration to catchment specific data this is achieved by adjusting the storage orifice opening percentage based on real time storage level information using the orifice equation the utility of the proposed tfc approach was tested using 750 different rainfall events from a range of climates from three australian capital cities adelaide melbourne and sydney and with a wide range of rainfall durations from 30 mins to 24 h rainfall intensities from frequent to rare and temporal patterns the experiments demonstrate that the tfc approach can achieve system flow targets effectively for the wide range of rainfall conditions investigated with an error of less than 10 for 95 of the 750 trials considered the above performance was achieved with a control time step of 30 s which can be easily achieved with existing control technologies while the performance of the tfc approach needs to be tested on more complex systems it shows great potential in practical benefits as the tfc approach is able to maintain system outflows at or below target flows stormwater storages can be applied to maximize utilization of the downstream capacity of existing stormwater conveyance systems in addition as the approach does not require calibration to specific local conditions and only relies on real time storage level information it is applicable to a wide range of catchments and will not be impacted by land use and climate change
