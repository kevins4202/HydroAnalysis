4695,modeling contaminant transport in fractured rock matrix systems often approximates the effect of the parabolic flow field in the fractures i e poiseuille flow on transport by adding a dispersion term to the uniform flow field in this study an analytical solution is derived to model contaminant transport in a parallel plate fractured rock matrix that explicitly simulates poiseuille flow in the fractures eliminating the need for the dispersion approximation in addition to simulating poiseuille flow in the fracture the contaminant transport model developed here includes 1 two dimensional contaminant diffusion in the fractures and matrix 2 first order decay in the aqueous phase and 3 rate limited sorption onto matrix solids it should be noted however that this model much like the commonly employed taylor dispersion approximation neglects macro dispersion thereby limiting the model s applicability to systems having wide fracture apertures with extremely high flow velocities p e 104 model equations are analytically solved in the laplace domain and numerically inverted in addition analytical expressions for the zeroth first and second spatial moments of the concentration profiles along the fractures are derived for both the new poiseuille flow model as well as a model that approximates the effect of poiseuille flow on transport by using a dispersion term the first and second moment expressions are used to quantify how well the dispersion term approximates the effect of poiseuille flow simulations confirm that the dispersion approximation will be adequate for natural fractures at long times however if a modeler is concerned with short time transport behavior or transport behavior in systems with relatively wide aperture fractures and high groundwater velocities where macro dispersion can be ignored such as may be found at engineered geothermal systems and carbon capture and storage sites there may be significant differences between model simulations that explicitly incorporate poiseuille flow and those that approximate poiseuille flow with a dispersion term the model presented here allows the modeler to analytically quantify these differences which depending on the modeling objective may cause the dispersion approximation to be inadequate simulations were also run to examine the effect of adsorption rate on remediation of fractured rock matrix systems it was shown that moderate adsorption rate constants could lead to very long remediation times if remediation success is quantified by achieving low concentrations within the fracture keywords analytical solution fate and transport parallel plate fracture rock matrix poiseuille flow taylor dispersion 1 introduction modeling fate and transport in fractured subsurface formations is of importance for investigating waste disposal contaminant remediation and long term environmental management of complex contaminated sites there has been considerable effort devoted to characterizing and quantifying contaminant fate and transport in fractured rock matrix systems berkowitz 2002 neretnieks 2017 li et al 2020 accidental release and waste disposal of hazardous chemicals have resulted in widespread subsurface contamination often at locations where the subsurface includes a fractured rock matrix which makes remediation and site management even more challenging the most concerning issues for environmental risk assessment and risk management at these complex contaminated sites are a accurately quantifying the mechanisms governing contaminant fate and transport along the preferential fracture flow paths and understanding the influence of retention in the rock matrix on this flow b characterizing how a contaminant transported from a source zone will distribute in the fractured rock matrix and c describing the influence of the immobilized contaminant in the rock matrix on the evolution of the contaminant source zone to reliably simulate the fate and transport of contaminants in such complex subsurface domains mathematical models that accurately incorporate the important governing processes are needed numerous models developed to simulate solute transport through a fractured rock matrix have been proposed e g berkowitz 2002 neretnieks 2017 li et al 2020 among the most common is the single fracture path model this model treats the fractured rock matrix as a dual domain medium consisting of fast flow zones the fractures and stagnant water zones the rock matrix contaminant mass is transferred between the two zones typical solutions to single fracture path models can be found in neretnieks 1980 grisak and pickens 1981 tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 barker 1982 chen 1986 maloszewski and zuber 1985 1990 roubinet et al 2012 and houseworth et al 2013 conventionally the water velocity in a fracture is assumed to be uniform across the flow channel while in the rock matrix the stagnant water acts to store contaminant the main processes affecting the movement of contaminants in such a system depicted in fig 1 a are advection and dispersion in the fractures sorption to the solid matrix diffusion through the immobile matrix water and in some cases first order biological or chemical decay while water flow in the single fracture path model is commonly assumed to be uniform more realistically the flow field is parabolic with maximum velocity at the center of the fracture and zero velocity at the fracture wall due to the no slip condition see fig 1b this parabolic flow field is referred to as poiseuille flow clark 2009 to capture the contaminant spreading that results from poiseuille flow in the fracture a dispersion term so called taylor dispersion taylor 1953 is introduced in the single fracture path uniform flow model this dispersion term attempts to approximate the spreading observed in the field by introducing an effective dispersion parameter the value of the dispersion parameter d f that simulates contaminant spreading at long times due to poiseuille flow has been calculated as fischer et al 1979 detwiler et al 2000 wang et al 2012 liu et al 2018 d f d m 2 d v a 2 105 d m where d m is the molecular diffusion coefficient v a is the average velocity in the fracture and d is the half aperture width of the fracture note that this approximation of the dispersion parameter df neglects macro dispersion or geometrical dispersion which is caused by velocity variations due to variations in the fracture aperture dimension roux et al 1998 detwiler et al 2000 boschan et al 2008 detwiler et al 2000 demonstrate that taylor dispersion dominates and macro dispersion may be neglected for values of the peclet number pe 2 v a d d m greater than about 104 in this paper we propose to couple poiseuille flow in the fractures with diffusion in the rock matrix explicitly modeling the poiseuille flow through the fracture eliminates the need to approximate spreading behavior using an artificial dispersion term approximation while there has been extensive modeling of fractured rock matrix systems e g berkowitz 2002 zhu et al 2016 neretnieks 2017 zhou et al 2017 zhu and zhan 2018 chen and zhan 2018 zhou and zhan 2018 li et al 2020 a thorough review of the literature found only a single reference where poiseuille flow was coupled with matrix diffusion bloechle 2001 this model however is only applicable at late times and neglects the potential for contaminant degradation which may have important impacts on contaminant fate and transport bloechle 2001 uses an asymptotic spectral comparison method ascm to derive the approximate long time solution to the model equations bloechle 2001 also derives the time dependent behavior of the zeroth and first moments of the concentration distribution by contrast this study derives an exact analytical solution in the laplace domain to the model governing equations for poiseuille flow in the fracture and diffusion in the rock matrix the model equations also include terms describing first order degradation in the aqueous phase and rate limited sorption to matrix solids the solution to the model equations in the laplace domain is then numerically inverted to compute the contaminant concentration as a function of time analytical solutions to the spatial moments of the simulated concentration distributions along the fracture are also derived the solutions presented here are applicable at all times they can be used to more accurately and efficiently model contaminant fate and transport through fractured rock matrix system that can be approximated as parallel plates which will allow for the rapid evaluation of model parameters and their influence on contaminant fate and transport this model can also be used to assess the error introduced by approximating spreading due to poiseuille flow with a taylor dispersion term as the taylor dispersion approximation is often employed out of mathematical convenience and has yet to be thoroughly evaluated to determine under what conditions the approximation may not apply it is also important to note that both the parallel plate poiseuille model developed here and the parallel plate taylor dispersion approximation commonly employed in the literature neglect macro dispersion which is an important process to incorporate when modeling fracture systems with p e less than 104 detwiler et al 2000 finally the analytical model presented here may be used to verify numerical modeling results 2 model description a conceptual model of the fractured rock matrix is depicted in fig 1b the fractured rock matrix is composed of identical slabs of rock matrix separated by equally spaced planar fractures this is commonly referred to as the single path fracture model solving this problem requires the following assumptions a water flow in the fractures is accurately described by poiseuille s law with a parabolic velocity distribution in the y direction b contaminant transport in the fracture is governed by advection in the x direction and molecular diffusion in the x and y directions c water in the rock matrix is immobile with contaminant transport governed by diffusion in the x and y directions d mass transfer occurs at the interface between fractures and the rock matrix e first order decay may occur in the aqueous phase in both fracture and rock matrix zones f rate limited adsorption occurs in the rock matrix zone g the model depicted in fig 1b provides useful insights into contaminant transport in a rock fracture matrix system such as is depicted in fig 1a h the two dimensional representation of the rock fracture matrix x y is an accurate representation of behavior likely to occur in three dimensions therefore macro dispersion due to velocity variations in the plane of the fracture detwiler et al 2000 is ignored assumption h is perhaps the least realistic of the assumptions as it requires either 1 a large value of pe that would only be seen in very wide fractures with extremely high flow velocities or 2 fracture widths that have very little variance while this limits the applicability of the model to simulate natural systems there are instances as will be subsequently discussed in section 6 where high pe flow in fractures occurs and consideration of poiseuille flow is necessary 3 governing equations two dimensional contaminant fate and transport in the fracture is governed by advection molecular diffusion and first order decay which can be described by 1 c t d m 2 c x 2 v y c x d m 2 c y 2 λ c where c is the contaminant concentration in the liquid phase v y is the velocity of fluid varying in the y direction within the fracture d m is the molecular diffusion coefficient λ is the first order degradation rate constant t is time x and y are spatial coordinates poiseuille flow is described by a parabolic velocity profile in a fracture according to clark 2009 2 v y 3 2 v a 1 y 2 d 2 where v a is the average velocity in the fracture and d is the half aperture of the fracture transport in the rock matrix is described by the two dimensional diffusion equation 3 θ c m t ρ b s m t d ex 2 c m x 2 d ey 2 c m y 2 θ λ m c

rock matrix ρ b is the bulk density of the rock matrix d ex and d ey are the effective diffusion coefficients in the x and y directions in the matrix respectively λ m is the first order degradation rate constant in the liquid phase in the matrix α is the non equilibrium adsorption rate constant and k d is the adsorption partitioning constant 3 1 initial conditions to solve the set of governing equations given in 1 to 4 an initial condition that defines the distribution of contaminant along the fracture and in the matrix must be established although a variety of initial conditions can be set the solution presented here assumed the following 5a c c i x t 0 x 0 y b 5b c m c mi x t 0 x b y b h 5c s m k d c mi x t 0 x b y b h where c i and c mi respectively are a function of x only which implies the fracture and matrix are initially contaminated at concentrations that are invariant in the y direction equation 5c indicates that the initial solid phase contaminant concentration in the matrix is in equilibrium with the dissolved phase matrix concentration 3 2 boundary conditions the boundary conditions used to solve equations 1 to 4 establish the concentration at the fracture walls and at the middle of the rock matrix as well as at the far extent of the fracture according to 6a c 0 x 0 y b t 0 6b c y 0 y 0 x t 0 6c c c m y d x t 0 6d d m c y d ey c m y y d x t 0 6e c m 0 x b y b h t 0 6f c m y 0 y d h x t 0 where h is the half thickness of the rock matrix boundary condition 6b indicates that no mass may pass through the center line of the fracture implying a symmetric concentration distribution about the fracture center line boundary conditions 6c and 6d indicate the continuity of concentration and mass flux at the surface of the fracture walls while 6f indicates no mass may pass through the center line of the matrix implying a symmetric concentration distribution in the matrix between adjacent fractures 4 model solutions 4 1 poiseuille flow case having defined the governing equations initial conditions and boundary conditions the solution of equations 1 3 and 4 can be developed using the laplace transform in t and fourier transform in x applying the

integrated according to 28 c x p 1 d 0 d c x y p d y evaluation of equation 28 is straightforward which gives a solution to the1 d transport problem in the fracture the distribution and breakthrough of this mean concentration characterizes the typical non fickian diffusion behavior that is observed due to the effects of poiseuille flow coupled with mass transfer to the rock matrix 4 3 taylor dispersion case conventionally taylor dispersion is implemented to approximate the effect of poiseuille flow in the fracture on contaminant transport coupled with a uniform velocity flow field in the x direction the taylor dispersion coefficient accounts for the long time impact on transport of the more realistic parabolic velocity flow field and molecular contaminant diffusion in the x and y directions the taylor model results in an equivalent governing equation for transport in the fracture 29 c t d f 2 c x 2 v a c x λ c 1 d j m where d f is the taylor dispersion coefficient represented as 30a d f d m 2 d v a 2 105 d m and j m is the mass flux of contaminant on the fracture wall represented as 30b j m d ey c m y y d in the laplace and fourier domain 30b becomes 30c j m d ey c m y y d using equation 13 we have 30d j m ξ p d ey γ m c ξ p 1 e d ey g c mi tanh γ m h sequentially equation 29 subject to initial condition 5a and boundary condition 6a can be solved to obtain a solution in

taylor model approximation impacts concentration versus time and concentration versus space simulations 4 4 mass transfer and mass storage in the rock matrix the solutions derived above can also be used to quantify the mass flux through the interface between the fracture and rock matrix this mass flux is modeled according to 33 f mas d ey c m y x y d t in the laplace and fourier domains 33 has the form 34 f mas d ey c m y x y d t applying equation 13 and substituting equation 16 equation 34 can be re written 35 f mas ξ d p d m β m c ξ d p 1 e d ey g c mi since the fourier transform of the mean concentration is represented as 36 c ξ p c x p e ξ x d x the zero order moment i e setting ξ 0 gives the total mass stored in the fracture at time t 37 m tot c 0 p d therefore it is relatively straightforward to compute the total mass stored in the rock matrix as 38 m tot m m ini m tot where m ini is the total mass initially stored in the system 5 evaluation of model solutions model solutions are evaluated using the baseline parameter values listed in table 1 two initial concentration distributions are proposed a constant slug and a dirac pulse 5 1 solution verification for an initial constant concentration slug distribution a constant concentration slug is assumed to reside in a finite region 39 c i x c 0 h x x a h x x b where c 0 is a constant h x is the heaviside step function x a and x b are spatial locations that bound the concentration distribution x a x b in the fourier domain 39 becomes 40 c i ξ c 0 e i x a ξ e i x b ξ i ξ though the analytical solutions are somewhat complex the numerical evaluation is readily implementable the laplace domain solutions given in eqs 27 and 28 are numerically inverted using the inversion method presented by de hoog et al 1982 as implemented in matlab by hollenbeck 1998 the solution includes a special function i e the confluent hypergeometric function which is calculated using algorithm 707 a fortran subroutine collected from acm nardin et al 1992 the solution also includes calculus associated with the confluent hypergeometric function for which some extensive numerical evaluations are needed for confirming the correctness of the analytical solution which relies on numerical laplace inversion and evaluations of various functions an alternative algorithm is used to compare with the analytical solution the algorithm designed as a semi numerical method numerically solves the intermediate equation 10 subject to the boundary conditions 6b and 15 using a finite difference method the analytical and semi numerical solutions are compared in fig 2 a and 2b where the concentration breakthroughs at three observation locations and the concentration spatial profile along the fracture at three times are respectively depicted both the analytical and semi numerical solutions are in excellent agreement giving confidence in the correctness of the analytical solution note that in fig 2 as well as in subsequent figures the value of the concentration simulated by the poiseuille flow model at a given value of x is the mean of the concentrations in the fracture transverse to the flow direction since concentration varies within the fracture at position x as a function of y fig 2 also shows the expected contaminant transport behavior in a fractured rock matrix a sharp breakthrough as the front makes its way through the fracture followed by long tailing as contaminant sequestered in the matrix slowly diffuses back into the fracture 5 2 sensitivity to fracture aperture and matrix thickness in fig 3 the concentration breakthrough curves at three observation locations are depicted for three fracture aperture half widths d simulations are run for both the poiseuille flow model and the model that uses taylor dispersion to approximate the effect of poiseuille flow on transport it may be seen that the use of the taylor dispersion approximation introduces very little error and the approximation improves at greater times the figure shows that when the fracture aperture is relatively large e g d 10 0 mm breakthrough arrives quickly and has a small tail indicating less mass contribution from the rock matrix while for smaller fracture aperture widths breakthrough is slowed spreading is enhanced and tailing is more significant this is a consequence of the rock matrix exerting a more significant influence on transport resulting in more retardation spreading and enhanced tailing rock matrix half thickness h is another parameter that is expected to influence transport as it controls the buffer capacity i e storage of the system the concentration breakthroughs at three locations are depicted in fig 4 for three rock matrix half thickness values breakthrough simulations shown in fig 4 are for both the poiseuille flow model and the model that uses taylor dispersion to approximate the effect of poiseuille flow on transport again the use of the taylor dispersion approximation introduces very little error a narrow and high concentration peak corresponds to a smaller h while smoother concentration peaks with increasing retardation spreading and tailing occur for larger h which shows that as the influence of the rock matrix on transport increases retardation spreading and tailing increase 5 3 dirac pulse initial condition an instantaneous mass m 0 input into a fracture at x x 0 may be modeled using a dirac pulse function 47 c i x 1 2 d m 0 δ x x 0 where δ x is the dirac delta function in the fourier domain 48 c i ξ 1 2 d m 0 e i x 0 ξ fig 5 a depicts the concentration breakthrough at three locations and fig 5 b shows the concentration profile along the fracture at three times for an instantaneous input of m 0 75 g m which corresponds to an initial concentration c 0 of 5000 mg l in a fracture of width 2 d 15 10 3 m the characteristics of the contaminant breakthrough curve and the contaminant distribution in space are consistent with the expectation of an initial sharp breakthrough with tailing eventually becoming more symmetric over time 5 4 effect of different initial contamination scenarios fig 6 a and 6b show the breakthrough curves and concentration spatial profiles along the fracture respectively for three scenarios 1 an initially contaminated fracture and matrix 2 an initially contaminated fracture but clean matrix and 3 an initially contaminated matrix and clean fracture in the latter two scenarios it s important to note that boundary condition 6c is only applicable for t 0 as described in table 1 the initial contaminated zone exists between 10 x 10 x 10 is initially clean in fig 6a we see that the initial breakthrough for the initially contaminated matrix clean fracture scenario slightly lags the two breakthrough curves where the fracture is initially contaminated this is a consequence of the time it takes for the contamination in the matrix to diffuse into the fracture before being advected to the sampling locations we also see that as would be expected the breakthrough curves for the two scenarios that include initial contamination in the matrix have more significant tailing than the breakthrough curve where the matrix is initially uncontaminated though importantly all three breakthrough curves exhibit tailing due to diffusion into the matrix from the fracture with subsequent back diffusion we may notice that the areas under the three breakthrough curves i e the curves zeroth moments are different area under the breakthrough curve is proportional to mass of contaminant passing the sampling point and since each of the three scenarios has a different initial mass of contamination the areas and corresponding zeroth moments should be different fig 6b shows the concentration spatial profile in the fracture for each of the above three scenarios we see that after three days the front for the scenario where the matrix is initially contaminated but the fracture is clean lags the two fronts where the fracture is initially contaminated this observation is consistent with the rapid transport of contaminant within the fracture after 30 days the concentration profiles for the two scenarios that include contaminant in the matrix initially have more significant tailing than the uncontaminated matrix scenario this reflects the additional contamination in the system and the extended time for the contaminant to diffuse from the rock matrix though it is worth noting that the 30 day concentration peaks are all approximately the same and all three distributions exhibit significant tailing since even for the scenario where there was no initial contaminant in the matrix subsequent diffusion from the fracture into the matrix results in tailing to examine the effect of adsorption on remediation of an initially contaminated system another set of simulations was run using the scenario where contaminant is initially distributed in both the fracture and rock matrix fig 7 examines the impact of the non equilibrium adsorption rate constant α on the breakthrough fig 7a and concentration spatial profile fig 7b curves the figure shows that at large α 3 10 1 d 1 and small α 3 10 4 d 1 adsorption rates compared to the rates of the other transport processes like advection both the breakthrough curves and concentration spatial profiles are relatively symmetric while there is significant asymmetry and tailing at moderate α 3 10 2 d 1 adsorption rates this behavior is characteristic of scenarios that involve remediation of systems where adsorption to solids is rate limited goltz and oxley 1991 goltz and huang 2017 at very high adsorption rates adsorption approaches equilibrium where breakthrough and spatial profiles are symmetric and retarded at very low adsorption rates adsorption has minimal impact on transport so the simulations only reflect the effects of advection and dispersion thereby resulting in relatively symmetric breakthrough and spatial profiles it is only at moderate rates that is when the adsorption rate is comparable to the rates of the other transport processes like advection does one see the early breakthrough and tailing characteristic of transport when adsorption is rate limited this significantly impacts remediation as the time to achieve a specified concentration level of contaminant when adsorption rates are moderate may be orders of magnitude greater than when adsorption is either fast or slow goltz and oxley 1991 goltz and huang 2017 fig 7 also shows that the taylor dispersion approximation does a reasonable job of approximating poiseuille flow with only a slight over prediction of the peak concentrations given that non equilibrium i e rate limited sorption may occur in the rock matrix it s important to examine the impact on mass sequestered fig 8 depicts the mass sequestered in the fracture and rock matrix as a function of time for four different non equilibrium sorption rate constants α 0 0 0 0003 0 03 and 0 3 d 1 and two different initial conditions one where the initial mass is only in the fracture fig 8a and one where the initial mass is only in the matrix fig 8b when α 0 0 d 1 there is no mass sorbed to the rock matrix solids indicating that k d also is equal to 0 0 l kg degradation is assumed to be negligible λ 0 d 1 fig 8a and 8b exhibit the same behavior only in opposite directions with mass being transferred from the fracture to the rock matrix in fig 8a and mass being transferred from the rock matrix to the fracture in fig 8b the rate at which mass moves is a function of the adsorption rate constant α as the value of α increases from 0 0003 d 1 to 0 03 d 1 to 0 3 d 1 the time for the system to reach equilibrium decreases from approximately 104 d to 102 d to 10 d respectively since the rate of desorption of mass from the rock matrix solids increases as the value of α increases when α 0 0 d 1 as indicated by the solid lines in fig 8 equilibration is fast since there is no mass sorbed onto the rock matrix solids in this case the time to equilibration only depends on the rate at which mass is transferred in the liquid phase between the fracture and rock matrix i e diffusion into out of the rock matrix when the system achieves equilibrium at long times the figure shows that the ratio of mass stored in the rock matrix dissolved plus sorbed mass to the dissolved mass stored in the fracture is 49 massinrock massinfracture c m 2 h θ d x ρ b k d c m 2 h d x c 2 d d x h θ ρ b k d h d since at equilibrium c c m for the table 1 parameter values the ratio is 1 54 when α 0 0 d 1 which also means k d 0 0 l kg the ratio is 0 53 of course since there s no degradation the total mass in the system remains constant throughout time the plots also show an interesting characteristic of the mass vs time profile which is evident when the adsorption rate constant is very low see the dashed lines for the α 0 0003 d 1 scenario after an initial period of about 2 days when mass is transferred relatively rapidly due to the concentration gradient in the liquid phase between the rock matrix and the fracture mass transfer remains extremely slow so that it is only after 104 days that equilibrium is ultimately achieved this slow rate of mass transfer is due to the very slow rate of desorption from the rock matrix solids taking account of the log scale on the x axis we see that the rate of mass transfer between the fracture and rock matrix is relatively constant over time on the order of several grams per thousand days this mass behavior corresponds to the long but unseen tail for the α 0 0003 d 1 simulated breakthrough curve shown in fig 7a where undetectably low concentrations of contaminant leach out from the rock matrix to the fracture over decades fig 9 a and b show similar mass transfer behavior however because there is degradation contaminant mass ultimately goes to zero in both the rock matrix and fracture note that the time to achieve zero mass approximately 105 d is the same regardless of the value of the adsorption rate constant the time is a function of the value of the degradation rate constant λ 6 analysis of the adequacy of the taylor dispersion approximation although the taylor dispersion approximation was shown to give relatively accurate predictions in some scenarios depicted in section 4 the model developed here can be used to examine those conditions under which the taylor dispersion scenario is no longer accurate to perform this evaluation we derive analytical solutions for the zeroth first and second spatial moments of the poiseuille flow and taylor dispersion models see appendices a and b the zeroth moment is a measure of the dissolved contaminant mass in the fracture at the sampling time the first moment quantifies the displacement of the dissolved contaminant mass peak along the fracture at a given sampling time and the second moment quantifies the spread of the dissolved contaminant mass around the peak in particular the difference between the two models simulations of the first and second moments may be used to quantify how well taylor dispersion approximates the effect of poiseuille flow on transport figs 10 and 11 plot the relative difference in the spatial first and second moments respectively simulated by each of the two models versus sampling time for various scenarios the plots were constructed using the specific parameter values in table 1 as a baseline however it is possible to make a number of generalizations based on the results first figs 10 and 11 show that in all cases at long times the taylor dispersion approximation model provides a reasonably accurate prediction of the poiseuille flow model it is only at relatively short times less than about a day that there is a significant difference between the modeled results relative differences in the first spatial moment are generally less than 10 relative differences in the second spatial moment however can be significant often as much as a factor of 1 to 1 5 more than the spreading predicted by the poiseuille flow model however even these differences decline with time to less than 20 percent within the first day from the figures we also see that relative differences between the model predictions at early times are a maximum when 1 the average velocity is high fig 11a 2 the fracture half aperture width is large fig 10b and 11b 3 the adsorption rate is fast fig 10c and the half thickness of the rock matrix is large fig 10d fig 11a demonstrates that as average velocity increases the difference between the second moment predictions of the two models increases this is expected as the second moment is indicative of spreading dispersion we see from the second term on the right hand side of equation 30a that the dispersion term used in the taylor approximation increases as the square of the average velocity fig 10b and 11b show the effect of the fracture half aperture width on the difference between the two models simulations as the fracture half aperture increases the difference between the two models increases this may be explained by the fact that for larger fracture apertures the velocity differences in poiseuille flow are more pronounced and the effects of diffusion within the fracture more significant thus the taylor approximation becomes less accurate as the fracture aperture increases fig 10c and 10d demonstrate the effect of the adsorption rate constant and the rock matrix half thickness on the difference between the two models simulations the effects are similar for both the adsorption rate constant and the rock matrix half thickness as the adsorption rate constant and the rock matrix half thickness increase more mass may be sequestered in the rock matrix thereby increasing the difference in the simulations of the two models comparing the y axes of figs 10 and 11 we also see that the taylor dispersion approximation has a much greater effect on the relative error of the second moment which is related to spreading rather than the first moment which is related to displacement hence interpreting figs 10 and 11 illustrates that for natural fractures which typically have aperture half widths less than 0 5 mm vandersteen et al 2003 brabazon et al 2019 and average velocities of less than 1 m d schäfer et al 2004 the taylor approximation is adequate however the figures also show that under certain conditions there are significant differences between simulations of the poiseuille flow model and a model that uses the taylor approximation as an example kittilä et al 2020 conducted a tracer experiment at an engineered geothermal systems egs site where hydraulic fracturing was used to improve injectivity fracture apertures on the order of 1 2 cm and flow velocities ranging from 10 to 220 m d were inferred from the tracer data such conditions correspond to peclet numbers as high as 4 104 where macro dispersion could be ignored and in this scenario depending on the modeling objective these fracture characteristics may require consideration of poiseuille flow as the taylor approximation may provide a poor prediction of contaminant transport thus while the results in figs 10 and 11 show that under natural conditions the taylor approximation adequately captures the important attributes of the poiseuille flow model there may be instances particularly when fractures are artificially induced and flow is imposed that the poiseuille flow model is required to meet modeling objectives in particular large aperture fractures with high flow velocities may be seen in conjunction with carbon capture and storage ccs and egs projects which are increasingly being implemented throughout the globe fractures associated with egs and ccs which can be on the order of millimeters may be the result of hydraulic fracturing that is undertaken to improve injectivity li 2016 ccs projects may also see fracture width growth from exposure to carbon dioxide acidified brine deng et al 2013 ellis et al 2011 7 conclusions single fracture path models are useful for hypothesis testing and evaluation of groundwater cleanup in rock aquifers the preceding analysis shows that in general and especially at long times the commonly used taylor dispersion will for most modeling needs adequately approximate the effect on transport of poiseuille flow in natural fractures however at short times the approximation may be inadequate especially for artificially induced fractures that have relatively large say 1 0 mm fracture aperture half widths and high groundwater velocities in those cases depending on the modeling objective it may be appropriate to incorporate poiseuille flow in the model this paper presents an approach that allows the modeler to analytically quantify for specified parameter values how large a difference there will be between simulations of a model that explicitly incorporates poiseuille flow and one that approximates poiseuille flow with taylor dispersion model simulations also showed that for fractured rock matrix systems that are characterized by moderate adsorption rate constants remediation times could be extremely long if remediation success is quantified by achieving low concentrations within

4695,modeling contaminant transport in fractured rock matrix systems often approximates the effect of the parabolic flow field in the fractures i e poiseuille flow on transport by adding a dispersion term to the uniform flow field in this study an analytical solution is derived to model contaminant transport in a parallel plate fractured rock matrix that explicitly simulates poiseuille flow in the fractures eliminating the need for the dispersion approximation in addition to simulating poiseuille flow in the fracture the contaminant transport model developed here includes 1 two dimensional contaminant diffusion in the fractures and matrix 2 first order decay in the aqueous phase and 3 rate limited sorption onto matrix solids it should be noted however that this model much like the commonly employed taylor dispersion approximation neglects macro dispersion thereby limiting the model s applicability to systems having wide fracture apertures with extremely high flow velocities p e 104 model equations are analytically solved in the laplace domain and numerically inverted in addition analytical expressions for the zeroth first and second spatial moments of the concentration profiles along the fractures are derived for both the new poiseuille flow model as well as a model that approximates the effect of poiseuille flow on transport by using a dispersion term the first and second moment expressions are used to quantify how well the dispersion term approximates the effect of poiseuille flow simulations confirm that the dispersion approximation will be adequate for natural fractures at long times however if a modeler is concerned with short time transport behavior or transport behavior in systems with relatively wide aperture fractures and high groundwater velocities where macro dispersion can be ignored such as may be found at engineered geothermal systems and carbon capture and storage sites there may be significant differences between model simulations that explicitly incorporate poiseuille flow and those that approximate poiseuille flow with a dispersion term the model presented here allows the modeler to analytically quantify these differences which depending on the modeling objective may cause the dispersion approximation to be inadequate simulations were also run to examine the effect of adsorption rate on remediation of fractured rock matrix systems it was shown that moderate adsorption rate constants could lead to very long remediation times if remediation success is quantified by achieving low concentrations within the fracture keywords analytical solution fate and transport parallel plate fracture rock matrix poiseuille flow taylor dispersion 1 introduction modeling fate and transport in fractured subsurface formations is of importance for investigating waste disposal contaminant remediation and long term environmental management of complex contaminated sites there has been considerable effort devoted to characterizing and quantifying contaminant fate and transport in fractured rock matrix systems berkowitz 2002 neretnieks 2017 li et al 2020 accidental release and waste disposal of hazardous chemicals have resulted in widespread subsurface contamination often at locations where the subsurface includes a fractured rock matrix which makes remediation and site management even more challenging the most concerning issues for environmental risk assessment and risk management at these complex contaminated sites are a accurately quantifying the mechanisms governing contaminant fate and transport along the preferential fracture flow paths and understanding the influence of retention in the rock matrix on this flow b characterizing how a contaminant transported from a source zone will distribute in the fractured rock matrix and c describing the influence of the immobilized contaminant in the rock matrix on the evolution of the contaminant source zone to reliably simulate the fate and transport of contaminants in such complex subsurface domains mathematical models that accurately incorporate the important governing processes are needed numerous models developed to simulate solute transport through a fractured rock matrix have been proposed e g berkowitz 2002 neretnieks 2017 li et al 2020 among the most common is the single fracture path model this model treats the fractured rock matrix as a dual domain medium consisting of fast flow zones the fractures and stagnant water zones the rock matrix contaminant mass is transferred between the two zones typical solutions to single fracture path models can be found in neretnieks 1980 grisak and pickens 1981 tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 barker 1982 chen 1986 maloszewski and zuber 1985 1990 roubinet et al 2012 and houseworth et al 2013 conventionally the water velocity in a fracture is assumed to be uniform across the flow channel while in the rock matrix the stagnant water acts to store contaminant the main processes affecting the movement of contaminants in such a system depicted in fig 1 a are advection and dispersion in the fractures sorption to the solid matrix diffusion through the immobile matrix water and in some cases first order biological or chemical decay while water flow in the single fracture path model is commonly assumed to be uniform more realistically the flow field is parabolic with maximum velocity at the center of the fracture and zero velocity at the fracture wall due to the no slip condition see fig 1b this parabolic flow field is referred to as poiseuille flow clark 2009 to capture the contaminant spreading that results from poiseuille flow in the fracture a dispersion term so called taylor dispersion taylor 1953 is introduced in the single fracture path uniform flow model this dispersion term attempts to approximate the spreading observed in the field by introducing an effective dispersion parameter the value of the dispersion parameter d f that simulates contaminant spreading at long times due to poiseuille flow has been calculated as fischer et al 1979 detwiler et al 2000 wang et al 2012 liu et al 2018 d f d m 2 d v a 2 105 d m where d m is the molecular diffusion coefficient v a is the average velocity in the fracture and d is the half aperture width of the fracture note that this approximation of the dispersion parameter df neglects macro dispersion or geometrical dispersion which is caused by velocity variations due to variations in the fracture aperture dimension roux et al 1998 detwiler et al 2000 boschan et al 2008 detwiler et al 2000 demonstrate that taylor dispersion dominates and macro dispersion may be neglected for values of the peclet number pe 2 v a d d m greater than about 104 in this paper we propose to couple poiseuille flow in the fractures with diffusion in the rock matrix explicitly modeling the poiseuille flow through the fracture eliminates the need to approximate spreading behavior using an artificial dispersion term approximation while there has been extensive modeling of fractured rock matrix systems e g berkowitz 2002 zhu et al 2016 neretnieks 2017 zhou et al 2017 zhu and zhan 2018 chen and zhan 2018 zhou and zhan 2018 li et al 2020 a thorough review of the literature found only a single reference where poiseuille flow was coupled with matrix diffusion bloechle 2001 this model however is only applicable at late times and neglects the potential for contaminant degradation which may have important impacts on contaminant fate and transport bloechle 2001 uses an asymptotic spectral comparison method ascm to derive the approximate long time solution to the model equations bloechle 2001 also derives the time dependent behavior of the zeroth and first moments of the concentration distribution by contrast this study derives an exact analytical solution in the laplace domain to the model governing equations for poiseuille flow in the fracture and diffusion in the rock matrix the model equations also include terms describing first order degradation in the aqueous phase and rate limited sorption to matrix solids the solution to the model equations in the laplace domain is then numerically inverted to compute the contaminant concentration as a function of time analytical solutions to the spatial moments of the simulated concentration distributions along the fracture are also derived the solutions presented here are applicable at all times they can be used to more accurately and efficiently model contaminant fate and transport through fractured rock matrix system that can be approximated as parallel plates which will allow for the rapid evaluation of model parameters and their influence on contaminant fate and transport this model can also be used to assess the error introduced by approximating spreading due to poiseuille flow with a taylor dispersion term as the taylor dispersion approximation is often employed out of mathematical convenience and has yet to be thoroughly evaluated to determine under what conditions the approximation may not apply it is also important to note that both the parallel plate poiseuille model developed here and the parallel plate taylor dispersion approximation commonly employed in the literature neglect macro dispersion which is an important process to incorporate when modeling fracture systems with p e less than 104 detwiler et al 2000 finally the analytical model presented here may be used to verify numerical modeling results 2 model description a conceptual model of the fractured rock matrix is depicted in fig 1b the fractured rock matrix is composed of identical slabs of rock matrix separated by equally spaced planar fractures this is commonly referred to as the single path fracture model solving this problem requires the following assumptions a water flow in the fractures is accurately described by poiseuille s law with a parabolic velocity distribution in the y direction b contaminant transport in the fracture is governed by advection in the x direction and molecular diffusion in the x and y directions c water in the rock matrix is immobile with contaminant transport governed by diffusion in the x and y directions d mass transfer occurs at the interface between fractures and the rock matrix e first order decay may occur in the aqueous phase in both fracture and rock matrix zones f rate limited adsorption occurs in the rock matrix zone g the model depicted in fig 1b provides useful insights into contaminant transport in a rock fracture matrix system such as is depicted in fig 1a h the two dimensional representation of the rock fracture matrix x y is an accurate representation of behavior likely to occur in three dimensions therefore macro dispersion due to velocity variations in the plane of the fracture detwiler et al 2000 is ignored assumption h is perhaps the least realistic of the assumptions as it requires either 1 a large value of pe that would only be seen in very wide fractures with extremely high flow velocities or 2 fracture widths that have very little variance while this limits the applicability of the model to simulate natural systems there are instances as will be subsequently discussed in section 6 where high pe flow in fractures occurs and consideration of poiseuille flow is necessary 3 governing equations two dimensional contaminant fate and transport in the fracture is governed by advection molecular diffusion and first order decay which can be described by 1 c t d m 2 c x 2 v y c x d m 2 c y 2 λ c where c is the contaminant concentration in the liquid phase v y is the velocity of fluid varying in the y direction within the fracture d m is the molecular diffusion coefficient λ is the first order degradation rate constant t is time x and y are spatial coordinates poiseuille flow is described by a parabolic velocity profile in a fracture according to clark 2009 2 v y 3 2 v a 1 y 2 d 2 where v a is the average velocity in the fracture and d is the half aperture of the fracture transport in the rock matrix is described by the two dimensional diffusion equation 3 θ c m t ρ b s m t d ex 2 c m x 2 d ey 2 c m y 2 θ λ m c

rock matrix ρ b is the bulk density of the rock matrix d ex and d ey are the effective diffusion coefficients in the x and y directions in the matrix respectively λ m is the first order degradation rate constant in the liquid phase in the matrix α is the non equilibrium adsorption rate constant and k d is the adsorption partitioning constant 3 1 initial conditions to solve the set of governing equations given in 1 to 4 an initial condition that defines the distribution of contaminant along the fracture and in the matrix must be established although a variety of initial conditions can be set the solution presented here assumed the following 5a c c i x t 0 x 0 y b 5b c m c mi x t 0 x b y b h 5c s m k d c mi x t 0 x b y b h where c i and c mi respectively are a function of x only which implies the fracture and matrix are initially contaminated at concentrations that are invariant in the y direction equation 5c indicates that the initial solid phase contaminant concentration in the matrix is in equilibrium with the dissolved phase matrix concentration 3 2 boundary conditions the boundary conditions used to solve equations 1 to 4 establish the concentration at the fracture walls and at the middle of the rock matrix as well as at the far extent of the fracture according to 6a c 0 x 0 y b t 0 6b c y 0 y 0 x t 0 6c c c m y d x t 0 6d d m c y d ey c m y y d x t 0 6e c m 0 x b y b h t 0 6f c m y 0 y d h x t 0 where h is the half thickness of the rock matrix boundary condition 6b indicates that no mass may pass through the center line of the fracture implying a symmetric concentration distribution about the fracture center line boundary conditions 6c and 6d indicate the continuity of concentration and mass flux at the surface of the fracture walls while 6f indicates no mass may pass through the center line of the matrix implying a symmetric concentration distribution in the matrix between adjacent fractures 4 model solutions 4 1 poiseuille flow case having

of this mean concentration characterizes the typical non fickian diffusion behavior that is observed due to the effects of poiseuille flow coupled with mass transfer to the rock matrix 4 3 taylor dispersion case conventionally taylor dispersion is implemented to approximate the effect of poiseuille flow in the fracture on contaminant transport coupled with a uniform velocity flow field in the x direction the taylor dispersion coefficient accounts for the long time impact on transport of the more realistic parabolic velocity flow field and molecular contaminant diffusion in the x and y directions the taylor model results in an equivalent governing equation for transport in the fracture 29 c t d f 2 c x 2 v a c x λ c 1 d j m where d f is the taylor dispersion coefficient represented

used to quantify the mass flux through the interface between the fracture and rock matrix this mass flux is modeled according to 33 f mas d ey c m y x y d t in the laplace and fourier domains 33 has

algorithm designed as a semi numerical method numerically solves the intermediate equation 10 subject to the boundary conditions 6b and 15 using a finite difference method the analytical and semi numerical solutions are compared in fig 2 a and 2b where the concentration breakthroughs at three observation locations and the concentration spatial profile along the fracture at three times are respectively depicted both the analytical and semi numerical solutions are in excellent agreement giving confidence in the correctness of the analytical solution note that in fig 2 as well as in subsequent figures the value of the concentration simulated by the poiseuille flow model at a given value of x is the mean of the concentrations in the fracture transverse to the flow direction since concentration varies within the fracture at position x as a function of y fig 2 also shows the expected contaminant transport behavior in a fractured rock matrix a sharp breakthrough as the front makes its way through the fracture followed by long tailing as contaminant sequestered in the matrix slowly diffuses back into the fracture 5 2 sensitivity to fracture aperture and matrix thickness in fig 3 the concentration breakthrough curves at three observation locations are depicted for three fracture aperture half widths d simulations are run for both the poiseuille flow model and the model that uses taylor dispersion to approximate the effect of poiseuille flow on transport it may be seen that the use of the taylor dispersion approximation introduces very little error and the approximation improves at greater times the figure shows that when the fracture aperture is relatively large e g d 10 0 mm breakthrough arrives quickly and has a small tail indicating less mass contribution from the rock matrix while for smaller fracture aperture widths breakthrough is slowed spreading is enhanced and tailing is more significant this is a consequence of the rock matrix exerting a more significant influence on transport resulting in more retardation spreading and enhanced tailing rock matrix half thickness h is another parameter that is expected to influence transport as it controls the buffer capacity i e storage of the system the concentration breakthroughs at three locations are depicted in fig 4 for three rock matrix half thickness values breakthrough simulations shown in fig 4 are for both the poiseuille flow model and the model that uses taylor dispersion to approximate the effect of poiseuille flow on transport again the use of the taylor dispersion approximation introduces very little error a narrow and high concentration peak corresponds to a smaller h while smoother concentration peaks with increasing retardation spreading and tailing occur for larger h which shows that as the influence of the rock matrix on transport increases retardation spreading and tailing increase 5 3 dirac pulse initial condition an instantaneous mass m 0 input into a fracture at x x 0 may be modeled using a dirac pulse function 47 c i x 1 2 d m 0 δ x x 0 where δ x is the dirac delta function in the fourier domain 48 c i ξ 1 2 d m 0 e i x 0 ξ fig 5 a depicts the concentration breakthrough at three locations and fig 5 b shows the concentration profile along the fracture at three times for an instantaneous input of m 0 75 g m which corresponds to an initial concentration c 0 of 5000 mg l in a fracture of width 2 d 15 10 3 m the characteristics of the contaminant breakthrough curve and the contaminant distribution in space are consistent with the expectation of an initial sharp breakthrough with tailing eventually becoming more symmetric over time 5 4 effect of different initial contamination scenarios fig 6 a and 6b show the breakthrough curves and concentration spatial profiles along the fracture respectively for three scenarios 1 an initially contaminated fracture and matrix 2 an initially contaminated fracture but clean matrix and 3 an initially contaminated matrix and clean fracture in the latter two scenarios it s important to note that boundary condition 6c is only applicable for t 0 as described in table 1 the initial contaminated zone exists between 10 x 10 x 10 is initially clean in fig 6a we see that the initial breakthrough for the initially contaminated matrix clean fracture scenario slightly lags the two breakthrough curves where the fracture is initially contaminated this is a consequence of the time it takes for the contamination in the matrix to diffuse into the fracture before being advected to the sampling locations we also see that as would be expected the breakthrough curves for the two scenarios that include initial contamination in the matrix have more significant tailing than the breakthrough curve where the matrix is initially uncontaminated though importantly all three breakthrough curves exhibit tailing due to diffusion into the matrix from the fracture with subsequent back diffusion we may notice that the areas under the three breakthrough curves i e the curves zeroth moments are different area under the breakthrough curve is proportional to mass of contaminant passing the sampling point and since each of the three scenarios has a different initial mass of contamination the areas and corresponding zeroth moments should be different fig 6b shows the concentration spatial profile in the fracture for each of the above three scenarios we see that after three days the front for the scenario where the matrix is initially contaminated but the fracture is clean lags the two fronts where the fracture is initially contaminated this observation is consistent with the rapid transport of contaminant within the fracture after 30 days the concentration profiles for the two scenarios that include contaminant in the matrix initially have more significant tailing than the uncontaminated matrix scenario this reflects the additional contamination in the system and the extended time for the contaminant to diffuse from the rock matrix though it is worth noting that the 30 day concentration peaks are all approximately the same and all three distributions exhibit significant tailing since even for the scenario where there was no initial contaminant in the matrix subsequent diffusion from the fracture into the matrix results in tailing to examine the effect of adsorption on remediation of an initially contaminated system another set of simulations was run using the scenario where contaminant is initially distributed in both the fracture and rock matrix fig 7 examines the impact of the non equilibrium adsorption rate constant α on the breakthrough fig 7a and concentration spatial profile fig 7b curves the figure shows that at large α 3 10 1 d 1 and small α 3 10 4 d 1 adsorption rates compared to the rates of the other transport processes like advection both the breakthrough curves and concentration spatial profiles are relatively symmetric while there is significant asymmetry and tailing at moderate α 3 10 2 d 1 adsorption rates this behavior is characteristic of scenarios that involve remediation of systems where adsorption to solids is rate limited goltz and oxley 1991 goltz and huang 2017 at very high adsorption rates adsorption approaches equilibrium where breakthrough and spatial profiles are symmetric and retarded at very low adsorption rates adsorption has minimal impact on transport so the simulations only reflect the effects of advection and dispersion thereby resulting in relatively symmetric breakthrough and spatial profiles it is only at moderate rates that is when the adsorption rate is comparable to the rates of the other transport processes like advection does one see the early breakthrough and tailing characteristic of transport when adsorption is rate limited this significantly impacts remediation as the time to achieve a specified concentration level of contaminant when adsorption rates are moderate may be orders of magnitude greater than when adsorption is either fast or slow goltz and oxley 1991 goltz and huang 2017 fig 7 also shows that the taylor dispersion approximation does a reasonable job of approximating poiseuille flow with only a slight over prediction of the peak concentrations given that non equilibrium i e rate limited sorption may occur in the rock matrix it s important to examine the impact on mass sequestered fig 8 depicts the mass sequestered in the fracture and rock matrix as a function of time for four different non equilibrium sorption rate constants α 0 0 0 0003 0 03 and 0 3 d 1 and two different initial conditions one where the initial mass is only in the fracture fig 8a and one where the initial mass is only in the matrix fig 8b when α 0 0 d 1 there is no mass sorbed to the rock matrix solids indicating that k d also is equal to 0 0 l kg degradation is assumed to be negligible λ 0 d 1 fig 8a and 8b exhibit the same behavior only in opposite directions with mass being transferred from the fracture to the rock matrix in fig 8a and mass being transferred from the rock matrix to the fracture in fig 8b the rate at which mass moves is a function of the adsorption rate constant α as the value of α increases from 0 0003 d 1 to 0 03 d 1 to 0 3 d 1 the time for the system to reach equilibrium decreases from approximately 104 d to 102 d to 10 d respectively since the rate of desorption of mass from the rock matrix solids increases as the value of α increases when α 0 0 d 1 as indicated by the solid lines in fig 8 equilibration is fast since there is no mass sorbed onto the rock matrix solids in this case the time to equilibration only depends on the rate at which mass is transferred in the liquid phase between the fracture and rock matrix i e diffusion into out of the rock matrix when the system achieves equilibrium at long times the figure shows that the ratio of mass stored in the rock matrix dissolved plus sorbed mass to the dissolved mass stored in the fracture is 49 massinrock massinfracture c m 2 h θ d x ρ b k d c m 2 h d x c 2 d d x h θ ρ b k d h d since at equilibrium c c m for the table 1 parameter values the ratio is 1 54 when α 0 0 d 1 which also means k d 0 0 l kg the ratio is 0 53 of course since there s no degradation the total mass in the system remains constant throughout time the plots also show an interesting characteristic of the mass vs time profile which is evident when the adsorption rate constant is very low see the dashed lines for the α 0 0003 d 1 scenario after an initial period of about 2 days when mass is transferred relatively rapidly due to the concentration gradient in the liquid phase between the rock matrix and the fracture mass transfer remains extremely slow so that it is only after 104 days that equilibrium is ultimately achieved this slow rate of mass transfer is due to the very slow rate of desorption from the rock matrix solids taking account of the log scale on the x axis we see that the rate of mass transfer between the fracture and rock matrix is relatively constant over time on the order of several grams per thousand days this mass behavior corresponds to the long but unseen tail for the α 0 0003 d 1 simulated breakthrough curve shown in fig 7a where undetectably low concentrations of contaminant leach out from the rock matrix to the fracture over decades fig 9 a and b show similar mass transfer behavior however because there is degradation contaminant mass ultimately goes to zero in both the rock matrix and fracture note that the time to achieve zero mass approximately 105 d is the same regardless of the value of the adsorption rate constant the time is a function of the value of the degradation rate constant λ 6 analysis of the adequacy of the taylor dispersion approximation although the taylor dispersion approximation was shown to give relatively accurate predictions in some scenarios depicted in section 4 the model developed here can be used to examine those conditions under which the taylor dispersion scenario is no longer accurate to perform this evaluation we derive analytical solutions for the zeroth first and second spatial moments of the poiseuille flow and taylor dispersion models see appendices a and b the zeroth moment is a measure of the dissolved contaminant mass in the fracture at the sampling time the first moment quantifies the displacement of the dissolved contaminant mass peak along the fracture at a given sampling time and the second moment quantifies the spread of the dissolved contaminant mass around the peak in particular the difference between the two models simulations of the first and second moments may be used to quantify how well taylor dispersion approximates the effect of poiseuille flow on transport figs 10 and 11 plot the relative difference in the spatial first and second moments respectively simulated by each of the two models versus sampling time for various scenarios the plots were constructed using the specific parameter values in table 1 as a baseline however it is possible to make a number of generalizations based on the results first figs 10 and 11 show that in all cases at long times the taylor dispersion approximation model provides a reasonably accurate prediction of the poiseuille flow model it is only at relatively short times less than about a day that there is a significant difference between the modeled results relative differences in the first spatial moment are generally less than 10 relative differences in the second spatial moment however can be significant often as much as a factor of 1 to 1 5 more than the spreading predicted by the poiseuille flow model however even these differences decline with time to less than 20 percent within the first day from the figures we also see that relative differences between the model predictions at early times are a maximum when 1 the average velocity is high fig 11a 2 the fracture half aperture width is large fig 10b and 11b 3 the adsorption rate is fast fig 10c and the half thickness of the rock matrix is large fig 10d fig 11a demonstrates that as average velocity increases the difference between the second moment predictions of the two models increases this is expected as the second moment is indicative of spreading dispersion we see from the second term on the right hand side of equation 30a that the dispersion term used in the taylor approximation increases as the square of the average velocity fig 10b and 11b show the effect of the fracture half aperture width on the difference between the two models simulations as the fracture half aperture increases the difference between the two models increases this may be explained by the fact that for larger fracture apertures the velocity differences in poiseuille flow are more pronounced and the effects of diffusion within the fracture more significant thus the taylor approximation becomes less accurate as the fracture aperture increases fig 10c and 10d demonstrate the effect of the adsorption rate constant and the rock matrix half thickness on the difference between the two models simulations the effects are similar for both the adsorption rate constant and the rock matrix half thickness as the adsorption rate constant and the rock matrix half thickness increase more mass may be sequestered in the rock matrix thereby increasing the difference in the simulations of the two models comparing the y axes of figs 10 and 11 we also see that the taylor dispersion approximation has a much greater effect on the relative error of the second moment which is related to spreading rather than the first moment which is related to displacement hence interpreting figs 10 and 11 illustrates that for natural fractures which typically have aperture half widths less than 0 5 mm vandersteen et al 2003 brabazon et al 2019 and average velocities of less than 1 m d schäfer et al 2004 the taylor approximation is adequate however the figures also show that under certain conditions there are significant differences between simulations of the poiseuille flow model and a model that uses the taylor approximation as an example kittilä et al 2020 conducted a tracer experiment at an engineered geothermal systems egs site where hydraulic fracturing was used to improve injectivity fracture apertures on the order of 1 2 cm and flow velocities ranging from 10 to 220 m d were inferred from the tracer data such conditions correspond to peclet numbers as high as 4 104 where macro dispersion could be ignored and in this scenario depending on the modeling objective these fracture characteristics may require consideration of poiseuille flow as the taylor approximation may provide a poor prediction of contaminant transport thus while the results in figs 10 and 11 show that under natural conditions the taylor approximation adequately captures the important attributes of the poiseuille flow model there may be instances particularly when fractures are artificially induced and flow is imposed that the poiseuille flow model is required to meet modeling objectives in particular large aperture fractures with high flow velocities may be seen in conjunction with carbon capture and storage ccs and egs projects which are increasingly being implemented throughout the globe fractures associated with egs and ccs which can be on the order of millimeters may be the result of hydraulic fracturing that is undertaken to improve injectivity li 2016 ccs projects may also see fracture width growth from exposure to carbon dioxide acidified brine deng et al 2013 ellis et al 2011 7 conclusions single fracture path models are useful for hypothesis testing and evaluation of groundwater cleanup in rock aquifers the preceding analysis shows that in general and especially at long times the commonly used taylor dispersion will for most modeling needs adequately approximate the effect on transport of poiseuille flow in natural fractures however at short times the approximation may be inadequate especially for artificially induced fractures that have relatively large say 1 0 mm fracture aperture half widths and high groundwater velocities in those cases depending on the modeling objective it may be appropriate to incorporate poiseuille flow in the model this paper presents an approach that allows the modeler to analytically quantify for specified parameter values how large a difference there will be between simulations of a model that explicitly incorporates poiseuille flow and one that approximates poiseuille flow with taylor dispersion model simulations also showed that for fractured rock matrix systems that are characterized by moderate adsorption rate constants remediation times could be extremely long if remediation success is quantified by achieving low concentrations within

4696,dual drainage systems in urban areas were historically designed and built to convey certain size storms on the assumption of stationarity however changes to rainfall due to climate change and increases in impervious cover due to land use change specifically redevelopment violate this assumption hydrologic models can be used to quantify impacts of climate and land use changes on stormwater runoff uncertain climate projections can complicate modeling efforts using predict then adapt strategies therefore this study used the opposite approach in a tipping point resilience assessment we determined the changes in rainfall from climate change and changes in land cover from redevelopment that pushed a dual drainage stormwater system to exceed regulatory flooding standards then adaptive measures bioretention cells were added to improve system resilience to handle wider changes in climate or land use we performed this assessment for a redeveloping urban neighborhood in denver colorado and tested regulatory flooding standards for both minor 5 yr and major 100 yr storm events at different levels of redevelopment we found that the pre redevelopment system exceeds acceptable minor event standards and floods streets i e reaches a tipping point at an increase in rainfall of 7 due to climate change it was also found that impervious areas can be increased by redevelopment up to 8 1 before exceeding minor storm event standards under current rainfall conditions suggesting similar stormwater quantity impacts from both climate and land use changes adding distributed bioretention units in redeveloped areas allows for up to an additional 12 5 and 8 5 absolute increase in rainfall before the stormwater system fails minor and major storm event standards respectively given the wide range of climate change estimates for future rainfall conditions redevelopment presents a unique opportunity for implementing green stormwater infrastructure and building system resilience keywords urban stormwater land use change climate change redevelopment infill development resilience assessment 1 introduction climate change and land use change are both drivers of hydrologic disturbance in urban environments understanding the impacts of these drivers on stormwater runoff flooding potential and water quality is critical for the future of water resources it is predicted that climate change will impact hydrologic processes by affecting the frequency duration and intensity of extreme precipitation events and increasing hydrologic variability leading to flashier runoff events praskievicz and chang 2009 forsee and ahmad 2011 land use change in urban areas in the united states is recently manifesting as infill development or redevelopment where existing land uses with lower impervious areas are densified to land uses with increases in impervious areas thomas 2009 epa 2016a several computational modeling studies have investigated the impacts of climate change on urban hydrologic processes for example moore et al 2016 studied the vulnerability of stormwater drainage systems within the built environment to climate change uncertainty waters et al 2003 determined how increases in rainfall intensities impact hydrologic processes in an urban southern ontario catchment alamdari et al 2017 used an auto calibration tool to assess how climate change and associated changes in seasonal variability impacts water quality and quantity in an urban watershed zahmatkesh et al 2014 analyzed multiple scenarios of maximum mean and minimum changes in rainfall due to climate change and found increases in the frequency of extreme events and magnitude of peak flows other hydrologic modeling studies have investigated the impacts of land use change through redevelopment on stormwater redevelopment is estimated to comprise 21 of new home constructions in the 209 largest u s metropolitan areas and the demand for redevelopment is expected to be sustained particularly for the next 15 to 20 years epa 2014 panos et al 2018 found that changes to land use through redevelopment in a denver colorado neighborhood can result in increased runoff volumes of 1 27 per 1 increase in impervious area hekl and dymond 2016 found similar but slightly lower results of a 0 8 increase in runoff volume per 1 increase in impervious area for a watershed in virginia a study by pond and kacvinsky 2006 determined a 1 04 increase in peak flows per 1 increase in impervious area due to redevelopment studies regarding redevelopment land use change highlight the increases to both runoff volumes and peak flows and potential consequences for increased flooding as evidenced many studies have assessed climate change and land use change impacts on urban hydrology separately however fewer studies have modeled the effects of climate change alongside those of land use change especially in urban catchments li et al 2009 assessed the impacts of both climate variability and land use change on an agricultural catchment in china finding that climate influenced hydrologic response more strongly than land use change other studies that have examined both climate and land use suggest that land use change may have a larger impact on runoff and other hydrological and ecological processes than climate change for example sala et al 2000 ranked land use change as the largest driver of impacts to biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems by the year 2100 with climate change as the second largest driver liu et al 2016 determined that land use had a greater impact on runoff volumes and pollutant loads than climate in an indiana watershed praskievicz and chang 2009 conclude that different studies find either climate or land use change to be more significant based on many factors such as hydrologic modeling assumptions and basin characteristics but that both climate and land use changes will be important to future water resources management which includes the continued functionality of existing urban drainage networks many urban drainage networks in the u s were originally sized to convey design storms up to the 5 yr and 10 yr storm based on statistical analysis of historic extreme rainfall events waters et al 2003 mailhot and duchesne 2010 moore et al 2016 by contrast systems in europe are designed to prevent floods from return periods ranging from the 10 yr to 50 yr storm salvadore et al 2015 in general urban drainage design was built on the assumption of stationarity or the idea that the factors that influence urban drainage design are unchanging through time problems arise when non stationary factors such as changes to precipitation patterns from climate change or increasing impervious area due to redevelopment violate this assumption arisz and burrell 2006 milly et al 2008 increases in the runoff amounts generated by storms that drainage systems were historically designed to handle could mean a decrease in system functionality causing flooding and exceedance of regulatory standards hence there is a desire to build resilience or the capacity to absorb disturbances such as climate change and redevelopment and retain functionality walker et al 2004 within urban stormwater systems for stormwater systems to be resilient studies have focused on adaptability or adaptive capacity design through innovative practices and strategies to adjust system responses to external drivers folke et al 2010 ahern 2013 such as climate and land use changes gersonius et al 2012 moore et al 2016 in particular there has been growing interest in stormwater control measures scms or green stormwater infrastructure gsi as climate adaptation strategies semadeni davies 2012 mcphillips et al 2020 for example china has launched the sponge city policy initiative which focuses on sustainable urban stormwater management using tools such as scms jiang et al 2017 seven us cities that are a part of the urban resilience to extremes sustainability research network urex srn including atlanta ga phoenix az and portland or focus on gsi as a key component to their climate change adaptation strategies a recent study of these cities found that gsi used for climate adaptation focuses on both smaller more frequent rainfall events as well as larger events mcphillips et al 2020 it has been shown that scms may be an adaptation strategy capable of mitigating increases in stormwater runoff due to redevelopment when land use change is the only consideration panos et al 2020 however it is unknown how climate change will compound impacts of redevelopment on stormwater runoff and flooding climate adaptation approaches typically follow a predict then adapt method in which climate change scenarios are predicted such as increases in rainfall intensities then the system effectiveness is assessed under this new climate waters et al 2003 arisz and burrell 2006 semadeni davies et al 2008 for example waters et al 2003 modeled climate change as a 15 increase in design rainfall intensities and found an increase in runoff volume and peak discharge of 19 and 13 respectively issues with this top down approach are that it is causal based neglects location specific considerations and has heavy reliance on climate change estimates these problems are exacerbated in areas of particularly uncertain climate change estimates such as regions in the central u s like colorado where precipitation change estimates range as wide as a 20 5 decrease to a 65 6 increase mahoney et al 2013 to address these issues gersonius et al 2012 present a flipped approach called the mainstreaming method in which acceptable performance thresholds for a local system are identified first then tipping points are identified where thresholds are crossed as a result of climate change and adaptive measures e g scms are used to improve tipping points for example gersonius et al 2012 found that a minor major stormwater system in a neighborhood in the netherlands exceeds acceptable standards and floods properties i e reaches a tipping point at an increase in rainfall of 40 due to climate change however with adaptive measures such as stormwater disconnections and providing additional surface storage through public green spaces the tipping point is improved and the system can handle an additional 10 increase in rainfall before failing improving tipping points leads to improved resilience as the system can perform its intended function under a larger disturbance walker et al 2006 this method is effect based and follows a bottom up approach that considers local conditions and constraints which is critical in the context of redevelopment the current study uses this novel approach to assess the adaptive potential and resilience of different components of an existing stormwater system in a redeveloping neighborhood to climate change moving forward growing cities across the u s and the world will face changes to the urban hydrologic regime due both to land use change and climate change the goal of this work is to analyze several dynamic factors such as increases in impervious areas and changes in rainfall in tandem along with scm implementation to predict the adaptive capacity of stormwater management for redeveloping cities into the future 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area consists of the 419 ha berkeley neighborhood in northwest denver colorado 39 776110 105 039245 as investigated in panos et al 2018 and panos et al 2020 fig 1 in the u s denver is cited by the usepa thomas 2009 as a leader in promoting growth management through redevelopment alongside portland sacramento and atlanta between the years 2000 and 2012 the number of downtown denver households grew by 110 epa 2014 berkeley has experienced significant redevelopment particularly around the tennyson business corridor cherry et al 2019 in 2014 the impervious area of the neighborhood was 53 5 cherry 2016 estimated that 15 of neighborhood parcels in the study area will be redeveloped between 2014 and 2024 resulting in an increase in impervious area of 1 berkeley experiences a historical 458 mm annual mean rainfall the neighborhood uses a dual drainage stormwater network with a storm sewer as the minor system and street conveyance as the major system streets within the neighborhood are classified as local collector or arterial fig 1 based on function and number of lanes udfcd 2016 the berkeley catchment contains no rivers or streams but stormwater collected by the dual drainage network eventually discharges into clear creek and ultimately the south platte river the neighborhood includes two manmade lakes berkeley lake and rocky mountain lake fig 1 the lakes were not built for storage purposes as stormwater ponds but do offer a combined volume of over 1 6 million m3 2 2 model application the storm water management model swmm version 5 1 013 was used as a part of the pcswmm software chi water to model the berkeley neighborhood sewershed a dual drainage model was built from an existing pcswmm model used in previous studies panos et al 2018 2020 the model includes 170 subcatchments fig 1 that were delineated from street storm sewer inlets and manholes based on a 9 m resolution digital elevation model dem the dem included the burned stormwater network to account for flow paths not dictated by topography the model was calibrated and validated at a 5 minute time step to three locations of observed flow and water level data indicated by circles in fig 1 the 5 minute time step was selected to account for the short time of concentration of the urbanized watershed approximately two hours calibration and validation resulted in good to very good model performance on average as defined by moriasi et al 2007 with average nash sutcliffe efficiency mccuen et al 2006 values of 0 727 and 0 730 and low average percent bias values of 6 12 and 7 53 absolute bias at the 5 min time step for calibration and validation respectively full performance statistics for calibration and validation are provided in table s1 in the supporting information runoff in each subcatchment was initiated at the start of the rainfall event the subarea routing option in pcswmm was used to route runoff from directly connected impervious areas dcia and unconnected impervious areas uia to the subcatchment outlet and pervious areas respectively dcia and uia were calculated and defined as detailed in panos et al 2020 runoff from pervious areas was routed to the subcatchment outlet the subcatchment outlet was defined as the furthest downstream minor junction of each subcatchment all model simulations were run with dynamic wave routing horton infiltration five antecedent dry days and monthly evaporation estimates the dual drainage components include storm sewer pipes for the minor system and streets for the major system all minor system geospatial coordinates lengths diameters slopes and roughness values were imported from gis data provided by the city of denver street conduits were classified as either local collector or arterial based on gis data from the denver open data catalog denvergov org opendata pcswmm s dual drainage creator tool was used to generate street conduits parallel to all existing minor system conduits all other street conduits were manually added to the model street conduits were assigned a transect based on street classification and minor or major event standards as described further in section 2 5 full descriptions of all pcswmm components are presented in table 1 2 3 redevelopment land use change three scenarios of future redevelopment are utilized in this study as developed by panos et al 2018 based on parcel scale predictions of redevelopment land use change from cherry et al 2019 the catchment has a total of 4436 parcels with an average parcel size of 0 107 ha parcels classified as an existing residential land use single family multifamily low rise and multifamily mid rise or vacant were considered for redevelopment the redevelopment scenarios redeveloped 411 1658 and 3288 of the total parcels and have an associated 1 2 4 7 and 8 1 increase in impervious area above baseline conditions 53 5 impervious respectively representing low moderate and high cases of potential redevelopment the average size of redeveloped parcels is 0 053 ha indicating smaller parcels are predicted to redevelop these redevelopment predictions are based on linear and logistic regression analyses performed for the berkeley neighborhood study area using county assessor s office data cherry et al 2019 and are comparable to impervious area increases investigated in other redevelopment studies for example hekl and dymond 2016 assessed a 7 increase in impervious area in fairfax county virginia and pond and kacvinsky 2006 assessed a 6 7 increase in impervious area for a hypothetical suburban catchment for the current study baseline represents pre redevelopment watershed conditions in 2014 with an impervious area of 53 5 and no scm implementation except for a few existing bioretention cells that were built into the calibrated pcswmm model 2 4 climate change methods of modeling climate change scenarios for urban catchments include downscaling projections from global climate models gcms moore et al 2016 applying delta change factors forsee and ahmad 2011 zahmatkesh et al 2014 moore et al 2016 or changing regional intensity duration frequency idf curves guo 2006 mirhosseini et al 2013 colorado specific literature indicates little agreement between climate models on how precipitation will be impacted by climate change a colorado water conservation board report by lukas et al 2014 notes changes in precipitation in colorado from a 5 decrease to an 8 increase for two emissions scenarios global climate models show that the average annual precipitation for colorado may not significantly change in the future but the frequency of larger events is changing along with the seasonality of precipitation towards wetter winters lukas et al 2014 other colorado specific literature that uses high resolution downscaled simulations in an array of climate models have found an even wider spread of possible precipitation changes from a 20 5 decrease to a 65 6 increase mahoney et al 2013 given the high variability of climate projections for the colorado region we addressed the study objectives using a resilience assessment based on the mainstreaming method presented by gersonius et al 2012 2 5 resilience assessment a resilience assessment was performed for the study area which includes several steps from the previously developed mainstreaming method gersonius et al 2012 following the steps of the flowchart in fig 2 in step one we identified the climate change effect of interest to be changes in rainfall and the hydrologic function of interest to be flood volume for step two we determined flooding threshold values acceptable standard line x axis in fig 3 based on current standards for the city of denver for both minor and major events as discussed in sections 2 5 1 and 2 5 2 respectively in step three we assessed the tipping points at which baseline and redevelopment low moderate and high scenarios cross the acceptable standards in terms of a rainfall multiplier the rainfall multiplier indicates changes in rainfall increases or decreases in rainfall depth where a rainfall multiplier of 1 represents historic rainfall 1 2 is a 20 increase in rainfall 0 9 is a 10 decrease in rainfall etc changes to rainfall depth were modeled as climate models have not projected any clear trends for the frequency or intensity of the convective precipitation events characteristic to colorado alexander et al 2013 mahoney et al 2013 lukas et al 2014 for step four adaptation options were added to the redeveloped scenarios as distributed scms and new tipping points were calculated in step five adaptation options were compared to pre scm scenarios to determine impacts on system resilience for this study a system that reaches its tipping point crosses the acceptable standard threshold at a higher rainfall multiplier than other options is considered to be a more resilient system reaching the tipping point at a higher rainfall multiplier indicates that the system can meet the standard and retain its functionality under wider changes to rainfall which is desirable in a future of uncertain climate projections a conceptual diagram of expected model results is presented in fig 3 the x axis is the climate change effect of increased rainfall and the y axis is the hydrologic function of flood volume where the y axis crosses the x axis is the acceptable standard for flooding as defined in sections 2 5 1 and 2 5 2 exceeding the standard will cause either excess nuisance or possible property damage from the flooding the baseline condition simulation no redevelopment or climate change is expected to cross the acceptable standard and reach a tipping point at some rainfall increase then the flood volume is expected to increase as rainfall increases but it may or may not be linear fig 3 black line then it is expected redevelopment will decrease the resilience of the stormwater system and fail acceptable standards at an earlier tipping point i e it takes a smaller rainfall increase from climate change to fail the same flood standard fig 3 grey line next it is expected that adding scms to the redeveloped condition will increase resilience and increase the tipping point ideally to a point beyond even the baseline condition fig 3 green line in this way the stormwater system is able to provide more stable performance in the face of a larger disturbance from both redevelopment and climate change and is thus more resilient walker et al 2006 2 5 1 minor storm event standards the urban drainage and flood control district udfcd drainage criteria manual states specific objectives and standards for both the minor and major events in the study area udfcd 2016 the objective for the minor storm event 5 yr is to reduce water nuisance by containing stormwater to the streets and storm sewer with specific maximum encroachment and inundation standards for different street classifications table 2 for example the minor event may inundate local streets to the crown of the street and may inundate collector streets as long as one lane is left free for traffic the minor event was modeled as the 5 yr 6 hr rainfall event for the study area 31 2 mm total rainfall depth as generated using the colorado urban hydrograph procedure cuhp excel based model rainfall multipliers were applied uniformly across the hyetograph street conduit transects in pcswmm were built based on the following standards for all streets we assumed a 2 crown slope 0 457 m 1 5 ft curb width 3 048 m 10 ft lane width and symmetric street geometry street transects for each classification are shown in fig 4 because the street conduit transects were designed based on the minor event standards the system exceeds the minor event standards reaches a tipping point when any major system junction street node see table 1 floods this means that minor system junctions may flood into connected major system conduits i e the storm sewer may flood into streets up to minor storm encroachment and inundation standards flooding in this study is defined as a flood volume of 3 8 m3 1 000 gallons or larger 2 5 2 major storm event standards the objective for the major storm event 100 yr is to minimize property damage by containing stormwater to an acceptable level below residential dwellings and public buildings or below a certain water depth above the gutter flow line table 3 the major event was modeled as the 100 yr 6 hr rainfall event for the study area 66 1 mm total rainfall depth as generated by cuhp rainfall multipliers were applied uniformly across the hyetograph new street conduit transects in pcswmm were built based on these major event standards for the various street classifications fig 5 for local and collector streets it was assumed that the depth of water over the gutter flow line would not exceed 304 8 mm 12 in with a back slope of 2 as indicated in the drainage criteria manual udfcd 2016 similar to the minor event because the street conduit transects were designed based on the major event standards the system exceeds the major event standards reaches a tipping point when any major system junction floods 2 6 scm scenario scms were implemented in the model in the form of distributed bioretention units one bioretention unit was placed on each redeveloped parcel following the approach in panos et al 2020 the distributed bioretention units were placed on existing redeveloped pervious areas within the model and runoff from all redeveloped impervious areas was routed to the bioretention units to achieve that highest flood reduction benefits based on previous modeling of the berkeley neighborhood panos et al 2020 subcatchment impervious percentages were adjusted accordingly panos et al 2020 the distributed bioretention units were sized to 2 of the redeveloped parcel area it is common practice to size a bioretention unit as a percentage of the drainage area with percentages typically ranging from 3 to 10 although panos et al 2020 investigated bioretention sizing between 1 and 10 the 2 sizing was chosen for further investigation because it was found that these are the smallest size units that return flooding to baseline conditions for the 2 yr 5 yr and 10 yr storm events bioretention parameters including surface soil storage and underdrain parameters as informed by swmm manuals and bioretention modeling rossman 2015 rossman and huber 2016 gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 and other denver area studies fry and maxwell 2017 udfcd 2018 are included in the supporting information table s2 3 results 3 1 minor storm event tipping points 3 1 1 pre scms in the pre redevelopment scenario baseline the existing stormwater system exceeds the minor event standards at a rainfall multiplier of 1 07 fig 6 black solid line in other words at baseline land use conditions without scm implementation the system does not fail minor event standards until a 7 0 increase in rainfall occurs due to climate change with subsequent redevelopment and increases in impervious area the tipping points decrease to 1 066 1 046 and 1 0 or a 6 6 4 6 and 0 0 increase in rainfall for the low moderate and high redevelopment scenarios respectively fig 6 grey solid lines table 4 the pre scm relationship between the tipping point rainfall multipliers and absolute percent increases in impervious area from baseline is polynomial for the minor event with more drastic changes in the tipping point with increasing impervious area fig 7 blue solid line with black dotted trendline at an absolute percent impervious increase of 8 1 the system reaches the minor storm tipping point at a rainfall multiplier of 1 meaning that the system would exceed acceptable standards with no increase in rainfall this 8 1 increase in impervious area corresponds to the high redevelopment scenario in this study fig 7 triangle symbols 3 1 2 post scms with distributed bioretention implementation on all redeveloped parcels the minor event tipping points for the low moderate and high redevelopment scenarios improved to rainfall multipliers of 1 079 1 105 and 1 125 or a 7 9 10 5 and 12 5 increase in rainfall respectively fig 6 green dotted lines table 4 compared to the baseline condition tipping point of 1 07 the tipping points for all redevelopment scenarios with bioretention are above baseline indicating more resilience in the system in fact the tipping points increase with each subsequent redevelopment scenario which is the opposite trend of the pre scm analysis fig 7 green solid line with black dotted trendline 3 2 major storm event tipping points 3 2 1 pre scms the analysis of the major event resulted in tipping points below 1 for all scenarios meaning that there is not enough street storage to prevent flooding that exceeds major event standards at current rainfall conditions even for the baseline land use condition this result is consistent with observations of historic street flooding in the denver area even for a smaller 25 yr event c d bell senior engineering associate at city and county of denver personal communication march 6 2020 for the baseline scenario the existing stormwater system exceeds the major event standards at a rainfall multiplier of 0 725 fig 8 solid black line in other words at baseline land use conditions without scm implementation the system reaches the major event tipping point at a 27 5 decrease in rainfall with subsequent land use change due to redevelopment and increases in impervious area the tipping points decrease further to rainfall multipliers of 0 715 0 690 and 0 660 or a 28 5 31 0 and 34 0 decrease in rainfall for the low moderate and high redevelopment scenarios respectively fig 8 grey solid lines table 5 similar to the minor event the pre scm relationship between the tipping point rainfall multipliers and absolute percent increases in impervious area from baseline is polynomial for the major event fig 9 blue solid line with black dotted trendline there is a similar range of tipping points for both the minor and major events there is a range of 0 07 between the highest and lowest minor event tipping points and a range of 0 065 between the highest and lowest major event tipping points table 4 and table 5 3 2 2 post scms similar results were found for the bioretention implementation with the major event but with more distinct differences in flooding between scenarios at higher rainfall multipliers fig 9a green dotted lines with distributed bioretention implementation on all redeveloped parcels the major event tipping point rainfall multipliers increased to 0 730 0 740 and 0 745 or a 27 0 26 0 and 25 5 decrease in rainfall for the low moderate and high redevelopment scenarios respectively table 5 which are all improved over the baseline tipping point 0 725 indicating more resilience in the system fig 9 green solid line with black dotted trendline 4 discussion 4 1 minor and major event differences according to the resilience assessments performed in this study the berkeley neighborhood dual drainage system is more resilient to disturbances in rainfall and land use for the minor storm event than the major storm event we found that at baseline conditions pre redevelopment the system can handle a 7 increase in rainfall before exceeding acceptable standards for the minor event we also found that redevelopment can increase impervious areas up to 8 1 before exceeding minor event standards at current rainfall conditions these percentages suggest that the berkeley neighborhood is similarly impacted by both climate changes and land use changes with respect to minor event flooding standards by contrast the berkeley neighborhood drainage system is very susceptible to flooding and exceeding major storm event standards even at baseline conditions in fact major event standards are exceeded with a 27 5 decrease in rainfall at baseline representing a rainfall depth of 47 9 mm which is close to a current historical 25 yr storm for the area 48 4 mm rainfall depth the assumptions made in this modeling study were conservative it is likely that results for major event flooding for redeveloped scenarios could be worse than simulated in this work specifically one consequence of redevelopment is that redeveloped buildings often extend closer to the street than existing buildings and existing buildings are typically built at a higher grade than redeveloped buildings in the study area however these building changes were not included in the redevelopment scenarios of this modeling effort therefore it is possible that major event standards would be exceeded at lower rainfall multipliers for redeveloped conditions because the buildings are built at a lower grade than existing buildings 4 2 redevelopment as an opportunity for building resilience through scms and revised policy the main driver of growth in the studied watershed is redevelopment rather than new developments thus opportunities to improve resilience by implementing or updating stormwater infrastructure will likely come from redevelopment projects current denver stormwater criteria state that flood control detention practices such as scms including bioretention are exempt from redevelopments that occur on 0 2 ha 1 2 acre or less dpw 2013 these criteria were adopted in 2006 however the writers of the original criteria recognized the non stationary nature of the field of urban hydrology and acknowledge that these criteria will be revised and updated as necessary to reflect advances in the field of urban drainage engineering and water resources management dpw 2013 section 3 3 2 based on the results of this study revision of current stormwater management criteria is necessary to build system resilience in the face of both climate and land use changes results show that scm implementation with redevelopment can positively impact resilience assessment tipping points adding bioretention units to all redeveloped parcels increases the adaptive capacity of the system by increasing all tipping points above the baseline condition for both the minor and major storm events it is recommended that distributed scm options are implemented with redevelopment and that 100 of redeveloped impervious area runoff is routed to the scms this recommendation would include changing the current criteria threshold of 0 2 ha 1 2 acre to require stormwater detention for redevelopments of any size or at least those 0 05 ha 1 8 acre and larger note that 99 of redeveloped parcels modeled in this study are less than 0 2 ha and 38 are less than 0 05 ha on average implementing distributed scm adaptation options in redeveloping areas on only 0 36 of the total watershed surface area see supporting information table s3 can allow for an additional 8 5 and 12 5 absolute increase in rainfall from pre scm conditions for the high redevelopment scenario for the minor and major storm events respectively therefore large increases in tipping points can be achieved with small areas of scms which presents redevelopment as a unique opportunity for implementing stormwater management through practices such as scms to build system resilience this perspective agrees with gersonius et al 2012 that urban renewal cycles including regeneration and redevelopment should be used as a driver for adaptation implementing scms in tandem with redevelopment means scms can be incorporated in building and infrastructure design rather than added separately which can lead to potential cost reductions redevelopment offers an opportunity for scms to be installed at minimal cost as a no low regret strategy in which system resilience is greatly enhanced with little to moderate additional investment gersonius et al 2012 for seven case studies of redevelopment projects from cities around the u s the stormwater management component averaged only 2 7 of total project costs and were as low as 0 5 epa 2016b in addition scms implemented with redevelopment can help drive economic development epa 2016b for example a 15 5 million redevelopment project in normal illinois that incorporated stormwater management in the form of a stormwater park has produced 160 million in private business investment epa 2016b while there are many benefits to scm implementation for stormwater management redevelopment offers a unique context and opportunity for installing scms with minimal costs and maximum benefits 5 conclusions as urban populations grow and cities densify through redevelopment increases in impervious area are impacting stormwater runoff and flood volumes concurrently changes in rainfall patterns due to climate change are also influencing urban runoff a resilience assessment was performed to determine at what changes in rainfall tipping points the urban stormwater system of a redeveloping neighborhood will exceed regulatory standards for flooding for both a minor 5 yr and major 100 yr storm event we also investigated how stormwater control measure scm adaptive management can be used to improve these tipping points and add resilience to the system key conclusions and contributions from this research include when changes in precipitation due to climate change are uncertain a tipping point approach can effectively assess system resilience the existing stormwater system of the berkeley co neighborhood effectively meets flood protection requirements for minor storm event 5 yr standards but not for major storm event 100 yr standards existing stormwater systems in redeveloping neighborhoods such as berkeley co may be able to handle increases in runoff and flooding from redevelopment land use changes or climate changes alone but likely not both distributed scm implementation can improve the resilience of a redeveloping urban system facing climate change redevelopment presents a unique opportunity to install scms and increase the resilience of cities to changes in precipitation due to climate change credit authorship

4696,dual drainage systems in urban areas were historically designed and built to convey certain size storms on the assumption of stationarity however changes to rainfall due to climate change and increases in impervious cover due to land use change specifically redevelopment violate this assumption hydrologic models can be used to quantify impacts of climate and land use changes on stormwater runoff uncertain climate projections can complicate modeling efforts using predict then adapt strategies therefore this study used the opposite approach in a tipping point resilience assessment we determined the changes in rainfall from climate change and changes in land cover from redevelopment that pushed a dual drainage stormwater system to exceed regulatory flooding standards then adaptive measures bioretention cells were added to improve system resilience to handle wider changes in climate or land use we performed this assessment for a redeveloping urban neighborhood in denver colorado and tested regulatory flooding standards for both minor 5 yr and major 100 yr storm events at different levels of redevelopment we found that the pre redevelopment system exceeds acceptable minor event standards and floods streets i e reaches a tipping point at an increase in rainfall of 7 due to climate change it was also found that impervious areas can be increased by redevelopment up to 8 1 before exceeding minor storm event standards under current rainfall conditions suggesting similar stormwater quantity impacts from both climate and land use changes adding distributed bioretention units in redeveloped areas allows for up to an additional 12 5 and 8 5 absolute increase in rainfall before the stormwater system fails minor and major storm event standards respectively given the wide range of climate change estimates for future rainfall conditions redevelopment presents a unique opportunity for implementing green stormwater infrastructure and building system resilience keywords urban stormwater land use change climate change redevelopment infill development resilience assessment 1 introduction climate change and land use change are both drivers of hydrologic disturbance in urban environments understanding the impacts of these drivers on stormwater runoff flooding potential and water quality is critical for the future of water resources it is predicted that climate change will impact hydrologic processes by affecting the frequency duration and intensity of extreme precipitation events and increasing hydrologic variability leading to flashier runoff events praskievicz and chang 2009 forsee and ahmad 2011 land use change in urban areas in the united states is recently manifesting as infill development or redevelopment where existing land uses with lower impervious areas are densified to land uses with increases in impervious areas thomas 2009 epa 2016a several computational modeling studies have investigated the impacts of climate change on urban hydrologic processes for example moore et al 2016 studied the vulnerability of stormwater drainage systems within the built environment to climate change uncertainty waters et al 2003 determined how increases in rainfall intensities impact hydrologic processes in an urban southern ontario catchment alamdari et al 2017 used an auto calibration tool to assess how climate change and associated changes in seasonal variability impacts water quality and quantity in an urban watershed zahmatkesh et al 2014 analyzed multiple scenarios of maximum mean and minimum changes in rainfall due to climate change and found increases in the frequency of extreme events and magnitude of peak flows other hydrologic modeling studies have investigated the impacts of land use change through redevelopment on stormwater redevelopment is estimated to comprise 21 of new home constructions in the 209 largest u s metropolitan areas and the demand for redevelopment is expected to be sustained particularly for the next 15 to 20 years epa 2014 panos et al 2018 found that changes to land use through redevelopment in a denver colorado neighborhood can result in increased runoff volumes of 1 27 per 1 increase in impervious area hekl and dymond 2016 found similar but slightly lower results of a 0 8 increase in runoff volume per 1 increase in impervious area for a watershed in virginia a study by pond and kacvinsky 2006 determined a 1 04 increase in peak flows per 1 increase in impervious area due to redevelopment studies regarding redevelopment land use change highlight the increases to both runoff volumes and peak flows and potential consequences for increased flooding as evidenced many studies have assessed climate change and land use change impacts on urban hydrology separately however fewer studies have modeled the effects of climate change alongside those of land use change especially in urban catchments li et al 2009 assessed the impacts of both climate variability and land use change on an agricultural catchment in china finding that climate influenced hydrologic response more strongly than land use change other studies that have examined both climate and land use suggest that land use change may have a larger impact on runoff and other hydrological and ecological processes than climate change for example sala et al 2000 ranked land use change as the largest driver of impacts to biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems by the year 2100 with climate change as the second largest driver liu et al 2016 determined that land use had a greater impact on runoff volumes and pollutant loads than climate in an indiana watershed praskievicz and chang 2009 conclude that different studies find either climate or land use change to be more significant based on many factors such as hydrologic modeling assumptions and basin characteristics but that both climate and land use changes will be important to future water resources management which includes the continued functionality of existing urban drainage networks many urban drainage networks in the u s were originally sized to convey design storms up to the 5 yr and 10 yr storm based on statistical analysis of historic extreme rainfall events waters et al 2003 mailhot and duchesne 2010 moore et al 2016 by contrast systems in europe are designed to prevent floods from return periods ranging from the 10 yr to 50 yr storm salvadore et al 2015 in general urban drainage design was built on the assumption of stationarity or the idea that the factors that influence urban drainage design are unchanging through time problems arise when non stationary factors such as changes to precipitation patterns from climate change or increasing impervious area due to redevelopment violate this assumption arisz and burrell 2006 milly et al 2008 increases in the runoff amounts generated by storms that drainage systems were historically designed to handle could mean a decrease in system functionality causing flooding and exceedance of regulatory standards hence there is a desire to build resilience or the capacity to absorb disturbances such as climate change and redevelopment and retain functionality walker et al 2004 within urban stormwater systems for stormwater systems to be resilient studies have focused on adaptability or adaptive capacity design through innovative practices and strategies to adjust system responses to external drivers folke et al 2010 ahern 2013 such as climate and land use changes gersonius et al 2012 moore et al 2016 in particular there has been growing interest in stormwater control measures scms or green stormwater infrastructure gsi as climate adaptation strategies semadeni davies 2012 mcphillips et al 2020 for example china has launched the sponge city policy initiative which focuses on sustainable urban stormwater management using tools such as scms jiang et al 2017 seven us cities that are a part of the urban resilience to extremes sustainability research network urex srn including atlanta ga phoenix az and portland or focus on gsi as a key component to their climate change adaptation strategies a recent study of these cities found that gsi used for climate adaptation focuses on both smaller more frequent rainfall events as well as larger events mcphillips et al 2020 it has been shown that scms may be an adaptation strategy capable of mitigating increases in stormwater runoff due to redevelopment when land use change is the only consideration panos et al 2020 however it is unknown how climate change will compound impacts of redevelopment on stormwater runoff and flooding climate adaptation approaches typically follow a predict then adapt method in which climate change scenarios are predicted such as increases in rainfall intensities then the system effectiveness is assessed under this new climate waters et al 2003 arisz and burrell 2006 semadeni davies et al 2008 for example waters et al 2003 modeled climate change as a 15 increase in design rainfall intensities and found an increase in runoff volume and peak discharge of 19 and 13 respectively issues with this top down approach are that it is causal based neglects location specific considerations and has heavy reliance on climate change estimates these problems are exacerbated in areas of particularly uncertain climate change estimates such as regions in the central u s like colorado where precipitation change estimates range as wide as a 20 5 decrease to a 65 6 increase mahoney et al 2013 to address these issues gersonius et al 2012 present a flipped approach called the mainstreaming method in which acceptable performance thresholds for a local system are identified first then tipping points are identified where thresholds are crossed as a result of climate change and adaptive measures e g scms are used to improve tipping points for example gersonius et al 2012 found that a minor major stormwater system in a neighborhood in the netherlands exceeds acceptable standards and floods properties i e reaches a tipping point at an increase in rainfall of 40 due to climate change however with adaptive measures such as stormwater disconnections and providing additional surface storage through public green spaces the tipping point is improved and the system can handle an additional 10 increase in rainfall before failing improving tipping points leads to improved resilience as the system can perform its intended function under a larger disturbance walker et al 2006 this method is effect based and follows a bottom up approach that considers local conditions and constraints which is critical in the context of redevelopment the current study uses this novel approach to assess the adaptive potential and resilience of different components of an existing stormwater system in a redeveloping neighborhood to climate change moving forward growing cities across the u s and the world will face changes to the urban hydrologic regime due both to land use change and climate change the goal of this work is to analyze several dynamic factors such as increases in impervious areas and changes in rainfall in tandem along with scm implementation to predict the adaptive capacity of stormwater management for redeveloping cities into the future 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area consists of the 419 ha berkeley neighborhood in

management through redevelopment alongside portland sacramento and atlanta between the years 2000 and 2012 the number of downtown denver households grew by 110 epa 2014 berkeley has experienced significant redevelopment particularly around the tennyson business corridor cherry et al 2019 in 2014 the impervious area of the neighborhood was 53 5 cherry 2016 estimated that 15 of neighborhood parcels in the study area will be redeveloped between 2014 and 2024 resulting in an increase in impervious area of 1 berkeley experiences a historical 458 mm annual mean rainfall the neighborhood uses a dual drainage stormwater network with a storm sewer as the minor system and street conveyance as the major system streets within the neighborhood are classified as local collector or arterial fig 1 based on function and number of lanes udfcd 2016 the berkeley catchment contains no rivers or streams but stormwater collected by the dual drainage network eventually discharges into clear creek and ultimately the south platte river the neighborhood includes two manmade lakes berkeley lake and rocky mountain lake fig 1 the lakes were not built for storage purposes as stormwater ponds but do offer a combined volume of over 1 6 million m3 2 2 model application the storm water management model swmm version 5 1 013 was used as a part of the pcswmm software chi water to model the berkeley neighborhood sewershed a dual drainage model was built from an existing pcswmm model used in previous studies panos et al 2018 2020 the model includes 170 subcatchments fig 1 that were delineated from street storm sewer inlets and manholes based on a 9 m resolution digital elevation model dem the dem included the burned stormwater network to account for flow paths not dictated by topography the model was calibrated and validated at a 5 minute time step to three locations of observed flow and water level data indicated by circles in fig 1 the 5 minute time step was selected to account for the short time of concentration of the urbanized watershed approximately two hours calibration and validation resulted in good to very good model performance on average as defined by moriasi et al 2007 with average nash sutcliffe efficiency mccuen et al 2006 values of 0 727 and 0 730 and low average percent bias values of 6 12 and 7 53 absolute bias at the 5 min time step for calibration and validation respectively full performance statistics for calibration and validation are provided in table s1 in the supporting information runoff in each subcatchment was initiated at the start of the rainfall event the subarea routing option in pcswmm was used to route runoff from directly connected impervious areas dcia and unconnected impervious areas uia to the subcatchment outlet and pervious areas respectively dcia and uia were calculated and defined as detailed in panos et al 2020 runoff from pervious areas was routed to the subcatchment outlet the subcatchment outlet was defined as the furthest downstream minor junction of each subcatchment all model simulations were run with dynamic wave routing horton infiltration five antecedent dry days and monthly evaporation estimates the dual drainage components include storm sewer pipes for the minor system and streets for the major system all minor system geospatial coordinates lengths diameters slopes and roughness values were imported from gis data provided by the city of denver street conduits were classified as either local collector or arterial based on gis data from the denver open data catalog denvergov org opendata pcswmm s dual drainage creator tool was used to generate street conduits parallel to all existing minor system conduits all other street conduits were manually added to the model street conduits were assigned a transect based on street classification and minor or major event standards as described further in section 2 5 full descriptions of all pcswmm components are presented in table 1 2 3 redevelopment land use change three scenarios of future redevelopment are utilized in this study as developed by panos et al 2018 based on parcel scale predictions of redevelopment land use change from cherry et al 2019 the catchment has a total of 4436 parcels with an average parcel size of 0 107 ha parcels classified as an existing residential land use single family multifamily low rise and multifamily mid rise or vacant were considered for redevelopment the redevelopment scenarios redeveloped 411 1658 and 3288 of the total parcels and have an associated 1 2 4 7 and 8 1 increase in impervious area above baseline conditions 53 5 impervious respectively representing low moderate and high cases of potential redevelopment the average size of redeveloped parcels is 0 053 ha indicating smaller parcels are predicted to redevelop these redevelopment predictions are based on linear and logistic regression analyses performed for the berkeley neighborhood study area using county assessor s office data cherry et al 2019 and are comparable to impervious area increases investigated in other redevelopment studies for example hekl and dymond 2016 assessed a 7 increase in impervious area in fairfax county virginia and pond and kacvinsky 2006 assessed a 6 7 increase in impervious area for a hypothetical suburban catchment for the current study baseline represents pre redevelopment watershed conditions in 2014 with an impervious area of 53 5 and no scm implementation except for a few existing bioretention cells that were built into the calibrated pcswmm model 2 4 climate change methods of modeling climate change scenarios for urban catchments include downscaling projections from global climate models gcms moore et al 2016 applying delta change factors forsee and ahmad 2011 zahmatkesh et al 2014 moore et al 2016 or changing regional intensity duration frequency idf curves guo 2006 mirhosseini et al 2013 colorado specific literature indicates little agreement between climate models on how precipitation will be impacted by climate change a colorado water conservation board report by lukas et al 2014 notes changes in precipitation in colorado from a 5 decrease to an 8 increase for two emissions scenarios global climate models show that the average annual precipitation for colorado may not significantly change in the future but the frequency of larger events is changing along with the seasonality of precipitation towards wetter winters lukas et al 2014 other colorado specific literature that uses high resolution downscaled simulations in an array of climate models have found an even wider spread of possible precipitation changes from a 20 5 decrease to a 65 6 increase mahoney et al 2013 given the high variability of climate projections for the colorado region we addressed the study objectives using a resilience assessment based on the mainstreaming method presented by gersonius et al 2012 2 5 resilience assessment a resilience assessment was performed for the study area which includes several steps from the previously developed mainstreaming method gersonius et al 2012 following the steps of the flowchart in fig 2 in step one we identified the climate change effect of interest to be changes in rainfall and the hydrologic function of interest to be flood volume for step two we determined flooding threshold values acceptable standard line x axis in fig 3 based on current standards for the city of denver for both minor and major events as discussed in sections 2 5 1 and 2 5 2 respectively in step three we assessed the tipping points at which baseline and redevelopment low moderate and high scenarios cross the acceptable standards in terms of a rainfall multiplier the rainfall multiplier indicates changes in rainfall increases or decreases in rainfall depth where a rainfall multiplier of 1 represents historic rainfall 1 2 is a 20 increase in rainfall 0 9 is a 10 decrease in rainfall etc changes to rainfall depth were modeled as climate models have not projected any clear trends for the frequency or intensity of the convective precipitation events characteristic to colorado alexander et al 2013 mahoney et al 2013 lukas et al 2014 for step four adaptation options were added to the redeveloped scenarios as distributed scms and new tipping points were calculated in step five adaptation options were compared to pre scm scenarios to determine impacts on system resilience for this study a system that reaches its tipping point crosses the acceptable standard threshold at a higher rainfall multiplier than other options is considered to be a more resilient system reaching the tipping point at a higher rainfall multiplier indicates that the system can meet the standard and retain its functionality under wider changes to rainfall which is desirable in a future of uncertain climate projections a conceptual diagram of expected model results is presented in fig 3 the x axis is the climate change effect of increased rainfall and the y axis is the hydrologic function of flood volume where the y axis crosses the x axis is the acceptable standard for flooding as defined in sections 2 5 1 and 2 5 2 exceeding the standard will cause either excess nuisance or possible property damage from the flooding the baseline condition simulation no redevelopment or climate change is expected to cross the acceptable standard and reach a tipping point at some rainfall increase then the flood volume is expected to increase as rainfall increases but it may or may not be linear fig 3 black line then it is expected redevelopment will decrease the resilience of the stormwater system and fail acceptable standards at an earlier tipping point i e it takes a smaller rainfall increase from climate change to fail the same flood standard fig 3 grey line next it is expected that adding scms to the redeveloped condition will increase resilience and increase the tipping point ideally to a point beyond even the baseline condition fig 3 green line in this way the stormwater system is able to provide more stable performance in the face of a larger disturbance from both redevelopment and climate change and is thus more resilient walker et al 2006 2 5 1 minor storm event standards the urban drainage and flood control district udfcd drainage criteria manual states specific objectives and standards for both the minor and major events in the study area udfcd 2016 the objective for the minor storm event 5 yr is to reduce water nuisance by containing stormwater to the streets and storm sewer with specific maximum encroachment and inundation standards for different street classifications table 2 for example the minor event may inundate local streets to the crown of the street and may inundate collector streets as long as one lane is left free for traffic the minor event was modeled as the 5 yr 6 hr rainfall event for the study area 31 2 mm total rainfall depth as generated using the colorado urban hydrograph procedure cuhp excel based model rainfall multipliers were applied uniformly across the hyetograph street conduit transects in pcswmm were built based on the following standards for all streets we assumed a 2 crown slope 0 457 m 1 5 ft curb width 3 048 m 10 ft lane width and symmetric street geometry street transects for each classification are shown in fig 4 because the street conduit transects were designed based on the minor event standards the system exceeds the minor event standards reaches a tipping point when any major system junction street node see table 1 floods this means that minor system junctions may flood into connected major system conduits i e the storm sewer may flood into streets up to minor storm encroachment and inundation standards flooding in this study is defined as a flood volume of 3 8 m3 1 000 gallons or larger 2 5 2 major storm event standards the objective for the major storm event 100 yr is to minimize property damage by containing stormwater to an acceptable level below residential dwellings and public buildings or below a certain water depth above the gutter flow line table 3 the major event was modeled as the 100 yr 6 hr rainfall event for the study area 66 1 mm total rainfall depth as generated by cuhp rainfall multipliers were applied uniformly across the hyetograph new street conduit transects in pcswmm were built based on these major event standards for the various street classifications fig 5 for local and collector streets it was assumed that the depth of water over the gutter flow line would not exceed 304 8 mm 12 in with a back slope of 2 as indicated in the drainage criteria manual udfcd 2016 similar to the minor event because the street conduit transects were designed based on the major event standards the system exceeds the major event standards reaches a tipping point when any major system junction floods 2 6 scm scenario scms were implemented in the model in the form of distributed bioretention units one bioretention unit was placed on each redeveloped parcel following the approach in panos et al 2020 the distributed bioretention units were placed on existing redeveloped pervious areas within the model and runoff from all redeveloped impervious areas was routed to the bioretention units to achieve that highest flood reduction benefits based on previous modeling of the berkeley neighborhood panos et al 2020 subcatchment impervious percentages were adjusted accordingly panos et al 2020 the distributed bioretention units were sized to 2 of the redeveloped parcel area it is common practice to size a bioretention unit as a percentage of the drainage area with percentages typically ranging from 3 to 10 although panos et al 2020 investigated bioretention sizing between 1 and 10 the 2 sizing was chosen for further investigation because it was found that these are the smallest size units that return flooding to baseline conditions for the 2 yr 5 yr and 10 yr storm events bioretention parameters including surface soil storage and underdrain parameters as informed by swmm manuals and bioretention modeling rossman 2015 rossman and huber 2016 gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 and other denver area studies fry and maxwell 2017 udfcd 2018 are included in the supporting information table s2 3 results 3 1 minor storm event tipping points 3 1 1 pre scms in the pre redevelopment scenario baseline the existing stormwater system exceeds the minor event standards at a rainfall multiplier of 1 07 fig 6 black solid line in other words at baseline land use conditions without scm implementation the system does not fail minor event standards until a 7 0 increase in rainfall occurs due to climate change with subsequent redevelopment and increases in impervious area the tipping points decrease to 1 066 1 046 and 1 0 or a 6 6 4 6 and 0 0 increase in rainfall for the low moderate and high redevelopment scenarios respectively fig 6 grey solid lines table 4 the pre scm relationship between the tipping point rainfall multipliers and absolute percent increases in impervious area from baseline is polynomial for the minor event with more drastic changes in the tipping point with increasing impervious area fig 7 blue solid line with black dotted trendline at an absolute percent impervious increase of 8 1 the system reaches the minor storm tipping point at a rainfall multiplier of 1 meaning that the system would exceed acceptable standards with no increase in rainfall this 8 1 increase in impervious area corresponds to the high redevelopment scenario in this study fig 7 triangle symbols 3 1 2 post scms with distributed bioretention implementation on all redeveloped parcels the minor event tipping points for the low moderate and high redevelopment scenarios improved to rainfall multipliers of 1 079 1 105 and 1 125 or a 7 9 10 5 and 12 5 increase in rainfall respectively fig 6 green dotted lines table 4 compared to the baseline condition tipping point of 1 07 the tipping points for all redevelopment scenarios with bioretention are above baseline indicating more resilience in the system in fact the tipping points increase with each subsequent redevelopment scenario which is the opposite trend of the pre scm analysis fig 7 green solid line with black dotted trendline 3 2 major storm event tipping points 3 2 1 pre scms the analysis of the major event resulted in tipping points below 1 for all scenarios meaning that there is not enough street storage to prevent flooding that exceeds major event standards at current rainfall conditions even for the baseline land use condition this result is consistent with observations of historic street flooding in the denver area even for a smaller 25 yr event c d bell senior engineering associate at city and county of denver personal communication march 6 2020 for the baseline scenario the existing stormwater system exceeds the major event standards at a rainfall multiplier of 0 725 fig 8 solid black line in other words at baseline land use conditions without scm implementation the system reaches the major event tipping point at a 27 5 decrease in rainfall with subsequent land use change due to redevelopment and increases in impervious area the tipping points decrease further to rainfall multipliers of 0 715 0 690 and 0 660 or a 28 5 31 0 and 34 0 decrease in rainfall for the low moderate and high redevelopment scenarios respectively fig 8 grey solid lines table 5 similar to the minor event the pre scm relationship between the tipping point rainfall multipliers and absolute percent increases in impervious area from baseline is polynomial for the major event fig 9 blue solid line with black dotted trendline there is a similar range of tipping points for both the minor and major events there is a range of 0 07 between the highest and lowest minor event tipping points and a range of 0 065 between the highest and lowest major event tipping points table 4 and table 5 3 2 2 post scms similar results were found for the bioretention implementation with the major event but with more distinct differences in flooding between scenarios at higher rainfall multipliers fig 9a green dotted lines with distributed bioretention implementation on all redeveloped parcels the major event tipping point rainfall multipliers increased to 0 730 0 740 and 0 745 or a 27 0 26 0 and 25 5 decrease in rainfall for the low moderate and high redevelopment scenarios respectively table 5 which are all improved over the baseline tipping point 0 725 indicating more resilience in the system fig 9 green solid line with black dotted trendline 4 discussion 4 1 minor and major event differences according to the resilience assessments performed in this study the berkeley neighborhood dual drainage system is more resilient to disturbances in rainfall and land use for the minor storm event than the major storm event we found that at baseline conditions pre redevelopment the system can handle a 7 increase in rainfall before exceeding acceptable standards for the minor event we also found that redevelopment can increase impervious areas up to 8 1 before exceeding minor event standards at current rainfall conditions these percentages suggest that the berkeley neighborhood is similarly impacted by both climate changes and land use changes with respect to minor event flooding standards by contrast the berkeley neighborhood drainage system is very susceptible to flooding and exceeding major storm event standards even at baseline conditions in fact major event standards are exceeded with a 27 5 decrease in rainfall at baseline representing a rainfall depth of 47 9 mm which is close to a current historical 25 yr storm for the area 48 4 mm rainfall depth the assumptions made in this modeling study were conservative it is likely that results for major event flooding for redeveloped scenarios could be worse than simulated in this work specifically one consequence of redevelopment is that redeveloped buildings often extend closer to the street than existing buildings and existing buildings are typically built at a higher grade than redeveloped buildings in the study area however these building changes were not included in the redevelopment scenarios of this modeling effort therefore it is possible that major event standards would be exceeded at lower rainfall multipliers for redeveloped conditions because the buildings are built at a lower grade than existing buildings 4 2 redevelopment as an opportunity for building resilience through scms and revised policy the main driver of growth in the studied watershed is redevelopment rather than new developments thus opportunities to improve resilience by implementing or updating stormwater infrastructure will likely come from redevelopment projects current denver stormwater criteria state that flood control detention practices such as scms including bioretention are exempt from redevelopments that occur on 0 2 ha 1 2 acre or less dpw 2013 these criteria were adopted in 2006 however the writers of the original criteria recognized the non stationary nature of the field of urban hydrology and acknowledge that these criteria will be revised and updated as necessary to reflect advances in the field of urban drainage engineering and water resources management dpw 2013 section 3 3 2 based on the results of this study revision of current stormwater management criteria is necessary to build system resilience in the face of both climate and land use changes results show that scm implementation with redevelopment can positively impact resilience assessment tipping points adding bioretention units to all redeveloped parcels increases the adaptive capacity of the system by increasing all tipping points above the baseline condition for both the minor and major storm events it is recommended that distributed scm options are implemented with redevelopment and that 100 of redeveloped impervious area runoff is routed to the scms this recommendation would include changing the current criteria threshold of 0 2 ha 1 2 acre to require stormwater detention for redevelopments of any size or at least those 0 05 ha 1 8 acre and larger note that 99 of redeveloped parcels modeled in this study are less than 0 2 ha and 38 are less than 0 05 ha on average implementing distributed scm adaptation options in redeveloping areas on only 0 36 of the total watershed surface area see supporting information table s3 can allow for an additional 8 5 and 12 5 absolute increase in rainfall from pre scm conditions for the high redevelopment scenario for the minor and major storm events respectively therefore large increases in tipping points can be achieved with small areas of scms which presents redevelopment as a unique opportunity for implementing stormwater management through practices such as scms to build system resilience this perspective agrees with gersonius et al 2012 that urban renewal cycles including regeneration and redevelopment should be used as a driver for adaptation implementing scms in tandem with redevelopment means scms can be incorporated in building and infrastructure design rather than added separately which can lead to potential cost reductions redevelopment offers an opportunity for scms to be installed at minimal cost as a no low regret strategy in which system resilience is greatly enhanced with little to moderate additional investment gersonius et al 2012 for seven case studies of redevelopment projects from cities around the u s the stormwater management component averaged only 2 7 of total project costs and were as low as 0 5 epa 2016b in addition scms implemented with redevelopment can help drive economic development epa 2016b for example a 15 5 million redevelopment project in normal illinois that incorporated stormwater management in the form of a stormwater park has produced 160 million in private business investment epa 2016b while there are many benefits to scm implementation for stormwater management redevelopment offers a unique context and opportunity for installing scms with minimal costs and maximum benefits 5 conclusions as urban populations grow and cities densify through redevelopment increases in impervious area are impacting stormwater runoff and flood volumes concurrently changes in rainfall patterns due to climate change are also influencing urban runoff a resilience assessment was performed to determine at what changes in rainfall tipping points the urban stormwater system of a redeveloping neighborhood will exceed regulatory standards for flooding for both a minor 5 yr and major 100 yr storm event we also investigated how stormwater control measure scm adaptive management can be used to improve these tipping points and add resilience to the system key conclusions and contributions from this research include when changes in precipitation due to climate change are uncertain a tipping point approach can effectively assess system resilience the existing stormwater system of the berkeley co neighborhood effectively meets flood protection requirements for minor storm event 5 yr standards but not for major storm event 100 yr standards existing stormwater systems in redeveloping neighborhoods such as berkeley co may be able to handle increases in runoff and flooding from redevelopment land use changes or climate changes alone but likely not both distributed scm implementation can improve the resilience of a redeveloping urban system facing climate change redevelopment presents a unique opportunity to install scms and increase the resilience of cities to changes in precipitation due to climate change credit authorship

4697,accurate prediction of crop evapotranspiration etc can provide a scientific basis for improving water use efficiency rational allocation of water resources and sustainable management of ecosystems however conventional statistical methods have the limited application in some regions because of the complex relationships nonlinear linear exponential etc between etc and its each driving factor this paper illustrated the utility of the back propagation neural network bp model for etc prediction and compared the performance of this model with that of the multiple linear regression technique combined with the etc measured by eddy covariance and the meteorological data three layer bp models trained by the levenberg marquardt algorithm were developed with a 4 10 1 architecture corresponding to four ten and one nodes in the input hidden and output layers respectively the bp models were trained and validated in the matlab environment with three different combinations of maximum air temperature minimum air temperature sunshine hours crop coefficient kc and precipitation a high correlation was observed between the values measured by eddy covariance and those predicted by bp with a higher coefficient of determination 0 87 and accuracy 91 44 than that achieved by the multiple linear regression model 0 79 and 82 96 respectively furthermore the performance of the bp models could be improved substantially by including the dynamic change of kc and the effect of precipitation which suggested that these two factors were crucial variables in modeling etc by bp approaches in testing sets the bp model that considered the dynamic change of kc was found to be superior to the bp model that considered the crop coefficient recommended by fao 56 with prediction accuracy increased by 19 additionally the accuracy of the bp prediction models that considered the dynamic change of kc and the effect of precipitation were higher than 95 moreover the bp prediction model in typical weather with precipitation was superior to the bp model in typical weather with no precipitation the results obtained would be helpful for obtaining the etc more consistent with the actual growth status of the crop thereby providing a scientific basis for improving water management during crop production keywords back propagation neural network driving factors crop evapotranspiration dynamic crop coefficient precipitation 1 introduction crop evapotranspiration etc is an important component of the land hydrological cycle and plays a crucial role in irrigation planning and regional water resource allocation pereira and pruitt 2004 gao et al 2016 qiu et al 2019 the accurate forecast of etc can conserve irrigation water to a certain extent particularly in arid and semiarid areas where agricultural water consumption is high and crop growth is strongly dependent on irrigation rana and katerji 2000 therefore to enhance management of irrigation water consumption and to improve the water use efficiency of a crop it is imperative to forecast etc accurately several methods for etc forecasting have been developed which can be classified into four main categories time series model marino et al 1993 grey model he and tao 2014 empirical formula kashyap and panda 2001 and artificial neural network model traore et al 2016 time series model is a kind of statistical analysis method which needs several years of data it can directly use the past trends to predict the future cheng and wang 2008 a grey model grey differential prediction model uses a small amount of incomplete information to construct a long term fuzzy description of the law of development of things yuan et al 2019 an empirical formula is based on the results of field experiments for example in the crop coefficient method the etc is calculated by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 by a crop coefficient kc alexandris and kerkides 2003 an artificial neural network model possesses the functions of self organization self adaptation and self learning it is highly suitable for simulating and analyzing a system that is influenced by many factors and has complex relationships zanetti et al 2007 given that only a single data type is used for the time series method only historical data for etc is required and the most recent data contain information that is extremely important for forecasting there is uncertainty in the forecast accuracy of the time series method the grey forecast method is based on an exponential model when the objective function shows zero growth the systemic error is serious and the longer the forecast period the more serious the error becomes the empirical formula method requires different parameters for different research areas it needs more meteorological data and calculation is more complex than that of other methods allen et al 1998 hargreaves and allen 2003 paredes et al 2017 phogat et al 2016 taylor et al 2015 an artificial neural network is a type of machine learning system that has been developed in recent years it can model a nonlinear system without the need to understand its internal specific structure and can provide an effective method for time series prediction and evaluation of highly nonlinear dynamic relations abrishami et al 2019 there is a complex relationship nonlinear linear exponential etc between etc and its driving factors in view of the shortcomings of the conventional model for water consumption prediction such as blindness low fitting accuracy and easy distortion the prediction model of nonlinear artificial neural network is established by introducing the calculation method of neural network which can consider the influence of many factors on etc the established prediction model has high prediction accuracy simple easy operation and has good application value comparing the structural characteristics of neural networks the back propagation neural network bp is a type that has a simple network structure fast convergence and strong performance in nonlinear function approximation moreover there is no local minimum problem so it has more extensive applicability kumar et al 2011 discussed the prediction of etc by bp model and showed that the bp model could predict etc better than the traditional method jain et al 2008 and oezguer 2006 applied the radial basis function bp model to predict etc the results showed that the former had better prediction performance than the semi empirical equation ozgur 2007 used the levenberge marquardt lm training algorithm for etc prediction based on the bp model and obtained good results sudheer et al 2003 established a bp model for estimating rice daily etc using limited meteorological data and found that the prediction performance of the model was reliable abrishami et al 2019 used bp model for estimating wheat and maize daily standard etc it was concluded that the artificial neural networks in which the calculated etc was used as output with two hidden layers showed more accurate results in estimating the wheat and maize daily evapotranspiration furthermore it is concluded that instead of using the measured values of etc the calculated values of etc based on the locally calibrated equation can be used as output in bp model with good accuracy for estimating etc of wheat and maize and generalization ability and could accurately reflect the relationship between etc and various influencing factors at present the bp neural network model is mainly used for training and testing with the temperature sunshine hours and wind speed as input variables liu et al 2009 yan et al 2007 most studies have used the crop coefficient recommended by fao 56 or the historical measured crop coefficient to predict etc chen and ou 2010 however with a change in the crop and the external conditions the crop coefficient kc constantly changes but the overall change is stable over the crop growth period alberto et al 2014 additionally the kc recommended by fao 56 does not reflect the daily dynamic change of crops there is a slight deviation between the forecasted value and the measured value in the short term forecast of etc peng et al 2007 therefore it is necessary to consider the influence of the crop growth stage on the dynamic change of crops for kc acquisition previous research showed that when the average annual precipitation is between 400 and 600 mm the average annual precipitation in this study area is 540 mm the etc is closely related to the precipitation and the etc decreases with the decrease of precipitation yang et al 2017 in recent years with the global temperature rising the lower amount of precipitation in most regions reduces the etc li et al 2015 as an important factor affecting the accuracy of evapotranspiration prediction precipitation has not been directly taken into account many previous studies have been conducted on the prediction of etc however there are two principal problems with previous approaches first fao 56 suggests different kc values for different crops based on various field experiments conducted worldwide the suggested values provide a convenient way for irrigation management and other purposes as kc varies with crop type climate irrigation method and other management factors the use of the same kc values in different places and for different irrigation methods is subject to significant uncertainties therefore kc values recommended by fao may not be applicable to all regions allen et al 2005 2011 ding et al 2015 additionally because of the uncertainty of precipitation few studies on etc prediction based on the bp model have considered precipitation bp model that considers only the deterministic meteorological factors will inevitably lead to the deviation of etc prediction in typical weather and its applicability is poor in such weather with the above considerations in mind winter wheat and summer maize in north china were selected as the subject of this study because kc changes dynamically a dynamic prediction method for etc was constructed based on the bp model bp kc and the bp model was further developed bp kcp to take account of the certainty of precipitation the improved model can produce etc forecasts that are more consistent with the actual growth status of the crop thereby providing a scientific basis for improving water management during crop production 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the daxing district 39 26 39 51 n 116 13 116 43 e of beijing is located on the floodplain of the

using the least squares error model 2 3 3 artificial neural network model bp neural network completely connects the neurons in the upper layer to the neurons in the next layer through the transfer function when the learning samples are provided to the neural network it first performs forward propagation if the difference between the output and the target output exceeds the expected value the forward propagation process is replaced by the back propagation process by modifying the weights of the neurons in each layer the error signal is reduced with the error back propagation correction the accuracy of the network response to the input mode is constantly improved and finally the accuracy is sufficiently high that it can applied to prediction chen and ou 2010 the artificial neural network modelling process comprises two stages preprocessing including variable selection data division and data normalization and processing including architecture and the network training process 1 data pre processing some of the selected data may be nonexistent or abnormal as a consequence of environmental interference or human operation li et al 2006 1000 datasets were finally obtained randomly selected 800 sets of data from the historical meteorological data between march and september from 2015 to 2019 as the training dataset for the purpose of identifying the fitting performance of the testing dataset a cross validation analysis between the measured and simulated was conducted on the testing dataset 200 groups of data were randomly selected from the historical meteorological forecast data between march and september from 2015 to 2019 as the testing dataset because of the different dimensions of the input variables and the greater magnitude of their values it was necessary to standardize the values of the input variables before training the neural network the aims were to avoid overfitting and improve the degree of convergence and the calculation speed to improve the simulation accuracy the hyperbolic tangent functions are commonly used as transformation functions in bp neural network training these functions can handle nonlinear characteristics in the interval 0 1 therefore all the input values were standardized into this range with respect to their maximum and minimum values according to eq 9 9 x x x min x max x min where xmax and xmin are the maximum and minimum respectively of all values taken by the variables x and x the measured values of all the variables before and after standardization respectively 2 network structure and parameters according to the empirical formula the number of hidden layer units ranges from three to 12 the formula is as follows ramirez et al 2005 10 j a b k where j is the number of hidden layer units a is the number of input layer units b is the number of output layer units and k is a constant whose value is in the range 1 10 in this study a three layer bp neural network comprising an input layer output layer and hidden layer was designed to predict the etc it was implemented with the matlab toolbox r2014 mathworks inc natwick ma because the numbers of neurons in the input and output layers are decided by objectives and the mode of connection is also fixed the structure mainly depends on the number of neurons in the hidden layer too few hidden nodes impairs the functionality of the network whereas too many hidden nodes can cause the network to overfit the data the number of neurons was selected by trial and error starting from the minimum number and then increasing gradually until no further improvement in efficiency was observed ramirez et al 2005 in the back propagation training algorithm the neurons in the hidden layer and output layer and their inputs were processed by multiplying each input by its weight summing the product and then processing the sum using a nonlinear transfer function the transfer function used was the sigmoid function learning in a neural network occurs when the weights of the neurons are modified according to the error the difference between the values of the actual output and target output the changes made to the weights are proportional to the negative of the derivative of the error during the process of network training the error was minimized through repeated iterations after many training runs and repeated screenings we finally determined the best bp neural network architecture to be 4 10 1 with a learning rate of 0 1 and 2000 iterations for training the bp prediction model and mlr model were constructed with three different sets of input variables by using the training datasets and the etc measured by eddy covariance was taken as the output variable scheme 1 taking tmax tmin n kc fao as the input variables scheme 2 taking tmax tmin n kc var as the input variables scheme 3 taking tmax tmin n kc var and p as the input variables 2 4 evaluation index the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and accuracy acc were used to evaluate the performance of these models each statistical index was calculated as follows zhang et al 2016 11 mae i 1 n x i y i n 12 rmse

measured value of ec i is the forecasted sample series i 1 2 n x and y are the means of the forecast value and the calculated value sequences respectively n is the sample number of the forecast value liu et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of driving factors of crop evapotranspiration before applying the mlr and bp single variable analysis was conducted to determine the relevant factors influencing etc first the correlation between etc and tmax tmin n u rh kc p were analyzed by assessing the correlation between each factor and etc because etc is subject to the comprehensive impression concept stocks of various factors and the relationship between variables is relatively complex principal component analysis was adopted to assess the direct effect of each factor on etc and the indirect effect of each factor as shown in fig 2 table 2 and table 3 in table 2 it is showed that a significant correlation between etc and tmax tmin n and kc without considering precipitation certainty p 0 01 the correlation coefficients were 0 50 0 41 0 33 and 0 72 for tmax tmin n kc respectively the correlations between etc and the variables u and p were not significant the correlation coefficients were 0 15 for u and 0 01 for p in fig 2 it is showed that the variation of precipitation and etc measured by ec etc ec in the study area between march 2015 and september 2019 the main growth period for winter wheat and summer maize the total precipitation amounts between march and september in the years 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 were 396 6 mm 582 63 mm 497 3 mm 540 4 mm and 351 4 mm respectively accounting for more than 80 of the annual precipitation the precipitation was mainly concentrated in the period between july and september every year which was in the main growth period for summer maize in table 3 it is showed that a very significant correlation between etc and the variables tmax tmin n kc and p p 0 01 the correlation coefficients were 0 45 0 41 0 32 0 70 and 0 31 respectively when precipitation certainty was considered however the correlation between etc and u was only 0 19 because the correlation between etc and u was weak when precipitation certainty was considered u was not considered further in the construction of the etc prediction model additionally the crop coefficient kc is a key factor in etc prediction because it reflects the effects of the biological characteristics of crops yield level soil water fertilizer status and management level on the etc of crops allen et al 1998 precipitation is the dominant factor for the change in the relative wettability index in every season of the growing season however because the certainty of precipitation is not taken into account in the principal component analysis the selected data include both the time period of prediction and the time period with no precipitation so a large deviation will be caused yan et al 2020 according to the national standard ma et al 2012 it is clear that precipitation is closely related to crop reference evapotranspiration therefore it is necessary to consider the deterministic impact of precipitation on the prediction of etc 3 2 crop evapotranspiration prediction model considering dynamic change of crop coefficient bp kc in fig 3 it is showed that a comparison of the dynamic crop coefficient kc var with kc fao in the main growth periods of winter wheat and summer maize between 2015 and 2019 as can be observed from fig 3 the trends in the variation of crop coefficient of winter wheat and summer maize obtained by the two methods were basically the same the crop coefficient first increased and then decreased with crop growth and reached its maximum value in the middle growth period the heading to filling stages that is the peak time for crop water demand ding et al 2007 in the early and late growth stages kc var fluctuated up and down relative to kc fao and in the middle growth stage kc var was generally lower than kc fao compared with kc fao the calculation of kc var take into account the actual growth state of crops so kc var can reflect the actual water consumption state more accurately 15 ml r 0 e t c 0 02 t max 0 068 t min 0 157 n 0 479 16 mlr kc e t c 0 009 t max 0 042 t min 0 256 n 3 472 k c 2 537 to illustrate the prediction performance of four bp models 100 groups of testing dataset were randomly selected to depict the scatter plots of the measured and predicted by bp models as can be seen from fig 4 a and 4 c that the trends in etc predicted by the bp0 model and the mlr0 model in scheme 1 eq 15 and the measured value et c ec without considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient it can be observed from the figure that the etc values predicted by the bp0 model and the mlr0 model were basically consistent with the etc trend measured by ec in testing sets the average values of etc from the bp0 model mlr0 model and measured by ec were 2 12 mm d 2 13 mm d and 3 03 mm d respectively and the coefficients of determination r2 for the bp0 and mlr0 predictions were 0 80 and 0 69 respectively however the deviation of the bp0 model was less than that of the mlr0 model the root mean square error rmse was 1 41 mm d for the bp0 model and 1 52 mm d for the mlr0 model and the mean absolute error mae was 1 19 mm d for the bp0 model and 1 23 mm d for the mlr0 model the values predicted by both the bp0 model and mlr0 model were generally lower than the measured values moreover the accuracy of the bp0 model was high and the bp model could more accurately reflect the complex nonlinear relationship between etc and various influencing factors whitley et al 2009 it can be observed from fig 4 b and 4 d that the trends in the variation of the measured values of etc were basically consistent with the values predicted by the bp kc model and the mlr kc model scheme 2 eq 16 in testing sets the mean values of etc from the bp kc model mlr kc model and measured by ec were 2 60 mm d 2 72 mm d and 2 64 mm d respectively the rmse was 1 35 mm d for the bp kc model and 1 36 mm d for the mlr kc model and the mae was 0 39 mm d for the bp kc model and 0 54 mm d for the mlr kc model the regression slope was 0 87 for the bp kc model and 0 79 for the mlr kc model the prediction accuracy was 91 44 for the bp kc model and 82 96 for the mlr kc model although the fitting accuracies fluctuated within a narrow range for bp model during both the training stage and testing stage the acc of model bp kc was improved by considering dynamic change of crop coefficient effect thereby suggesting the importance of the dynamic change of crop coefficient for etc prediction qiu et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 hou et al 2010 similary the acc of model mlr kc was improved by considering dynamic change of crop coefficient tu et al 2019 kc depends on several aspects such as type of crop weather variable canopy cover density growth stage soil moisture and agriculture operations allen et al 1988 kc has the potential to precisely calculate the actual crop etc mehta and pandey 2015 therefore it is necessary to obtain kc accurately for etc prediction 3 3 crop evapotranspiration prediction model considering dynamic change of crop coefficient and precipitation bp kcp it is can be seen from fig 5 a and 5 c that a comparison between the predicted values of bp kcp1 and mlr kcp1 scheme 3 eq 17 and the measured values when precipitation was determined in testing sets it can be observed from the figure that the trends of the two methods were basically consistent with the measured values but the bp kcp model had a higher accuracy rate and smaller errors when determining the precipitation for etc prediction the bp model was still superior to the mlr model the superiority of the bp model in reflecting complex nonlinear relations was evident again this is similar to the results in section 3 2 and was also consistent with the research results of fernández et al fernández et al 2008 tu et al 2019 the coefficients of determination were 0 90 and 0 81 respectively and the prediction accuracies were 97 61 and 87 69 respectively rmse values were 1 19 mm d and 1 27 mm d respectively and the mae values were 0 28 mm d and 0 39 mm d respectively in fig 5 b and 5 d it showed the etc prediction model of bp kcp2 and mlr kcp2 eq 18 in scheme 3 considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient when there was no precipitation it can be observed from fig 5 that the etc predicted by the bp kcp2 model was consistent with the measured value and was better than that predicted by the mlr model the regression slopes of the correlation equation between the measured values and the bp kcp2 and mlr kcp2 models were 0 88 and 0 85 respectively the coefficients of determination were 0 84 and 0 78 respectively the prediction accuracies were 95 84 and 77 73 respectively and the rmse values were 1 37 mm d and 1 40 mm d respectively and the mae values were 0 43 mm d and 0 51 mm d respectively this result showed that the bp kcp2 prediction model could reflect the response of etc to meteorological factors in the case of no precipitation whereas the mlr model could not fully reflect the response of etc to meteorological factors because of the complex nonlinear relationship etc is closely related to the precipitation 64 of precipitation enters the atmosphere in the form of etc which directly participates in the earth s water cycle our study suggested that the performance of bp model may be greatly improved by the inclusion of the dynamic change of crop coefficient and precipitation thereby suggesting that these two factors were important variables in modelling etc in our study geng et al 2020 17 mlr k c p 1 e t c 0 002 t max 0 012 t min 0 007 p 0 247 n 2 097 k c 0 542 18 mlr k c p 2 e t c 0 062 t max 0 016 t min 0 156 n 4 16 k c 2 685 it can be observed from table 4 and fig 6 that the bp kc model took into account the actual growth status of crops this made its prediction accuracy higher than that of the bp0 model and all errors were smaller the rmse was reduced by 0 06 mm d and the coefficient of determination and prediction accuracy were increased by 0 07 and 19 respectively similarly the accuracy of the mlr model considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient was higher than that when the dynamic change of crop coefficient was ignored in addition to reflecting the influence of meteorological data on etc the crop coefficient reflects the influence of crop species soil water fertilizer conditions and field management level on etc the bp model considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient could more accurately reflect the dynamic change of crop etc jiang et al 2014 kang et al 2003 additionally when the measured etc was small the values predicted by the bp kc model and the mlr kc model showed a good fit with the measured values when the measured etc was greater than 4 mm d the prediction accuracy decreased compared with the bp kc model that did not consider precipitation fig 6 as a consequence of considering the influence of precipitation on etc the prediction accuracy was increased by about 6 the average value predicted by the bp kcp2 model was 3 20 mm and the measured value was 3 21 mm however compared with the bp kcp1 model in the case of precipitation the prediction effect of the bp kcp2 model was slightly worse the rmse and mae were increased by 0 18 mm d and 0 15 mm d respectively the corresponding coefficient of determination and prediction accuracy were reduced by 0 06 and 1 77 respectively this may be because the measured etc 3 21 mm d in the case of no precipitation was greater than that of the predicted one in the case of precipitation the measured etc 2 50 mm d was large which resulted in the discrete distribution of etc so the bp kcp model has better applicability in the case of precipitation bp model is potential decision support tools for predicting etc in agriculture across different climate parameters numerous studies have been conducted to examine the potential impact of climate change on etc and most of researches have confirmed the impact of climate change on precipitation arun et al 2014 min et al 2011 kao and ganguly 2011 various models for etc prediction have been investigated liu et al 2018 rawat et al 2017 anapalli et al 2016 but limited studies have investigated the etc prediction considering the precipitation effects overall the fitting accuracies of the bp models are higher than in the traditional multiple regression model and may be used to forecast for etc the improved agreements between the measured and predicted were given by the bp models of considering dynamic change of crop coefficient and precipitation primarily because of their ability to capture arbitrarily complex and nonlinear input output relationships from data without any restrictive assumptions about the functional form of the underlying process humphrey et al 2016 otherwise compared with the traditional etc prediction method chen and ou 2010 lu et al 2014 zheng et al 2008 huang et al 2019 the etc prediction model considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient and precipitation can reflect the influence of crop species soil moisture conditions and field management level on etc and can get a more suitable etc for the actual growth state of crops 4 conclusion this study is aimed at producing a new method of crop evapotranspiration prediction by considering dynamic change of crop coefficient and the precipitation effect in back propagation neural network model we expect that our results may have useful implications for obtaining the etc more consistent with the actual growth status of the crop thereby providing a scientific basis for improving water management during crop production the following conclusions formulated 1 in the principal component analysis considering precipitation certainty tmax tmin n kc p were the key factors determining crop etc and the correlation between etc and u was not significant 2 kc not only reflected the influence of meteorological data on etc but also reflected the influence of crop species soil water and fertilizer conditions and field management level on etc the bp kc model considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient can predict crop etc more accurately the bp kc model considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient can better realize the accurate prediction of etc and bp model can more accurately reflect the complex nonlinear relationship between etc and various influencing factors than mlr model 3 at the same time the accuracy of the prediction model considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient and precipitation certainty was the best and the prediction accuracy was above 95 however the bp kcp1 model with precipitation was better than the bp kcp2 model without precipitation the bp kcp1 model has better applicability when considering

4697,accurate prediction of crop evapotranspiration etc can provide a scientific basis for improving water use efficiency rational allocation of water resources and sustainable management of ecosystems however conventional statistical methods have the limited application in some regions because of the complex relationships nonlinear linear exponential etc between etc and its each driving factor this paper illustrated the utility of the back propagation neural network bp model for etc prediction and compared the performance of this model with that of the multiple linear regression technique combined with the etc measured by eddy covariance and the meteorological data three layer bp models trained by the levenberg marquardt algorithm were developed with a 4 10 1 architecture corresponding to four ten and one nodes in the input hidden and output layers respectively the bp models were trained and validated in the matlab environment with three different combinations of maximum air temperature minimum air temperature sunshine hours crop coefficient kc and precipitation a high correlation was observed between the values measured by eddy covariance and those predicted by bp with a higher coefficient of determination 0 87 and accuracy 91 44 than that achieved by the multiple linear regression model 0 79 and 82 96 respectively furthermore the performance of the bp models could be improved substantially by including the dynamic change of kc and the effect of precipitation which suggested that these two factors were crucial variables in modeling etc by bp approaches in testing sets the bp model that considered the dynamic change of kc was found to be superior to the bp model that considered the crop coefficient recommended by fao 56 with prediction accuracy increased by 19 additionally the accuracy of the bp prediction models that considered the dynamic change of kc and the effect of precipitation were higher than 95 moreover the bp prediction model in typical weather with precipitation was superior to the bp model in typical weather with no precipitation the results obtained would be helpful for obtaining the etc more consistent with the actual growth status of the crop thereby providing a scientific basis for improving water management during crop production keywords back propagation neural network driving factors crop evapotranspiration dynamic crop coefficient precipitation 1 introduction crop evapotranspiration etc is an important component of the land hydrological cycle and plays a crucial role in irrigation planning and regional water resource allocation pereira and pruitt 2004 gao et al 2016 qiu et al 2019 the accurate forecast of etc can conserve irrigation water to a certain extent particularly in arid and semiarid areas where agricultural water consumption is high and crop growth is strongly dependent on irrigation rana and katerji 2000 therefore to enhance management of irrigation water consumption and to improve the water use efficiency of a crop it is imperative to forecast etc accurately several methods for etc forecasting have been developed which can be classified into four main categories time series model marino et al 1993 grey model he and tao 2014 empirical formula kashyap and panda 2001 and artificial neural network model traore et al 2016 time series model is a kind of statistical analysis method which needs several years of data it can directly use the past trends to predict the future cheng and wang 2008 a grey model grey differential prediction model uses a small amount of incomplete information to construct a long term fuzzy description of the law of development of things yuan et al 2019 an empirical formula is based on the results of field experiments for example in the crop coefficient method the etc is calculated by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 by a crop coefficient kc alexandris and kerkides 2003 an artificial neural network model possesses the functions of self organization self adaptation and self learning it is highly suitable for simulating and analyzing a system that is influenced by many factors and has complex relationships zanetti et al 2007 given that only a single data type is used for the time series method only historical data for etc is required and the most recent data contain information that is extremely important for forecasting there is uncertainty in the forecast accuracy of the time series method the grey forecast method is based on an exponential model when the objective function shows zero growth the systemic error is serious and the longer the forecast period the more serious the error becomes the empirical formula method requires different parameters for different research areas it needs more meteorological data and calculation is more complex than that of other methods allen et al 1998 hargreaves and allen 2003 paredes et al 2017 phogat et al 2016 taylor et al 2015 an artificial neural network is a type of machine learning system that has been developed in recent years it can model a nonlinear system without the need to understand its internal specific structure and can provide an effective method for time series prediction and evaluation of highly nonlinear dynamic relations abrishami et al 2019 there is a complex relationship nonlinear linear exponential etc between etc and its driving factors in view of the shortcomings of the conventional model for water consumption prediction such as blindness low fitting accuracy and easy distortion the prediction model of nonlinear artificial neural network is established by introducing the calculation method of neural network which can consider the influence of many factors on etc the established prediction model has high prediction accuracy simple easy operation and has good application value comparing the structural characteristics of neural networks the back propagation neural network bp is a type that has a simple network structure fast convergence and strong performance in nonlinear function approximation moreover there is no local minimum problem so it has more extensive applicability kumar et al 2011 discussed the prediction of etc by bp model and showed that the bp model could predict etc better than the traditional method jain et al 2008 and oezguer 2006 applied the radial basis function bp model to predict etc the results showed that the former had better prediction performance than the semi empirical equation ozgur 2007 used the levenberge marquardt lm training algorithm for etc prediction based on the bp model and obtained good results sudheer et al 2003 established a bp model for estimating rice daily etc using limited meteorological data and found that the prediction performance of the model was reliable abrishami et al 2019 used bp model for estimating wheat and maize daily standard etc it was concluded that the artificial neural networks in which the calculated etc was used as output with two hidden layers showed more accurate results in estimating the wheat and maize daily evapotranspiration furthermore it is concluded that instead of using the measured values of etc the calculated values of etc based on the locally calibrated equation can be used as output in bp model with good accuracy for estimating etc of wheat and maize and generalization ability and could accurately reflect the relationship between etc and various influencing factors at present the bp neural network model is mainly used for training and testing with the temperature sunshine hours and wind speed as input variables liu et al 2009 yan et al 2007 most studies have used the crop coefficient recommended by fao 56 or the historical measured crop coefficient to predict etc chen and ou 2010 however with a change in the crop and the external conditions the crop coefficient kc constantly changes but the overall change is stable over the crop growth period alberto et al 2014 additionally the kc recommended by fao 56 does not reflect the daily dynamic change of crops there is a slight deviation between the forecasted value and the measured value in the short term forecast of etc peng et al 2007 therefore it is necessary to consider the influence of the crop growth stage on the dynamic change of crops for kc acquisition previous research showed that when the average annual precipitation is between 400 and 600 mm the average annual precipitation in this study area is 540 mm the etc is closely related to the precipitation and the etc decreases with the decrease of precipitation yang et al 2017 in recent years with the global temperature rising the lower amount of precipitation in most regions reduces the etc li et al 2015 as an important factor affecting the accuracy of evapotranspiration prediction precipitation has not been directly taken into account many previous studies have been conducted on the prediction of etc however there are two principal problems with previous approaches first fao 56 suggests different kc values for different crops based on various field experiments conducted worldwide the suggested values provide a convenient way for irrigation management and other purposes as kc varies with crop type climate irrigation method and other management factors the use of the same kc values in different places and for different irrigation methods is subject to significant uncertainties therefore kc values recommended by fao may not be applicable to all regions allen et al 2005 2011 ding et al 2015 additionally because of the uncertainty of precipitation few studies on etc prediction based on the bp model have considered precipitation bp model that considers only the deterministic meteorological factors will inevitably lead to the deviation of etc prediction in typical weather and its applicability is poor in such weather with the above considerations in mind winter wheat and summer maize in north china were selected as the subject of this study because kc changes dynamically a dynamic prediction method for etc was constructed based on the bp model bp kc and the bp model was further developed bp kcp to take account of the certainty of precipitation the improved model can produce etc forecasts that are more consistent with the actual growth status of the crop thereby providing a scientific basis for improving water management during crop production 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the daxing district 39 26 39 51 n 116 13 116 43 e of beijing is located on the floodplain of the

using the least squares error model 2 3 3 artificial neural network model bp neural network completely connects the neurons in the upper layer to the neurons in the next layer through the transfer function when the learning samples are provided to the neural network it first performs forward propagation if the difference between the output and the target output exceeds the expected value the forward propagation process is replaced by the back propagation process by modifying the weights of the neurons in each layer the error signal is reduced with the error back propagation correction the accuracy of the network response to the input mode is constantly improved and finally the accuracy is sufficiently high that it can applied to prediction chen and ou 2010 the artificial neural network modelling process comprises two stages preprocessing including variable selection data division and data normalization and processing including architecture and the network training process 1 data pre processing some of the selected data may be nonexistent or abnormal as a consequence of environmental interference or human operation li et al 2006 1000 datasets were finally obtained randomly selected 800 sets of data from the historical meteorological data between march and september from 2015 to 2019 as the training dataset for the purpose of identifying the fitting performance of the testing dataset a cross validation analysis between the measured and simulated was conducted on the testing dataset 200 groups of data were randomly selected from the historical meteorological forecast data between march and september from 2015 to 2019 as the testing dataset because of the different dimensions of the input variables and the greater magnitude of their values it was necessary to standardize the values of the input variables before training the neural network the aims were to avoid overfitting and improve the degree of convergence and the calculation speed to improve the simulation accuracy the hyperbolic tangent functions are commonly used as transformation functions in bp neural network training these functions can handle nonlinear characteristics in the interval 0 1 therefore all the input values were standardized into this range with respect to their maximum and minimum values according to eq 9 9 x x x min x max x min where xmax and xmin are the maximum and minimum respectively of all values taken by the variables x and x the measured values of all the variables before and after standardization respectively 2 network structure and parameters according to the empirical formula the number of hidden layer units ranges from three to 12 the formula is as follows ramirez et al 2005 10 j a b k where j is the number of hidden layer units a is the number of input layer units b is the number of output layer units and k is a constant whose value is in the range 1 10 in this study a three layer bp neural network comprising an input layer output layer and hidden layer was designed to predict the etc it was implemented with the matlab toolbox r2014 mathworks inc natwick ma because the numbers of neurons in the input and output layers are decided by objectives and the mode of connection is also fixed the structure mainly depends on the number of neurons in the hidden layer too few hidden nodes impairs the functionality of the network whereas too many hidden nodes can cause the network to overfit the data the number of neurons was selected by trial and error starting from the minimum number and then increasing gradually until no further improvement in efficiency was observed ramirez et al 2005 in the back propagation training algorithm the neurons in the hidden layer and output layer and their inputs were processed by multiplying each input by its weight summing the product and then processing the sum using a nonlinear transfer function the transfer function used was the sigmoid function learning in a neural network occurs when the weights of the neurons are modified according to the error the difference between the values of the actual output and target output the changes made to the weights are proportional to the negative of the derivative of the error during the process of network training the error was minimized through repeated iterations after many training runs and repeated screenings we finally determined the best bp neural network architecture to be 4 10 1 with a learning rate of 0 1 and 2000 iterations for training the bp prediction model and mlr model were constructed with three different sets of input variables by using the training datasets and the etc measured by eddy covariance was taken as the output variable scheme 1 taking tmax tmin n kc fao as the input variables scheme 2 taking tmax tmin n kc var as the input variables scheme 3 taking tmax tmin n kc var and p as the input variables 2 4 evaluation index the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and accuracy acc were used to evaluate the performance of these models each statistical index was calculated as follows zhang et al 2016 11 mae i 1 n x i y i n 12 rmse

measured value of ec i is the forecasted sample series i 1 2 n x and y are the means of the forecast value and the calculated value sequences respectively n is the sample number of the forecast value liu et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of driving factors of crop evapotranspiration before applying the mlr and bp single variable analysis was conducted to determine the relevant factors influencing etc first the correlation between etc and tmax tmin n u rh kc p were analyzed by assessing the correlation between each factor and etc because etc is subject to the comprehensive impression concept stocks of various factors and the relationship between variables is relatively complex principal component analysis was adopted to assess the direct effect of each factor on etc and the indirect effect of each factor as shown in fig 2 table 2 and table 3 in table 2 it is showed that a significant correlation between etc and tmax tmin n and kc without considering precipitation certainty p 0 01 the correlation coefficients were 0 50 0 41 0 33 and 0 72 for tmax tmin n kc respectively the correlations between etc and the variables u and p were not significant the correlation coefficients were 0 15 for u and 0 01 for p in fig 2 it is showed that the variation of precipitation and etc measured by ec etc ec in the study area between march 2015 and september 2019 the main growth period for winter wheat and summer maize the total precipitation amounts between march and september in the years 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 were 396 6 mm 582 63 mm 497 3 mm 540 4 mm and 351 4 mm respectively accounting for more than 80 of the annual precipitation the precipitation was mainly concentrated in the period between july and september every year which was in the main growth period for summer maize in table 3 it is showed that a very significant correlation between etc and the variables tmax tmin n kc and p p 0 01 the correlation coefficients were 0 45 0 41 0 32 0 70 and 0 31 respectively when precipitation certainty was considered however the correlation between etc and u was only 0 19 because the correlation between etc and u was weak when precipitation certainty was considered u was not considered further in the construction of the etc prediction model additionally the crop coefficient kc is a key factor in etc prediction because it reflects the effects of the biological characteristics of crops yield level soil water fertilizer status and management level on the etc of crops allen et al 1998 precipitation is the dominant factor for the change in the relative wettability index in every season of the growing season however because the certainty of precipitation is not taken into account in the principal component analysis the selected data include both the time period of prediction and the time period with no precipitation so a large deviation will be caused yan et al 2020 according to the national standard ma et al 2012 it is clear that precipitation is closely related to crop reference evapotranspiration therefore it is necessary to consider the deterministic impact of precipitation on the prediction of etc 3 2 crop evapotranspiration prediction model considering dynamic change of crop coefficient bp kc in fig 3 it is showed that a comparison of the dynamic crop coefficient kc var with kc fao in the main growth periods of winter wheat and summer maize between 2015 and 2019 as can be observed from fig 3 the trends in the variation of crop coefficient of winter wheat and summer maize obtained by the two methods were basically the same the crop coefficient first increased and then decreased with crop growth and reached its maximum value in the middle growth period the heading to filling stages that is the peak time for crop water demand ding et al 2007 in the early and late growth stages kc var fluctuated up and down relative to kc fao and in the middle growth stage kc var was generally lower than kc fao compared with kc fao the calculation of kc var take into account the actual growth state of crops so kc var can reflect the actual water consumption state more accurately 15 ml r 0 e t c 0 02 t max 0 068 t min 0 157 n 0 479 16 mlr kc e t c 0 009 t max 0 042 t min 0 256 n 3 472 k c 2 537 to illustrate the prediction performance of four bp models 100 groups of testing dataset were randomly selected to depict the scatter plots of the measured and predicted by bp models as can be seen from fig 4 a and 4 c that the trends in etc predicted by the bp0 model and the mlr0 model in scheme 1 eq 15 and the measured value et c ec without considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient it can be observed from the figure that the etc values predicted by the bp0 model and the mlr0 model were basically consistent with the etc trend measured by ec in testing sets the average values of etc from the bp0 model mlr0 model and measured by ec were 2 12 mm d 2 13 mm d and 3 03 mm d respectively and the coefficients of determination r2 for the bp0 and mlr0 predictions were 0 80 and 0 69 respectively however the deviation of the bp0 model was less than that of the mlr0 model the root mean square error rmse was 1 41 mm d for the bp0 model and 1 52 mm d for the mlr0 model and the mean absolute error mae was 1 19 mm d for the bp0 model and 1 23 mm d for the mlr0 model the values predicted by both the bp0 model and mlr0 model were generally lower than the measured values moreover the accuracy of the bp0 model was high and the bp model could more accurately reflect the complex nonlinear relationship between etc and various influencing factors whitley et al 2009 it can be observed from fig 4 b and 4 d that the trends in the variation of the measured values of etc were basically consistent with the values predicted by the bp kc model and the mlr kc model scheme 2 eq 16 in testing sets the mean values of etc from the bp kc model mlr kc model and measured by ec were 2 60 mm d 2 72 mm d and 2 64 mm d respectively the rmse was 1 35 mm d for the bp kc model and 1 36 mm d for the mlr kc model and the mae was 0 39 mm d for the bp kc model and 0 54 mm d for the mlr kc model the regression slope was 0 87 for the bp kc model and 0 79 for the mlr kc model the prediction accuracy was 91 44 for the bp kc model and 82 96 for the mlr kc model although the fitting accuracies fluctuated within a narrow range for bp model during both the training stage and testing stage the acc of model bp kc was improved by considering dynamic change of crop coefficient effect thereby suggesting the importance of the dynamic change of crop coefficient for etc prediction qiu et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 hou et al 2010 similary the acc of model mlr kc was improved by considering dynamic change of crop coefficient tu et al 2019 kc depends on several aspects such as type of crop weather variable canopy cover density growth stage soil moisture and agriculture operations allen et al 1988 kc has the potential to precisely calculate the actual crop etc mehta and pandey 2015 therefore it is necessary to obtain kc accurately for etc prediction 3 3 crop evapotranspiration prediction model considering dynamic change of crop coefficient and precipitation bp kcp it is can be seen from fig 5 a and 5 c that a comparison between the predicted values of bp kcp1 and mlr kcp1 scheme 3 eq 17 and the measured values when precipitation was determined in testing sets it can be observed from the figure that the trends of the two methods were basically consistent with the measured values but the bp kcp model had a higher accuracy rate and smaller errors when determining the precipitation for etc prediction the bp model was still superior to the mlr model the superiority of the bp model in reflecting complex nonlinear relations was evident again this is similar to the results in section 3 2 and was also consistent with the research results of fernández et al fernández et al 2008 tu et al 2019 the coefficients of determination were 0 90 and 0 81 respectively and the prediction accuracies were 97 61 and 87 69 respectively rmse values were 1 19 mm d and 1 27 mm d respectively and the mae values were 0 28 mm d and 0 39 mm d respectively in fig 5 b and 5 d it showed the etc prediction model of bp kcp2 and mlr kcp2 eq 18 in scheme 3 considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient when there was no precipitation it can be observed from fig 5 that the etc predicted by the bp kcp2 model was consistent with the measured value and was better than that predicted by the mlr model the regression slopes of the correlation equation between the measured values and the bp kcp2 and mlr kcp2 models were 0 88 and 0 85 respectively the coefficients of determination were 0 84 and 0 78 respectively the prediction accuracies were 95 84 and 77 73 respectively and the rmse values were 1 37 mm d and 1 40 mm d respectively and the mae values were 0 43 mm d and 0 51 mm d respectively this result showed that the bp kcp2 prediction model could reflect the response of etc to meteorological factors in the case of no precipitation whereas the mlr model could not fully reflect the response of etc to meteorological factors because of the complex nonlinear relationship etc is closely related to the precipitation 64 of precipitation enters the atmosphere in the form of etc which directly participates in the earth s water cycle our study suggested that the performance of bp model may be greatly improved by the inclusion of the dynamic change of crop coefficient and precipitation thereby suggesting that these two factors were important variables in modelling etc in our study geng et al 2020 17 mlr k c p 1 e t c 0 002 t max 0 012 t min 0 007 p 0 247 n 2 097 k c 0 542 18 mlr k c p 2 e t c 0 062 t max 0 016 t min 0 156 n 4 16 k c 2 685 it can be observed from table 4 and fig 6 that the bp kc model took into account the actual growth status of crops this made its prediction accuracy higher than that of the bp0 model and all errors were smaller the rmse was reduced by 0 06 mm d and the coefficient of determination and prediction accuracy were increased by 0 07 and 19 respectively similarly the accuracy of the mlr model considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient was higher than that when the dynamic change of crop coefficient was ignored in addition to reflecting the influence of meteorological data on etc the crop coefficient reflects the influence of crop species soil water fertilizer conditions and field management level on etc the bp model considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient could more accurately reflect the dynamic change of crop etc jiang et al 2014 kang et al 2003 additionally when the measured etc was small the values predicted by the bp kc model and the mlr kc model showed a good fit with the measured values when the measured etc was greater than 4 mm d the prediction accuracy decreased compared with the bp kc model that did not consider precipitation fig 6 as a consequence of considering the influence of precipitation on etc the prediction accuracy was increased by about 6 the average value predicted by the bp kcp2 model was 3 20 mm and the measured value was 3 21 mm however compared with the bp kcp1 model in the case of precipitation the prediction effect of the bp kcp2 model was slightly worse the rmse and mae were increased by 0 18 mm d and 0 15 mm d respectively the corresponding coefficient of determination and prediction accuracy were reduced by 0 06 and 1 77 respectively this may be because the measured etc 3 21 mm d in the case of no precipitation was greater than that of the predicted one in the case of precipitation the measured etc 2 50 mm d was large which resulted in the discrete distribution of etc so the bp kcp model has better applicability in the case of precipitation bp model is potential decision support tools for predicting etc in agriculture across different climate parameters numerous studies have been conducted to examine the potential impact of climate change on etc and most of researches have confirmed the impact of climate change on precipitation arun et al 2014 min et al 2011 kao and ganguly 2011 various models for etc prediction have been investigated liu et al 2018 rawat et al 2017 anapalli et al 2016 but limited studies have investigated the etc prediction considering the precipitation effects overall the fitting accuracies of the bp models are higher than in the traditional multiple regression model and may be used to forecast for etc the improved agreements between the measured and predicted were given by the bp models of considering dynamic change of crop coefficient and precipitation primarily because of their ability to capture arbitrarily complex and nonlinear input output relationships from data without any restrictive assumptions about the functional form of the underlying process humphrey et al 2016 otherwise compared with the traditional etc prediction method chen and ou 2010 lu et al 2014 zheng et al 2008 huang et al 2019 the etc prediction model considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient and precipitation can reflect the influence of crop species soil moisture conditions and field management level on etc and can get a more suitable etc for the actual growth state of crops 4 conclusion this study is aimed at producing a new method of crop evapotranspiration prediction by considering dynamic change of crop coefficient and the precipitation effect in back propagation neural network model we expect that our results may have useful implications for obtaining the etc more consistent with the actual growth status of the crop thereby providing a scientific basis for improving water management during crop production the following conclusions formulated 1 in the principal component analysis considering precipitation certainty tmax tmin n kc p were the key factors determining crop etc and the correlation between etc and u was not significant 2 kc not only reflected the influence of meteorological data on etc but also reflected the influence of crop species soil water and fertilizer conditions and field management level on etc the bp kc model considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient can predict crop etc more accurately the bp kc model considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient can better realize the accurate prediction of etc and bp model can more accurately reflect the complex nonlinear relationship between etc and various influencing factors than mlr model 3 at the same time the accuracy of the prediction model considering the dynamic change of crop coefficient and precipitation certainty was the best and the prediction accuracy was above 95 however the bp kcp1 model with precipitation was better than the bp kcp2 model without precipitation the bp kcp1 model has better applicability when considering

4698,the middle route of the south to north water diversion project mrp effectively alleviates the problem of serious shortage of water resources in north china however owing to the long term operation of this project abnormal algal proliferation has occurred in the upper reaches of the main canal and the water diversion outlet is easily blocked by the large colonies of algae falling into the canal which has seriously threatened the water quality and water supply safety of the canal in light of this issue this study coupled the reinforcement learning model with the one dimensional hydrodynamic model of the series sluice group to build an ecological scheduling model for prevention and control of algal proliferation in the mrp the model was applied to the canal section approximately 300 km long from no g2 to no g17 where in algae grows easily the results show that 1 the model can achieve the desired reciprocating adjustment of the canal water level in the process of decline stability rise within 0 8 m and stably maintain the low water level for more than 72 h 2 during the process of ecological scheduling the maximum drawdown of water level satisfying the safety regulation and control constraints of the mrp is 1 0 m 3 for an ecological regulation water level drop greater than 0 3 m it is more difficult to restore the initial water level and the water level rise range should therefore be greater than the decrease range 4 the constructed model exhibits high robustness even for an observation error level less than 0 08 m the success rate of the model can still exceed 80 the ecological scheduling scheme generated by the model can be used to destroy the algal habitat conditions through hydrodynamic dynamic regulation whereby decisional support can be provided for the prevention and control of abnormal proliferation of algae in the main canal keywords middle route south to north water diversion project abnormal algae proliferation reinforcement learning model ecological scheduling model 1 introduction water is an important basic resource for human survival socio economic development and ecological environment stability wang and jia 2016 however owing to the impact of population explosion rapid economic development and climatic change the problem of water shortage caused by the uneven spatial and temporal distributions of water resources has become increasingly prominent and the sustainable socio economic development of many countries and regions is restricted shiklomanov and rodda 2004 vörösmarty et al 2010 it is an important means to alleviate the water shortage crisis in some areas by constructing water diversion projects from places with abundant water resources to places with water shortages qiao and yang 2010 at present more than 350 long distance water diversion projects have been completed in at least 39 countries framji 1994 in view of the shortage and uneven distribution of water resources china has built a series of water diversion projects to realize the spatially optimal allocation of water resources zhang et al 2019 among them the middle route of south to north water diversion project mrp with strategic significance was built jiang et al 2007 a to alleviate the water shortage in north china and b to improve the water ecological environment beijing has exceeded the planned water supply for three years and tianjin has exceeded the planned water supply for five consecutive years after years of operation the mrp has formed a relatively independent artificial water ecosystem under suitable temperature light and water flow conditions water ecological problems occur easily which causes many problems in operation management and water quality safety zhao and sun 2018 the operation data of the main canal in the mrp from 2015 to 2016 showed that the nutrients in the main canal remained relatively stable but the species quantity and biomass of algae responded quickly to changes in habitat and the algal community in some canal sections increased rapidly at a specific time tian 2019 there is a single dominant species in the algal community and the dominance and biomass remain high showing obvious abnormal algal proliferation characteristics shang et al 2017 moreover a large number of algae falling off into the channel blocked the grid of the water intake and quickly silted up in front of the gate which seriously threatened the water quality and water supply security of the canal wang et al 2020 zhu zhu et al 2019 conducted field investigations on algae growth in the mrp and found that the areas with strong algae growth concentrated on the bottom and side walls of the water conveyance canal between the canal head of taocha and lanhe aqueduct control gate the abnormal proliferation of algae not only directly affects the water quality of the upstream canal section but also poses a great threat to the water quality and operational safety of the downstream canal section therefore it is very important to take measures to prevent and control the abnormal proliferation of algae in the mrp the control of algae in water diversion projects mainly includes engineering measures and non engineering measures engineering measures mainly include the installation of algae removal equipment wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 removal of algae by air flotation devices huang et al 2015 chemical technology zinatloo ajabshir et al 2020a 2020b and biological technology ma 2018 zinatloo ajabshir et al 2020a 2020b the mrp has been committed to algae prevention and control since the onset of the water supply accordingly a series of engineering measures have been enforced and good results have been achieved for example ma 2018 designed a chain net algae removal mechanism for the mrp canal which can remove algae from the upper part of the water body chen and an 2018 shang et al 2020 developed a fully automatic algae blocking device based on a programmable logic controller system according to the structural characteristics of the main canal gate slot that realized the automatic interception and removal of algae although engineering measures can effectively remove algae in the canal there are problems such as a high risk of equipment installation and high cost wang 2010 zhang et al 2015 chemical residues formed by chemical technology may cause secondary pollution to the environment thus resulting in additional water pollution problems heidari asil et al 2020 zhu 2012 zinatloo ajabshir and salavati niasari 2019 biotechnology is relatively safe and environmentally friendly but it takes a long time to be implemented wang et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to adopt non engineering measures with low cost and simple operation schemes in the algae control of the mrp non engineering measures include ecological factors in the water diversion project scheduling scheme for ecological regulation tan et al 2008 in the effort to adjust the canal water level and flowrate modifications of the hydrodynamic habitat of algae growth and proliferation conditions and the destruction of the environment suitable for algae growth and proliferation so as to achieve the effects of prevention and control of algae proliferation zhao and sun 2018 zhang 2016 studied the effects of reservoir water level fluctuations on algae based on the environmental fluid dynamics code model the results showed that ① nutrient concentration decreased after the reservoir water level fluctuation which would restrict algae growth ② alternate rising and falling water levels would a destroy water stratification caused by stratified density flow b increase water exchange yang 2014 and c destroy algal reproduction and survival conditions wu et al 2012 according to field observations hai et al 2017 found that the rise and fall of operation water levels have profound influences on algae growth and canal eutrophication zhao and sun 2018 proposed three scheduling schemes for algae prevention and control of the mrp ① increase of the water disturbance and lowering of the water level based on artificial peaking and increase of the flow velocity to achieve the prevention and control of algae ② use of canal grooves to store large flow to flush the canal ③ discharge algae containing water bodies based on jacking water bodies with the use of a large flow filling canal and the use of recession sluice for drainage however zhao only proposed the scheduling scheme but he did not verify the feasibility of the scheme and provide a scheduling process it can be observed that the most direct non engineering measures for algae control can be achieved by regulating water levels at present the mrp has completed hardware equipment and facilities which are used to realize the automation of project operation and scheduling such as the gate remote control system and water regime real time monitoring system chen and an 2018 liu et al 2018a 2018b liu 2011 however the identification of methodologies to formulate the current or future gate regulation scheme according to the monitoring information is still determined by manual experience shang et al 2011 artificial experience regulation is a relatively stable regulation method used to ensure the safe operation of the project at this stage however there are some prominent problems such as low control precision low decision making efficiency large labor consumption and high regulation frequency wang et al 2017 which can no longer meet the urgent needs of intelligent adjustment of the mrp therefore it is urgent to introduce more advanced intelligent scheduling technology based on traditional scheduling methods since sutton developed reinforcement learning it has gradually attracted the attention of scholars worldwide kaelbling et al 2005 and the theory and application research of reinforcement learning have developed rapidly chen and dong 2008 van hasselt et al 2015 reinforcement learning algorithms have been extensively used in industrial manufacturing gao et al 2007 simulations fu et al 2014 robot control kober and peters 2013 optimization and scheduling ipek et al 2008 wei and zhao 2005 and in games tesauro 1994 wang and tuomas 2002 with the rapid development of human society in more complex real scene tasks deep learning can be used to automatically learn the abstract representation of large scale input data based on this representation self motivated reinforcement learning can be conducted to optimize problem solving strategies liu et al 2018a 2018b there are many system variables in the mrp scheduling process the relationship between time and space is complex and it is affected by many factors consequently the scheduling is very difficult reinforcement learning can effectively solve the sequence decision problem in the control system of high dimensional action space and high dimensional state space therefore in this paper the reinforcement learning model is coupled with the hydrodynamic model which can effectively solve the problem of understanding the high dimensional state space through the value based method and the strategy based method the approximate optimal action in the high dimensional action space is given systematically and efficiently and the ecological scheduling model of the mrp is constructed innovatively this can provide support for solving the problem of abnormal algae proliferation in the main canal by means of scheduling and can meet the needs of intelligent engineering of the middle route the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the general status of the project in the study area section 3 introduces the hydrodynamic model and reinforcement learning model used section 4 discusses the regulation results and the model robustness test of the ecological scheduling scheme section 5 presents concluding remarks 2 methodology 2 1 model principle the reinforcement learning method is a common method used to perform decision making for closed loop problems sutton and barto 2018 in recent years owing to the advent and influence of deep learning new reinforcement learning models have also been developed such as the deep q network mnih et al 2013 deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg timothy p lillicrap 2016 and a3c mnih et al 2016 the reinforcement learning model is usually divided into two component namely the environment e and agent π in this study a 1d hydrodynamic model of the series sluice group was used for the environment component and an actor critic using the kronecker factored trust region acktr model was used for the agent component 2 1 1 2 1 1 1d hydrodynamic model of series sluice group the basic governing equations of one dimensional flow in rivers and canals are saint venant s equations which were proposed by french scientist b saint venant in 1871 including continuity equation 1 and momentum equation 2 ren et al 2020 1 b z t q x q 2 q t x α q 2 a g a z x g a s f 0 where b is the surface width of the overflow section m z is the water level m t is time s q is the discharge m3 s x is the longitudinal distance of the canal along the mainstream direction m q is the side inflow m3 s α is the momentum correction coefficient a is the discharge area m2 g is the gravity acceleration m s2 sf is the friction ratio drop which can be expressed by the following formula 3 s f n c 2 q q a 2 r 4 3 where nc is manning s roughness coefficient of the water conveyance canal and r is the hydraulic radius m the model adopts the preissmann four point weighted implicit difference scheme with fast convergence and good stability to discretize saint venant s equations the continuity equation and discharge formula are selected as the governing equations of the inner boundary of the gate assuming that the sections before and after the gate are i and i 1 respectively and the flow loss at the gate is ignored the continuity equation of the position can be written as follows 4 q i q i 1 where qi and qi 1 represent the flows in m3 s in front of and behind the gate respectively therefore the discharge formula can be written as follows 5 q q i m e b g 2 g h m e b g 2 g z i z b where m is the comprehensive discharge coefficient e is the gate opening bg is the total overflow width of the gate h is the weir head zi is the water level of the control section in front of the gate and zb is the weir top elevation 2 1 2 acktr model the acktr model used in this study was developed from asynchronous advantage actor critic a3c wu et al 2017 generally the simulation and optimization process of the model is divided into two steps 1 at time t e updates its state st by accepting action at 1 given by agent π and gives the return rt of this action at 1 2 π updates its own strategy according to state st at time t and the reward rt of action at 1 given at the last time instant and gives the action at to e at this time our agents include the actor and critic networks the actor network is used to select the action at based on the state st while the critic network is used to evaluate the action at given by the actor network accordingly the actor network can conduct the subsequent time of action according to the critic s score in the solution of the model the parameters of the model are recorded as θ the objective function of the model is denoted as j θ and the objective of the model is argmin θ j θ the acktr algorithm uses the fisher information matrix grosse and martens 2016 t 2000 to solve θ the fisher information matrix of the actor network is as follows 6 f a e p τ θ log π a t s t θ log π a t s t fa is the fisher information matrix of the actor network p τ is the distribution of sample trajectories and π a t s t is the probability that the agent executes action at when the state of time t is the st the fisher information matrix of the critic network is as follows 7 f c e p τ log p a t v t s t log p a t v t s t fc is the fisher information matrix of the critic network and vt is the output of the critic network at time t the two networks are then updated with the following formula 8 v e c δ w f l 1 v e c w j v e c a 1 w j s 1 where w r c ot c i is the weight parameter of the l layer of the neural network a r c in is the input of the l layer of the neural network a e a a s r c out is the output of the l layer of the neural network and s e s l s l t is the likelihood function of the neural network fitting 2 1 3 coupled model in this study through communication between e and π the reinforcement learning model was coupled with the 1d hydrodynamic model of the series sluice group and the ecological scheduling model for prevention and control of algal proliferation in the mrp was constructed fig 1 the process of the ecological scheduling model can be divided into four stages 1 the discharge and water level information of the current period is calculated using the hydrodynamic model and saved in the hydrodynamic model for the next call 2 this information is input into the output converter and then compared with the ecological operation scheme via a comparison of the information of the target water level and the target discharge the return value of the period is calculated and the discharge and water level information is compiled into the state list that can be processed by the agent 3 the agent receives the state and return values which are input into the critic module and the intermediate variable td error is calculated the error and state value are input into the actor module together and the action information of the next period is obtained through calculation 4 the action information is input using the input converter and transformed into the list of gate opening information that can be processed by hydraulic model following which it is input into hydraulic model 2 2 principles and strategies of ecological regulation in this study the water level was considered as the key factor of algae control and the ecological regulation process was divided into five stages the initial water level of the stable operation stage precipitation level process ecological water level of the stable operation stage water level rising process and the original water level stable operation stage fig 2 based on the excellent performance of the reinforcement learning model in parameter regulation the demand scheduling scheme was generated by coupling the reinforcement learning model and hydrodynamic model to ensure the smooth implementation of the ecological scheduling process the following principles should be followed 1 safe operation principle the rate of the water level change in each stage should be less than 0 15 m h and 0 30 m 24 h 2 principle of reducing influence to achieve the goal of regulating and controlling a small amount of canal ecological impact the regulation and control of a small amount of ecological pool is achieved as far as possible fig 2 shows the process of modeling strategy for ecological regulation according to the requirements of ecological regulation objectives the hydrodynamic model and reinforcement learning model are driven to train the target the reinforcement learning model seeks the regulation strategy to meet the requirements of the goal based on the regulation target search the control diagram is shown in fig 3 3 application and discussion 3 1 experimental area description since the water supply of the mrp was officially opened on december 12 2014 the overall operation has been smooth and it has changed considerably the water supply pattern in the water receiving area to date more than 67 million people have benefited from the entire line the mrp has the following basic characteristics zheng 2018 ① long water diversion routes the total length of the main canal is 1432 km including 1277 km of main canal and 155 km of tianjin branch zheng et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 2018 ② existence of numerous buildings there are more than 2000 buildings of various types in the project including 63 gates 1 pump station 98 water diversion outlets and 54 outlet sluices tang et al 2018 zhao and sun 2018 ③ harsh control conditions the operation mode is the normal water level in front of the gate and there is no online regulating reservoir ④ high water quality requirements the water quality of the water supply should meet the class ii standard of china s surface water environmental quality standard gb3838 2002 wang and chen 2015 these characteristics make the operation and management of the main canal in the mrp extremely difficult as shown in fig 4 the algae growing area spans from the diaohe s aqueduct gate no g2 to the yinghe s inverted siphon gate no g17 in total there are 15 gates 18 water outlets and 13 recession sluices along the line to be consistent with the actual project the entire coding sequence of the central line project is still adopted for the various building numbers in this study see tables 1 and 2 for basic information on the gate and water conveyance canal respectively 3 2 ecological regulation scheme 3 2 1 scheme setting in the actual operation of the mrp the water level and flow fluctuate slightly owing to the gate regulation and external factors to be consistent with the actual control process the upstream and downstream boundary conditions of the hydrodynamic model are randomly disturbed within the predetermined design range the disturbance of the upstream water level boundary is a uniformly distributed random number 0 02 0 02 m in addition the downstream flow boundary disturbance is truncated to 2 2 m3 s and obeys a normal distribution with a mean value of zero and standard deviation of 0 3 the boundary conditions of the hydrodynamic model are set as shown in fig 5 to meet the demand of algae control in the main canal of the mrp g5 was selected as the target gate in this study the ecological regulation scheme is shown in table 3 and fig 7 a 3 2 2 results of ecological regulation 1 evaluation of regulation effects fig 6 shows the changes in the reward value of the regulation model during the ecological regulation process it can be observed from the figure that the three plans c1 c2 and c3 can obtain a higher positive reward value after a certain round of training approximately 3000 rounds thus indicating that the three plans can be successfully controlled however c4 has always been unable to obtain a positive reward value as the number of training rounds increases the reward value has no obvious increasing trend thus indicating that the control of scheme c4 has failed at the same time it can be observed from the successfully controlled plans c1 c2 and c3 in fig 6 that as the water level variation increases there is no obvious change in the rounds when the positive reward value is first obtained this shows that when the regulation is successful the water level variation that drives the regulation model is not necessarily related to the training round to obtain a positive reward value table 4 shows the error analysis between the calculated and the target values it can be observed that the average absolute error mae between the calculated and the target values of the target gate is approximately 0 10 m and the mean square error mse is less than 0 02 m thus indicating that the control model is reliable 2 analysis of the regulatory results fig 7 b shows the water level change process of ecological regulation based on the reinforcement learning model and the water level variation amplitude after the regulation of the schemes c1 c2 and c3 includes five complete stages however when scheme c4 is in the later stage of the third stage regulation fails and there is no subsequent stage fig 7 c shows that in the regulation process obtained by the four schemes the deviation between the water level and the target water level is less than 0 2 m table 5 shows the actual regulation time and amplitude of the water level at each stage of the regulation model the variation amplitude of the water level every 1 h and the variation amplitude of the continuous 24 h water level based on the listings and findings in table 3 table 5 fig 7 a and fig 7 b it can be inferred that 1 in c1 c2 and c3 the five control stages are distinct and can be maintained for a period of time among them the durations of c1 s3 c2 s3 and c3 s3 are slightly different from the expected setting 72 h although the remaining four stages can be completed there is a certain difference from the expected setting in addition during the falling and rising stages of the water level the rate of change of the water level meets the safety principles of ecological regulation 2 c4 can be successfully controlled in s1 s2 and s3 but in the s3 the canal pond where the target control gate is located has been at a lower operating water level for a long time correspondingly it can be observed from fig 8 a that the water level drops when it is smaller c1 c2 there are minor differences in the opening variation of the target gate of each control stage and the gate flow of the target gate fluctuates slightly fig 8 b when the target gate water level drops to 0 8 m c3 s3 to meet the water level fall requirements in front of the target gate the gate opening is larger at this time the gate flow is also greatly increased in c3 s2 c3 s3 and c3 s4 in c4 s2 the target gate opening exceeds 6510 mm and the water depth in front of the target control gate is 6 51 m if the control target is achieved and the target water level is maintained for a period of time a larger gate opening is required however at this time the gate opening has exceeded the water depth in front of the gate and the control gate no longer plays a role in the overall control thus the model control thus fails 3 c1 s2 c2 s2 and c3 s2 water level changes are 0 38 m 0 52 m and 0 78 m while the c1 s4 c2 s4 and c3 s4 water level changes are 0 35 m 0 36 mm and 0 65 m respectively specifically based on the regulation applied in the model the water level can basically fall to the set ecological water level target and when the water level rises to the state before the regulation the water levels in the c1 s5 and c1 s1 are basically the same but the c2 and c3 water levels decline considerably and the water levels in the c2 s5 and c3 s5 stages are less than the water levels of c2 s1 and c3 s1 the changes in the volume of water in each canal pool during the adjustment process are shown in fig 9 c1 c2 c3 and c4 all show that the volume of the water in the canal pool before the target gate decreases and the water in the canal pool behind the target gate to meet the needs of ecological regulation of the water level gate regulation is needed to distribute the water in the canal pool ahead of the target gate to the latter canal pool because the ecological regulation water level is low in c4 the water level in front of the gate needs to be adjusted the decline is relatively large and a large amount of water in the canal pond needs to be distributed to the downstream canal pond thus causing the water volume in the downstream canal pond to exceed the limit and the water level to exceed the set safe range therefore the control of c4 failed in the c4 s3 stage 3 3 ecological regulation model and scheme optimization regarding the control results the decline patterns of the water levels in the c1 s2 c2 s2 and c3 s2 are inconsistent with the water level rise patterns in the c1 s4 c2 s4 and c3 s4 stages the differences are 0 03 m 0 16 m and 0 13 m respectively this results in a water level that does not meet the expectations after the completion of the control to set the target water level we revised the model and reset the plan 3 3 1 scheme settings the boundary conditions and other parameters of the hydrodynamic model are consistent with those in section 3 2 1 the ecological control scheme is set as shown in table 6 and fig 11 d 3 3 2 ecological regulation outcomes 1 evaluation of regulation effects fig 10 shows the change in the reward value of the regulation model during the ecological regulation process after the model and plan are optimized it can be observed from the figure that the change rule of the reward value is basically the same as that in fig 6 table 7 shows the error analysis between the calculated value of the optimized control model and the target value it can be observed that the mae between the calculated value of the target gate and the target value is approximately 0 11 m furthermore the mse within 0 02 m indicates that the model control effect is good and the control model is reliable 2 analysis of the regulatory results the change process of the ecological control water level generated by the optimized control model is shown in fig 11 e it can be observed from the figure that the regulation process of the schemes c5 c6 c7 and c8 is basically consistent with the results obtained from the optimized control model as shown in fig 7 b it can be observed from fig 11 f that the deviation between the water level and target water level is less than 0 2 m during the regulation process obtained by the four optimized ecological control schemes table 8 shows the actual control time and water level change amplitude in each stage of the optimized control model the water level change amplitude per hour and the continuous 24 h water level amplitude comparing table 6 table 8 fig 11 d and e it is clear that c5 c6 and c7 are successfully regulated the water level changes in c5 s2 c6 s2 and c7 s2 are 0 29 m 0 53 m and 0 82 m while in c5 s4 c6 s4 and c7 s4 the water level rises by 0 51 m 0 55 m and 0 86 m after the model and scheme are optimized the water level can basically drop to the set ecological water level target and the water level rises to the state before regulation the difference between the water levels of c5 c6 and c7 are 0 22 m 0 02 m and 0 04 m respectively pre and post optimization comparisons indicate that when the water level target decreases by 0 3 m the actual rise of the water level in the fourth stage is consistent with the set target rise through the control model when the water level target drops by more than 0 3 m the actual increase in the water level in the fourth stage is less than the set target increase therefore when the ecological regulation water level decline demand is greater than 0 3 m to restore the final water level to the preregulation water level the water level recovery target needs to be appropriately increased 4 discussion 4 1 model robustness testing the model described in this study was based on the simulation results of the hydraulic model used to achieve the regulation goal however owing to the difference between the hydraulic model and reality observation error and other factors there is an error ε between the hydraulic simulation results and the observation results in this section we will build a noise model to illustrate how much the error ε should be limited under different guarantee rate requirements by adding noise n to the output state s of environment e in the original model m we established a noise model mn as shown in fig 12 the new noise marker n marker component in the mn is responsible for receiving the output state s of the hydraulic model thus we artificially added a normally distributed noise n with a mean value of zero and a standard deviation of μ to the water level in front and behind the gates it should be noted that the noise added to the water level in front and behind each gate was the same after the adjustment of parameter μ of the noise model repeated tests with the trained agents can obtain the success rate of regulation at different degrees of interference fig 13 shows the control success rate chart for each working condition when the standard deviation μ of the noise is different c4 and c8 cannot be successfully controlled without noise so this section does not discuss the above working conditions as shown in fig 13 the increase in the standard deviation of the noise indicates that the success rate of regulation and control of each working condition presents a downward trend according to this trend the standard deviation limits of error ε at different guarantee rate requirements can be given when an 80 success rate is needed the standard deviation of the errors between the hydraulic simulation results of c3 c5 c6 and c7 and the actual observation results should be controlled within 0 05 m while c1 and c2 should be controlled within 0 08 m overall the improved scheme improves the regulation outcome of the model and does not affect the robustness of the model 4 2 difference analysis in this paper the reinforcement learning model was coupled with the 1d hydrodynamic model of the series sluice group to construct the ecological scheduling model for prevention and control of algal proliferation in the mrp the observed differences between this model and other sluice pump group scheduling models are as follows 1 adaptive parameter disturbance self learning action adjustment when studying the regulation of the sluice and dam group zuo and li 2013 constructed the regulation model of the sluice and dam group on the basis of the simulation optimization method whereby the sluice and dam group can be dynamically regulated according to the specific conditions however the use of the model will be limited when dealing with problems of uncertainty mo 2014 constructed the optimization model of the sluice pump hydrodynamic regulation of the river network on the basis of the multi objective optimization method which can be applied to the sluice and dam group regulation the optimal control scheme under specific objectives is given but each objective restricts the other through decision variables which renders the topological structure of the weighted objective function very complex in this study the ecological scheduling model based on reinforcement learning method does not need a large number of labeled data sets and it obtains training samples through continuous interactions between the agent and environment whereby a large amount of time is saved in terms of obtaining labeled samples moreover this approach is closer to the human learning process the model can realize self learning of a high dimensional mapping relationship from state to action and can deal with the dynamic adjustment of water level required by ecological scheduling so it possesses strong inclusiveness 2 wide control range and high control precision when zhang 2016 studied the effect of water level dynamic adjustment on algae the simulation period was long from wet season to dry season the water level changed slowly the flow rate was approximately 0 2 m d and the water level difference was about 0 4 m and there was no control structure in the model li 2010 studied the effect of water level dynamic decline on algae growth through experiments but the water level dynamic decline was slow 0 05 m d and there were no water level dynamics in the experiment during the recovery process however the model constructed in this study can realize the desired reciprocating adjustment of the channel water level in the process of large amplitude 0 8 m dynamic decline and stability dynamic rise the water level decline or rise speed is approximately 0 2 m d and the low water level is maintained stably for more than 72 h whereby the precise ecological regulation for the middle line project water level reciprocating adjustment can be met 5 conclusion to solve the problem concerning abnormal algal proliferation through convenient and low cost scheduling methods this study coupled the reinforcement learning model with the 1d hydrodynamic model of the series sluice group to establish an ecological scheduling model for prevention and control of algal proliferation in the mrp through an ecological scheduling strategy and by exploitation of the excellent performance of the reinforcement learning model in parameter regulation the model was trained and optimized according to the actual and hydrodynamic simulation data and the ecological scheduling scheme was generated to solve the aforementioned problem in this manner the needs for intelligent scheduling of the mrp were met the conclusions drawn from the study are as follows 1 the results showed that the reinforcement learning model is feasible for ecological regulation of the mrp and the scheduling model successfully meets the water level safety requirements 2 the model can achieve the reciprocating adjustment of the canal water level in the process of decline stability rise within 0 8 m and it can maintain the low water level stably for more than 72 h 3 in the process of ecological scheduling the maximum drawdown of water level satisfying the safety regulation and control constraints of the mrp is 1 0 m 4 when the ecological scheduling water level drop was greater than 0 3 m it was more difficult to restore the initial water level because of which the water level rise range should be greater than the decrease range 5 the constructed model shows high robustness when the observation error level was less than 0 08 m the success rate of the model could still exceed 80 the ecological scheduling scheme generated by the model can be used to destroy the algal habitat conditions through hydrodynamic dynamic control and this can provide decisional support for the prevention and control of abnormal algal proliferation in the mrp moreover the model is suitable for application in various series sluice systems credit

4698,the middle route of the south to north water diversion project mrp effectively alleviates the problem of serious shortage of water resources in north china however owing to the long term operation of this project abnormal algal proliferation has occurred in the upper reaches of the main canal and the water diversion outlet is easily blocked by the large colonies of algae falling into the canal which has seriously threatened the water quality and water supply safety of the canal in light of this issue this study coupled the reinforcement learning model with the one dimensional hydrodynamic model of the series sluice group to build an ecological scheduling model for prevention and control of algal proliferation in the mrp the model was applied to the canal section approximately 300 km long from no g2 to no g17 where in algae grows easily the results show that 1 the model can achieve the desired reciprocating adjustment of the canal water level in the process of decline stability rise within 0 8 m and stably maintain the low water level for more than 72 h 2 during the process of ecological scheduling the maximum drawdown of water level satisfying the safety regulation and control constraints of the mrp is 1 0 m 3 for an ecological regulation water level drop greater than 0 3 m it is more difficult to restore the initial water level and the water level rise range should therefore be greater than the decrease range 4 the constructed model exhibits high robustness even for an observation error level less than 0 08 m the success rate of the model can still exceed 80 the ecological scheduling scheme generated by the model can be used to destroy the algal habitat conditions through hydrodynamic dynamic regulation whereby decisional support can be provided for the prevention and control of abnormal proliferation of algae in the main canal keywords middle route south to north water diversion project abnormal algae proliferation reinforcement learning model ecological scheduling model 1 introduction water is an important basic resource for human survival socio economic development and ecological environment stability wang and jia 2016 however owing to the impact of population explosion rapid economic development and climatic change the problem of water shortage caused by the uneven spatial and temporal distributions of water resources has become increasingly prominent and the sustainable socio economic development of many countries and regions is restricted shiklomanov and rodda 2004 vörösmarty et al 2010 it is an important means to alleviate the water shortage crisis in some areas by constructing water diversion projects from places with abundant water resources to places with water shortages qiao and yang 2010 at present more than 350 long distance water diversion projects have been completed in at least 39 countries framji 1994 in view of the shortage and uneven distribution of water resources china has built a series of water diversion projects to realize the spatially optimal allocation of water resources zhang et al 2019 among them the middle route of south to north water diversion project mrp with strategic significance was built jiang et al 2007 a to alleviate the water shortage in north china and b to improve the water ecological environment beijing has exceeded the planned water supply for three years and tianjin has exceeded the planned water supply for five consecutive years after years of operation the mrp has formed a relatively independent artificial water ecosystem under suitable temperature light and water flow conditions water ecological problems occur easily which causes many problems in operation management and water quality safety zhao and sun 2018 the operation data of the main canal in the mrp from 2015 to 2016 showed that the nutrients in the main canal remained relatively stable but the species quantity and biomass of algae responded quickly to changes in habitat and the algal community in some canal sections increased rapidly at a specific time tian 2019 there is a single dominant species in the algal community and the dominance and biomass remain high showing obvious abnormal algal proliferation characteristics shang et al 2017 moreover a large number of algae falling off into the channel blocked the grid of the water intake and quickly silted up in front of the gate which seriously threatened the water quality and water supply security of the canal wang et al 2020 zhu zhu et al 2019 conducted field investigations on algae growth in the mrp and found that the areas with strong algae growth concentrated on the bottom and side walls of the water conveyance canal between the canal head of taocha and lanhe aqueduct control gate the abnormal proliferation of algae not only directly affects the water quality of the upstream canal section but also poses a great threat to the water quality and operational safety of the downstream canal section therefore it is very important to take measures to prevent and control the abnormal proliferation of algae in the mrp the control of algae in water diversion projects mainly includes engineering measures and non engineering measures engineering measures mainly include the installation of algae removal equipment wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 removal of algae by air flotation devices huang et al 2015 chemical technology zinatloo ajabshir et al 2020a 2020b and biological technology ma 2018 zinatloo ajabshir et al 2020a 2020b the mrp has been committed to algae prevention and control since the onset of the water supply accordingly a series of engineering measures have been enforced and good results have been achieved for example ma 2018 designed a chain net algae removal mechanism for the mrp canal which can remove algae from the upper part of the water body chen and an 2018 shang et al 2020 developed a fully automatic algae blocking device based on a programmable logic controller system according to the structural characteristics of the main canal gate slot that realized the automatic interception and removal of algae although engineering measures can effectively remove algae in the canal there are problems such as a high risk of equipment installation and high cost wang 2010 zhang et al 2015 chemical residues formed by chemical technology may cause secondary pollution to the environment thus resulting in additional water pollution problems heidari asil et al 2020 zhu 2012 zinatloo ajabshir and salavati niasari 2019 biotechnology is relatively safe and environmentally friendly but it takes a long time to be implemented wang et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to adopt non engineering measures with low cost and simple operation schemes in the algae control of the mrp non engineering measures include ecological factors in the water diversion project scheduling scheme for ecological regulation tan et al 2008 in the effort to adjust the canal water level and flowrate modifications of the hydrodynamic habitat of algae growth and proliferation conditions and the destruction of the environment suitable for algae growth and proliferation so as to achieve the effects of prevention and control of algae proliferation zhao and sun 2018 zhang 2016 studied the effects of reservoir water level fluctuations on algae based on the environmental fluid dynamics code model the results showed that ① nutrient concentration decreased after the reservoir water level fluctuation which would restrict algae growth ② alternate rising and falling water levels would a destroy water stratification caused by stratified density flow b increase water exchange yang 2014 and c destroy algal reproduction and survival conditions wu et al 2012 according to field observations hai et al 2017 found that the rise and fall of operation water levels have profound influences on algae growth and canal eutrophication zhao and sun 2018 proposed three scheduling schemes for algae prevention and control of the mrp ① increase of the water disturbance and lowering of the water level based on artificial peaking and increase of the flow velocity to achieve the prevention and control of algae ② use of canal grooves to store large flow to flush the canal ③ discharge algae containing water bodies based on jacking water bodies with the use of a large flow filling canal and the use of recession sluice for drainage however zhao only proposed the scheduling scheme but he did not verify the feasibility of the scheme and provide a scheduling process it can be observed that the most direct non engineering measures for algae control can be achieved by regulating water levels at present the mrp has completed hardware equipment and facilities which are used to realize the automation of project operation and scheduling such as the gate remote control system and water regime real time monitoring system chen and an 2018 liu et al 2018a 2018b liu 2011 however the identification of methodologies to formulate the current or future gate regulation scheme according to the monitoring information is still determined by manual experience shang et al 2011 artificial experience regulation is a relatively stable regulation method used to ensure the safe operation of the project at this stage however there are some prominent problems such as low control precision low decision making efficiency large labor consumption and high regulation frequency wang et al 2017 which can no longer meet the urgent needs of intelligent adjustment of the mrp therefore it is urgent to introduce more advanced intelligent scheduling technology based on traditional scheduling methods since sutton developed reinforcement learning it has gradually attracted the attention of scholars worldwide kaelbling et al 2005 and the theory and application research of reinforcement learning have developed rapidly chen and dong 2008 van hasselt et al 2015 reinforcement learning algorithms have been extensively used in industrial manufacturing gao et al 2007 simulations fu et al 2014 robot control kober and peters 2013 optimization and scheduling ipek et al 2008 wei and zhao 2005 and in games tesauro 1994 wang and tuomas 2002 with the rapid development of human society in more complex real scene tasks deep learning can be used to automatically learn the abstract representation of large scale input data based on this representation self motivated reinforcement learning can be conducted to optimize problem solving strategies liu et al 2018a 2018b there are many system variables in the mrp scheduling process the relationship between time and space is complex and it is affected by many factors consequently the scheduling is very difficult reinforcement learning can effectively solve the sequence decision problem in the control system of high dimensional action space and high dimensional state space therefore in this paper the reinforcement learning model is coupled with the hydrodynamic model which can effectively solve the problem of understanding the high dimensional state space through the value based method and the strategy based method the approximate optimal action in the high dimensional action space is given systematically and efficiently and the ecological scheduling model of the mrp is constructed innovatively this can provide support for solving the problem of abnormal algae proliferation in the main canal by means of scheduling and can meet the needs of intelligent engineering of the middle route the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the general status of the project in the study area section 3 introduces the hydrodynamic model and reinforcement learning model used section 4 discusses the regulation results and the model robustness test of the ecological scheduling scheme section 5 presents concluding remarks 2 methodology 2 1 model principle the reinforcement learning method is a common method used to perform decision making for closed loop problems sutton and barto 2018 in recent years owing to the advent and influence of deep learning new reinforcement learning models have also been developed such as the deep q network mnih et al 2013 deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg timothy p lillicrap 2016 and a3c mnih et al 2016 the reinforcement learning model is usually divided into two component namely the environment e and agent π in this study a 1d hydrodynamic model of the series sluice group was used for the environment component and an actor critic using the kronecker factored trust region acktr model was used for the agent component 2 1 1 2 1 1 1d hydrodynamic model of series sluice group the basic governing equations of one dimensional flow in rivers and canals are saint venant s equations which were proposed by french scientist b saint venant in 1871 including continuity equation 1 and momentum equation 2 ren et al 2020 1 b z t q x q 2 q t x α q 2 a g a z x g a s f 0 where b is the surface width of the overflow section m z is the water level m t is time s q is the discharge m3 s x is the longitudinal distance of the canal along the mainstream direction m q is the side inflow m3 s α is the momentum correction coefficient a is the discharge area m2 g is the gravity acceleration m s2 sf is the friction ratio drop which can be expressed by the following formula 3 s f n c 2 q q a 2 r 4 3 where nc is manning s roughness coefficient of the water conveyance canal and r is the hydraulic radius m the model adopts the preissmann four point weighted implicit difference scheme with fast convergence and good stability to discretize saint venant s equations the continuity equation and discharge formula are selected as the governing equations of the inner boundary of the gate assuming that the sections before and after the gate are i and i 1 respectively and the flow loss at the gate is ignored the continuity equation of the position can be written as follows 4 q i q i 1 where qi and qi 1 represent the flows in m3 s in front of and behind the gate respectively therefore the discharge formula can be written as follows 5 q q i m e b g 2 g h m e b g 2 g z i z b where m is the comprehensive discharge coefficient e is the gate opening bg is the total overflow width of the gate h is the weir head zi is the water level of the control section in front of the gate and zb is the weir top elevation 2 1 2 acktr model the acktr model used in this study was developed from asynchronous advantage actor critic a3c wu et al 2017 generally the simulation and optimization process of the model is divided into two steps 1 at time t e updates its state st by accepting action at 1 given by agent π and gives the return rt of this action at 1 2 π updates its own strategy according to state st at time t and the reward rt of action at 1 given at the last time instant and gives the action at to e at this time our agents include the actor and critic networks the actor network is used to select the action at based on the state st while the critic network is used to evaluate the action at given by the actor network accordingly the actor network can conduct the subsequent time of action according to the critic s score in the solution of the model the parameters of the model are recorded as θ the objective function of the model is denoted as j θ and the objective of the model is argmin θ j θ the acktr algorithm uses the fisher information matrix grosse and martens 2016 t 2000 to solve θ the fisher information matrix of the actor network is as follows 6 f a e p τ θ log π a t s t θ log π a t s t fa is the fisher information matrix of the actor network p τ is the distribution of sample trajectories and π a t s t is the probability that the agent executes action at when the state of time t is the st the fisher information matrix of the critic network is as follows 7 f c e p τ log p a t v t s t log p a t v t s t fc is the fisher information matrix of the critic network and vt is the output of the critic network at time t the two networks are then updated with the following formula 8 v e c δ w f l 1 v e c w j v e c a 1 w j s 1 where w r c ot c i is the weight parameter of the l layer of the neural network a r c in is the input of the l layer of the neural network a e a a s r c out is the output of the l layer of the neural network and s e s l s l t is the likelihood function of the neural network fitting 2 1 3 coupled model in this study through communication between e and π the reinforcement learning model was coupled with the 1d hydrodynamic model of the series sluice group and the ecological scheduling model for prevention and control of algal proliferation in the mrp was constructed fig 1 the process of the ecological scheduling model can be divided into four stages 1 the discharge and water level information of the current period is calculated using the hydrodynamic model and saved in the hydrodynamic model for the next call 2 this information is input into the output converter and then compared with the ecological operation scheme via a comparison of the information of the target water level and the target discharge the return value of the period is calculated and the discharge and water level information is compiled into the state list that can be processed by the agent 3 the agent receives the state and return values which are input into the critic module and the intermediate variable td error is calculated the error and state value are input into the actor module together and the action information of the next period is obtained through calculation 4 the action information is input using the input converter and transformed into the list of gate opening information that can be processed by hydraulic model following which it is input into hydraulic model 2 2 principles and strategies of ecological regulation in this study the water level was considered as the key factor of algae control and the ecological regulation process was divided into five stages the initial water level of the stable operation stage precipitation level process ecological water level of the stable operation stage water level rising process and the original water level stable operation stage fig 2 based on the excellent performance of the reinforcement learning model in parameter regulation the demand scheduling scheme was generated by coupling the reinforcement learning model and hydrodynamic model to ensure the smooth implementation of the ecological scheduling process the following principles should be followed 1 safe operation principle the rate of the water level change in each stage should be less than 0 15 m h and 0 30 m 24 h 2 principle of reducing influence to achieve the goal of regulating and controlling a small amount of canal ecological impact the regulation and control of a small amount of ecological pool is achieved as far as possible fig 2 shows the process of modeling strategy for ecological regulation according to the requirements of ecological regulation objectives the hydrodynamic model and reinforcement learning model are driven to train the target the reinforcement learning model seeks the regulation strategy to meet the requirements of the goal based on the regulation target search the control diagram is shown in fig 3 3 application and discussion 3 1 experimental area description since the water supply of the mrp was officially opened on december 12 2014 the overall operation has been smooth and it has changed considerably the water supply pattern in the water receiving area to date more than 67 million people have benefited from the entire line the mrp has the following basic characteristics zheng 2018 ① long water diversion routes the total length of the main canal is 1432 km including 1277 km of main canal and 155 km of tianjin branch zheng et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 2018 ② existence of numerous buildings there are more than 2000 buildings of various types in the project including 63 gates 1 pump station 98 water diversion outlets and 54 outlet sluices tang et al 2018 zhao and sun 2018 ③ harsh control conditions the operation mode is the normal water level in front of the gate and there is no online regulating reservoir ④ high water quality requirements the water quality of the water supply should meet the class ii standard of china s surface water environmental quality standard gb3838 2002 wang and chen 2015 these characteristics make the operation and management of the main canal in the mrp extremely difficult as shown in fig 4 the algae growing area spans from the diaohe s aqueduct gate no g2 to the yinghe s inverted siphon gate no g17 in total there are 15 gates 18 water outlets and 13 recession sluices along the line to be consistent with the actual project the entire coding sequence of the central line project is still adopted for the various building numbers in this study see tables 1 and 2 for basic information on the gate and water conveyance canal respectively 3 2 ecological regulation scheme 3 2 1 scheme setting in the actual operation of the mrp the water level and flow fluctuate slightly owing to the gate regulation and external factors to be consistent with the actual control process the upstream and downstream boundary conditions of the hydrodynamic model are randomly disturbed within the predetermined design range the disturbance of the upstream water level boundary is a uniformly distributed random number 0 02 0 02 m in addition the downstream flow boundary disturbance is truncated to 2 2 m3 s and obeys a normal distribution with a mean value of zero and standard deviation of 0 3 the boundary conditions of the hydrodynamic model are set as shown in fig 5 to meet the demand of algae control in the main canal of the mrp g5 was selected as the target gate in this study the ecological regulation scheme is shown in table 3 and fig 7 a 3 2 2 results of ecological regulation 1 evaluation of regulation effects fig 6 shows the changes in the reward value of the regulation model during the ecological regulation process it can be observed from the figure that the three plans c1 c2 and c3 can obtain a higher positive reward value after a certain round of training approximately 3000 rounds thus indicating that the three plans can be successfully controlled however c4 has always been unable to obtain a positive reward value as the number of training rounds increases the reward value has no obvious increasing trend thus indicating that the control of scheme c4 has failed at the same time it can be observed from the successfully controlled plans c1 c2 and c3 in fig 6 that as the water level variation increases there is no obvious change in the rounds when the positive reward value is first obtained this shows that when the regulation is successful the water level variation that drives the regulation model is not necessarily related to the training round to obtain a positive reward value table 4 shows the error analysis between the calculated and the target values it can be observed that the average absolute error mae between the calculated and the target values of the target gate is approximately 0 10 m and the mean square error mse is less than 0 02 m thus indicating that the control model is reliable 2 analysis of the regulatory results fig 7 b shows the water level change process of ecological regulation based on the reinforcement learning model and the water level variation amplitude after the regulation of the schemes c1 c2 and c3 includes five complete stages however when scheme c4 is in the later stage of the third stage regulation fails and there is no subsequent stage fig 7 c shows that in the regulation process obtained by the four schemes the deviation between the water level and the target water level is less than 0 2 m table 5 shows the actual regulation time and amplitude of the water level at each stage of the regulation model the variation amplitude of the water level every 1 h and the variation amplitude of the continuous 24 h water level based on the listings and findings in table 3 table 5 fig 7 a and fig 7 b it can be inferred that 1 in c1 c2 and c3 the five control stages are distinct and can be maintained for a period of time among them the durations of c1 s3 c2 s3 and c3 s3 are slightly different from the expected setting 72 h although the remaining four stages can be completed there is a certain difference from the expected setting in addition during the falling and rising stages of the water level the rate of change of the water level meets the safety principles of ecological regulation 2 c4 can be successfully controlled in s1 s2 and s3 but in the s3 the canal pond where the target control gate is located has been at a lower operating water level for a long time correspondingly it can be observed from fig 8 a that the water level drops when it is smaller c1 c2 there are minor differences in the opening variation of the target gate of each control stage and the gate flow of the target gate fluctuates slightly fig 8 b when the target gate water level drops to 0 8 m c3 s3 to meet the water level fall requirements in front of the target gate the gate opening is larger at this time the gate flow is also greatly increased in c3 s2 c3 s3 and c3 s4 in c4 s2 the target gate opening exceeds 6510 mm and the water depth in front of the target control gate is 6 51 m if the control target is achieved and the target water level is maintained for a period of time a larger gate opening is required however at this time the gate opening has exceeded the water depth in front of the gate and the control gate no longer plays a role in the overall control thus the model control thus fails 3 c1 s2 c2 s2 and c3 s2 water level changes are 0 38 m 0 52 m and 0 78 m while the c1 s4 c2 s4 and c3 s4 water level changes are 0 35 m 0 36 mm and 0 65 m respectively specifically based on the regulation applied in the model the water level can basically fall to the set ecological water level target and when the water level rises to the state before the regulation the water levels in the c1 s5 and c1 s1 are basically the same but the c2 and c3 water levels decline considerably and the water levels in the c2 s5 and c3 s5 stages are less than the water levels of c2 s1 and c3 s1 the changes in the volume of water in each canal pool during the adjustment process are shown in fig 9 c1 c2 c3 and c4 all show that the volume of the water in the canal pool before the target gate decreases and the water in the canal pool behind the target gate to meet the needs of ecological regulation of the water level gate regulation is needed to distribute the water in the canal pool ahead of the target gate to the latter canal pool because the ecological regulation water level is low in c4 the water level in front of the gate needs to be adjusted the decline is relatively large and a large amount of water in the canal pond needs to be distributed to the downstream canal pond thus causing the water volume in the downstream canal pond to exceed the limit and the water level to exceed the set safe range therefore the control of c4 failed in the c4 s3 stage 3 3 ecological regulation model and scheme optimization regarding the control results the decline patterns of the water levels in the c1 s2 c2 s2 and c3 s2 are inconsistent with the water level rise patterns in the c1 s4 c2 s4 and c3 s4 stages the differences are 0 03 m 0 16 m and 0 13 m respectively this results in a water level that does not meet the expectations after the completion of the control to set the target water level we revised the model and reset the plan 3 3 1 scheme settings the boundary conditions and other parameters of the hydrodynamic model are consistent with those in section 3 2 1 the ecological control scheme is set as shown in table 6 and fig 11 d 3 3 2 ecological regulation outcomes 1 evaluation of regulation effects fig 10 shows the change in the reward value of the regulation model during the ecological regulation process after the model and plan are optimized it can be observed from the figure that the change rule of the reward value is basically the same as that in fig 6 table 7 shows the error analysis between the calculated value of the optimized control model and the target value it can be observed that the mae between the calculated value of the target gate and the target value is approximately 0 11 m furthermore the mse within 0 02 m indicates that the model control effect is good and the control model is reliable 2 analysis of the regulatory results the change process of the ecological control water level generated by the optimized control model is shown in fig 11 e it can be observed from the figure that the regulation process of the schemes c5 c6 c7 and c8 is basically consistent with the results obtained from the optimized control model as shown in fig 7 b it can be observed from fig 11 f that the deviation between the water level and target water level is less than 0 2 m during the regulation process obtained by the four optimized ecological control schemes table 8 shows the actual control time and water level change amplitude in each stage of the optimized control model the water level change amplitude per hour and the continuous 24 h water level amplitude comparing table 6 table 8 fig 11 d and e it is clear that c5 c6 and c7 are successfully regulated the water level changes in c5 s2 c6 s2 and c7 s2 are 0 29 m 0 53 m and 0 82 m while in c5 s4 c6 s4 and c7 s4 the water level rises by 0 51 m 0 55 m and 0 86 m after the model and scheme are optimized the water level can basically drop to the set ecological water level target and the water level rises to the state before regulation the difference between the water levels of c5 c6 and c7 are 0 22 m 0 02 m and 0 04 m respectively pre and post optimization comparisons indicate that when the water level target decreases by 0 3 m the actual rise of the water level in the fourth stage is consistent with the set target rise through the control model when the water level target drops by more than 0 3 m the actual increase in the water level in the fourth stage is less than the set target increase therefore when the ecological regulation water level decline demand is greater than 0 3 m to restore the final water level to the preregulation water level the water level recovery target needs to be appropriately increased 4 discussion 4 1 model robustness testing the model described in this study was based on the simulation results of the hydraulic model used to achieve the regulation goal however owing to the difference between the hydraulic model and reality observation error and other factors there is an error ε between the hydraulic simulation results and the observation results in this section we will build a noise model to illustrate how much the error ε should be limited under different guarantee rate requirements by adding noise n to the output state s of environment e in the original model m we established a noise model mn as shown in fig 12 the new noise marker n marker component in the mn is responsible for receiving the output state s of the hydraulic model thus we artificially added a normally distributed noise n with a mean value of zero and a standard deviation of μ to the water level in front and behind the gates it should be noted that the noise added to the water level in front and behind each gate was the same after the adjustment of parameter μ of the noise model repeated tests with the trained agents can obtain the success rate of regulation at different degrees of interference fig 13 shows the control success rate chart for each working condition when the standard deviation μ of the noise is different c4 and c8 cannot be successfully controlled without noise so this section does not discuss the above working conditions as shown in fig 13 the increase in the standard deviation of the noise indicates that the success rate of regulation and control of each working condition presents a downward trend according to this trend the standard deviation limits of error ε at different guarantee rate requirements can be given when an 80 success rate is needed the standard deviation of the errors between the hydraulic simulation results of c3 c5 c6 and c7 and the actual observation results should be controlled within 0 05 m while c1 and c2 should be controlled within 0 08 m overall the improved scheme improves the regulation outcome of the model and does not affect the robustness of the model 4 2 difference analysis in this paper the reinforcement learning model was coupled with the 1d hydrodynamic model of the series sluice group to construct the ecological scheduling model for prevention and control of algal proliferation in the mrp the observed differences between this model and other sluice pump group scheduling models are as follows 1 adaptive parameter disturbance self learning action adjustment when studying the regulation of the sluice and dam group zuo and li 2013 constructed the regulation model of the sluice and dam group on the basis of the simulation optimization method whereby the sluice and dam group can be dynamically regulated according to the specific conditions however the use of the model will be limited when dealing with problems of uncertainty mo 2014 constructed the optimization model of the sluice pump hydrodynamic regulation of the river network on the basis of the multi objective optimization method which can be applied to the sluice and dam group regulation the optimal control scheme under specific objectives is given but each objective restricts the other through decision variables which renders the topological structure of the weighted objective function very complex in this study the ecological scheduling model based on reinforcement learning method does not need a large number of labeled data sets and it obtains training samples through continuous interactions between the agent and environment whereby a large amount of time is saved in terms of obtaining labeled samples moreover this approach is closer to the human learning process the model can realize self learning of a high dimensional mapping relationship from state to action and can deal with the dynamic adjustment of water level required by ecological scheduling so it possesses strong inclusiveness 2 wide control range and high control precision when zhang 2016 studied the effect of water level dynamic adjustment on algae the simulation period was long from wet season to dry season the water level changed slowly the flow rate was approximately 0 2 m d and the water level difference was about 0 4 m and there was no control structure in the model li 2010 studied the effect of water level dynamic decline on algae growth through experiments but the water level dynamic decline was slow 0 05 m d and there were no water level dynamics in the experiment during the recovery process however the model constructed in this study can realize the desired reciprocating adjustment of the channel water level in the process of large amplitude 0 8 m dynamic decline and stability dynamic rise the water level decline or rise speed is approximately 0 2 m d and the low water level is maintained stably for more than 72 h whereby the precise ecological regulation for the middle line project water level reciprocating adjustment can be met 5 conclusion to solve the problem concerning abnormal algal proliferation through convenient and low cost scheduling methods this study coupled the reinforcement learning model with the 1d hydrodynamic model of the series sluice group to establish an ecological scheduling model for prevention and control of algal proliferation in the mrp through an ecological scheduling strategy and by exploitation of the excellent performance of the reinforcement learning model in parameter regulation the model was trained and optimized according to the actual and hydrodynamic simulation data and the ecological scheduling scheme was generated to solve the aforementioned problem in this manner the needs for intelligent scheduling of the mrp were met the conclusions drawn from the study are as follows 1 the results showed that the reinforcement learning model is feasible for ecological regulation of the mrp and the scheduling model successfully meets the water level safety requirements 2 the model can achieve the reciprocating adjustment of the canal water level in the process of decline stability rise within 0 8 m and it can maintain the low water level stably for more than 72 h 3 in the process of ecological scheduling the maximum drawdown of water level satisfying the safety regulation and control constraints of the mrp is 1 0 m 4 when the ecological scheduling water level drop was greater than 0 3 m it was more difficult to restore the initial water level because of which the water level rise range should be greater than the decrease range 5 the constructed model shows high robustness when the observation error level was less than 0 08 m the success rate of the model could still exceed 80 the ecological scheduling scheme generated by the model can be used to destroy the algal habitat conditions through hydrodynamic dynamic control and this can provide decisional support for the prevention and control of abnormal algal proliferation in the mrp moreover the model is suitable for application in various series sluice systems credit

4699,geologic heterogeneity which commonly exists in target reservoirs for co2 sequestration has a significant effect on co2 trapping in this study we performed darcy scale multiphase flow experiments on a heterogeneous rock with in situ imaging techniques to obtain x ray images of co2 saturation during both drainage and imbibition residual trapping was assessed using the initial residual characteristic curve the distribution of residual co2 saturation widened as the initial saturation increased implying that the capillary heterogeneity becomes increasingly important with higher initial co2 saturation during dissolution we discovered new flow regimes in heterogeneous media and proposed a quantitative scaling relationship for their temporal evolution the high porosity layers showed a descending slope of 0 4 during the early stage of dissolution whereas it decreased by an order of magnitude slope 0 04 during the later stage the high capillarity layers however showed a single descending trend during dissolution the highly time resolved images of co2 saturation provide a detailed understanding of the dynamic processes of both residual and dissolution trapping in heterogeneous media which contributes to a wide range of applications including environmental remediation co2 sequestration and the enhancement of energy resources from hydrocarbon reservoirs keywords multiphase flow capillary heterogeneity co2 sequestration residual trapping dissolution 1 introduction an understanding of multiphase fluid flow in geological media is important for a wide range of reasons this includes management of groundwater resources remediation of non aqueous phase liquid napl contaminated aquifers and development of petroleum and natural gas resources additionally using the pore space of geologic reservoirs for energy and environmental applications such as carbon dioxide co2 sequestration also requires understanding of the fluid flow and mass transfer processes co2 emissions mostly originating from fossil fuel combustion for energy and transportation are the primary drivers of global climate change and a significant and urgent reduction therein is required to prevent the worst impacts of climate change alcalde et al 2018 ipcc 2014 carbon capture and storage ccs is a viable option to achieve this aminu et al 2017 bui et al 2018 celia 2017 szulczewski et al 2012 and an increasing worldwide interest in ccs technology has prompted several research pilot and commercial co2 storage projects michael et al 2010 the success of geologic co2 storage depends on the effectiveness of immobilizing injected co2 at a geological storage site long term isolation of co2 from the atmosphere is achieved via physical and chemical trapping mechanisms including structural residual solubility and mineral trapping bui et al 2018 ipcc 2005 while structural trapping occurs on a short timescale the contribution of residual and dissolution trapping increases over time enhancing storage security by immobilizing co2 ni et al 2019 when co2 is injected into a reservoir it exists as a highly interconnected co2 rich phase and becomes mobile xu et al 2017 during imbibition i e where the wetting phase displaces a nonwetting phase the injected co2 can be immobilized by capillary trapping a process resulting from the break up of the co2 phase into isolated ganglia juanes et al 2006 at the darcy scale this phenomenon is referred to as residual trapping capillary trapping limits the extent of co2 migration and controls fluid flow this trapping mechanism is considered a key process for maximizing capacity and ensuring the integrity of industrial scale co2 sequestration niu et al 2015 co2 dissolution into brine is another type of trapping mechanism that occurs at a later stage when co2 is injected into a reservoir a portion of the injected co2 will dissolve in the formation water co2 dissolution per unit volume of water is a function of the pressure temperature and salinity of the aqueous phase yang et al 2014 during co2 injection advective mass transport and rapid dissolution occur while the interfacial area continuously increases as co2 comes into contact with fresh unsaturated brine as co2 dissolves into the brine the increased brine density forms a stable stratification less susceptible to leakage thus ensuring long term storage security sathaye et al 2014 solubility trapping is enhanced when the interface between co2 rich brine and fresh brine becomes gravitationally unstable resulting in convective dissolution kim et al 2019 soltanian et al 2017 research is being conducted at different spatial scales including pore and core scales with the use of imaging techniques such as x ray micro computed tomography to understand the fundamental processes of trapping mechanisms krevor et al 2015 middleton et al 2012 the pore scale study of multiphase flow provides detailed information at a resolution of a few microns high resolution images allow capillary trapped ganglia of supercritical co2 scco2 to be observed in situ at reservoir conditions such that parameters e g contact angle and interfacial curvature can be measured directly armstrong et al 2012 lin et al 2018 the development of the rapid pore scale imaging technologies allows even real time observation of the movement of immiscible fluids in pores alratrout et al 2018 iglauer et al 2019 lin et al 2018 rücker et al 2015 in pore scale studies the entrapment and remobilization of the nonwetting fluid has been extensively studied developing a detailed understanding of the pore scale dynamics is important for several applications including aquifer remediation oil recovery and co2 sequestration datta et al 2014 yiotis et al 2019 zarikos et al 2018 fluid entrapment and remobilization is governed by the balance between capillary and viscous forces measured by the capillary number n c pak et al 2018 once the nonwetting fluid is trapped in the form of isolated ganglia some of this fluid becomes mobilized with an increase in the capillary number characterizing the continued flow of the wetting fluid datta et al 2014 although pore scale studies provide insights into the mechanisms in individual pores an important trade off exists between the sample size to be scanned and the image resolution cnudde and boone 2013 thus only small core plug sizes e g 3 5 mm in diameter and 5 8 mm in length are used for flow experiments limiting the understanding of the effects of sub core heterogeneity at the core scale e g 4 5 cm in diameter and 10 20 cm in length image resolution is lower r 0 5 mm than that of pore scale studies but effective as it incorporates the effects of structural heterogeneities pini and madonna 2015 geologic heterogeneity has a significant effect on co2 trapping mechanisms in sequestration settings dai et al 2018 xu et al 2020 several studies have shown that heterogeneities at the submeter scale have a large impact on both single and multiphase flow properties such that they are considered to be an important control on flow at larger scales jackson et al 2018 reynolds et al 2018 studies at this scale mostly focus on measuring relative permeabilities capillary pressures and characterizing the effect of heterogeneity kim et al 2018 mishra and haese 2020 oh et al 2015 pini et al 2012 sorai et al 2014 xu et al 2020 krevor et al conducted co2 core flooding experiments and investigated the impact of natural capillary heterogeneity in a sandstone rock on co2 saturation buildup and trapping krevor et al 2011 reynolds et al 2018 investigated the impact of heterogeneity on relative permeability and residual trapping showing that heterogeneity increased residual trapping to above that achieved from solely the pore scale capillary trapping mechanism although core scale multiphase flow experiments have predominantly focused on the impact of heterogeneity on residual trapping few studies are conducted on core flooding experiments in view of heterogeneity effect on dissolution trapping in this study we consider a heterogeneous media especially those with inclined alternating layers of high and low permeabilities as illustrated in fig 1 when co2 is injected through a partially perforated well the built up pressure induces brine displacement and the buoyant co2 migrates upward through preferential pathways until it is blocked by caprock drainage process the cease of co2 injection relieves the built up pressure and water imbibes back into the pore space dissolving residual co2 imbibition process the t1 and t2 are time points during the injection period whereas the t3 and t4 are time points during the post injection period we conduct two phase scco2 brine flow experiments at the core scale drainage and imbibition tests are performed under reservoir conditions focusing on the effect of heterogeneity on the dynamics of trapping mechanisms we use highly time resolved x ray imaging technique to quantify the detailed processes of both residual and dissolution trapping in a heterogeneous rock we identify new flow regimes in heterogeneous media and present quantitative scaling relationship for their temporal evolution 2 materials and methods 2 1 core sample a core sample was obtained from a sandstone formation in pohang basin in south korea pohang basin located in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula is considered a potential storage site due to its favorable geological and hydrogeological setting song et al 2015 the core was characterized using x ray computed tomography ct with observations of inclined alternating thin laminae fig s1 in the supplementary material the porosity profile shows the multilayer structure with alternating high and low porosity layers the grain size distribution analysis indicated that high porosity layers were mostly composed of sand whereas the low porosity layer consisted of silt the dimensions of the core were 105 mm in length and 38 mm in diameter and the measured porosity and permeability were 29 and 11 10 15 m2 the porosity was measured using mercury porosimetry and absolute permeability was measured with water using a core flooding system 2 2 experimental system the core flooding system includes a fluid injection system a core holder system a confining pressure system a back pressure system and a main control system fig 2 the fluid injection system included a 4 cylinder dual fluid pumping system chandler engineering model quizix q5000 10k which controlled the fluid flow rate and pore pressure in the system combined with a 1 l piston accumulator for co2 the core holder system was constructed of graphite composite with titanium endplates with multiple spiral grooves on the inlet face end plug to ensure that the fluid injection was evenly distributed onto the face of the core an integrated heating system with temperature monitoring thermocouples allowed for temperature control during the tests the confining pressure controller generated and maintained a constant confining pressure while the back pressure regulator controlled the flow to maintain pore pressure line pressure measurements were performed at both the upstream and downstream ends of the core with pressure transducers an x ray scanning system integrated with the core flooding system allowed the visualization of co2 saturation across the core sample during the flow experiments the method is based on the attenuation of x rays when they travel through material as expressed by the lambert beer law bultreys et al 2016 the x ray scanning system consists of an x ray tube varian medical systems model ndi 160 20 and a 2d detector sens tech model xdas v2 the detector board has two arrays of 128 channels each corresponding to 256 detectors with a detector pitch of 0 4 mm the data output are in a 16 bit format here we take into account the flow problem at the darcy scale and consider the co2 saturation as a volume fraction occupied by co2 as the pixel size 0 4 0 4 mm is larger than the characteristic pore size the x ray saturation technique mees et al 2003 is used which can be expressed as follows 1 s co 2 i exp i brine i co 2 i brine where i co 2 and i brine are the gray scale intensities when saturated with co2 and brine respectively and i exp is the intensity measured during the multiphase flow experiments the temporarily resolved images showed detailed processes of residual and dissolution trapping in a heterogeneous rock 2 3 experimental procedure a drainage experiment injection of a nonwetting phase followed by an imbibition test injection of a wetting phase was designed to investigate the dynamics of the trapping mechanisms the core sample was wrapped in a sleeve layering outward from the core it consists of heat shrinkable teflon aluminum foil and another layer of heat shrinkable teflon while the teflon layer served as a barrier to the confining fluid the aluminum foil prevented the diffusion of co2 to the outer sleeve the core was installed in the core holder and confining fluid was pumped into the region between the teflon layer and core holder walls to maintain the confining pressure the core was first saturated with co2 and the gray scale intensity values i co 2 of each pixel were measured by x ray scanning next the core was vacuum saturated with brine followed by brine injection at high flow rate of 15 ml min to remove co2 in the core until x ray scan results showed no apparent change in intensity value ensuring fully brine saturated core then an x ray scan was performed to measure the gray scale intensity values i brine during the test the downstream pressure was maintained at 10 mpa and the temperature was set at 40 c to replicate a hypothetical 1 km subsurface environment under these conditions co2 is in a supercritical state with a density and viscosity of 628 6 kg m3 and 4 78 10 5 pa s respectively a drainage test was performed by injecting co2 into the brine saturated core sample at an injection rate of 0 1 ml min the capillary number n c v μ σ where v is the darcy velocity μ is viscosity and σ is interfacial tension was calculated to be 1 1 10 8 indicating that the experiments were conducted under a capillary dominated condition a total of 60 x ray scans for the entire core were obtained with a total of 5 46 pore volume pv of co2 injection the co2 saturation for each pixel was calculated using eq 1 after the drainage test brine was injected into the core sample at the same flow rate n c 1 1 10 8 to simulate imbibition a total of 74 x ray scans were obtained with 5 05 pv of brine injection 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluid saturation and heterogeneity effects fig 3 a shows snapshots of the co2 saturation maps at various pvs of co2 during the drainage experiments as dry co2 is continuously injected brine is displaced from the pores at the early stage of co2 injection 0 2 pv a relatively sharp interface between the co2 and brine was observed the co2 advanced and displaced brine in a piston like manner two phase flow can be characterized by two dimensionless numbers the capillary number n c and the viscosity ratio m defined as the ratio of invading to defending phase viscosities m μ i μ d where μ i 0 0478 mpa s and μ d 0 89 mpa s are the viscosity of the invading and defending fluids respectively based on the log n c log m stability diagram lenormand et al 1988 zhang et al 2011 the flow is expected to exhibit flow patterns inherent to the capillary fingering regime log n c 8 log m 1 27 as the flow was considered at the darcy scale capillary fingering was not clearly observed but irregular flow pattern is seen in the invading co2 front the displacement process was predominantly governed by the small scale capillary heterogeneities laminae features in the core sample these capillary heterogeneities considerably affected local co2 saturation development which would not occur otherwise in case of a homogeneous core the co2 saturation would gently decrease from the core inlet to outlet oh et al 2013 a relatively high co2 saturation approximately 0 5 was observed in sand layers whereas low saturation approximately 0 05 was observed in silt layers from a pore scale perspective the large pore spaces of the sand layer which can be characterized by low capillarity allow co2 to easily penetrate most of the pore throats and occupy the pore space in other words the capillary pressure exceeds the maximum threshold pressure of the sand layer this results in high co2 saturation at the darcy scale in contrast relatively small pore bodies with narrow pore throats in the silt layer are characterized by high capillarity as the co2 capillary pressure does not exceed the highest threshold pressure co2 only migrates through a portion of the silt layer resulting in low co2 saturation at the darcy scale during the imbibition test at the pore scale the co2 becomes disconnected in the form of blobs and ganglia through the snap off process caused by the swelling of corner wetting films singh et al 2017 at the darcy scale this phenomenon is observed as a decrease in the co2 saturation in this study as fresh brine was continuously injected from the core inlet the immobilized blobs and ganglia began to dissolve into the surrounding brine initiating a process known as solubility trapping at the darcy scale advancing dissolution front was observed from core inlet fig 3b 0 27 1 62 pv unlike the case of drainage the displacement dissolution front became unstable the dissolution process depends on a number of factors including initial co2 saturation and heterogeneity which resulted in channeling of dissolution front jiang et al 2016 similar results were observed in the study conducted by akbarabadi and piri 2013 the solubility trapping may be enhanced by density driven convection but this process is not considered here because the experiments were conducted over limited spatial and temporal scales a total of 60 and 74 time resolved x ray scans were obtained during the co2 and brine injection experiments respectively figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary material present the co2 saturation maps over time 3 2 temporal variation in co2 saturation fig 4 shows the co2 saturation profiles measured across the middle of the core sample during the drainage tests the profiles show that the increasing rate of co2 saturation was relatively high during the early stage of injection and co2 saturation was dependent on the capillarity of alternating layers after co2 breakthrough the increasing rate of co2 saturation became smaller with the increase in injection time points a and b in fig 4 show an example of co2 saturation between the two layers the high porosity and low capillarity of the sand layer allowed co2 to easily penetrate the pore throats and occupy the pore space furthermore the high capillarity of the silt layer above the sand layer contributed to the enhancement of co2 saturation upon maintaining a constant injection rate of 0 1 ml min the pressure would increase when co2 reaches the silt layer to overcome the high capillary entry pressure the increased pressure allows more co2 to intrude small pore spaces oh et al 2019 fig 5 presents a domain of interest enlarged from a co2 saturation map at 0 23 and 5 46 pv the center panel shows the co2 saturation profiles across the middle of the domain focusing on the interface between the sand and silt layers equi saturation lines moved upward or downward across the drainage period for example at zone i the equi saturation lines of 0 2 moved upward whereas the equi saturation lines of 0 2 moved downward at zone ii our experimental results demonstrate that equi saturation lines near the layer boundary tend to move upward when a layer of higher capillarity overlies a layer of lower capillarity fig 6 shows the co2 saturation profiles across the middle of the core sample during the imbibition test as brine imbibes the pore space a breakup process known as snap off occurs for the continuous co2 phase during imbibition co2 saturation across the core decreased but soon stabilized for some period of time reaching residual co2 saturation yellow dotted line in fig 6 upon reaching the stabilized co2 saturation a significant decrease in co2 saturation was observed at point a whereas the change in saturation at point b was relatively marginal this implies that the continuous co2 phase was more easily isolated and mobilized in the larger pores 3 3 dynamic transition of trapping regime during imbibition the imbibing phase can displace co2 nonwetting phase up to an endpoint at which a residual saturation is reached pore scale studies have shown that the residual nonwetting phase is split into many disconnected clusters of different sizes andrew et al 2013 fig 7 a shows a subdomain of the core sample with time resolved images of co2 saturation during imbibition overall there was a decreasing trend in co2 saturation but the degree of decrease was dependent on the capillarity of alternating layers a total of 11 points 5 mm spacing were selected to focus on the effect of capillary heterogeneities on temporal variation in co2 saturation during imbibition fig 7b shows the co2 saturation profiles against pvs at the 11 selected points the imbibition characteristics of this heterogeneous media showed distinct temporal variation in co2 saturation points that lie in sand layer e g points 1 2 6 and 7 showed a rapid decrease in co2 saturation at the early stage pv 0 1 for example co2 saturation at point 1 showed a 33 decrease from 0 42 to 0 28 in contrast points that lie in silt layer e g points 4 5 10 and 11 showed a marginal decrease in co2 saturation as most of the pores in the sand layer were occupied by co2 during drainage the injected brine exhibited a piston like advance in a connected front across the core resulting in a rapid decrease in co2 saturation in contrast in the silt layer only a small portion of the pores was occupied by co2 due to high capillarity during drainage the injected brine tends to flow through the path where brine saturation is high resulting in an inefficient sweep i e a small decrease in co2 saturation based on the temporal variation characteristics in co2 saturation we can generally divide the trapping dynamics into three regimes at the early stage pv 0 1 of imbibition the initially connected co2 phase becomes disconnected in the form of blobs and ganglia and the co2 clusters that span several individual pores flow through a sequence of breakup and coalescence processes rücker et al 2015 in this ganglion dynamics regime co2 clusters are not yet capillary trapped but remain mobile resulting in a decrease in co2 saturation the saturation becomes stabilized for a certain period pv 0 1 0 5 indicating that the co2 clusters are immobilized and trapped by capillary forces at a later stage pv 0 5 the saturation begins to decrease as residually trapped co2 dissolves into continuously injected fresh brine 3 4 residual trapping residual trapping was assessed using the initial residual characteristic curve which describes the relationship between the initial and residual nonwetting saturations fig 8 first all pixel data obtained from the x ray scan were used and plotted as gray dots the results show that the distribution of the residual co2 saturation becomes wider with an increase in the initial saturation to see the upscaling effect the core sample was divided into 200 equal subdomains 10 20 and 50 equal subdomains 5 10 the average value of each subdomain was respectively plotted in blue circles and orange crosses for the two upscaling cases both cases also exhibited wide variance in residual saturation with increased initial saturation several empirical trapping models have been developed to describe the initial residual relation the land model land 1968 was used in this study which is given by s co 2 r s co 2 i 1 c s co 2 i where c is the dimensionless constant known as the land coefficient abundant data from previous studies have indicated that c ranges between 0 2 and 5 krevor et al 2015 here a smaller c value implies increased capillary trapping as the experimental data showed a wide distribution of residual saturation the entire range of the data does not fit a single land model two different land coefficients were used to examine the relationship between the initial and residual saturation the low and high limit of c was 0 4 and 2 0 respectively the distribution of residual co2 saturation becomes wider as the initial saturation increased implying that the capillary heterogeneity becomes a more important factor with a higher initial co2 saturation the 11 selected points described in the previous section also lie within this range and the relatively high porosity layers e g points 1 2 6 and 7 are close to the curve with c 2 0 whereas the relatively high capillarity layers e g points 3 4 10 and 11 are close to the curve with c 0 4 points 1 and 2 show that the initial saturation is relatively high 0 4 0 5 the points lie close to the curve with a land coefficient of c 2 0 this implies that a relatively high portion of co2 clusters broken into small blobs or ganglia were transported toward the downstream direction in the ganglion dynamics regime until they were blocked by a layer with small pore throats high capillarity points 3 and 6 show a similar initial saturation s co 2 i 0 35 but point 3 lies closer to the curve with a land coefficient of c 0 4 whereas point 6 lies closer to the curve with c 2 0 point 3 is located near the interface between the sand and silt and the overlying silt hinders the transport of broken blobs and ganglia point 6 however is located in the lower part of the sand layer which raises the possibility of the transport of blobs and ganglia in the downstream direction the results reveal that fluid displacement is strongly controlled by capillary heterogeneity the land coefficient may show large variation depending on the structure of heterogeneity 3 5 dissolution trapping the dissolution of co2 into native pore water is another dominant trapping mechanism despite the significance of dissolution trapping there is a paucity of literature investigating the dynamics of co2 dissolution compared with residual trapping in this study the rates of co2 dissolution were determined under experimental conditions the results show that dissolution can be subdivided into two stages based on the slope of co2 saturation versus pv fig 7b the curves obtained from the sand layers showed a steep descending slope during the early stage of dissolution whereas the slope became gentler during the later stage for example points 1 6 and 7 which lie on the sand layer showed a descending slope of 0 4 during the early stage of dissolution whereas it decreased by an order of magnitude slope 0 04 during the later stage in contrast the curves obtained from silt layers e g points 10 and 11 showed a relatively constant slope 0 04 during the entire process in the sand layer the capillary trapped co2 blobs and ganglia become smaller as they dissolve into brine which may initiate the mobilization of co2 blobs and ganglia resulting in a steep decrease in co2 saturation pore scale studies with dynamic imaging are required to further confirm these observations fig 9 compares the dissolution slope at the 11 selected points during the two stages at the early stage of dissolution the dissolution rate showed a large variation dependent upon the capillarity of the medium blue circles in fig 9 the descending slope at points 1 3 sand layer was 0 3 0 4 which decreased at points 4 5 silt layer points 6 7 sand layer showed a steep descending slope while layers with higher capillarity points 8 11 showed a gentle slope in the later stage however dissolution was slow slope 0 02 0 05 for all the observation points orange squares in fig 9 4 conclusions immiscible two phase flow in geologic media is encountered in many technological processes including aquifer remediation enhanced oil recovery and co2 sequestration this study focused on co2 sequestration sequestration differs from the transport of non aqueous phase liquid contaminants in aquifers or oil and gas production from hydrocarbon reservoirs as it aims to ensure co2 trapping whereas the other two cases aim to remobilize the organic fluid trapped in porous media to achieve enhanced recovery efficiency additionally an understanding of the dissolution between the two phases is required as co2 and brine are mutually soluble such that dissolution is an important process in co2 trapping mechanisms in this study the impact of capillary heterogeneity on the distribution and migration of two phase fluids scco2 and brine was experimentally investigated with the use of a highly time resolved x ray imaging technique we were able to visualize and quantify the dynamics of the co2 trapping process at the darcy scale residual trapping was characterized using an initial residual characteristic curve our experimental data showed that the distribution of the residual co2 saturation becomes wider as the initial saturation increased implying that the capillary heterogeneity becomes a more important factor with a higher initial co2 saturation the lower and upper limits of the land coefficient c were 0 4 and 2 0 respectively the relatively high porosity layers were close to the curve with c 2 0 whereas the relatively high capillarity layers were close to the curve with c 0 4 this reveals that a greater portion of co2 breaks up into small blobs or ganglia in a low capillarity sand layers during imbibition three flow regimes were identified the co2 saturation at the darcy scale decreases as the co2 phase becomes disconnected in the form of blobs and ganglia then the co2 saturation stabilizes representing residual trapping finally dissolution begins the dissolution of co2 into native pore water is not only fundamental to solubility trapping but also a prerequisite for subsequent permanent trapping in stable minerals we observed that during dissolution the co2 saturation decreased more rapidly in the low capillarity sand layer at an early stage this implies that the blobs and ganglia tend to dissolve into brine more rapidly in larger pores than in smaller ones however more detailed studies on dissolution at the pore scale are required to elucidate these mechanisms the insights obtained from this study will be critical for multiphase flow in porous media with capillary heterogeneity such processes are important in a number of porous media applications e g environmental remediation and the enhancement of energy resources from hydrocarbon reservoirs the scale of local heterogeneity is proportional to the dimensions of the given sample quantifying the nature and degree of the heterogeneity of rock samples is important to determine the full range of rock types present in a reservoir

4699,geologic heterogeneity which commonly exists in target reservoirs for co2 sequestration has a significant effect on co2 trapping in this study we performed darcy scale multiphase flow experiments on a heterogeneous rock with in situ imaging techniques to obtain x ray images of co2 saturation during both drainage and imbibition residual trapping was assessed using the initial residual characteristic curve the distribution of residual co2 saturation widened as the initial saturation increased implying that the capillary heterogeneity becomes increasingly important with higher initial co2 saturation during dissolution we discovered new flow regimes in heterogeneous media and proposed a quantitative scaling relationship for their temporal evolution the high porosity layers showed a descending slope of 0 4 during the early stage of dissolution whereas it decreased by an order of magnitude slope 0 04 during the later stage the high capillarity layers however showed a single descending trend during dissolution the highly time resolved images of co2 saturation provide a detailed understanding of the dynamic processes of both residual and dissolution trapping in heterogeneous media which contributes to a wide range of applications including environmental remediation co2 sequestration and the enhancement of energy resources from hydrocarbon reservoirs keywords multiphase flow capillary heterogeneity co2 sequestration residual trapping dissolution 1 introduction an understanding of multiphase fluid flow in geological media is important for a wide range of reasons this includes management of groundwater resources remediation of non aqueous phase liquid napl contaminated aquifers and development of petroleum and natural gas resources additionally using the pore space of geologic reservoirs for energy and environmental applications such as carbon dioxide co2 sequestration also requires understanding of the fluid flow and mass transfer processes co2 emissions mostly originating from fossil fuel combustion for energy and transportation are the primary drivers of global climate change and a significant and urgent reduction therein is required to prevent the worst impacts of climate change alcalde et al 2018 ipcc 2014 carbon capture and storage ccs is a viable option to achieve this aminu et al 2017 bui et al 2018 celia 2017 szulczewski et al 2012 and an increasing worldwide interest in ccs technology has prompted several research pilot and commercial co2 storage projects michael et al 2010 the success of geologic co2 storage depends on the effectiveness of immobilizing injected co2 at a geological storage site long term isolation of co2 from the atmosphere is achieved via physical and chemical trapping mechanisms including structural residual solubility and mineral trapping bui et al 2018 ipcc 2005 while structural trapping occurs on a short timescale the contribution of residual and dissolution trapping increases over time enhancing storage security by immobilizing co2 ni et al 2019 when co2 is injected into a reservoir it exists as a highly interconnected co2 rich phase and becomes mobile xu et al 2017 during imbibition i e where the wetting phase displaces a nonwetting phase the injected co2 can be immobilized by capillary trapping a process resulting from the break up of the co2 phase into isolated ganglia juanes et al 2006 at the darcy scale this phenomenon is referred to as residual trapping capillary trapping limits the extent of co2 migration and controls fluid flow this trapping mechanism is considered a key process for maximizing capacity and ensuring the integrity of industrial scale co2 sequestration niu et al 2015 co2 dissolution into brine is another type of trapping mechanism that occurs at a later stage when co2 is injected into a reservoir a portion of the injected co2 will dissolve in the formation water co2 dissolution per unit volume of water is a function of the pressure temperature and salinity of the aqueous phase yang et al 2014 during co2 injection advective mass transport and rapid dissolution occur while the interfacial area continuously increases as co2 comes into contact with fresh unsaturated brine as co2 dissolves into the brine the increased brine density forms a stable stratification less susceptible to leakage thus ensuring long term storage security sathaye et al 2014 solubility trapping is enhanced when the interface between co2 rich brine and fresh brine becomes gravitationally unstable resulting in convective dissolution kim et al 2019 soltanian et al 2017 research is being conducted at different spatial scales including pore and core scales with the use of imaging techniques such as x ray micro computed tomography to understand the fundamental processes of trapping mechanisms krevor et al 2015 middleton et al 2012 the pore scale study of multiphase flow provides detailed information at a resolution of a few microns high resolution images allow capillary trapped ganglia of supercritical co2 scco2 to be observed in situ at reservoir conditions such that parameters e g contact angle and interfacial curvature can be measured directly armstrong et al 2012 lin et al 2018 the development of the rapid pore scale imaging technologies allows even real time observation of the movement of immiscible fluids in pores alratrout et al 2018 iglauer et al 2019 lin et al 2018 rücker et al 2015 in pore scale studies the entrapment and remobilization of the nonwetting fluid has been extensively studied developing a detailed understanding of the pore scale dynamics is important for several applications including aquifer remediation oil recovery and co2 sequestration datta et al 2014 yiotis et al 2019 zarikos et al 2018 fluid entrapment and remobilization is governed by the balance between capillary and viscous forces measured by the capillary number n c pak et al 2018 once the nonwetting fluid is trapped in the form of isolated ganglia some of this fluid becomes mobilized with an increase in the capillary number characterizing the continued flow of the wetting fluid datta et al 2014 although pore scale studies provide insights into the mechanisms in individual pores an important trade off exists between the sample size to be scanned and the image resolution cnudde and boone 2013 thus only small core plug sizes e g 3 5 mm in diameter and 5 8 mm in length are used for flow experiments limiting the understanding of the effects of sub core heterogeneity at the core scale e g 4 5 cm in diameter and 10 20 cm in length image resolution is lower r 0 5 mm than that of pore scale studies but effective as it incorporates the effects of structural heterogeneities pini and madonna 2015 geologic heterogeneity has a significant effect on co2 trapping mechanisms in sequestration settings dai et al 2018 xu et al 2020 several studies have shown that heterogeneities at the submeter scale have a large impact on both single and multiphase flow properties such that they are considered to be an important control on flow at larger scales jackson et al 2018 reynolds et al 2018 studies at this scale mostly focus on measuring relative permeabilities capillary pressures and characterizing the effect of heterogeneity kim et al 2018 mishra and haese 2020 oh et al 2015 pini et al 2012 sorai et al 2014 xu et al 2020 krevor et al conducted co2 core flooding experiments and investigated the impact of natural capillary heterogeneity in a sandstone rock on co2 saturation buildup and trapping krevor et al 2011 reynolds et al 2018 investigated the impact of heterogeneity on relative permeability and residual trapping showing that heterogeneity increased residual trapping to above that achieved from solely the pore scale capillary trapping mechanism although core scale multiphase flow experiments have predominantly focused on the impact of heterogeneity on residual trapping few studies are conducted on core flooding experiments in view of heterogeneity effect on dissolution trapping in this study we consider a heterogeneous media especially those with inclined alternating layers of high and low permeabilities as illustrated in fig 1 when co2 is injected through a partially perforated well the built up pressure induces brine displacement and the buoyant co2 migrates upward through preferential pathways until it is blocked by caprock drainage process the cease of co2 injection relieves the built up pressure and water imbibes back into the pore space dissolving residual co2 imbibition process the t1 and t2 are time points during the injection period whereas the t3 and t4 are time points during the post injection period we conduct two phase scco2 brine flow experiments at the core scale drainage and imbibition tests are performed under reservoir conditions focusing on the effect of heterogeneity on the dynamics of trapping mechanisms we use highly time resolved x ray imaging technique to quantify the detailed processes of both residual and dissolution trapping in a heterogeneous rock we identify new flow regimes in heterogeneous media and present quantitative scaling relationship for their temporal evolution 2 materials and methods 2 1 core sample a core sample was obtained from a sandstone formation in pohang basin in south korea pohang basin located in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula is considered a potential storage site due to its favorable geological and hydrogeological setting song et al 2015 the core was characterized using x ray computed tomography ct with observations of inclined alternating thin laminae fig s1 in the supplementary material the porosity profile shows the multilayer structure with alternating high and low porosity layers the grain size distribution analysis indicated that high porosity layers were mostly composed of sand whereas the low porosity layer consisted of silt the dimensions of the core were 105 mm in length and 38 mm in diameter and the measured porosity and permeability were 29 and 11 10 15 m2 the porosity was measured using mercury porosimetry and absolute permeability was measured with water using a core flooding system 2 2 experimental system the core flooding system includes a fluid injection system a core holder system a confining pressure system a back pressure

pore pressure in the system combined with a 1 l piston accumulator for co2 the core holder system was constructed of graphite composite with titanium endplates with multiple spiral grooves on the inlet face end plug to ensure that the fluid injection was evenly distributed onto the face of the core an integrated heating system with temperature monitoring thermocouples allowed for temperature control during the tests the confining pressure controller generated and maintained a constant confining pressure while the back pressure regulator controlled the flow to maintain pore pressure line pressure measurements were performed at both the upstream and downstream ends of the core with pressure transducers an x ray scanning system integrated with the core flooding system allowed the visualization of co2 saturation across the core sample during the flow experiments the method is based on the attenuation of x rays when they travel through material as expressed by the lambert beer

channels each corresponding to 256 detectors with a detector pitch of 0 4 mm the data output are in a 16 bit format here we take into account the flow problem at the darcy scale and consider the co2 saturation as a volume fraction occupied by co2 as the pixel size 0 4 0 4 mm is larger than the characteristic pore size the x ray saturation technique mees et al 2003 is used which can be expressed as follows 1 s co 2 i exp i brine i co 2 i brine where i co 2 and i brine are the gray scale intensities when saturated with co2 and brine respectively and i exp is the intensity measured during the multiphase flow experiments the temporarily resolved images showed detailed processes of residual and dissolution trapping in a heterogeneous rock 2 3 experimental procedure a drainage experiment injection of a nonwetting phase followed by an imbibition test injection of a wetting phase was designed to investigate the dynamics of the trapping mechanisms the core sample was wrapped in a sleeve layering outward from the core it consists of heat shrinkable teflon aluminum foil and another layer of heat shrinkable teflon while the teflon layer served as a barrier to the confining fluid the aluminum foil prevented the diffusion of co2 to the outer sleeve the core was installed in the core holder and confining fluid was pumped into the region between the teflon layer and core holder walls to maintain the confining pressure the core was first saturated with co2 and the gray scale intensity values i co 2 of each pixel were measured by x ray scanning next the core was vacuum saturated with brine followed by brine injection at high flow rate of 15 ml min to remove co2 in the core until x ray scan results showed no apparent change in intensity value ensuring fully brine saturated core then an x ray scan was performed to measure the gray scale intensity values i brine during the test the downstream pressure was maintained at 10 mpa and the temperature was set at 40 c to replicate a hypothetical 1 km subsurface environment under these conditions co2 is in a supercritical state with a density and viscosity of 628 6 kg m3 and 4 78 10 5 pa s respectively a drainage test

fluids respectively based on the log n c log m stability diagram lenormand et al 1988 zhang et al 2011 the flow is expected to exhibit flow patterns inherent to the capillary fingering regime log n c 8 log m 1 27 as the flow was considered at the darcy scale capillary fingering was not clearly observed but irregular flow pattern is seen in the invading co2 front the displacement process was predominantly governed by the small scale capillary heterogeneities laminae features in the core sample these capillary heterogeneities considerably affected local co2 saturation development which would not occur otherwise in case of a homogeneous core the co2 saturation would gently decrease from the core inlet to outlet oh et al 2013 a relatively high co2 saturation approximately 0 5 was observed in sand layers whereas low saturation approximately 0 05 was observed in silt layers from a pore scale perspective the large pore spaces of the sand layer which can be characterized by low capillarity allow co2 to easily penetrate most of the pore throats and occupy the pore space in other words the capillary pressure exceeds the maximum threshold pressure of the sand layer this results in high co2 saturation at the darcy scale in contrast relatively small pore bodies with narrow pore throats in the silt layer are characterized by high capillarity as the co2 capillary pressure does not exceed the highest threshold pressure co2 only migrates through a portion of the silt layer resulting in low co2 saturation at the darcy scale during the imbibition test at the pore scale the co2 becomes disconnected in the form of blobs and ganglia through the snap off process caused by the swelling of corner wetting films singh et al 2017 at the darcy scale this phenomenon is observed as a decrease in the co2 saturation in this study as fresh brine was continuously injected from the core inlet the immobilized blobs and ganglia began to dissolve into the surrounding brine initiating a process known as solubility trapping at the darcy scale advancing dissolution front was observed from core inlet fig 3b 0 27 1 62 pv unlike the case of drainage the displacement dissolution front became unstable the dissolution process depends on a number of factors including initial co2 saturation and heterogeneity which resulted in channeling of dissolution front jiang et al 2016 similar results were observed in the study conducted by akbarabadi and piri 2013 the solubility trapping may be enhanced by density driven convection but this process is not considered here because the experiments were conducted over limited spatial and temporal scales a total of 60 and 74 time resolved x ray scans were obtained during the co2 and brine injection experiments respectively figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary material present the co2 saturation maps over time 3 2 temporal variation in co2 saturation fig 4 shows the co2 saturation profiles measured across the middle of the core sample during the drainage tests the profiles show that the increasing rate of co2 saturation was relatively high during the early stage of injection and co2 saturation was dependent on the capillarity of alternating layers after co2 breakthrough the increasing rate of co2 saturation became smaller with the increase in injection time points a and b in fig 4 show an example of co2 saturation between the two layers the high porosity and low capillarity of the sand layer allowed co2 to easily penetrate the pore throats and occupy the pore space furthermore the high capillarity of the silt layer above the sand layer contributed to the enhancement of co2 saturation upon maintaining a constant injection rate of 0 1 ml min the pressure would increase when co2 reaches the silt layer to overcome the high capillary entry pressure the increased pressure allows more co2 to intrude small pore spaces oh et al 2019 fig 5 presents a domain of interest enlarged from a co2 saturation map at 0 23 and 5 46 pv the center panel shows the co2 saturation profiles across the middle of the domain focusing on the interface between the sand and silt layers equi saturation lines moved upward or downward across the drainage period for example at zone i the equi saturation lines of 0 2 moved upward whereas the equi saturation lines of 0 2 moved downward at zone ii our experimental results demonstrate that equi saturation lines near the layer boundary tend to move upward when a layer of higher capillarity overlies a layer of lower capillarity fig 6 shows the co2 saturation profiles across the middle of the core sample during the imbibition test as brine imbibes the pore space a breakup process known as snap off occurs for the continuous co2 phase during imbibition co2 saturation across the core decreased but soon stabilized for some period of time reaching residual co2 saturation yellow dotted line in fig 6 upon reaching the stabilized co2 saturation a significant decrease in co2 saturation was observed at point a whereas the change in saturation at point b was relatively marginal this implies that the continuous co2 phase was more easily isolated and mobilized in the larger pores 3 3 dynamic transition of trapping regime during imbibition the imbibing phase can displace co2 nonwetting phase up to an endpoint at which a residual saturation is reached pore scale studies have shown that the residual nonwetting phase is split into many disconnected clusters of different sizes andrew et al 2013 fig 7 a shows a subdomain of the core sample with time resolved images of co2 saturation during imbibition overall there was a decreasing trend in co2 saturation but the degree of decrease was dependent on the capillarity of alternating layers a total of 11 points 5 mm spacing were selected to focus on the effect of capillary heterogeneities on temporal variation in co2 saturation during imbibition fig 7b shows the co2 saturation profiles against pvs at the 11 selected points the imbibition characteristics of this heterogeneous media showed distinct temporal variation in co2 saturation points that lie in sand layer e g points 1 2 6 and 7 showed a rapid decrease in co2 saturation at the early stage pv 0 1 for example co2 saturation at point 1 showed a 33 decrease from 0 42 to 0 28 in contrast points that lie in silt layer e g points 4 5 10 and 11 showed a marginal decrease in co2 saturation as most of the pores in the sand layer were occupied by co2 during drainage the injected brine exhibited a piston like advance in a connected front across the core resulting in a rapid decrease in co2 saturation in contrast in the silt layer only a small portion of the pores was occupied by co2 due to high capillarity during drainage the injected brine tends to flow through the path where brine saturation is high resulting in an inefficient sweep i e a small decrease in co2 saturation based on the temporal variation characteristics in co2 saturation we can generally divide the trapping dynamics into three regimes at the early stage pv 0 1 of imbibition the initially connected co2 phase becomes disconnected in the form of blobs and ganglia and the co2 clusters that span several individual pores flow through a sequence of breakup and coalescence processes rücker et al 2015 in this ganglion dynamics regime co2 clusters are not yet capillary trapped but remain mobile resulting in a decrease in co2 saturation the saturation becomes stabilized for a certain period pv 0 1 0 5 indicating that the co2 clusters are immobilized and trapped by capillary forces at a later stage pv 0 5 the saturation begins to decrease as residually trapped co2 dissolves into continuously injected fresh brine 3 4 residual trapping residual trapping was assessed using the initial residual characteristic curve which describes the relationship between the initial and residual nonwetting saturations fig 8 first all pixel data obtained from the x ray scan were used and plotted as gray dots the results show that the distribution of the residual co2 saturation becomes wider with an increase in the initial saturation to see the upscaling effect the core sample was divided into 200 equal subdomains 10 20 and 50 equal subdomains 5 10 the average value of each subdomain was respectively plotted in blue circles and orange crosses for the two upscaling cases both cases also exhibited wide variance in residual saturation with increased initial saturation several empirical trapping models have been developed to describe the initial residual relation the land model land 1968 was used in this study which is given by s co 2 r s co 2 i 1 c s co 2 i where c is the dimensionless constant known as the land coefficient abundant data from previous studies have indicated that c ranges between 0 2 and 5 krevor et al 2015 here a smaller c value implies increased capillary trapping as the experimental data showed a wide distribution of residual saturation the entire range of the data does not fit a single land model two different land coefficients were used to examine the relationship between the initial and residual saturation the low and high limit of c was 0 4 and 2 0 respectively the distribution of residual co2 saturation becomes wider as the initial saturation increased implying that the capillary heterogeneity becomes a more important factor with a higher initial co2 saturation the 11 selected points described in the previous section also lie within this range and the relatively high porosity layers e g points 1 2 6 and 7 are close to the curve with c 2 0 whereas the relatively high capillarity layers e g points 3 4 10 and 11 are close to the curve with c 0 4 points 1 and 2 show that the initial saturation is relatively high 0 4 0 5 the points lie close to the curve with a land coefficient of c 2 0 this implies that a relatively high portion of co2 clusters broken into small blobs or ganglia were transported toward the downstream direction in the ganglion dynamics regime until they were blocked by a layer with small pore throats high capillarity points 3 and 6 show a similar initial saturation s co 2 i 0 35 but point 3 lies closer to the curve with a land coefficient of c 0 4 whereas point 6 lies closer to the curve with c 2 0 point 3 is located near the interface between the sand and silt and the overlying silt hinders the transport of broken blobs and ganglia point 6 however is located in the lower part of the sand layer which raises the possibility of the transport of blobs and ganglia in the downstream direction the results reveal that fluid displacement is strongly controlled by capillary heterogeneity the land coefficient may show large variation depending on the structure of heterogeneity 3 5 dissolution trapping the dissolution of co2 into native pore water is another dominant trapping mechanism despite the significance of dissolution trapping there is a paucity of literature investigating the dynamics of co2 dissolution compared with residual trapping in this study the rates of co2 dissolution were determined under experimental conditions the results show that dissolution can be subdivided into two stages based on the slope of co2 saturation versus pv fig 7b the curves obtained from the sand layers showed a steep descending slope during the early stage of dissolution whereas the slope became gentler during the later stage for example points 1 6 and 7 which lie on the sand layer showed a descending slope of 0 4 during the early stage of dissolution whereas it decreased by an order of magnitude slope 0 04 during the later stage in contrast the curves obtained from silt layers e g points 10 and 11 showed a relatively constant slope 0 04 during the entire process in the sand layer the capillary trapped co2 blobs and ganglia become smaller as they dissolve into brine which may initiate the mobilization of co2 blobs and ganglia resulting in a steep decrease in co2 saturation pore scale studies with dynamic imaging are required to further confirm these observations fig 9 compares the dissolution slope at the 11 selected points during the two stages at the early stage of dissolution the dissolution rate showed a large variation dependent upon the capillarity of the medium blue circles in fig 9 the descending slope at points 1 3 sand layer was 0 3 0 4 which decreased at points 4 5 silt layer points 6 7 sand layer showed a steep descending slope while layers with higher capillarity points 8 11 showed a gentle slope in the later stage however dissolution was slow slope 0 02 0 05 for all the observation points orange squares in fig 9 4 conclusions immiscible two phase flow in geologic media is encountered in many technological processes including aquifer remediation enhanced oil recovery and co2 sequestration this study focused on co2 sequestration sequestration differs from the transport of non aqueous phase liquid contaminants in aquifers or oil and gas production from hydrocarbon reservoirs as it aims to ensure co2 trapping whereas the other two cases aim to remobilize the organic fluid trapped in porous media to achieve enhanced recovery efficiency additionally an understanding of the dissolution between the two phases is required as co2 and brine are mutually soluble such that dissolution is an important process in co2 trapping mechanisms in this study the impact of capillary heterogeneity on the distribution and migration of two phase fluids scco2 and brine was experimentally investigated with the use of a highly time resolved x ray imaging technique we were able to visualize and quantify the dynamics of the co2 trapping process at the darcy scale residual trapping was characterized using an initial residual characteristic curve our experimental data showed that the distribution of the residual co2 saturation becomes wider as the initial saturation increased implying that the capillary heterogeneity becomes a more important factor with a higher initial co2 saturation the lower and upper limits of the land coefficient c were 0 4 and 2 0 respectively the relatively high porosity layers were close to the curve with c 2 0 whereas the relatively high capillarity layers were close to the curve with c 0 4 this reveals that a greater portion of co2 breaks up into small blobs or ganglia in a low capillarity sand layers during imbibition three flow regimes were identified the co2 saturation at the darcy scale decreases as the co2 phase becomes disconnected in the form of blobs and ganglia then the co2 saturation stabilizes representing residual trapping finally dissolution begins the dissolution of co2 into native pore water is not only fundamental to solubility trapping but also a prerequisite for subsequent permanent trapping in stable minerals we observed that during dissolution the co2 saturation decreased more rapidly in the low capillarity sand layer at an early stage this implies that the blobs and ganglia tend to dissolve into brine more rapidly in larger pores than in smaller ones however more detailed studies on dissolution at the pore scale are required to elucidate these mechanisms the insights obtained from this study will be critical for multiphase flow in porous media with capillary heterogeneity such processes are important in a number of porous media applications e g environmental remediation and the enhancement of energy resources from hydrocarbon reservoirs the scale of local heterogeneity is proportional to the dimensions of the given sample quantifying the nature and degree of the heterogeneity of rock samples is important to determine the full range of rock types present in a reservoir
