7405,the paper investigates the applicability of kinematic and diffusive wave models for mud flows with a power law shear thinning rheology in analogy with a well known approach for turbulent clear water flows the study compares the steady flow depth profiles predicted by approximated models with those of the full dynamic wave one for all the models and assuming an infinitely wide channel the analytical solution of the flow depth profiles in terms of hypergeometric functions is derived the accuracy of the approximated models is assessed by computing the average along the channel length of the errors for several values of the froude and kinematic wave numbers assuming the threshold value of the error equal to 5 the applicability conditions of the two approximations have been individuated for several values of the power law exponent showing a crucial role of the rheology the comparison with the clear water results indicates that applicability criteria for clear water flows do not apply to shear thinning fluids potentially leading to an incorrect use of approximated models if the rheology is not properly accounted for keywords mud flow power law fluid simplified wave models steady flow 1 introduction in the geophysical context a large number of flows e g debris and or mud flows submarine or snow avalanches is characterized by water transporting huge quantities of solids these flows are often studied with the methods of fluid mechanics combining appropriate flow schematizations with suitable rheological descriptions a widespread approach considers a non newtonian rheology under purely viscous regime and a depth integrated approximation for fluids with negligible yield stress the power law represents an effective rheological model for the description of the shear thinning fine sediment water mixtures which are often encountered in natural estuaries e g zhang et al 2010 or in landsides e g carotenuto et al 2015 coupling the power law rheology with the von karman approximation for the momentum conservation equation leads to the well known shallow layer model of ng and mei 1994 in several applications some of the terms of the momentum conservation equation i e inertia pressure gradient gravity and bottom shear stress may be smaller than the others in these circumstances similarly to what is commonly exploited in open channel flows in the context of flood routing the flow model can be further simplified for instance neglecting the inertia terms leads to the so called diffusive wave model whereas the further disregarding of the pressure gradient term results in the kinematic wave approximation even if efficient numerical methods for the solution of the complete momentum equations are currently available the approximate models are still useful in the field of flood routing in fact in addition to the inherent benefit of reducing the computational effort approximated wave models offer several further advantages for instance simplified models may be more easily coupled with high resolution topographic data and the boundary conditions more straightforwardly accounted for than in the full one aricò et al 2011 moreover several studies showed a smaller sensitivity of simplified models to the errors in the topographic description with respect to the full one demonstrating their accuracy and robustness to data uncertainty yu and lane 2006 weill et al 2014 aricò et al 2016 most of these advantages do not depend on the flowing medium so it does not surprise that simplified models have been widely used also with non newtonian fluids to reproduce either the results of laboratory experiments huang and garcia 1998 balmforth et al 2007 ancey and cochard 2009 pudasaini 2001 ancey et al 2012 or mud debris flows occurred in the field o brien et al 1993 developed the flo 2d code for mud debris flow simulations including both diffusive and kinematic approximations arattano and savage 1994 simulated the two debris flows occurred in 1981 on mount st helens washington u s a with a model based on kinematic approximation obtaining a good agreement with the field data arattano et al 2006 in simulating the debris flow occurred in 2004 in an experimental basin on the italian alps showed that the kinematic approximation based on the rheological model by honda and egashira 1997 was able to fairly reproduce the recorded hydrographs arattano and franzi 2010 analyzed the applicability of both diffusive and kinematic wave models for reproducing debris flow occurred in an italian instrumented torrent evaluating in a real case scenario the actual magnitude of the neglected terms chiang et al 2012 studied landslides and debris flows caused by morakot typhoon in taiwan on august 2009 by means of a cell model with a kinematic approximation of the flow model achieving a predictive capability of the affected area and of the deposition volume rengers et al 2016 investigated post wildfire debris flows adopting the kinematic approximation it has been shown that the kinematic wave model represents a suitable approach for predicting flood and debris flows timing in steep burned watersheds gregoretti et al 2016 applied an approach similar to chiang et al 2012 for the simulation of the debris flow on the rio lazer dolomites north eastern italian alps obtaining a good agreement between computed and observed results in terms of debris flow deposition area and changes in valley morphology the promising results achieved in the above applications open a wider question on a more general definition of the applicability range of simplified models this aspect has been widely studied in the literature for clear water open channel flows in turbulent regime and three approaches to assess the applicability of approximated models have been followed the first technique consists in analysing the linearized version of both the complete and the approximated models and comparing the properties of the resulting unsteady solutions as a function of the dimensionless wave period ponce et al 1978 menendez and norscini 1982 dooge et al 1987 lamberti and pilati 1996 singh 1996 tsai 2003 the other two methods account for the non linearity of the flow model indeed the second approach is essentially based on the estimation of the magnitude of the terms neglected in the momentum equation woolhiser and liggett 1967 morris and woolhiser 1980 fread 1983 ferrick 1985 moussa and boequillon 1996 moramarco and singh 2000 perumal and sahoo 2007 finally the third approach relies on the solution of the full and the approximated models and on the analysis of the differences among the results either steady govindaraju et al 1988a b parlange et al 1990 singh and aravamuthan 1995a b 1996 moramarco et al 2008a or unsteady moramarco et al 2008b flow conditions have been investigated and an estimation of the spatial resp temporal error resulting from to the application of the approximated models has been provided some of these criteria have been validated through the comparison with the dynamics of recorded flood events moramarco et al 2008b as far as non newtonian fluids are concerned di cristo et al 2014a b followed the first of the above approaches in order to define applicability criteria for some approximate models for mud floods considering a herschel bulkley and a power law rheology respectively in an unbounded channel a linearized version of the flow model valid in the neighbourhood of uniform condition has been considered the expressions of celerity and attenuation factor of the primary wave for the full and some simplified i e kinematic diffusion and quasi steady models have been compared considering an accuracy threshold of 95 applicability criteria have been deduced in terms of the dimensionless wave period of the flow perturbation which can be related the dimensionless rising time of the flood hydrograph di cristo et al 2017 addressed the same problem of di cristo et al 2014b but for finite length channels the analysis based on the evaluation of three shape factors of the linearized upstream channel response function has shown that the diffusive approximation provides the best performance especially for low values of the froude number despite they natively account for the power law rheology both di cristo et al 2014b and di cristo et al 2017 studies deal with linearized flow models the present paper investigates the applicability of kinematic and diffusive wave models in presence of power law fluids fully accounting for the non linearity of governing equations steady state conditions are considered extending to the shear thinning power law rheology the analyses previously performed for turbulent clear water flows govindaraju et al 1988a b parlange et al 1990 singh and aravamuthan 1995a b 1996 moramarco et al 2008a de almeida and bates 2013 as for the turbulent clear water case moramarco et al 2008a the analysis considers accelerated hypocritical flow profiles in mild slope channel with the critical depth assigned as the downstream boundary condition applicability criteria for approximated models in finite length channels are sought for to this aim the analytical solution of the flow depth profiles of both full and approximated models in an infinitely wide channel has been derived based on the theoretical developments the spatial distribution of the error for the approximated models has been analyzed as a function of the fluid rheology assuming a threshold of 5 for the channel length averaged error the applicability conditions have been individuated in terms of the governing dimensionless parameters i e kinematic wave and froude numbers for several values of the power law exponent the outline of the paper is as follows section 2 reports the governing equations for the full wave diffusive wave and kinematic wave models while in section 3 the analytical solutions for steady state flow profiles are derived section 4 presents the results relative to the comparison of the full with both the kinematic and diffusive approximations and the resulting applicability criteria finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 governing equations let us consider a homogeneous layer of a shear thinning power law fluid flowing over a fixed bed with a constant inclination θ with respect to the horizontal plane without lateral inflow or outflow the fluid is regarded as incompressible assuming that spatial variations occur over scales larger than the flow depth flow resistance by the sidewalls is negligible with respect to that by the bottom surface tension is negligible the dimensional depth averaged momentum and mass conservation equations are di cristo et al 2017 1 u h t β h u

bottom stress are 3 β 2 2 n 1 3 n 2 1 4 τ b μ n 2 n 1 n u h n in 3 4 µn and n denote the consistency and the rheological index respectively the rheological index ranges between 0 and 1 for a shear

h h n τ b τ b τ b n where the subscript n denotes the normal i e uniform flow variables corresponding to q and l is the dimensional channel length therefore the dimensionless form of the flow

steady formulation of the full wave model fwm puts in evidence that similarly to the turbulent clear water tcw case govindaraju et al 1988a b moramarco et al 2008a even for the power law fluids the flow depth profile depends only on fn and k along with the boundary condition in what follows similarly to the tcw case moramarco et al 2008a one of the two pairs f n k or f n k with k kf n 2 l h n tan θ will be considered the diffusive wave model dwm comes from eq 10 neglecting the convective acceleration i e the first term therefore the counterpart of eq 12 reads 13 d h s dwm d x kf n 2 h s dwm 2 n 1 1 h s dwm 2 n 1 the steady formulation of the kinematic wave model kwm which disregards in eq 10 also the pressure gradient term leads to the following simple equation 14 h s kwm 1 3 solution of the steady flow depth profile in order to quantify the errors of the approximated models the solution of eqs 12 14 is needed while this is trivial for the kwm see eq 14 the steady flow depth profile predicted by both full and diffusive wave models has to be evaluated from the integration of the non linear ordinary differential equations 12 and 13 respectively in the present paper a closed form solution has been derived to this aim as far as the fwm is concerned from the integration of eq 12 it follows 15 x const 1 kf n 2 h 2 n 1 h 2 n 1 1 d h β f n 2 h 2 n 1 h 2 n 1 1 d h in eq 15 the subscript s has been dropped for the sake of simplicity the r h s of eq 15 is then rewritten as follows 16 w kf n 2 ξ w 1 ξ d ξ β f n 2 ξ 2 w 1 ξ d ξ with 17 w 1 2 n 1 ξ h 2 n 1 accounting for the chebyshev integral identity weisstein 1998 18 x p 1 x q d x x 1 p f p 1 q p 2 x 1 p f a b c z being the hypergeometric function the closed form solution of eq 15 reads 19 x 1 kf n 2 h 2 n 2 2 n 1

the flow depth profile for 1 x fm 0 may be deduced through the following implicit equation 20 x fm β f n 2 2 n 1 2 n 1 k 2 h 2 n 1 1 n f 2 n 1 2 n 1 1 4 n 2 n 1 h 2 n 1 2 h 2 n 1 1 n f 2 n 1 2 n 1 1 4

such a value of the power law exponent the following expression holds appendix b 21 x fm 1 kf n 2 h h 1 β f n 2 2 ln h 1 h 1 1 β f n 2 2 ln h 1 h 1 β f n 2 ln h h eqs 20 and 21 allow to compute the flow depth profile of steady flow of a power law fluid showing that the hypergeometric functions commonly employed in the context of turbulent clear water flows chyan deng 2014 may be fruitfully used even dealing with different rheologies starting from eqs 20 and 21 and taking the limit for β f n 2 0 its easy to verify that the counterparts of 20 and 21 for the diffusive wave model read 22 x dwm 1

and 3 report the calculated accelerated flow depth profiles for two different froude numbers values namely fig 2 f n 0 1 fig 3 f n 0 5 in a mild slope channel i e f n f n c f n c 1 β being the critical froude number campomaggiore et al 2016 both the full and diffusive wave models have been considered three different n values namely n 0 25 0 5 1 0 have been selected while the kinematic wave number k has been fixed equal to 5 at the downstream end of the channel x 0 critical flow depth h c β f n 2 3 campomaggiore et al 2016 has been imposed for the considered power law exponent values fig 1 depicts the critical flow depth as a function of the froude number figure 1 puts in evidence that owing to the dependence of the momentum correction factor on the power law exponent eq 3 the critical flow depth increases with n for a fixed value of froude number moreover it is also easy to verify that the critical froude number f n c reduces with the power law exponent reaching the minimum value f n c min 0 913 for n 1 figures 2 and 3 indicate that independently of the froude number the power law exponent strongly influences the flow depth profiles for both models the increase of the power law exponent leads to a growth of the flow depth gradient for both models therefore a careful rheological characterization of the flow medium appears to be mandatory for a correct prediction of the accelerated flow depth profiles 4 results based on the above closed forms of the steady flow depth profiles the present section compares the results of the approximated models i e kwm and dwm with those of the fwm to this aim for a fixed value of the power law exponent and of the fn k pair for both approximated wave models awm the spatial distribution of the relative error is evaluated as 24 ε awm x h awm x h fwm x h fwm x following moramarco et al 2008a the analysis has been carried out referring to accelerated hypocritical currents in a mild slope channel and assuming as downstream boundary condition the critical flow depth in this condition the largest errors in the application of the approximated models are expected moramarco et al 2008a in what follows for the sake of comparison the results concerning the turbulent clear water tcw case with the manning resistance formula are also discussed the closed form of the flow depth profile for this case can be found for instance in chyan deng 2014 figure 4 depicts the spatial distribution of the relative error as far as the kwm is concerned εkwm for k 3 5 10 30 three different n values have been considered namely n 0 25 fig 4a n 0 5 fig 4b n 1 0 fig 4c along with the turbulent clear water case tcw fig 4d the froude number has been fixed equal to 0 1 similarly to the turbulent clear water case fig 4d for all n values fig 4a b c show that independently of the k value εkwm increases monotonically with the channel abscissa x and decreases with k for all the values of the kinematic wave number εkwm reduces with n the comparison with the turbulent clear water case fig 4d puts in evidence that the performances of the kinematic wave model significantly depend on the rheology of the flowing medium both a pronounced shear thinning attitude and a small value of the kinematic wave number induce an increase of εkwm for a power law fluid with respect to ε kwm tcw for instance for k 3 at x 0 5 the tcw model predicts ε kwm tcw 0 84 whereas ε kwm n 0 5 1 76 therefore migrating the evaluations for tcw to a shear thinning power law fluid could imply a strong underestimation of the error associated to the kwm model figure 5 depicts the εdwm spatial distribution along the channel for the same k and n values of fig 4 while figs 6 and 7 represent the counterparts of figs 4 and 5 for fn 0 5 figure 5 shows that for all the considered values of power law exponent and kinematic wave number the magnitude of the εdwm is much smaller than the one of the kwm moreover owing to the fulfillment of the downstream boundary condition and differently from the kwm εdwm is a non monotone function along the channel even though all the considered cases show a similar trend the abscissa of the maximum value of εdwm depends on both k and n values an increase of both k and n values shifts downstream the εdwm maximum location the comparison of fig 5a b c with fig 5d suggests that even in applying the dwm model the results deduced for tcw cannot be safely applied for the power law fluids especially for small values of n comparing fig 5c and fig 5d it follows that independently of the k value although very close to the outlet ε dwm tcw overwhelms the corresponding one for the power law fluid in most of the channel ε dwm tcw ε dwm n 0 5 is smaller than 0 5 therefore similarly to the kinematic wave model it is expected that the bounds for a correct application of the dwm in the presence of a power law fluid may significantly differ from those deduced for the tcw case figures 6 and 7 representing the counterparts of figs 4 and 5 for fn 0 5 show that an increase of the froude number leads a reduction for all n and k values of both εkwm and εdwm values although confirming the general trend suggested by the fn 0 1 case an overall analysis of the accuracy of the approximated wave models may be carried out considering the magnitude of the average of the error along the channel moramarco et al 2008a ε awm for the kwm model the average was computed for 0 95 x 0 05 i e considering the part of the channel less influenced by the boundary conditions singh and aravamuthan 1997 moramarco et al 2008a figures 8 and 9 depict for two froude numbers namely fn 0 1 and fn 0 5 the averaged error ε awm as function of the dimensionless parameter k again the n 0 25 0 5 1 0 values along with the tcw case have been considered for both approximated models ε kwm figs 8a and 9a ε dwm figs 8b and 9b figures 8a and 9 put in evidence that independently of n values and similarly to the tcw case ε kwm curves overwhelm the corresponding ones of the diffusive wave model in the fn 0 1 case even of an order of magnitude and for both models the error reduces when the power law exponent increases for fn 0 1 fig 8a and fig 8b show a monotonically decreasing behavior with k moreover they suggest that in averaged sense the results pertaining to the turbulent clear water case may be applicable even for the laminar case i e n 1 especially for the kwm figure 9 indicates that an increase of the froude number has a different effect on the two approximated models in fact for a fixed k value ε kwm decreases from the fn 0 1 to the fn 0 5 case while ε dwm increases furthermore fig 9a hints the same monotone decrease of the error with k while for the dwm fig 9b reveals for very small values of k an increasing trend reaching a peak value and then the usual decreasing behavior finally it is also confirmed that even for fn 0 5 the turbulent and laminar clear water flows have similar results especially for the kwm the results of figs 8 and 9 imply that it is possible to individuate a lower bound of the kinematic wave number k lb above which the approximate wave model is applicable with a prescribed accuracy assuming as applicability condition ε awm 5 moramarco et al 2008a for each n value the applicability map in the plane k f n may be deduced for both kinematic fig 10 a and diffusive fig 10b wave models figure 10a clearly shows that for all n values the lower bound k lb above which the kwm is applicable monotonically decreases when the froude number increases as observed also for the tcw case moreover a decrease of the power law exponent reduces the extension of the applicability region differently fig 10b indicates that as far as the dwm is concerned and similarly to the tcw flow the lower bound k lb is not a monotone function of fn even for the power law fluids also in this case a reduction in terms of power law exponent induces a restriction of the applicability region of the dwm figure 10 points out that for each value of the power law exponent it exists a threshold value k tv max f n k lb which may be considered as a conservative estimate of the lower bound for the applicability of the approximate models with an error less than 5 for all subcritical froude numbers for the tcw flow these threshold values are k tv tcw 1 4 kwm and k tv tcw 0 6 dwm which are in perfect agreement with those deduced by moramarco et al 2008a figure 11 reports for both dwm and kwm the threshold values k tv obtained for several rheological exponents black lines which define for each fluid the limiting k value above which the approximated models can be safely applied for the sake of comparison also the corresponding ones for the tcw case k tv tcw with grey color are reported it can be observed that the dwm has a larger applicability range than the kwm figure 11 demonstrates that in presence of huge quantities of sediments which may lend the mixture a shear thinning power law rheology the applicability criteria deduced for clear water may lead to an incorrect use of both approximated wave models results reported in fig 11 constitute a criterion for the correct application of the kwm and dwm models for mud flows extending to power law fluids the results available in the literature for turbulent clear water flows 5 conclusions the paper investigated the applicability of the kinematic and diffusive wave models for flows of shear thinning fluids described by a power law rheology the study represents an extension to the power law rheology of the steady state analyses previously developed for turbulent clear water tcw flows the procedure is based on the evaluation of the error associated to the application of the approximated models accounting for the non linearity of the governing equations the analysis is carried out starting from the analytical solution of the flow depth profiles of both full and approximated models in an infinitely wide channel under steady state conditions of flow similarly to the turbulent clear water case accelerated hypocritical flows in mild slope channel with free flow outlet condition have been investigated it has been found that in presence of a power law fluid the spatial distribution of the error for both approximated models differs with respect to that of tcw flows revealing the important role of the rheology on the model selection the overall analysis of the accuracy of the approximated models has been carried out considering the magnitude of the average error along the channel length for different rheological exponents and governing dimensionless numbers assuming a threshold on the average error of 5 for a fixed value of the power law index it has been individuated a limit value of the kinematic wave number k tv above which the approximate models are applicable for all the subcritical froude number values present results show that the applicability range of the diffusive wave model is larger than that of the kinematic model and in both cases it decreases when n reduces moreover these applicability ranges especially for fluids with a pronounced shear thinning attitude strongly differ from the corresponding ones for the turbulent clear water case in conclusion present study reveals that the results available in the literature for clear water flows may not be valid for power law fluids and it provides novel specific applicability criteria for this class of fluids in a future research the present analysis will be extended considering different power law rheologies such as the one proposed by lanzoni et al 2017 for debris flows in drained inertial range moreover for addressing problems with realistic mountain topographies often associated to natural avalanches and debris flows the analysis could be performed adopting depth averaged models able to include the bottom curvature effect such as for instance ionescu 2013a b or fent et al 2018 appendix

7405,the paper investigates the applicability of kinematic and diffusive wave models for mud flows with a power law shear thinning rheology in analogy with a well known approach for turbulent clear water flows the study compares the steady flow depth profiles predicted by approximated models with those of the full dynamic wave one for all the models and assuming an infinitely wide channel the analytical solution of the flow depth profiles in terms of hypergeometric functions is derived the accuracy of the approximated models is assessed by computing the average along the channel length of the errors for several values of the froude and kinematic wave numbers assuming the threshold value of the error equal to 5 the applicability conditions of the two approximations have been individuated for several values of the power law exponent showing a crucial role of the rheology the comparison with the clear water results indicates that applicability criteria for clear water flows do not apply to shear thinning fluids potentially leading to an incorrect use of approximated models if the rheology is not properly accounted for keywords mud flow power law fluid simplified wave models steady flow 1 introduction in the geophysical context a large number of flows e g debris and or mud flows submarine or snow avalanches is characterized by water transporting huge quantities of solids these flows are often studied with the methods of fluid mechanics combining appropriate flow schematizations with suitable rheological descriptions a widespread approach considers a non newtonian rheology under purely viscous regime and a depth integrated approximation for fluids with negligible yield stress the power law represents an effective rheological model for the description of the shear thinning fine sediment water mixtures which are often encountered in natural estuaries e g zhang et al 2010 or in landsides e g carotenuto et al 2015 coupling the power law rheology with the von karman approximation for the momentum conservation equation leads to the well known shallow layer model of ng and mei 1994 in several applications some of the terms of the momentum conservation equation i e inertia pressure gradient gravity and bottom shear stress may be smaller than the others in these circumstances similarly to what is commonly exploited in open channel flows in the context of flood routing the flow model can be further simplified for instance neglecting the inertia terms leads to the so called diffusive wave model whereas the further disregarding of the pressure gradient term results in the kinematic wave approximation even if efficient numerical methods for the solution of the complete momentum equations are currently available the approximate models are still useful in the field of flood routing in fact in addition to the inherent benefit of reducing the computational effort approximated wave models offer several further advantages for instance simplified models may be more easily coupled with high resolution topographic data and the boundary conditions more straightforwardly accounted for than in the full one aricò et al 2011 moreover several studies showed a smaller sensitivity of simplified models to the errors in the topographic description with respect to the full one demonstrating their accuracy and robustness to data uncertainty yu and lane 2006 weill et al 2014 aricò et al 2016 most of these advantages do not depend on the flowing medium so it does not surprise that simplified models have been widely used also with non newtonian fluids to reproduce either the results of laboratory experiments huang and garcia 1998 balmforth et al 2007 ancey and cochard 2009 pudasaini 2001 ancey et al 2012 or mud debris flows occurred in the field o brien et al 1993 developed the flo 2d code for mud debris flow simulations including both diffusive and kinematic approximations arattano and savage 1994 simulated the two debris flows occurred in 1981 on mount st helens washington u s a with a model based on kinematic approximation obtaining a good agreement with the field data arattano et al 2006 in simulating the debris flow occurred in 2004 in an experimental basin on the italian alps showed that the kinematic approximation based on the rheological model by honda and egashira 1997 was able to fairly reproduce the recorded hydrographs arattano and franzi 2010 analyzed the applicability of both diffusive and kinematic wave models for reproducing debris flow occurred in an italian instrumented torrent evaluating in a real case scenario the actual magnitude of the neglected terms chiang et al 2012 studied landslides and debris flows caused by morakot typhoon in taiwan on august 2009 by means of a cell model with a kinematic approximation of the flow model achieving a predictive capability of the affected area and of the deposition volume rengers et al 2016 investigated post wildfire debris flows adopting the kinematic approximation it has been shown that the kinematic wave model represents a suitable approach for predicting flood and debris flows timing in steep burned watersheds gregoretti et al 2016 applied an approach similar to chiang et al 2012 for the simulation of the debris flow on the rio lazer dolomites north eastern italian alps obtaining a good agreement between computed and observed results in terms of debris flow deposition area and changes in valley morphology the promising results achieved in the above applications open a wider question on a more general definition of the applicability range of simplified models this aspect has been widely studied in the literature for clear water open channel flows in turbulent regime and three approaches to assess the applicability of approximated models have been followed the first technique consists in analysing the linearized version of both the complete and the approximated models and comparing the properties of the resulting unsteady solutions as a function of the dimensionless wave period ponce et al 1978 menendez and norscini 1982 dooge et al 1987 lamberti and pilati 1996 singh 1996 tsai 2003 the other two methods account for the non linearity of the flow model indeed the second approach is essentially based on the estimation of the magnitude of the terms neglected in the momentum equation woolhiser and liggett 1967 morris and woolhiser 1980 fread 1983 ferrick 1985 moussa and boequillon 1996 moramarco and singh 2000 perumal and sahoo 2007 finally the third approach relies on the solution of the full and the approximated models and on the analysis of the differences among the results either steady govindaraju et al 1988a b parlange et al 1990 singh and aravamuthan 1995a b 1996 moramarco et al 2008a or unsteady moramarco et al 2008b flow conditions have been investigated and an estimation of the spatial resp temporal error resulting from to the application of the approximated models has been provided some of these criteria have been validated through the comparison with the dynamics of recorded flood events moramarco et al 2008b as far as non newtonian fluids are concerned di cristo et al 2014a b followed the first of the above approaches in order to define applicability criteria for some approximate models for mud floods considering a herschel bulkley and a power law rheology respectively in an unbounded channel a linearized version of the flow model valid in the neighbourhood of uniform condition has been considered the expressions of celerity and attenuation factor of the primary wave for the full and some simplified i e kinematic diffusion and quasi steady models have been compared considering an accuracy threshold of 95 applicability criteria have been deduced in terms of the dimensionless wave period of the flow perturbation which can be related the dimensionless rising time of the flood hydrograph di cristo et al 2017 addressed the same problem of di cristo et al 2014b but for finite length channels the analysis based on the evaluation of three shape factors of the linearized upstream channel response function has shown that the diffusive approximation provides the best performance especially for low values of the froude number despite they natively account for the power law rheology both di cristo et al 2014b and di cristo et al 2017 studies deal with linearized flow models the present paper investigates the applicability of kinematic and diffusive wave models in presence of power law fluids fully accounting for the non linearity of governing equations steady state conditions are considered extending to the shear thinning power law rheology the analyses previously performed for turbulent clear water flows govindaraju et al 1988a b parlange et al 1990 singh and aravamuthan 1995a b 1996 moramarco et al 2008a de almeida and bates 2013 as for the turbulent clear water case moramarco et al 2008a the analysis considers accelerated hypocritical flow profiles in mild slope channel with the critical depth assigned as the downstream boundary condition applicability criteria for approximated models in finite length channels are sought for to this aim the analytical solution of the flow depth profiles of both full and approximated models in an infinitely wide channel has been derived based on the theoretical developments the spatial distribution of the error for the approximated models has been analyzed as a function of the fluid rheology assuming a threshold of 5 for the channel length averaged error the applicability conditions have been individuated in terms of the governing dimensionless parameters i e kinematic wave and froude numbers for several values of the power law exponent the outline of the paper is as follows section 2 reports the governing equations for the full wave diffusive wave and kinematic wave models while in section 3 the analytical solutions for steady state flow profiles are derived section 4 presents the results relative to the comparison of the full with both the kinematic and diffusive approximations and the resulting applicability criteria finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 governing equations let us consider a homogeneous layer of a shear thinning power law fluid flowing over a fixed bed with a constant inclination θ with respect to the horizontal plane without lateral inflow or outflow the fluid is regarded as incompressible assuming that spatial variations occur over scales larger than the flow depth flow resistance by the sidewalls is negligible with respect to that by the bottom surface tension is negligible the dimensional depth averaged momentum and mass conservation equations are di cristo et al 2017 1 u h t β h u

steady formulation of the full wave model fwm puts in evidence that similarly to the turbulent clear water tcw case govindaraju et al 1988a b moramarco et al 2008a even for the power law fluids the flow depth profile depends only on fn and k along with the boundary condition in what follows similarly to the tcw case moramarco et al 2008a one of the two pairs f n k or f n k with k kf n 2 l h n tan θ will be considered the diffusive wave model dwm comes from eq 10 neglecting the convective acceleration i e the first term therefore the counterpart of eq 12 reads 13 d h s dwm d x kf n 2 h s dwm 2 n 1 1 h s dwm 2 n 1 the steady formulation of the kinematic wave model kwm which disregards in eq 10 also the pressure gradient term leads to the following simple equation 14 h s kwm 1 3 solution of the steady flow depth profile in order to quantify the errors of the approximated models the solution of eqs 12 14 is needed while this is trivial for the kwm see eq 14 the steady flow depth profile predicted by both full and diffusive wave models has to be evaluated from the integration of the non linear ordinary differential equations 12 and 13 respectively in the present paper a closed form solution has been derived to this aim as far as the fwm is concerned from the integration of eq 12 it follows 15 x const 1 kf n 2 h 2 n 1 h 2 n 1 1 d h β f n 2 h 2 n 1 h 2 n 1 1 d h in eq 15 the subscript s has been dropped for the sake of simplicity the r h s of eq 15 is then rewritten as follows 16 w kf n 2 ξ w 1 ξ d ξ β f n 2 ξ 2 w 1 ξ d ξ with 17 w 1 2 n 1 ξ h 2 n 1 accounting for the chebyshev integral identity weisstein 1998 18 x p 1 x q d x x 1 p f p 1 q p 2 x 1 p f a b c z being the hypergeometric function the closed form solution of eq 15 reads 19 x 1 kf n 2 h 2 n 2 2 n 1

the flow depth profile for 1 x fm 0 may be deduced through the following implicit equation 20 x fm β f n 2 2 n 1 2 n 1 k 2 h 2 n 1 1 n f 2 n 1 2 n 1 1 4 n 2 n 1 h 2 n 1 2 h 2 n 1 1 n f 2 n 1 2 n 1 1 4

such a value of the power law exponent the following expression holds appendix b 21 x fm 1 kf n 2 h h 1 β f n 2 2 ln h 1 h 1 1 β f n 2 2 ln h 1 h 1 β f n 2 ln h h eqs 20 and 21 allow to compute the flow depth profile of steady flow of a power law fluid showing that the hypergeometric functions commonly employed in the context of turbulent clear water flows chyan deng 2014 may be fruitfully used even dealing with different rheologies starting from eqs 20 and 21 and taking the limit for β f n 2 0 its easy to verify that the counterparts of 20 and 21 for the diffusive wave model read 22 x dwm 1

and 3 report the calculated accelerated flow depth profiles for two different froude numbers values namely fig 2 f n 0 1 fig 3 f n 0 5 in a mild slope channel i e f n f n c f n c 1 β being the critical froude number campomaggiore et al 2016 both the full and diffusive wave models have been considered three different n values namely n 0 25 0 5 1 0 have been selected while the kinematic wave number k has been fixed equal to 5 at the downstream end of the channel x 0 critical flow depth h c β f n 2 3 campomaggiore et al 2016 has been imposed for the considered power law exponent values fig 1 depicts the critical flow depth as a function of the froude number figure 1 puts in evidence that owing to the dependence of the momentum correction factor on the power law exponent eq 3 the critical flow depth increases with n for a fixed value of froude number moreover it is also easy to verify that the critical froude number f n c reduces with the power law exponent reaching the minimum value f n c min 0 913 for n 1 figures 2 and 3 indicate that independently of the froude number the power law exponent strongly influences the flow depth profiles for both models the increase of the power law exponent leads to a growth of the flow depth gradient for both models therefore a careful rheological characterization of the flow medium appears to be mandatory for a correct prediction of the accelerated flow depth profiles 4 results based on the above closed forms of the steady flow depth profiles the present section compares the results of the approximated models i e kwm and dwm with those of the fwm to this aim for a fixed value of the power law exponent and of the fn k pair for both approximated wave models awm the spatial distribution of the relative error is evaluated as 24 ε awm x h awm x h fwm x h fwm x following moramarco et al 2008a the analysis has been carried out referring to accelerated hypocritical currents in a mild slope channel and assuming as downstream boundary condition the critical flow depth in this condition the largest errors in the application of the approximated models are expected moramarco et al 2008a in what follows for the sake of comparison the results concerning the turbulent clear water tcw case with the manning resistance formula are also discussed the closed form of the flow depth profile for this case can be found for instance in chyan deng 2014 figure 4 depicts the spatial distribution of the relative error as far as the kwm is concerned εkwm for k 3 5 10 30 three different n values have been considered namely n 0 25 fig 4a n 0 5 fig 4b n 1 0 fig 4c along with the turbulent clear water case tcw fig 4d the froude number has been fixed equal to 0 1 similarly to the turbulent clear water case fig 4d for all n values fig 4a b c show that independently of the k value εkwm increases monotonically with the channel abscissa x and decreases with k for all the values of the kinematic wave number εkwm reduces with n the comparison with the turbulent clear water case fig 4d puts in evidence that the performances of the kinematic wave model significantly depend on the rheology of the flowing medium both a pronounced shear thinning attitude and a small value of the kinematic wave number induce an increase of εkwm for a power law fluid with respect to ε kwm tcw for instance for k 3 at x 0 5 the tcw model predicts ε kwm tcw 0 84 whereas ε kwm n 0 5 1 76 therefore migrating the evaluations for tcw to a shear thinning power law fluid could imply a strong underestimation of the error associated to the kwm model figure 5 depicts the εdwm spatial distribution along the channel for the same k and n values of fig 4 while figs 6 and 7 represent the counterparts of figs 4 and 5 for fn 0 5 figure 5 shows that for all the considered values of power law exponent and kinematic wave number the magnitude of the εdwm is much smaller than the one of the kwm moreover owing to the fulfillment of the downstream boundary condition and differently from the kwm εdwm is a non monotone function along the channel even though all the considered cases show a similar trend the abscissa of the maximum value of εdwm depends on both k and n values an increase of both k and n values shifts downstream the εdwm maximum location the comparison of fig 5a b c with fig 5d suggests that even in applying the dwm model the results deduced for tcw cannot be safely applied for the power law fluids especially for small values of n comparing fig 5c and fig 5d it follows that independently of the k value although very close to the outlet ε dwm tcw overwhelms the corresponding one for the power law fluid in most of the channel ε dwm tcw ε dwm n 0 5 is smaller than 0 5 therefore similarly to the kinematic wave model it is expected that the bounds for a correct application of the dwm in the presence of a power law fluid may significantly differ from those deduced for the tcw case figures 6 and 7 representing the counterparts of figs 4 and 5 for fn 0 5 show that an increase of the froude number leads a reduction for all n and k values of both εkwm and εdwm values although confirming the general trend suggested by the fn 0 1 case an overall analysis of the accuracy of the approximated wave models may be carried out considering the magnitude of the average of the error along the channel moramarco et al 2008a ε awm for the kwm model the average was computed for 0 95 x 0 05 i e considering the part of the channel less influenced by the boundary conditions singh and aravamuthan 1997 moramarco et al 2008a figures 8 and 9 depict for two froude numbers namely fn 0 1 and fn 0 5 the averaged error ε awm as function of the dimensionless parameter k again the n 0 25 0 5 1 0 values along with the tcw case have been considered for both approximated models ε kwm figs 8a and 9a ε dwm figs 8b and 9b figures 8a and 9 put in evidence that independently of n values and similarly to the tcw case ε kwm curves overwhelm the corresponding ones of the diffusive wave model in the fn 0 1 case even of an order of magnitude and for both models the error reduces when the power law exponent increases for fn 0 1 fig 8a and fig 8b show a monotonically decreasing behavior with k moreover they suggest that in averaged sense the results pertaining to the turbulent clear water case may be applicable even for the laminar case i e n 1 especially for the kwm figure 9 indicates that an increase of the froude number has a different effect on the two approximated models in fact for a fixed k value ε kwm decreases from the fn 0 1 to the fn 0 5 case while ε dwm increases furthermore fig 9a hints the same monotone decrease of the error with k while for the dwm fig 9b reveals for very small values of k an increasing trend reaching a peak value and then the usual decreasing behavior finally it is also confirmed that even for fn 0 5 the turbulent and laminar clear water flows have similar results especially for the kwm the results of figs 8 and 9 imply that it is possible to individuate a lower bound of the kinematic wave number k lb above which the approximate wave model is applicable with a prescribed accuracy assuming as applicability condition ε awm 5 moramarco et al 2008a for each n value the applicability map in the plane k f n may be deduced for both kinematic fig 10 a and diffusive fig 10b wave models figure 10a clearly shows that for all n values the lower bound k lb above which the kwm is applicable monotonically decreases when the froude number increases as observed also for the tcw case moreover a decrease of the power law exponent reduces the extension of the applicability region differently fig 10b indicates that as far as the dwm is concerned and similarly to the tcw flow the lower bound k lb is not a monotone function of fn even for the power law fluids also in this case a reduction in terms of power law exponent induces a restriction of the applicability region of the dwm figure 10 points out that for each value of the power law exponent it exists a threshold value k tv max f n k lb which may be considered as a conservative estimate of the lower bound for the applicability of the approximate models with an error less than 5 for all subcritical froude numbers for the tcw flow these threshold values are k tv tcw 1 4 kwm and k tv tcw 0 6 dwm which are in perfect agreement with those deduced by moramarco et al 2008a figure 11 reports for both dwm and kwm the threshold values k tv obtained for several rheological exponents black lines which define for each fluid the limiting k value above which the approximated models can be safely applied for the sake of comparison also the corresponding ones for the tcw case k tv tcw with grey color are reported it can be observed that the dwm has a larger applicability range than the kwm figure 11 demonstrates that in presence of huge quantities of sediments which may lend the mixture a shear thinning power law rheology the applicability criteria deduced for clear water may lead to an incorrect use of both approximated wave models results reported in fig 11 constitute a criterion for the correct application of the kwm and dwm models for mud flows extending to power law fluids the results available in the literature for turbulent clear water flows 5 conclusions the paper investigated the applicability of the kinematic and diffusive wave models for flows of shear thinning fluids described by a power law rheology the study represents an extension to the power law rheology of the steady state analyses previously developed for turbulent clear water tcw flows the procedure is based on the evaluation of the error associated to the application of the approximated models accounting for the non linearity of the governing equations the analysis is carried out starting from the analytical solution of the flow depth profiles of both full and approximated models in an infinitely wide channel under steady state conditions of flow similarly to the turbulent clear water case accelerated hypocritical flows in mild slope channel with free flow outlet condition have been investigated it has been found that in presence of a power law fluid the spatial distribution of the error for both approximated models differs with respect to that of tcw flows revealing the important role of the rheology on the model selection the overall analysis of the accuracy of the approximated models has been carried out considering the magnitude of the average error along the channel length for different rheological exponents and governing dimensionless numbers assuming a threshold on the average error of 5 for a fixed value of the power law index it has been individuated a limit value of the kinematic wave number k tv above which the approximate models are applicable for all the subcritical froude number values present results show that the applicability range of the diffusive wave model is larger than that of the kinematic model and in both cases it decreases when n reduces moreover these applicability ranges especially for fluids with a pronounced shear thinning attitude strongly differ from the corresponding ones for the turbulent clear water case in conclusion present study reveals that the results available in the literature for clear water flows may not be valid for power law fluids and it provides novel specific applicability criteria for this class of fluids in a future research the present analysis will be extended considering different power law rheologies such as the one proposed by lanzoni et al 2017 for debris flows in drained inertial range moreover for addressing problems with realistic mountain topographies often associated to natural avalanches and debris flows the analysis could be performed adopting depth averaged models able to include the bottom curvature effect such as for instance ionescu 2013a b or fent et al 2018 appendix

7406,we investigated the interactions of lake merzbacher with the southern inylchek glacier central tien shan using the synthetic aperture radar sar pixel offset small baseline subset po sbas to derive a time series of three dimensional 3d glacier motion the measurements of 3d glacier velocity were 17 more precise than a previous study that did not use the sbas estimation the velocities of the glacier were up to 58 cm day east 70 cm day north and 113 cm day vertically combining these data with landsat images indicated that movement of the glacier is sensitive to changes of lake merzbacher specifically the entry of more lake water into the glacier during the ablation season increased englacial ablation due to thermal erosion moreover ice calving begins when the lake water gradually lifts the ice dam calving can cause greater loss of glacier mass than normal ablation trying to replenish the front mass loss the distributary accelerates and the mass loss further intensifies a time series of the vertical velocity indicates that the glacier tongue has a huge englacial cavity we suggest that the lake outburst is directly related to the crack of this cavity bursting of the lake triggers a mini surge at the glacier tongue the vertical velocity at the ice dam was 60 cm day before the lake outburst and 113 cm day afterwards after drainage of the lake flow velocities at the distributary do not sharply decrease because pre drainage mass loss needs to be replenished by fast flow based on comparisons with previous measurements our results indicate that the lake had an increasing influence on the glacier from 2005 to 2009 this study demonstrates that a time series of 3d glacier motion based on the po sbas technique is effective for assessing the dynamics of a mountain glacial system and interactions with its glacial lake keywords southern inylchek glacier lake merzbacher lake outburst sar offset tracking po sbas three dimensional glacier motion 1 introduction synthetic aperture radar sar is an effective technique for measuring the 3d velocity of glaciers because it penetrates cloud cover it is unaffected by glacier surface texture and it monitors ground displacements from multiple directions mohr et al 1998 hu et al 2014 monitoring of the flow velocities of tidewater glaciers ocean calving glaciers provides improved understanding of the interactions between glaciers and the ocean because these glaciers lose most of their mass by calving into the ocean mohr et al 1998 gray et al 2005 gray 2011 burgess et al 2013 however the mass of inland glaciers is mainly lost through shrinking or downwasting stationary thinning and it is very difficult to determine the exact glacier mass balance from glacier motion fields in addition random or short term motion monitoring provides insufficient warnings for glacier hazards in spite of the successful use of sar for the study of inland glaciers most previous studies have not clarified the implications of glacier flow velocities kumar et al 2011 hu et al 2014 neelmeijer et al 2014 in fact if an inland glacier directly connects to a glacial lake its motion patterns might differ from those of a land terminated glacier because ice front calving and subglacial thermal erosion can increase loss of mass li et al 2017 specially when water drainage tunnels of a lake pass through the glacier body lake outburst can impact the motion and mass balance of the glacier moreover a lake s storage and outburst indexes which measure the time and frequency of events are sensitive to the dynamics of the glacier which accounts for most of the lake water therefore in addition to monitoring water area and level xie et al 2013 kingslake and ng 2013 it is also necessary to study how a lake influences the motion and mass balance of the glacier to determine the mechanism of the lake outburst three major factors cause vertical displacements of the glacier surface natural flow down the sloping glacier bed changes in ice thickness and surface subsidence or uplift because of englacial structural changes hu et al 2014 hence measurement of 3d glacier motion fields before and after a lake outburst should be the most effective way to study interactions of lakes and glaciers in theory a time series of 3d glacier motion can be acquired by an in situ survey e g gps measurement or by remote sensing displacement detection approaches e g optical offset tracking and sar offset tracking because most glaciers are in remote and inhospitable locations in situ measurements are often temporally and spatially limited optical offset tracking provides a pair of images to produce a 2d glacier motion field multiple image pairs in the spatial and temporal dimensions are then needed to determine a time series of 3d glacier motion however cloud cover reduces the quality of these optical images because the weather in glacial regions is highly variable it is nearly impossible to acquire sufficient cloudless optical image pairs from different angles by contrast sar images are unaffected by cloud cover when used for offset tracking applications sar sensors currently have a wide range of revisit time intervals thus it is possible to choose appropriate types of sar images which maintain the balance between temporal resolution and velocity variations when constructing a meaningful time series of glacier motion neelmeijeri et al derived a time series of 3d motion of a large glacial system in 2014 however they did not perform temporal dimensional adjustment when multi period observations were available sbas is a technique designed for temporal dimensional adjustment of sar observations berardino et al 2002 lanari et al 2004 casu et al 2006 in the study of the time series of 2d glacier motion fields the effects of sbas on improving the result precision has been verified by euillades et al 2016 the objectives of our study are i to investigate the interactions of a large mountain glacial system and its associated glacier lake and ii to identify the mechanism of the outburst of the glacial lake by deriving a time series of 3d glacier motion fields to derive the precise glacier motion fields we integrate po sbas processing with sar 3d displacements resolving we first carried out offset tracking for the ascending and descending terrasar x image sets respectively and then used sbas processing to adjust the pixel offsets in each direction either pixel offsets or differential phases of multiple image pairs can be the inputs for sbas processing casu et al 2011 euillades et al 2016 generally for image pairs with long intervals 0 5 1 year changes in the glacier surface can lead to failures of sar offset tracking however our purpose is to determine changes in glacier motion before and after the lake outburst rather than the seasonal or annual average flow velocities hence image pairs with long intervals are not needed because terrasar x images are available at 11 day intervals we acquired enough redundant observations for most of the study area even if the temporal threshold of image pairs was reduced to 33 days this guaranteed the validity of the sbas technique for our purpose after po sbas we computed 3d glacier displacements from the adjusted offsets in four directions using a least squares procedure and then interpreted displacements using optical images 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site the northern inylchek and southern inylchek glaciers are on the western slope of the tuomuer khan tengri mountain ranges in central tien shan fig 1 these glaciers were once connected but probably separated due to the intensive decline of the northern inylchek glacier during the little ice age mayer et al 2008 sheng et al 2009 glazirin 2010 the southern inylchek glacier is the largest and fastest flowing glacier of the tien shan li et al 2014 during summer glacier meltwater and rain flow enters the lower valley bottom into which the northern inylchek glacier previously extended the southern inylchek glacier blocks this water forming lake merzbacher because glacier ice has plastic behavior and can only bear limited stress a lake outburst occurs almost every year and has even occurred twice in warm years according to data from the xiehela hydrological station over the kumalik river there were 51 outbursts from lake merzbacher between 1956 and 2010 during a lake outburst a large volume of water passes through the tongue of the southern inylchek glacier mayer et al 2008 drainage at the glacier outlet can exceed 1000 m3 s mayer et al 2008 and cause destructive floods in the sary jaz kumalik river mayer et al 2008 sheng et al 2009 xie et al 2013 kingslake and ng 2013 the rising temperatures since the 1980s have led to a much lower ice dam and an accelerated collection of lake water sheng et al 2009 these glacial floods can threaten nearly 20 000 ha of farmlands highlighting the urgent need for studies of outbursts from lake merzbacher fig 2 shows lake merzbacher before and after an outburst that occurred on 6 august 2002 kingslake and ng 2013 the lake water level typically rises quickly during summer because of significant snow ice ablation hence from 1 july to 17 july 2002 the lake area increased by 25 and floating ice bodies mini icebergs accounted for a larger proportion of the lake surface fig 2a and b however the lake water drained almost completely after the outburst and these ice bodies remained in the lake bottom by 18 august 2002 the lake had already shrunk to a small pool 2 2 materials in this paper 20 strip mode terrasar x images acquired during 2009 were used to determine glacier flow velocity the land coverage of the 10 ascending images are indicated by dashed rectangle a in fig 1 and the 10 descending images by dashed rectangle b in fig 1 most images were acquired using the shortest available interval of terrasar x 11 days and the longest interval between consecutive images was 22 days track direction changed in only 3 days supplementary table 1 a major advantage for determining the 3d glacier flow velocity time series the azimuth pixel size of the standard strip mode terrasar x image is 2 00 m and the ground range pixel size varies according to the incidence angle 1 29 2 66 m for incidence angles of 45 20 accordingly the frame length is constant 50 km but the frame width varies with the incidence angle 25 7 33 1 km in this study the incidence angle was 21 945 for the ascending images and 35 320 for the descending images the ground range pixel size was 2 43 m ascending images and 1 57 m descending images the c band srtm dem from cgiar csi http srtm csi cgiar org was used for calculations of glacier motion and landsat images from the usgs http earthexplorer usgs gov were used for interpretation of results 3 methods 3 1 sar offset tracking fig 3 shows the procedures used to derive the time series of 3d glacier velocities there are 3 general steps sar offset tracking po sbas processing and resolution of 3d velocities before offset tracking the first acquired image of each track was chosen as the master image and the other 9 images were co registered with it because we used offset tracking with removal of topographic effects the spatial baseline of the sar image pairs has little influence on precision sansosti et al 2006 li et al 2014 the selection of image pairs for offset tracking was mainly based on the threshold of the temporal baseline the size of the image matching window was carefully selected because it can directly influence the results strozzi et al 2002 when the matching window size decreases within a certain rage the accuracy of calculated offsets improves as the amount of noise increases if offset tracking precision is the main focus the area with effective observations would be very small in this case use of multi level windows for each track is preferred generally a high offset tracking cross correlation coefficient crc threshold should be set to guarantee result accuracy for each image pair the final offsets are then determined by crc weighted averages of the offsets tracked by different matching windows and the average displacement velocities by dividing the offset by the image pair interval in this study offset tracking was used to compute the initial offsets in 4 directions ascending azimuth az ascending line of sight los descending az and descending los to compromise between the number of redundant observations at each point and the spatial coverage of effective observations the temporal baseline threshold of terrasar x image pairs was set to 33 days eighteen image pairs can be formed for each track supplementary table 1 four levels of offset tracking window sizes were set for each track specifically for descending tracks window sizes of 32 32 48 48 64 64 and 80 80 pixels were used in succession the forward steps of the matching window in the azimuth 6 pixels and slant range 8 pixels corresponded to 12 m on the ground the window sizes and steps of the ascending track were kept in accordance with that of the descending track in terms of field distance multiple experiments showed that use of a crc threshold of 0 3 maintained a fine balance between spatial coverage of observations and number of outliers 3 2 pixel offset small baseline subset processing the sbas technique based on pixel offsets was used as previously described berardino et al 2002 lanari et al 2004 casu et al 2006 casu et al 2011 let t be the time vector of n 1 sar images that cover the same area 1 t t 0 t n

of 3d velocities the 3d velocities east north and vertical were computed from the velocity observations in four directions ascending slant range and azimuth directions and descending slant range and azimuth directions using a least squares procedure hu 2013 for slant range los displacement measured via offset tracking the direction away from the radar is positive opposite to that of d insar in terms of the ascending track the projection of los velocity v los a onto the ground i e ground range gr velocity v gr a can be regarded as the combination of east velocity v e a and north velocity v n a and v los a as the combination of vertical velocity v u a and v gr a fig 4 13 v gr a v e sin α a 3 π 2 v n cos α a 3 π 2 v los a v u cos θ a v gr sin θ a where α a is the radar azimuth and θ a is

sin α a 3 π 2 v n sin θ a cos α a 3 π 2 thus in terms of ascending track the azimuth az velocity v az a can be considered a combination of v e a and v n a fialko et al 2001 fig 4b 15 v az a v e cos α

measurement errors in offset tracking are inevitable eq 17 should be written as 18 b 2 x v l where v is the vector of measurement errors assuming that offset tracking errors are randomly distributed we can acquire the optimal estimation of 3d velocities x using a least squares procedure v t pv min 19 x b 2 t pb 2 1 b 2 t pl σ x 2 b 2 t pb 2 1 where σ x 2 is the variance of x and p is the matrix of the weight assuming that the velocity observations of the four directions are independent yields the following 20 p σ los a 2 0 0 0 0 σ az a 2 0 0 0 0 σ los d 2 0 0 0 0 σ az d 2 where σ los a σ az a σ los d and σ az d are the standard deviations of v los a v az a v los d and v az d respectively if the velocity observations within a regular window centered at point x y obey a gaussian distribution the standard deviation σ of the velocity observation at that point x y can be calculated as jung et al 2011 21 σ n v i j v i j 2 n 1 where v i j are the observations v i j are the averages of observations within the window and n is the number of observations in the window in addition to the standard deviations of observations the crc of offset tracking can be used to determine p the calculation of x is iterative and the estimation of v can be used to optimize p until improvement of x is below a threshold after the po sbas estimation the 3d velocity was independently resolved for each period before this procedure the descending and ascending velocity fields were overlapped and transformed from the sar coordinate system to the geographical system the variation from the ascending to descending track only takes 3 days supplementary table 1 designation of glacier velocities at the time of first image as zero means there are observations at 10 times to minimize the effects of temporal differences between descending and ascending glacier velocities the ascending observations were interpolated to the time of the corresponding descending observations using a shape preserving piecewise cubic interpolation the construction of matrix b 2 and p eq 19 is needed to resolve 3d velocity use of one of the terrasar x ascending descending image combinations in this study as an example where θ a α a θ d and α d are typically 21 945 348 496 35 496 and 190 275 respectively yields 22 b 2 0 928 0 366 0 075 0 0 199 0 980 0 816 0 569 0 103 0 0 178 0 984 for b 2 the condition number of the second norm is only 1 975 indicating the numerical stability of eq 18 hu 2013 thus slight variations in the observations will not have a major impact on the solutions in addition the standard deviation of the velocity observation σ was used to determine the initial weight matrix p during the iteration the elements of p were adjusted based on the corresponding elements of v using robust estimation wang et al 2006 the iteration proceeds until improvement of x is less than 0 1 cm day 4 results 4 1 uncertainty analysis we used the 2000 srtm dem as an external dem and found that elevation errors caused by changes in glacier thickness had limited influence on offset tracking according to li et al 2014 if glacier thinning during 2000 2009 is up to 80 m the corresponding los velocity errors of the ascending and descending tracks in this study will be 1 6 cm day and 1 2 cm day respectively and the az velocity errors can be neglected below 0 1 cm day the sar co registration precision in the glacial region is 1 10 pixel li et al 2014 corresponding to an az velocity error of 1 8 cm day and an los velocity error of 1 4 2 2 cm day the glacier velocity results are a time series and the spatial coverage of the final velocity fields is the intersection of 18 period offsets however by integrating the offset fields estimated from multiple window sizes either in glacial or nonglacial area our spatial coverages of observations are much larger than that of neelmeijer et al 2014 in the present study we used velocities in the nonglacial area to scale glacier velocity errors based on the assumption that the nonglacial area is stable neelmeijer et al 2014 estimated offsets using a single match window and sbas estimation was not performed for the same image pairs our method indicated a 17 smaller 3d velocity in the nonglacial area for the 9 periods of 2009 period 1 24 may 04 jun period 2 04 jun 26 jun period 3 26 jun 07 jul period 4 07 jul 18 jul period 5 18 jul 29 jul period 6 29 jul 09 aug period 7 09 aug 31 aug period 8 31 aug 22 sep period 9 22 sep 03 oct the errors ranged from 1 1 to 2 2 cm day for east velocity from 0 7 to 1 5 cm day for north velocity and from 0 6 to 1 2 cm day for vertical velocity 4 2 overview of 3d glacier motion fields based on in situ observations by the gottfried merzbacher global change observatory the 2009 outburst of lake merzbacher occurred on august 6 neelmeijer et al 2014 thus given the objectives of this study we only elaborated glacier velocities during periods close to this event periods 4 8 when the lake level changed substantially and had remarkable influence on the glacier supplementary figs 1 3 show the entire time series of the 3d velocity fields to highlight the features of glacier motion changes the ranges of the color bars were unified 50 cm day to 50 cm day fig 4 shows the positive directions of the velocity components we extracted the velocities along six profiles fig 5 v8 and within seven regions fig 5v6 for quantitative comparisons fig 6 and table 1 the front of the ice dam had a substantial change before and after the lake outburst period 6 so offset tracking of some image pairs failed there our 3d velocity measurements did not fully cover the ice dam the spatial variations of the glacier velocities were continuous consistent with the basic features of glacier motion the peak of glacier movement occurred during period 6 during which the lake outburst occurred prominent north and east velocities were observed at the distributary and trunk of the southern inylchek glacier respectively during periods 1 5 and 7 9 the glacier body decelerated remarkably after passing the ice dam because a large part of the mass was diverted into the lake the highest east velocity up to 58 cm day and north velocity up to 70 cm day were observed at the front of the ice dam during periods 5 and 6 respectively most east velocities ranged from 50 to 25 cm day in the trunk on the eastern side of the ice dam upstream but ranged from 15 to 0 cm day on the western side downstream during periods 1 5 and 7 9 the highest north velocities were observed at the fork rather than the front of the ice dam most of the north velocities at the distributary ranged from 20 to 35 cm day prominent vertical velocities could be observed at the distributary and trunk the vertical velocities were the greatest at the front of the ice dam 60 cm day during period 5 113 cm day during period 6 except for the ice dam most parts of the distributary had vertical velocities from 10 cm day to 4 cm day during periods 5 7 the largest vertical velocity of the trunk more than 12 cm day was on the west side of the ice dam during period 6 region a5 our records of the 3d velocities of the northern inylchek glacier indicate much slower movement the east north and vertical velocities all had small differences mostly within 5 cm day to 5 cm day 4 3 time series of 3d glacier motion fields below we summarize the changes in glacier velocity between adjacent periods from period 4 to 5 the north velocity of region a4 increased by 13 1 2 2 cm day in region a3 the downward velocity increased by 47 8 1 0 cm day however the horizontal velocity increased by only 2 1 0 5 cm day the west and downward velocities of the trunk on the east side of the ice dam increased the increasing gradient was greater in the upper reaches the west velocity increased by 9 0 3 0 cm day in region a1 and by 2 7 1 7 cm day in region a2 and the downward velocity increased by 91 3 2 1 cm day in region a1 and by 38 3 0 9 cm day in region a2 on the west side of the ice dam the west velocity decreased by 8 0 0 7 cm day in region a5 but increased by 46 8 2 2 cm day in region a6 meanwhile the subsidence in region a6 was turned into uplifting from period 5 to 6 the north velocity increased by 85 3 16 2 cm day in region a4 and by 17 9 3 0 cm day in region a3 and the downward velocity increased by 617 2 17 9 cm day in region a4 and by 73 5 2 5 cm day in region a3 along profile 4 the increments of west and down velocities were up to 10 cm day and 5 5 cm day respectively however the west velocities decreased by 5 2 1 9 cm day in region a1 and by 0 6 0 2 cm day in region a2 the downward velocity decreased by 13 6 0 6 cm day in region a1 but increased by 12 3 0 4 cm day in region a2 the most notable changes were in the trunk on the west side of the ice dam the horizontal velocity increased by 109 8 9 0 cm day in region a5 and by 86 2 6 5 cm day in region a6 moreover the downward velocity in region a5 increased by 150 2 1 cm day from period 6 to 7 the horizontal velocity decreased by 11 1 3 9 cm day in region a1 and by 10 7 3 4 cm day in region a2 and the downward velocity decreased by 35 1 1 3 cm day in region a1 and by 37 8 1 4 cm day in region a2 the horizontal velocity decreased by 43 0 7 4 cm day in region a5 23 7 9 0 cm day in region a4 and 16 1 4 7 cm day in region a3 but these velocities were still greater than those of period 5 the horizontal velocity in region a6 decreased by 68 4 9 6 cm day in region a5 the downward velocity decreased to the level recorded during period 5 but it increased in region a6 by 469 7 1 6 cm day from period 7 to 8 the horizontal and vertical velocities in all the regions continued to decrease however region a4 had a horizontal velocity that was 22 7 4 2 cm day higher than that of period 4 5 discussion 5 1 interactions of lake merzbacher with the southern inylchek glacier mayer et al 2008 conducted field gps surveys at 22 stakes distributed over the southern inylchek glacier between 30 july and 10 august 2005 after the first lake outburst and measured 3d glacier flow velocities at 15 stakes they also estimated the surface level 2d velocities over long intervals 96 days 1 year using optical image offset tracking based on precise in situ measurements their report was the first to describe the response of ice dam motion to the outburst of lake merzbacher table 2 however in spite of the high precision there was limited temporal and spatial coverage 10 days for 3 profiles near lake merzbacher and the timing of optical offset tracking did not coincide with the field surveys therefore this initial study only identified the responses of the ice flow split zone and ice dam after the lake outburst several subsequent studies erten et al 2009 li et al 2014 nobakht et al 2014 shangguan et al 2015 adopted optical or sar offset tracking to estimate the surface level 2d flow velocity of the southern inylchek glacier however the temporal resolutions of these studies were too low at least 46 days table 2 to determine the influence of lake merzbacher on the southern inylchek glacier only a few features of the velocity such as split flow towards the lake can be recognized neelmeijer et al 2014 derived a time series of the 3d motion of the southern inylchek glacier using sar offset tracking to terrasar x images of descending and ascending tracks due to the fine spatial 3 m and temporal 11 days resolutions of the terrasar x images knowledge of the southern inylchek glacier has greatly improved however most interpretations have focused on the relationship between glacier motion and meteorological conditions in terms of the interactions of lake merzbacher with the southern inylchek glacier this previous work is equivalent to measurements of 2d glacier velocities thus we interpreted the time series of 3d glacier motion fields to provide more comprehensive knowledge of the interactions between the glacier and lake 5 1 1 pre outburst phases analysis of the distributary and trunk indicated the horizontal velocities during periods 1 3 were higher than during period 4 supplementary figs 1 3 this difference was primarily due to temperature changes neelmeijer et al 2014 from period 4 to period 5 the ice front began to float because the water level rose remarkably therefore the entire a4 region had downward velocities during periods 1 3 but its northern part had significant upward velocities during periods 4 5 fig 5v4 v5 and table 1 in addition the resistance to forward movement of the ice dam declined as its front started to float therefore the north velocity of the ice dam increased at the same time more lake water entered the distributary via holes and crevasses at the bottom of the ice dam as mentioned in the introduction natural flow down the sloping glacier bed and ice thickness changes can cause vertical displacements of the glacier surface the thermal erosion by the relatively warm lake water exacerbated the subglacial ablation therefore the downward velocity of the fork a3 increased considerably although the horizontal velocities barely changed the downward velocity and its change over time were considerably greater on the west side of profile 4 than the east side because of the abrupt slope on the west side in which the elevation decreases by 50 m over a horizontal distance of 450 m mayer et al 2008 this slope blocked the movement of lake water so only the west side experienced erosion because the horizontal velocity at the fork region a3 barely changed the increase of the west velocity in the upstream trunk regions a1 and a2 which is further from the ice dam was unrelated to changes of lake merzbacher in addition the variation of the downward velocity was consistent with the west velocity the acceleration on the east side of the ice dam was mainly from the increasing basal meltwater which promoted basal sliding at the fork more mass turned to the ice dam but the total mass of the upper reaches barely changed and the compressive force along the trunk decreased however these effects did not affect the downstream region as a result the west velocity decreased in the upper reaches of the trunk on the west side of the ice dam but it increased in the lower reaches we classified period 3 with the pre outburst periods because it included only 3 post outburst days from period 5 to 6 a larger proportion of the ice dam started to float and more ice calved into the lake fig 2 shows that the debris over the ice dam almost disappeared during the days immediately before the outburst while the number of icebergs in the lake increased remarkably the intensified ice dam floating and ice front calving reduced the resistance to forward motion of the ice dam in addition the loss of glacier mass from ice calving was much more rapid than the loss from ablation so the glacier kept accelerating and this replenished the loss of mass at the ice front mayer et al 2008 at that time the compressive flow at the ice dam was converted into extensive flow and the north velocity at the calving front increased substantially however further from the ice front the decrement gradient of the resistance quickly reduced so the north velocity at the fork increased moderately after the outburst of lake merzbacher the floating part of the ice dam began to sink in addition the ice dam thinned remarkably due to thermal erosion and this explains why the downward velocity of the ice front after the outburst was much higher than the upward velocity before the outburst based on the large variations in the gradients of the downward velocities mayer et al 2008 reported that the grounding line of the ice dam was located near profile 4 west side however our data fig 5v6 shows that further from the ice front the downward velocity declined sharply from 113 cm day to 10 cm day and then slowly to 4 cm day it then gradually increased to 11 cm day on the west side of profile 4 because of the uneven distribution of the downward velocities it is unlikely that the floating ice body extended from the ice front to profile 4 as mentioned above the high downward velocities on the west side of profile 4 were due to its abrupt slope enhanced basal lubrication and basal ablation in fact as shown in fig 5v4 v6 a line appears to separate the abrupt changes of vertical velocity close to profile 5 this line is 0 55 km behind the ice front and is more likely to be the location of the grounding line mayer et al 2008 used gps to measure horizontal velocities near profile 4 from 30 july to 8 august 2005 10 days after the first outburst in 2005 and reported they were close to those measured from 25 june 2003 to 11 june 2004 using optical offset tracking this indicates that lake merzbacher did not affect profile 4 however in the present study the west and downward velocities of profile 4 were considerably increased due to the lake level changes indicating that lake merzbacher had an increasing influence from 2005 to 2009 this result is consistent with the results of our previous study of changes in glacier thickness li et al 2017 a comparison of the srtm dem with the new tandem x dem indicated the ice dam was much lower in 2012 than 2000 supplementary fig 4 as the loss of glacier mass in the inylchek valley continued water accumulated more rapidly in lake merzbacher during the ablation season consequently the loss of mass at the distributary caused by englacial thermal erosion and ice calving exceeded the increase of mass from glacier flow the ice thickness of the trunk on the east side of the ice dam decreased greatly after period 5 so the forces driving the flow were weaker during period 6 the ablation was more severe in the lower reaches region a2 than in the upper reaches region a1 however the continuously increasing basal meltwater partly counteracted the effects of glacier thinning hence the changes of horizontal and downward velocity from period 5 to 6 were quite different after lake merzbacher drained a large volume of lake water rapidly flowed through the englacial channels and this promoted shear and basal sliding therefore the west velocity of the entire trunk on the west side of the ice dam increased sharply creating a mini surge this finding is consistent with the results of neelmeijer et al 2014 undoubtedly the mini surge transferred more glacier mass to the lower reaches and exacerbated the loss of mass interestingly we found that region a5 had prominent downward and west velocities during period 6 fig 5v6 and 5e6 region a5 is a considerable distance from the ice dam and should not float before the outburst the shape of the subsided area was regular and symmetrical so the prominent downward velocity could not be due to an abrupt slope to verify this we checked the surface slope distribution in contrast to region a3 region a5 had no prominent changes in slope thus we suggest that a large englacial cavity is located in region a5 and when water pressure cracks the walls of this cavity the outburst occurred and the stored meltwater flowed away without support the surface ice body subsides 5 1 2 post outburst phases after lake drainage glacier flow replenishes the mass loss at the ice dam caused by basal erosion and ice calving however the resistance to the forward movement of the ice dam certainly increased because the ice dam completely sank to the lake bed therefore the horizontal velocities of ice front during period 7 were greater than during periods 4 5 but still lower than during period 6 the horizontal and downward velocities at the fork had similar patterns as the temperature began to drop during period 7 neelmeijer et al 2014 the loss of mass on the trunk on the east side of the ice dam slowed and the amount of basal meltwater decreased because of the continuing ablation the ice body was thinner during period 7 than period 6 so the downward and horizontal velocities decreased from period 6 to 7 the horizontal velocities of regions a2 and a7 increased from period 4 to 5 and then continuously decreased from period 5 to 8 whereas the downward velocities continuously increased from period 4 to 6 and then decreased from period 6 to 8 moreover for the trunk on the east side of the ice dam supplementary figs 1 3 the horizontal velocities during periods 1 3 were higher than during period 6 however the downward velocities were lower these phenomena indicate that the ablation intensity of the northern and southern inylchek glaciers reached peaks during period 6 after drainage of the lake in addition to region a2 the horizontal velocities of regions a1 a5 and a6 also decreased however in contrast to regions a1 a2 and a6 region a5 had greater horizontal velocities during period 7 than periods 4 5 it is likely that the ability of the ice body in region a5 to bear longitudinal compressive forces declined after drainage of the englacial cavity interestingly region a6 mainly had upward velocities during periods 5 and 6 but had a downward velocity during period 7 fig 5v5 v7 thus we suggest that region a6 has a smaller englacial cavity because this cavity is located at the lower reaches it can still collect a large amount of meltwater after lake drainage this explains the uplift of the glacier surface during period 6 however the amount of basal meltwater decreased during period 7 leading to subsidence of the glacier surface 5 2 mechanism of lake merzbacher outburst multi year measurements confirm that the outburst of lake merzbacher is periodic sheng et al 2009 based on our findings and previous results mayer et al 2008 we suggest the reason for these periodic outbursts is that this drainage system alternates between expansion and compression this drainage system extends from the constant holes and crevasses at the bottom of the ice dam to the main outlet of the southern inylchek glacier near the terminus at the beginning of the ablation season the volume of lake water flowing into the southern inylchek glacier increases and this increases the water pressure on the walls of englacial cavities and drainage channels at the same time the warm lake water seriously erodes the contact ice together these increase the cross sectional areas of the drainage channels after lifting of the ice dam the englacial water pressure increases dramatically when this pressure exceeds the limit that choke points and walls of the channels can bear it cracks the englacial cavity and the joint walls of the adjacent channels break through this activates the whole drainage system leading to lake outburst after the peak of water discharge the pressure in the drainage channels quickly drops and the ice dam sinks to the lake bed due to the plasticity of the glacier body and the constant compressive motion the cross sectional areas of the drainage channels gradually shrink however subsidence of the ice dam does not halt the drainage otherwise the lake water cannot quickly drain to the extent shown in fig 2c in general the lifting of the ice dam and the cracking of the englacial cavity play key roles in accelerating the outburst of lake merzbacher our results show that the lifting of the ice dam is a gradual process and that excessive englacial pressure rather than the floating of the ice dam appears to control this drainage system 6 conclusion we measured changes of 3d glacier motion over time to investigate the interactions of lake merzbacher with the southern inylchek glacier during the ablation season our use of the sbas technique improved the precision of the measured glacier velocities by combining 3 landsat images we found high correlations of the motion and mass balance of the southern inylchek glacier with the dynamics of lake merzbacher before the outburst lake water enters the glacier via crevasses and holes in the ice dam and erodes the englacial ice during this process the ice dam gradually moves upward due to water pressure therefore ice calving starts at the front as the water continues to rise ice calving leads to severe loss of mass and more parts of the ice dam start to float this accelerates the distributary so the loss of mass becomes increasingly severe due to the englacial erosion and lifting of the ice dam the volume of englacial water increases dramatically the vertical velocity time series indicates a huge englacial cavity at the glacier tongue we suggest that lake outburst occurs when extreme water pressure cracks the englacial cavity as the lake drains the velocity of the glacier tongue more than doubles so that more mass is transferred to the lower reaches where it undergoes strong ablation after drainage of the lake the 3d velocities at the glacier tongue and distributary slowly drop because the loss of mass at the ice front needs to be supplemented by fast flow based on the recognition that changes in ice thickness contribute to vertical displacements of the glacier we found that the time of the lake outburst was associated with the peak of glacier ablation furthermore a comparison of our results with previous studies indicates that the lake affected more of the glacier in 2009 than in 2005 this study points to the benefits of using sar for measurement of glacier velocities however the method we adopted requires two sets of images in different tracks when applied to fast flowing or maritime glaciers the method further requires fine temporal resolution of images which means a big number of images must

7406,we investigated the interactions of lake merzbacher with the southern inylchek glacier central tien shan using the synthetic aperture radar sar pixel offset small baseline subset po sbas to derive a time series of three dimensional 3d glacier motion the measurements of 3d glacier velocity were 17 more precise than a previous study that did not use the sbas estimation the velocities of the glacier were up to 58 cm day east 70 cm day north and 113 cm day vertically combining these data with landsat images indicated that movement of the glacier is sensitive to changes of lake merzbacher specifically the entry of more lake water into the glacier during the ablation season increased englacial ablation due to thermal erosion moreover ice calving begins when the lake water gradually lifts the ice dam calving can cause greater loss of glacier mass than normal ablation trying to replenish the front mass loss the distributary accelerates and the mass loss further intensifies a time series of the vertical velocity indicates that the glacier tongue has a huge englacial cavity we suggest that the lake outburst is directly related to the crack of this cavity bursting of the lake triggers a mini surge at the glacier tongue the vertical velocity at the ice dam was 60 cm day before the lake outburst and 113 cm day afterwards after drainage of the lake flow velocities at the distributary do not sharply decrease because pre drainage mass loss needs to be replenished by fast flow based on comparisons with previous measurements our results indicate that the lake had an increasing influence on the glacier from 2005 to 2009 this study demonstrates that a time series of 3d glacier motion based on the po sbas technique is effective for assessing the dynamics of a mountain glacial system and interactions with its glacial lake keywords southern inylchek glacier lake merzbacher lake outburst sar offset tracking po sbas three dimensional glacier motion 1 introduction synthetic aperture radar sar is an effective technique for measuring the 3d velocity of glaciers because it penetrates cloud cover it is unaffected by glacier surface texture and it monitors ground displacements from multiple directions mohr et al 1998 hu et al 2014 monitoring of the flow velocities of tidewater glaciers ocean calving glaciers provides improved understanding of the interactions between glaciers and the ocean because these glaciers lose most of their mass by calving into the ocean mohr et al 1998 gray et al 2005 gray 2011 burgess et al 2013 however the mass of inland glaciers is mainly lost through shrinking or downwasting stationary thinning and it is very difficult to determine the exact glacier mass balance from glacier motion fields in addition random or short term motion monitoring provides insufficient warnings for glacier hazards in spite of the successful use of sar for the study of inland glaciers most previous studies have not clarified the implications of glacier flow velocities kumar et al 2011 hu et al 2014 neelmeijer et al 2014 in fact if an inland glacier directly connects to a glacial lake its motion patterns might differ from those of a land terminated glacier because ice front calving and subglacial thermal erosion can increase loss of mass li et al 2017 specially when water drainage tunnels of a lake pass through the glacier body lake outburst can impact the motion and mass balance of the glacier moreover a lake s storage and outburst indexes which measure the time and frequency of events are sensitive to the dynamics of the glacier which accounts for most of the lake water therefore in addition to monitoring water area and level xie et al 2013 kingslake and ng 2013 it is also necessary to study how a lake influences the motion and mass balance of the glacier to determine the mechanism of the lake outburst three major factors cause vertical displacements of the glacier surface natural flow down the sloping glacier bed changes in ice thickness and surface subsidence or uplift because of englacial structural changes hu et al 2014 hence measurement of 3d glacier motion fields before and after a lake outburst should be the most effective way to study interactions of lakes and glaciers in theory a time series of 3d glacier motion can be acquired by an in situ survey e g gps measurement or by remote sensing displacement detection approaches e g optical offset tracking and sar offset tracking because most glaciers are in remote and inhospitable locations in situ measurements are often temporally and spatially limited optical offset tracking provides a pair of images to produce a 2d glacier motion field multiple image pairs in the spatial and temporal dimensions are then needed to determine a time series of 3d glacier motion however cloud cover reduces the quality of these optical images because the weather in glacial regions is highly variable it is nearly impossible to acquire sufficient cloudless optical image pairs from different angles by contrast sar images are unaffected by cloud cover when used for offset tracking applications sar sensors currently have a wide range of revisit time intervals thus it is possible to choose appropriate types of sar images which maintain the balance between temporal resolution and velocity variations when constructing a meaningful time series of glacier motion neelmeijeri et al derived a time series of 3d motion of a large glacial system in 2014 however they did not perform temporal dimensional adjustment when multi period observations were available sbas is a technique designed for temporal dimensional adjustment of sar observations berardino et al 2002 lanari et al 2004 casu et al 2006 in the study of the time series of 2d glacier motion fields the effects of sbas on improving the result precision has been verified by euillades et al 2016 the objectives of our study are i to investigate the interactions of a large mountain glacial system and its associated glacier lake and ii to identify the mechanism of the outburst of the glacial lake by deriving a time series of 3d glacier motion fields to derive the precise glacier motion fields we integrate po sbas processing with sar 3d displacements resolving we first carried out offset tracking for the ascending and descending terrasar x image sets respectively and then used sbas processing to adjust the pixel offsets in each direction either pixel offsets or differential phases of multiple image pairs can be the inputs for sbas processing casu et al 2011 euillades et al 2016 generally for image pairs with long intervals 0 5 1 year changes in the glacier surface can lead to failures of sar offset tracking however our purpose is to determine changes in glacier motion before and after the lake outburst rather than the seasonal or annual average flow velocities hence image pairs with long intervals are not needed because terrasar x images are available at 11 day intervals we acquired enough redundant observations for most of the study area even if the temporal threshold of image pairs was reduced to 33 days this guaranteed the validity of the sbas technique for our purpose after po sbas we computed 3d glacier displacements from the adjusted offsets in four directions using a least squares procedure and then interpreted displacements using optical images 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site the northern inylchek and southern inylchek glaciers are on the western slope of the tuomuer khan tengri mountain ranges in central tien shan fig 1 these glaciers were once connected but probably separated due to the intensive decline of the northern inylchek glacier during the little ice age mayer et al 2008 sheng et al 2009 glazirin 2010 the southern inylchek glacier is the largest and fastest flowing glacier of the tien shan li et al 2014 during summer glacier meltwater and rain flow enters the lower valley bottom into which the northern inylchek glacier previously extended the southern inylchek glacier blocks this water forming lake merzbacher because glacier ice has plastic behavior and can only bear limited stress a lake outburst occurs almost every year and has even occurred twice in warm years according to data from the xiehela hydrological station over the kumalik river there were 51 outbursts from lake merzbacher between 1956 and 2010 during a lake outburst a large volume of water passes through the tongue of the southern inylchek glacier mayer et al 2008 drainage at the glacier outlet can exceed 1000 m3 s mayer et al 2008 and cause destructive floods in the sary jaz kumalik river mayer et al 2008 sheng et al 2009 xie et al 2013 kingslake and ng 2013 the rising temperatures since the 1980s have led to a much lower ice dam and an accelerated collection of lake water sheng et al 2009 these glacial floods can threaten nearly 20 000 ha of farmlands highlighting the urgent need for studies of outbursts from lake merzbacher fig 2 shows lake merzbacher before and after an outburst that occurred on 6 august 2002 kingslake and ng 2013 the lake water level typically rises quickly during summer because of significant snow ice ablation hence from 1 july to 17 july 2002 the lake area increased by 25 and floating ice bodies mini icebergs accounted for a larger proportion of the lake surface fig 2a and b however the lake water drained almost completely after the outburst and these ice bodies remained in the lake bottom by 18 august 2002 the lake had already shrunk to a small pool 2 2 materials in this paper 20 strip mode terrasar x images acquired during 2009 were used to determine glacier flow velocity the land coverage of the 10 ascending images are indicated by dashed rectangle a in fig 1 and the 10 descending images by dashed rectangle b in fig 1 most images were acquired using the shortest available interval of terrasar x 11 days and the longest interval between consecutive images was 22 days track direction changed in only 3 days supplementary table 1 a major advantage for determining the 3d glacier flow velocity time series the azimuth pixel size of the standard strip mode terrasar x image is 2 00 m and the ground range pixel size varies according to the incidence angle 1 29 2 66 m for incidence angles of 45 20 accordingly the frame length is constant 50 km but the frame width varies with the incidence angle 25 7 33 1 km in this study the incidence angle was 21 945 for the ascending images and 35 320 for the descending images the ground range pixel size was 2 43 m ascending images and 1 57 m descending images the c band srtm dem from cgiar csi http srtm csi cgiar org was used for calculations of glacier motion and landsat images from the usgs http earthexplorer usgs gov were used for interpretation of results 3 methods 3 1 sar offset tracking fig 3 shows the procedures used to derive the time series of 3d glacier velocities there are 3 general steps sar offset tracking po sbas processing and resolution of 3d velocities before offset tracking the first acquired image of each track was chosen as the master image and the other 9 images were co registered with it because we used offset tracking with removal of topographic effects the spatial baseline of the sar image pairs has little influence on precision sansosti et al 2006 li et al 2014 the selection of image pairs for offset tracking was mainly based on the threshold of the temporal baseline the size of the image matching window was carefully selected because it can directly influence the results strozzi et al 2002 when the matching window size decreases within a certain rage the accuracy of calculated offsets improves as the amount of noise increases if offset tracking precision is the main focus the area with effective observations would be very small in this case use of multi level windows for each track is preferred generally a high offset tracking cross correlation coefficient crc threshold should be set to guarantee result accuracy for each image pair the final offsets are then determined by crc weighted averages of the offsets tracked by different matching windows and the average displacement velocities by dividing the offset by the image pair interval in this study offset tracking was used to compute the initial offsets in 4 directions ascending azimuth az ascending line of sight los descending az and descending los to compromise between the number of redundant observations at each point and the spatial coverage of effective observations the temporal baseline threshold of terrasar x image pairs was set to 33 days eighteen image pairs can be formed for each track supplementary table 1 four levels of offset tracking window sizes were set for each track specifically for descending tracks window sizes of 32 32 48 48 64 64 and 80 80 pixels were used in succession the forward steps of the matching window in the azimuth 6 pixels and slant range 8 pixels corresponded to 12 m on the ground the window sizes and steps of the ascending track were kept in accordance with that of the descending track in terms of field distance multiple experiments showed that use of a crc threshold of 0 3 maintained a fine balance between spatial coverage of observations and number of outliers 3 2 pixel offset small baseline subset processing the sbas technique based on pixel offsets was used as previously described berardino et al 2002 lanari et al 2004 casu et al 2006 casu et al 2011 let t be the time vector of n 1 sar images that cover the same area 1 t t 0 t n t consideration of temporal and spatial baseline thresholds allows grouping of images into m pairs 2 n 1 2 m n n 1 2 if the time of the first image t 0 is the reference time the relative offset d t i at time t i i 1 n is the parameter to be solved 3 d d t 1 d t n t the offsets δ d j j 1 m derived from pixel by pixel matching of m image pairs are the observations 4 δ d δ d 1 δ d m t for m image pairs the acquisition order of master and slave images is m j and s j j 1 m respectively if the master and slave images are aligned in sequence then m j s j j 1 m and 5 δ d j d t m j d t s j j 1 m eq

0 0 1 0 if l is the number of the small baseline subset the rank of matrix a is n l 1 notably when l is greater than 1 matrix a is rank defect in this case singular value decomposition is used to assure that equation δ d ad provides the minimum norm least squares solution 8 d q e 1 0 0 0 u t δ d where u is an orthogonal matrix with dimension m m and consisting of the eigenvector of aa t q is an orthogonal matrix with dimension n n and consisting of the eigenvector of a t a e 1 is diag 1 σ 1 1 σ e and σ i is the singular of matrix a to derive a meaningful glacier velocity time series the

provides average displacement velocity over each period v offset tracking in each direction provided offsets of eighteen periods δ d in eq 11 and allowed estimation of the glacier velocities of nine

of 3d velocities the 3d velocities east north and vertical were computed from the velocity observations in four directions ascending slant range and azimuth directions and descending slant range and azimuth directions using a least squares procedure hu 2013 for slant range los displacement measured via offset tracking the direction away from the radar is positive opposite to that of d insar in terms of the ascending track the projection of los velocity v los a onto the ground i e ground range gr velocity v gr a can be regarded as the combination of east velocity v e a and north velocity v n a and v los a as the combination of vertical velocity v u a and v gr a fig 4 13 v gr a v e sin α a 3 π 2 v n cos α a 3 π 2 v los a v u cos θ a v gr sin θ a where α a is the radar azimuth and θ a is the incidence angle we obtain the relationship between v los a and 3d velocities by substituting the first subequation of eq 13 into the second one fialko et al 2001 14 v los a v u cos θ a v e sin θ a sin α a 3 π 2 v n sin θ a cos α a 3 π 2 thus in terms of ascending track the azimuth az velocity v az a can be considered a combination of v e a and v n a fialko et al 2001 fig 4b 15 v az a v e cos α

3 π 2 v n sin θ d cos α d 3 π 2 v az d v e cos α d 3 π 2 v n sin α d 3 π 2 where the superscript d indicates descending track eqs 1416 can be simplified to 17 b 2 x l b 2 x l l v los a v az a v los d

measurement errors in offset tracking are inevitable eq 17 should be written as 18 b 2 x v l where v is the vector of measurement errors assuming that offset tracking errors are randomly distributed we can acquire the optimal estimation of 3d velocities x using a least squares procedure v t pv min 19 x b 2 t pb 2 1 b 2 t pl σ x 2 b 2 t pb 2 1 where σ x 2 is the variance of x and p is the matrix of the weight assuming that the velocity observations of the four directions are independent yields the following 20 p σ los a 2 0 0 0 0 σ az a 2 0 0 0 0 σ los d 2 0 0 0 0 σ az d 2 where σ los a σ az a σ los d and σ az d are the standard deviations of v los a v az a v los d and v az d respectively if the velocity observations within a regular window centered at point x y obey a gaussian distribution the standard deviation σ of the velocity observation at that point x y can be calculated as jung et al 2011 21 σ n v i j v i j 2 n 1 where v i j are the observations v i j are the averages of observations within the window and n is the number of observations in the window in addition to the standard deviations of observations the crc of offset tracking can be used to determine p the calculation of x is iterative and the estimation of v can be used to optimize p until improvement of x is below a threshold after the po sbas estimation the 3d velocity was independently resolved for each period before this procedure the descending and ascending velocity fields were overlapped and transformed from the sar coordinate system to the geographical system the variation from the ascending to descending track only takes 3 days supplementary table 1 designation of glacier velocities at the time of first image as zero means there are observations at 10 times to minimize the effects of temporal differences between descending and ascending glacier velocities the ascending observations were interpolated to the time of the corresponding descending observations using a shape preserving piecewise cubic interpolation the construction of matrix b 2 and p eq 19 is needed to resolve 3d velocity use of one of the terrasar x ascending descending image combinations in this study as an example where θ a α a θ d and α d are typically 21 945 348 496 35 496 and 190 275 respectively yields 22 b 2 0 928 0 366 0 075 0 0 199 0 980 0 816 0 569 0 103 0 0 178 0 984 for b 2 the condition number of the second norm is only 1 975 indicating the numerical stability of eq 18 hu 2013 thus slight variations in the observations will not have a major impact on the solutions in addition the standard deviation of the velocity observation σ was used to determine the initial weight matrix p during the iteration the elements of p were adjusted based on the corresponding elements of v using robust estimation wang et al 2006 the iteration proceeds until improvement of x is less than 0 1 cm day 4 results 4 1 uncertainty analysis we used the 2000 srtm dem as an external dem and found that elevation errors caused by changes in glacier thickness had limited influence on offset tracking according to li et al 2014 if glacier thinning during 2000 2009 is up to 80 m the corresponding los velocity errors of the ascending and descending tracks in this study will be 1 6 cm day and 1 2 cm day respectively and the az velocity errors can be neglected below 0 1 cm day the sar co registration precision in the glacial region is 1 10 pixel li et al 2014 corresponding to an az velocity error of 1 8 cm day and an los velocity error of 1 4 2 2 cm day the glacier velocity results are a time series and the spatial coverage of the final velocity fields is the intersection of 18 period offsets however by integrating the offset fields estimated from multiple window sizes either in glacial or nonglacial area our spatial coverages of observations are much larger than that of neelmeijer et al 2014 in the present study we used velocities in the nonglacial area to scale glacier velocity errors based on the assumption that the nonglacial area is stable neelmeijer et al 2014 estimated offsets using a single match window and sbas estimation was not performed for the same image pairs our method indicated a 17 smaller 3d velocity in the nonglacial area for the 9 periods of 2009 period 1 24 may 04 jun period 2 04 jun 26 jun period 3 26 jun 07 jul period 4 07 jul 18 jul period 5 18 jul 29 jul period 6 29 jul 09 aug period 7 09 aug 31 aug period 8 31 aug 22 sep period 9 22 sep 03 oct the errors ranged from 1 1 to 2 2 cm day for east velocity from 0 7 to 1 5 cm day for north velocity and from 0 6 to 1 2 cm day for vertical velocity 4 2 overview of 3d glacier motion fields based on in situ observations by the gottfried merzbacher global change observatory the 2009 outburst of lake merzbacher occurred on august 6 neelmeijer et al 2014 thus given the objectives of this study we only elaborated glacier velocities during periods close to this event periods 4 8 when the lake level changed substantially and had remarkable influence on the glacier supplementary figs 1 3 show the entire time series of the 3d velocity fields to highlight the features of glacier motion changes the ranges of the color bars were unified 50 cm day to 50 cm day fig 4 shows the positive directions of the velocity components we extracted the velocities along six profiles fig 5 v8 and within seven regions fig 5v6 for quantitative comparisons fig 6 and table 1 the front of the ice dam had a substantial change before and after the lake outburst period 6 so offset tracking of some image pairs failed there our 3d velocity measurements did not fully cover the ice dam the spatial variations of the glacier velocities were continuous consistent with the basic features of glacier motion the peak of glacier movement occurred during period 6 during which the lake outburst occurred prominent north and east velocities were observed at the distributary and trunk of the southern inylchek glacier respectively during periods 1 5 and 7 9 the glacier body decelerated remarkably after passing the ice dam because a large part of the mass was diverted into the lake the highest east velocity up to 58 cm day and north velocity up to 70 cm day were observed at the front of the ice dam during periods 5 and 6 respectively most east velocities ranged from 50 to 25 cm day in the trunk on the eastern side of the ice dam upstream but ranged from 15 to 0 cm day on the western side downstream during periods 1 5 and 7 9 the highest north velocities were observed at the fork rather than the front of the ice dam most of the north velocities at the distributary ranged from 20 to 35 cm day prominent vertical velocities could be observed at the distributary and trunk the vertical velocities were the greatest at the front of the ice dam 60 cm day during period 5 113 cm day during period 6 except for the ice dam most parts of the distributary had vertical velocities from 10 cm day to 4 cm day during periods 5 7 the largest vertical velocity of the trunk more than 12 cm day was on the west side of the ice dam during period 6 region a5 our records of the 3d velocities of the northern inylchek glacier indicate much slower movement the east north and vertical velocities all had small differences mostly within 5 cm day to 5 cm day 4 3 time series of 3d glacier motion fields below we summarize the changes in glacier velocity between adjacent periods from period 4 to 5 the north velocity of region a4 increased by 13 1 2 2 cm day in region a3 the downward velocity increased by 47 8 1 0 cm day however the horizontal velocity increased by only 2 1 0 5 cm day the west and downward velocities of the trunk on the east side of the ice dam increased the increasing gradient was greater in the upper reaches the west velocity increased by 9 0 3 0 cm day in region a1 and by 2 7 1 7 cm day in region a2 and the downward velocity increased by 91 3 2 1 cm day in region a1 and by 38 3 0 9 cm day in region a2 on the west side of the ice dam the west velocity decreased by 8 0 0 7 cm day in region a5 but increased by 46 8 2 2 cm day in region a6 meanwhile the subsidence in region a6 was turned into uplifting from period 5 to 6 the north velocity increased by 85 3 16 2 cm day in region a4 and by 17 9 3 0 cm day in region a3 and the downward velocity increased by 617 2 17 9 cm day in region a4 and by 73 5 2 5 cm day in region a3 along profile 4 the increments of west and down velocities were up to 10 cm day and 5 5 cm day respectively however the west velocities decreased by 5 2 1 9 cm day in region a1 and by 0 6 0 2 cm day in region a2 the downward velocity decreased by 13 6 0 6 cm day in region a1 but increased by 12 3 0 4 cm day in region a2 the most notable changes were in the trunk on the west side of the ice dam the horizontal velocity increased by 109 8 9 0 cm day in region a5 and by 86 2 6 5 cm day in region a6 moreover the downward velocity in region a5 increased by 150 2 1 cm day from period 6 to 7 the horizontal velocity decreased by 11 1 3 9 cm day in region a1 and by 10 7 3 4 cm day in region a2 and the downward velocity decreased by 35 1 1 3 cm day in region a1 and by 37 8 1 4 cm day in region a2 the horizontal velocity decreased by 43 0 7 4 cm day in region a5 23 7 9 0 cm day in region a4 and 16 1 4 7 cm day in region a3 but these velocities were still greater than those of period 5 the horizontal velocity in region a6 decreased by 68 4 9 6 cm day in region a5 the downward velocity decreased to the level recorded during period 5 but it increased in region a6 by 469 7 1 6 cm day from period 7 to 8 the horizontal and vertical velocities in all the regions continued to decrease however region a4 had a horizontal velocity that was 22 7 4 2 cm day higher than that of period 4 5 discussion 5 1 interactions of lake merzbacher with the southern inylchek glacier mayer et al 2008 conducted field gps surveys at 22 stakes distributed over the southern inylchek glacier between 30 july and 10 august 2005 after the first lake outburst and measured 3d glacier flow velocities at 15 stakes they also estimated the surface level 2d velocities over long intervals 96 days 1 year using optical image offset tracking based on precise in situ measurements their report was the first to describe the response of ice dam motion to the outburst of lake merzbacher table 2 however in spite of the high precision there was limited temporal and spatial coverage 10 days for 3 profiles near lake merzbacher and the timing of optical offset tracking did not coincide with the field surveys therefore this initial study only identified the responses of the ice flow split zone and ice dam after the lake outburst several subsequent studies erten et al 2009 li et al 2014 nobakht et al 2014 shangguan et al 2015 adopted optical or sar offset tracking to estimate the surface level 2d flow velocity of the southern inylchek glacier however the temporal resolutions of these studies were too low at least 46 days table 2 to determine the influence of lake merzbacher on the southern inylchek glacier only a few features of the velocity such as split flow towards the lake can be recognized neelmeijer et al 2014 derived a time series of the 3d motion of the southern inylchek glacier using sar offset tracking to terrasar x images of descending and ascending tracks due to the fine spatial 3 m and temporal 11 days resolutions of the terrasar x images knowledge of the southern inylchek glacier has greatly improved however most interpretations have focused on the relationship between glacier motion and meteorological conditions in terms of the interactions of lake merzbacher with the southern inylchek glacier this previous work is equivalent to measurements of 2d glacier velocities thus we interpreted the time series of 3d glacier motion fields to provide more comprehensive knowledge of the interactions between the glacier and lake 5 1 1 pre outburst phases analysis of the distributary and trunk indicated the horizontal velocities during periods 1 3 were higher than during period 4 supplementary figs 1 3 this difference was primarily due to temperature changes neelmeijer et al 2014 from period 4 to period 5 the ice front began to float because the water level rose remarkably therefore the entire a4 region had downward velocities during periods 1 3 but its northern part had significant upward velocities during periods 4 5 fig 5v4 v5 and table 1 in addition the resistance to forward movement of the ice dam declined as its front started to float therefore the north velocity of the ice dam increased at the same time more lake water entered the distributary via holes and crevasses at the bottom of the ice dam as mentioned in the introduction natural flow down the sloping glacier bed and ice thickness changes can cause vertical displacements of the glacier surface the thermal erosion by the relatively warm lake water exacerbated the subglacial ablation therefore the downward velocity of the fork a3 increased considerably although the horizontal velocities barely changed the downward velocity and its change over time were considerably greater on the west side of profile 4 than the east side because of the abrupt slope on the west side in which the elevation decreases by 50 m over a horizontal distance of 450 m mayer et al 2008 this slope blocked the movement of lake water so only the west side experienced erosion because the horizontal velocity at the fork region a3 barely changed the increase of the west velocity in the upstream trunk regions a1 and a2 which is further from the ice dam was unrelated to changes of lake merzbacher in addition the variation of the downward velocity was consistent with the west velocity the acceleration on the east side of the ice dam was mainly from the increasing basal meltwater which promoted basal sliding at the fork more mass turned to the ice dam but the total mass of the upper reaches barely changed and the compressive force along the trunk decreased however these effects did not affect the downstream region as a result the west velocity decreased in the upper reaches of the trunk on the west side of the ice dam but it increased in the lower reaches we classified period 3 with the pre outburst periods because it included only 3 post outburst days from period 5 to 6 a larger proportion of the ice dam started to float and more ice calved into the lake fig 2 shows that the debris over the ice dam almost disappeared during the days immediately before the outburst while the number of icebergs in the lake increased remarkably the intensified ice dam floating and ice front calving reduced the resistance to forward motion of the ice dam in addition the loss of glacier mass from ice calving was much more rapid than the loss from ablation so the glacier kept accelerating and this replenished the loss of mass at the ice front mayer et al 2008 at that time the compressive flow at the ice dam was converted into extensive flow and the north velocity at the calving front increased substantially however further from the ice front the decrement gradient of the resistance quickly reduced so the north velocity at the fork increased moderately after the outburst of lake merzbacher the floating part of the ice dam began to sink in addition the ice dam thinned remarkably due to thermal erosion and this explains why the downward velocity of the ice front after the outburst was much higher than the upward velocity before the outburst based on the large variations in the gradients of the downward velocities mayer et al 2008 reported that the grounding line of the ice dam was located near profile 4 west side however our data fig 5v6 shows that further from the ice front the downward velocity declined sharply from 113 cm day to 10 cm day and then slowly to 4 cm day it then gradually increased to 11 cm day on the west side of profile 4 because of the uneven distribution of the downward velocities it is unlikely that the floating ice body extended from the ice front to profile 4 as mentioned above the high downward velocities on the west side of profile 4 were due to its abrupt slope enhanced basal lubrication and basal ablation in fact as shown in fig 5v4 v6 a line appears to separate the abrupt changes of vertical velocity close to profile 5 this line is 0 55 km behind the ice front and is more likely to be the location of the grounding line mayer et al 2008 used gps to measure horizontal velocities near profile 4 from 30 july to 8 august 2005 10 days after the first outburst in 2005 and reported they were close to those measured from 25 june 2003 to 11 june 2004 using optical offset tracking this indicates that lake merzbacher did not affect profile 4 however in the present study the west and downward velocities of profile 4 were considerably increased due to the lake level changes indicating that lake merzbacher had an increasing influence from 2005 to 2009 this result is consistent with the results of our previous study of changes in glacier thickness li et al 2017 a comparison of the srtm dem with the new tandem x dem indicated the ice dam was much lower in 2012 than 2000 supplementary fig 4 as the loss of glacier mass in the inylchek valley continued water accumulated more rapidly in lake merzbacher during the ablation season consequently the loss of mass at the distributary caused by englacial thermal erosion and ice calving exceeded the increase of mass from glacier flow the ice thickness of the trunk on the east side of the ice dam decreased greatly after period 5 so the forces driving the flow were weaker during period 6 the ablation was more severe in the lower reaches region a2 than in the upper reaches region a1 however the continuously increasing basal meltwater partly counteracted the effects of glacier thinning hence the changes of horizontal and downward velocity from period 5 to 6 were quite different after lake merzbacher drained a large volume of lake water rapidly flowed through the englacial channels and this promoted shear and basal sliding therefore the west velocity of the entire trunk on the west side of the ice dam increased sharply creating a mini surge this finding is consistent with the results of neelmeijer et al 2014 undoubtedly the mini surge transferred more glacier mass to the lower reaches and exacerbated the loss of mass interestingly we found that region a5 had prominent downward and west velocities during period 6 fig 5v6 and 5e6 region a5 is a considerable distance from the ice dam and should not float before the outburst the shape of the subsided area was regular and symmetrical so the prominent downward velocity could not be due to an abrupt slope to verify this we checked the surface slope distribution in contrast to region a3 region a5 had no prominent changes in slope thus we suggest that a large englacial cavity is located in region a5 and when water pressure cracks the walls of this cavity the outburst occurred and the stored meltwater flowed away without support the surface ice body subsides 5 1 2 post outburst phases after lake drainage glacier flow replenishes the mass loss at the ice dam caused by basal erosion and ice calving however the resistance to the forward movement of the ice dam certainly increased because the ice dam completely sank to the lake bed therefore the horizontal velocities of ice front during period 7 were greater than during periods 4 5 but still lower than during period 6 the horizontal and downward velocities at the fork had similar patterns as the temperature began to drop during period 7 neelmeijer et al 2014 the loss of mass on the trunk on the east side of the ice dam slowed and the amount of basal meltwater decreased because of the continuing ablation the ice body was thinner during period 7 than period 6 so the downward and horizontal velocities decreased from period 6 to 7 the horizontal velocities of regions a2 and a7 increased from period 4 to 5 and then continuously decreased from period 5 to 8 whereas the downward velocities continuously increased from period 4 to 6 and then decreased from period 6 to 8 moreover for the trunk on the east side of the ice dam supplementary figs 1 3 the horizontal velocities during periods 1 3 were higher than during period 6 however the downward velocities were lower these phenomena indicate that the ablation intensity of the northern and southern inylchek glaciers reached peaks during period 6 after drainage of the lake in addition to region a2 the horizontal velocities of regions a1 a5 and a6 also decreased however in contrast to regions a1 a2 and a6 region a5 had greater horizontal velocities during period 7 than periods 4 5 it is likely that the ability of the ice body in region a5 to bear longitudinal compressive forces declined after drainage of the englacial cavity interestingly region a6 mainly had upward velocities during periods 5 and 6 but had a downward velocity during period 7 fig 5v5 v7 thus we suggest that region a6 has a smaller englacial cavity because this cavity is located at the lower reaches it can still collect a large amount of meltwater after lake drainage this explains the uplift of the glacier surface during period 6 however the amount of basal meltwater decreased during period 7 leading to subsidence of the glacier surface 5 2 mechanism of lake merzbacher outburst multi year measurements confirm that the outburst of lake merzbacher is periodic sheng et al 2009 based on our findings and previous results mayer et al 2008 we suggest the reason for these periodic outbursts is that this drainage system alternates between expansion and compression this drainage system extends from the constant holes and crevasses at the bottom of the ice dam to the main outlet of the southern inylchek glacier near the terminus at the beginning of the ablation season the volume of lake water flowing into the southern inylchek glacier increases and this increases the water pressure on the walls of englacial cavities and drainage channels at the same time the warm lake water seriously erodes the contact ice together these increase the cross sectional areas of the drainage channels after lifting of the ice dam the englacial water pressure increases dramatically when this pressure exceeds the limit that choke points and walls of the channels can bear it cracks the englacial cavity and the joint walls of the adjacent channels break through this activates the whole drainage system leading to lake outburst after the peak of water discharge the pressure in the drainage channels quickly drops and the ice dam sinks to the lake bed due to the plasticity of the glacier body and the constant compressive motion the cross sectional areas of the drainage channels gradually shrink however subsidence of the ice dam does not halt the drainage otherwise the lake water cannot quickly drain to the extent shown in fig 2c in general the lifting of the ice dam and the cracking of the englacial cavity play key roles in accelerating the outburst of lake merzbacher our results show that the lifting of the ice dam is a gradual process and that excessive englacial pressure rather than the floating of the ice dam appears to control this drainage system 6 conclusion we measured changes of 3d glacier motion over time to investigate the interactions of lake merzbacher with the southern inylchek glacier during the ablation season our use of the sbas technique improved the precision of the measured glacier velocities by combining 3 landsat images we found high correlations of the motion and mass balance of the southern inylchek glacier with the dynamics of lake merzbacher before the outburst lake water enters the glacier via crevasses and holes in the ice dam and erodes the englacial ice during this process the ice dam gradually moves upward due to water pressure therefore ice calving starts at the front as the water continues to rise ice calving leads to severe loss of mass and more parts of the ice dam start to float this accelerates the distributary so the loss of mass becomes increasingly severe due to the englacial erosion and lifting of the ice dam the volume of englacial water increases dramatically the vertical velocity time series indicates a huge englacial cavity at the glacier tongue we suggest that lake outburst occurs when extreme water pressure cracks the englacial cavity as the lake drains the velocity of the glacier tongue more than doubles so that more mass is transferred to the lower reaches where it undergoes strong ablation after drainage of the lake the 3d velocities at the glacier tongue and distributary slowly drop because the loss of mass at the ice front needs to be supplemented by fast flow based on the recognition that changes in ice thickness contribute to vertical displacements of the glacier we found that the time of the lake outburst was associated with the peak of glacier ablation furthermore a comparison of our results with previous studies indicates that the lake affected more of the glacier in 2009 than in 2005 this study points to the benefits of using sar for measurement of glacier velocities however the method we adopted requires two sets of images in different tracks when applied to fast flowing or maritime glaciers the method further requires fine temporal resolution of images which means a big number of images must

7407,pre excavation dewatering ped is an important construction stage in deep excavation field measurements show that retaining walls can develop obvious deflections during ped which has been rarely considered in the past the characteristics of ped induced wall deflection and the relationship of this deflection to surrounding ground deformation are still unclear in this study a ped test is simulated by a numerical model the model is verified by field observations and used to investigate the responses of retaining wall and surrounding ground to ped results indicate that the maximum wall defection δ hm and surface settlement δ vm can all reach centimeter level under common conditions of ped the ratio of δ vm to δ hm varies at the range of 0 45 0 67 wall and soil deformations will be more obvious if the soils within the dewatering depth h d have better permeability the relative positions between h d and strata i e aquifer or aquitard have great influence on the ped induced deformations if an aquifer appears below h d further increasing h d can induce a rapid growth of wall and soil deformations if thick aquitard appears below h d the deformation increments by further increasing h d are not apparent however once h d exceeds the center of the thick aquitard and reaches a thick confined aquifer the wall deflections and soil deformation zones behind the wall will enlarge significantly meanwhile a large bending moment in the retaining wall will arise around the bottom of the confined aquifer the designers should consider this condition and allocate enough steel rebars there preventing the appearance of wall cracks in the confined aquifer keywords deep excavation dewatering wall deflection ground deformation groundwater seepage numerical simulation 1 introduction in recent years with the rapid development of underground space exploitation in big cities plenty of deep excavations appear in the congested urban environment these excavations are featured by a close proximity to existing underground structures such as metro tunnels and pile foundations see fig 1 the environment deformations induced by deep excavation should be strictly controlled for example the final deformation and differential deformation of existing metro tunnels are demanded to be controlled within 5 20 mm chang et al 2001 chen et al 2016 hu et al 2003 huang et al 2013 liang et al 2018 ng et al 2013 sharma et al 2001 shi et al 2015 xing et al 2016 which is a huge challenge to engineers as is known to all the construction processes of deep excavation consist of many stages such as the construction of retaining wall dewatering staged excavation construction of slabs or struts removal of struts and backfill and the groundwater level recovery as shown in fig 2 in fact the whole construction processes of excavation can cause environment deformation in order to more proactively control the deformation in a planned way and to ensure that the final deformation could meet the strict control requirement the control demand for the final deformation should be decomposed into the control demand in each construction stage and the dynamic control i e the real time control of deformation according to the real time monitoring data of deformation by stages should be conducted xu et al 2016 this indicates that the environment deformations induced by each construction stage need to be controlled within smaller value maybe several millimeters it is clear that the construction in current deep excavation must be conducted more carefully and the deformations induced by the whole construction processes need to be considered and controlled the pre excavation dewatering also called as test pumping and denoted as ped in this paper as shown in fig 2 is an important construction stage before excavation to check the completion quality of dewatering wells and obtain sufficient parameters so that the dewatering system can be optimized cashman and preene 2012 powers 2007 wang et al 2009 2016 2017 wu et al 2016 yao et al 2006 zeng et al 2017a b c zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2014a typically the discharge flow rate of dewatering wells and the drawdown in dewatering wells need to be tested and should meet the design requirement before excavation cashman and preene 2012 powers 2007 wang et al 2017 yao et al 2006 moreover ped is also used as pumping test to evaluate the hydrogeological parameters of aquifers and the hydraulic barrier effect of retaining wall note the retaining wall in our study refers to an underground structure that can not only retain soil but also block groundwater e g the diaphragm wall pujades et al 2014a b shen et al 2015 wu et al 2015a b 2016 xu et al 2014 considering that the retaining wall already existed before ped the retaining wall is expected to be affected by ped and appears deformation response zheng et al 2014a ever reported a case study of ped in a metro excavation in tianjin china inward cantilever deflections were observed for a diaphragm wall in the ped test and the maximum deflection was about 10 mm which reached 37 6 of the allowable wall deflection i e about 27 mm for the project based on numerical simulation zheng et al 2014a pointed out that the seepage force around the dewatering well during ped can cause the inward horizontal displacement of the soil inside the excavation and thus the redistribution of earth pressure on the excavated side of the wall occurs which disequilibrates the original earth pressure on both sides of the wall and leads to the inward wall deflections during ped however in practice it is usually considered that no wall deflection exists before excavation for this reason the existing studies about deep excavation are mainly focused on the deformation induced by staged excavation and bracing including field studies finno and roboski 2005 liu et al 2016 ou et al 1998 tan et al 2016 tan and lu 2017a b analytical and numerical analyses bryson and kotheimer 2011 hashash et al 2006 hsieh et al 2013 osouli et al 2010 ou et al 2013 whittle et al 1993 xing et al 2016 and empirical or semiempirical approaches bryson and zapata medina 2012 clough and o rourke 1990 goh et al 2017 hsieh and ou 1998 2016 moormann 2004 ou et al 1993 these studies only considered the deformations induced during and after excavation and ignored the deformations induced before excavation i e the ped induced retaining wall deflections and surrounding environment deformations although some authors pujades et al 2014a b 2017 wang et al 2009 2016 2017 wu et al 2015a b 2016 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 carried out ped tests and relevant numerical simulations their concerns were the dewatering induced drawdown curve and the soil settlement induced by drawdown they did not investigate wall deflection and its relationship with surrounding ground deformation during ped in fact the wall deflection will induce ground loss behind the wall then the soils outside the excavation will move towards the retaining wall peck 1969 however the characteristics of ped induced wall and surrounding ground movements are still unclear due to the lack of well documented field data or theoretical analyses in this study a three dimensional 3d finite element fe model considering soil fluid coupling is developed to simulate a ped test in tianjin china the model is verified by the field measurements then parametrical studies are performed to investigate the responses of retaining wall and surrounding ground to ped in different hydrogeological environments two parameters are considered in this study which are the soil permeability and the dewatering depth by changing their values in the numerical models a series of 3d numerical simulations are conducted the wall deflections and surrounding ground deformations under different soil permeability and dewatering depth are compared and analyzed on this basis the variation rules of ped induced soil deformation zone behind the wall are obtained and meanwhile a series of optimized design schemes of ped are proposed for reference to designers in order to ensure that the retaining wall and surrounding ground would not develop considerable deformations during ped 2 overview of background fig 3 presents a deep excavation for a metro station in tianjin china this excavation consisted of three sections i e excavation a excavation b and the interchange shaft the excavation depth and width can be seen in fig 3 the retaining structure was a reinforced concrete diaphragm wall that was 0 8 m thick and 33 0 m deep for the excavation a and b several buildings existed around the excavation but the building behaviors were not the target in this study and thus the layouts of the surrounding buildings are not presented in fig 3 the allowable wall deflection for this project is 0 14 of the final excavation depth i e about 27 mm according to the corresponding protection grade specified by the local metro construction standard tianjin construction management committee 2009 according to the geotechnical investigation report as shown in table 1 soils at the site consist of saturated silts silty clays and silty fine sands in the upper 50 m below the ground surface bgs the soil layers can be defined as an alternated multi aquifer aquitard system maas there are one phreatic aquifer and three confined aquifers within the depth of 50 m bgs the aquifers are separated by three aquitards the corresponding soil types and soil properties for the aquifers and aquitards are presented in table 1 where the modified cam clay mcc model roscoe and burland 1968 wood 1990 is a constitutive model used to simulate the behavior of soil during dewatering in the numerical simulation which will be described detailly in section 3 the long term phreatic water level was observed at depths of 0 8 2 9 m bgs the hydrostatic equilibrium for the three confined aquifers were reached at 3 26 4 12 and 5 0 m bgs respectively from the upper to the lower layers since the excavation would be performed below the groundwater level dewatering was adopted to ensure excavation safety as shown in fig 3 there were a total of 9 and 10 wells in excavations a s1 s9 and b s10 s19 respectively the wells were drilled with a diameter of 650 mm and were fitted with a steel well liner with a diameter of 273 mm the liner had a section slotted i e well screen from 2 m bgs to approximately 3 m below the final excavation depth to ensure that the water table could be lowered below the final excavation depth during excavation the borehole annuli were sealed above the screen level with clay the deflections of the diaphragm walls were monitored by fully automatic total station and 14 inclinometer tubes c1 c6 for excavation a and the others for excavation b that were affixed to the steel reinforcement cages and later covered by concrete the fully automatic total station was employed to monitor the horizontal displacement at wall top and the inclinometers were used to monitor the relative deflections between wall sections below the wall top the reason why the two equipment were used in combination is that the inclinometers may just give a relatively accurate result of the relative wall deflections the obtainment of the real or absolute wall deflections depends on the accurate monitoring of the displacement at inclinometer top or toe i e the base point must be determined either at inclinometer top or toe and the displacement at base point must be accurately obtained the traditional method is that choose the inclinometer toe as the base point assume the displacement at inclinometer toe as zero and then compute the wall deflection from down to top based on the zero value at inclinometer toe however since the inclinometer toe may still develop movement even if the inclinometer is installed to the wall toe tan and wei 2012 tan and wang 2013 tan et al 2015 tan and lu 2017b the traditional method to obtain the wall deflection may inappropriate especially in the area with a thick layer of soft soils as a better choice the fully automatic total station is employed and some measures e g for a specific survey area at least 3 reference points are placed at a distance of over 4 times the final excavation depth behind the diaphragm wall are taken to ensure the obtainment of accurate measurements of horizontal displacement at the wall top and then the wall deflections below the wall top can be computed from top to down based on the horizontal displacement at the wall top and the relative wall deflections observed by inclinometers shandong construction department 2009 tan and wei 2012 tan and wang 2013 tan et al 2015 tan and lu 2017b the precision of field measurements for horizontal displacement at the wall top and below the wall top can reach 0 8 mm and 0 02 mm 0 5 m respectively which are all meet the requirements specified by the national construction standard in china shandong construction department 2009 this study focuses on ped test in excavation a and thus the layout of inclinometer tubes in excavation b is not shown in fig 3 in addition the observation wells to monitor the water levels of phreatic aquifer and confined aquifers and the soil and adjacent building settlement markers were also mounted around the excavation however observation results showed no changes of water level and environment deformations were not monitored during ped test in excavation a therefore the specific layouts of observation wells and soil and adjacent building settlement markers are not presented in fig 3 after the diaphragm walls and dewatering wells were installed on site two ped tests t1 and t2 were carried out in excavation a and b respectively to check the completion quality of the wells t1 lasted 10 days during which all of the dewatering wells in excavations a were operating the dewatering target depth is 16 m but this target was expected to achieve by stages i e dewatering with dewatering depth h d of 4 8 12 and 16 m were conducted successively in four stages each stage lasted 2 5 days wall deflections were monitored during t1 the discharge rate was not accurately obtained since flowmeter had not been installed on the wells in excavation a however experienced engineers using visual observations found that the groundwater yield decreased with the time elapsed during each dewatering stage at the end of the dewatering test the measurements of groundwater level in some of the dewatering wells showed that the groundwater level was located at the pump depth which means that the prescribed dewatering depth was reached hence the completion quality of the wells is creditable and can meet the design requirement t2 lasted 5 days the dewatering depth was 15 20 m for different wells each well in excavation b was equipped with a flowmeter due to the approximately identical site condition and well arrangement of excavation a and b it is assumed that the discharge rate observed in excavation b can directly reflect that in excavation a t2 indicated that the discharge rate q ranged from 6 to 20 m3 d for different wells on the first day and decreased to a range of 0 3 7 m3 d after a 5 day dewatering period 3 numerical model and verification 3 1 model setup in this section a 3d fe model is developed in a fe software abaqus which considers the fluid mechanical interaction using the biot consolidation theory biot 1941 then the t1 is simulated the computed wall deflections ground deformations groundwater seepage and discharge rate are analyzed and compared with the test results to validate the model fig 4 shows the mesh of the fe model considering the excavation with dimensions of approximately 200 m by 20 m in plane the dimensions of the model are set to 400 m by 230 m in plane hence the distance of the lateral soil boundary to retaining wall is about 100 m which exceeds the zone of influence of the dewatering well estimated by sichardt s formula cashman and preene 2012 the model is set to 50 m in depth according to the actual soil conditions at the excavation site the model strata are divided into 9 layers besides considering the stress and deformations of soil could undergo a relatively large development around the excavation the horizontal and vertical mesh are refined there in order to obtain relatively accurate results the initial groundwater level is assumed to be located at the ground surface and the soils are considered to be under the normally consolidated state before dewatering zheng et al 2014a the soil movements at the bottom of the model are restrained in all directions grid points over four vertical sides are only free to move in the vertical direction and restrained from movement in other directions besides the lateral soil boundaries are recharged by a constant head at the ground surface the bottom of the soil is impermeable the top of the soil is set on a drainage only flow dof boundary which will be explained in the following the soil is modeled with the 8 node trilinear displacement and pore pressure solid elements the behavior of the soils is assumed to obey the constitutive theory of modified cam clay mcc roscoe and burland 1968 wood 1990 during dewatering table 1 summarizes the main parameters for mcc model of each soil layer λ κ and m

the friction behavior governed by a limiting shear slip γ crit and friction coefficient μ complies with the coulomb frictional law in this study γ crit and μ are set to 5 mm and 0 3 respectively diao and zheng 2008 zheng et al 2011 2014a the structure of dewatering well is simulated by 4 node doubly curved shell elements the geometry and distribution of dewatering well in the model is generally in agreement with the description in section 2 as shown in fig 4 for simplicity the borehole annuli of the dewatering well are not considered the linear elastic model is adopted for the dewatering well the young s moduli of the dewatering well is 2 1 108 kpa china academy of building research 2010 the function of dewatering well is simulated by applying a seepage boundary on a zone where the screen

is in the direction outward from the soil element surface is equal to k s p w i e v n k s p w when p w is positive where k s is termed the seepage coefficient and p w is the pore water pressure on the element surface v n will be equal to 0 when p w is negative three features for the practical dewatering process can be considered by the dof boundary 1 groundwater can only flow out from the soil and cannot flow in from the well 2 v n will be larger at deeper locations in the well than at shallow locations and 3 for a specific k s v n will decrease due to p w decrease with the elapsed dewatering time the initial value of ks can be obtained using eq 1 where d is the well diameter l is the length of screening and q is discharge flow rate the derivation process of eq 1 can be referred to zheng et al 2014a q observed in ped tests see section 2 can be adopted to calculate ks although q was not monitored in t1 the observation results for q in t2 can be used because of the approximately identical site conditions and well arrangement of t1 and t2 1 k s q π dlp w the fe modeling is conducted according to t1 presented in section 2 the details of the simulation process can be found in zheng et al 2014a only a brief summary is presented here after the soil initial state is established and the wall and dewatering wells are set up in the model the dof seepage boundary is activated i e the dewatering process is simulated however because the dewatering with dewatering depth h d of 4 8 12 and 16 m were conducted successively every 2 5 days during dewatering test the dof seepage boundary on the corresponding range of screen in the fe model is activated stepwise 3 2 simulation results 3 2 1 groundwater seepage and discharge rate in the fe model pore water pressure p w is used to evaluate whether the soil is saturated or not and the change of p w can reflect the groundwater seepage during the dewatering simulation p w of the soil elements around the dewatering well decrease indicating that the groundwater volume decreases in practice in order to clearly reflect the groundwater seepage inside the excavation during ped a normalized index the degree of drainage η is defined by the ratio of reduction in p w δp w during dewatering to the initial value of p w p w ini before dewatering i e η δp w p w ini η approaches one during the dewatering simulation fig 5 presents the calculated contour of η for the inner soil at section 1 1 see fig 4 of excavation a after each dewatering stage there is a denser contour of η around the well indicating that a high hydraulic gradient i developed the drainage proceeds under the action of i additionally η is higher for the soil closer to the well due to the cone of depression around the well cashman and preene 2012 powers 2007 xue 1986 at the end of the dewatering process i e stage 4 η is no less than 0 8 for the soils immediately adjacent to the dewatering well within dewatering depth i e 16 m which means the groundwater drawdown in or around dewatering wells can basically reach the dewatering depth this conclusion corresponds with the field observation results see section 2 fig 6 shows the calculated contour of η for the soils behind the right wall at the end of dewatering stage 4 the values of η are concentrated at an extremely small range i e 0 0 01 and a huge part of the η values are equal to 0 this is also the reason why the contour of η appears to be disorder this result indicates that the groundwater level outside the excavation is almost unchanged which corresponds with the field observation results see section 2 in fact the reason is that the phreatic aquifer and two confined aquifers are cut off by diaphragm wall and thus the hydraulic connection between inside and outside of the excavation are weak fig 7 presents the calculated real time discharge rate q during each dewatering stage in the first 2 5 days the dewatering depth h d is 4 m and thus the area of water crossing surface is relatively small which leads to the relatively small q and no clear variation of q for that period however q increases sharply when the pumps enter the clayey silts i e h d 8 m that is because the permeability of this layer is relatively better and thus the groundwater recharge from around the dewatering well in this layer is relatively stronger which leads to a larger groundwater yield at the beginning of this dewatering stage i e stage 2 then a decrease in q becomes clear in each dewatering stage over time which is consistent with the observation results see section 2 besides as mentioned in section 2 q was not monitored in t1 but in t2 due to the approximately identical soil condition and well arrangement in t1 and t2 see section 2 and fig 3 it can be assumed that the observed q in t2 can reflect that in t1 based on this assumption it is believed that the observed q in t2 can to some extent be used to check the reasonability of calculated q in t1 e g at least the calculated variation trend of q and the variation range of q should correspond with the observed results if the calculated results are reasonable hence a comparison is conducted between observed q in t2 and calculated q in t1 because the duration of stages 3 and 4 i e 5 days in t1 and the dewatering depth in that period i e 12 16 m are similar to the duration i e 5 days and dewatering depth i e 15 20 m in t2 see section 2 the comparison is made between the calculated q from stages 3 and 4 in t1 and the observed q in t2 as shown in fig 7 on the first day of dewatering the observed q was varying from 6 0 m3 d to 15 6 m3 d averaged about 12 0 m3 d for wells with h d 15 m and from 19 2 m3 d to 19 8 m3 d averaged about 19 5 m3 d for wells with h d 20 m after a 5 day dewatering period the observed q decreased to a range of 0 3 2 5 m3 d averaged about 2 0 m3 d for wells with h d 15 m and a range of 5 2 7 0 m3 d averaged about 6 0 m3 d for wells with h d 20 m since the soil conditions in different dewatering wells may be slightly different the observed values show a certain degree of dispersion the calculated variation trend of q corresponds with the field observation results and the calculated values are basically within the variation range of the observed values 3 2 2 wall deflections and ground deformations fig 8 compares the calculated wall deflections and ground surface settlements at c1 and c3 see fig 3 with the corresponding field observations and empirical prediction curve the empirical prediction curves are reprinted from hsieh and ou 1998 by using the dewatering depth h d to substitute the excavation depth adopted in their literature in order to obtain the relationship between the influence range of surface settlement behind the wall and h d d h d is employed in the graph of surface settlement as one of the horizontal axis where d distance from the wall and the final dewatering depth of 16 m is adopted here for h d the deflection pattern of wall is cantilever type with the maximum wall deflection δ hm at the wall top the calculated wall deflections in the upper 19 m are consistent with those observed meanwhile the calculated curves indicate that the diaphragm wall also develops deflections of 0 1 mm from 19 m bgs to the wall bottom the surface settlement profile is spandrel type which is mainly induced by the ground loss behind the wall due to wall deflection during ped since the mechanism of ped induced surface settlement is similar to that of excavation induced surface settlement the empirical curve of surface settlement proposed by hsieh and ou 1998 is employed as a contrast to the calculated final surface settlements the values corresponding to 10 day dewatering relatively larger mismatches between the calculated and empirical curves are found at the range of d h d 2 however after d h d 2 the two curves match well meanwhile the two curves show that the influence range of surface settlements are almost the same since the empirical curve is obtained by regression analysis based on plenty of field data from excavation and not all of the field data are completely consistent with the empirical curve hsieh and ou 1998 the appearance of incomplete coincidence between calculated and empirical curves is reasonable besides the calculated values show that with d h d increased from 0 to 1 the surface settlement decreases significantly buildings or public facilities within this distance may be subject to the influence of severe differential settlement moreover the ratios of the maximum surface settlement δ vm to the maximum wall deflection δ hm average about 0 50 according to the calculated results shown in fig 8 note δ vm and δ hm adopted here are corresponding to the maximum values in the series of 10 day dewatering fig 9 presents the calculated vertical deformation of soil δ v on the retained side of the wall at the section 1 1 see fig 4 in fig 9 a sections h1 h5 are used to monitor the δ v profile at different depths the spandrel type settlement profile can be seen at h1 h5 in the range of d h d 1 δ v reduces obviously with the increase of soil depth z soil heave cannot be found on the retained side of the wall even at the wall bottom i e z h d 2 0 this is different from the excavation induced ground behaviors which show some degree of soil heave around the wall bottom huang et al 2013 ou et al 2000 xing et al 2016 zheng et al 2014b in fig 9 b the primary influence zone piz of δ v is presented in this paper the piz is defined as an area with soil deformations no less than 1 mm hence δ v in piz of δ v must satisfy δ v 1 mm the piz of δ v in the vertical direction is significantly smaller than that in the horizontal direction this is different from the piz of δ v induced by deep excavation which shows large piz in the vertical direction huang et al 2013 ou et al 2000 xing et al 2016 zheng et al 2014b the reason can be explained as follows the deep excavation will cause apparent soil heave inside the excavation and thus it will occur soil movements from outside to inside of the excavation which makes the piz of δ v enlarge downward however the ped will cause large soil settlements inside the excavation zheng et al 2014a which prevent the soil movements from outside to inside of the excavation therefore the piz of δ v in the vertical direction is relatively smaller during ped fig 10 presents the calculated horizontal deformation of soil δ hs on the retained side of the wall at the section 1 1 in fig 10 a sections v1 v5 are used to monitor the δ hs profile at different distance from the wall d the cantilever type deformation profile can be seen at v1 v5 in the range of z h d 1 δ hs reduces obviously with the increase of d in fig 10 b the piz of δ hs is presented δ hs in piz of δ hs must satisfy δ hs 1 mm the piz of δ hs in both the vertical and horizontal direction have no significant difference and all reach the range of h d besides comparing figs 9 and 10 it can be seen that the soils are more likely to move in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction during ped because both the maximum δ hs and the piz of δ hs are greater than those of δ v 4 parametric study the above analyses indicate that the numerical model is able to simulate the groundwater seepage and wall and ground deformations induced by ped in an alternated multi aquifer aquitard system maas in this section a series of calculations are conducted to study the effect of soil permeability and dewatering depth on the ped induced wall and ground deformations 4 1 parameters value the soils in the field mainly contain silty clays and silts considering that the ped depth is typically within 20 m bgs the permeability of clayey silts k 2 buried from 5 5 m bgs to 11 m bgs i e aquifer ① the permeability of silty clays k 3 buried from 11 m bgs to 19 m bgs i e aquitard ① and the dewatering depth h d are considered as changing parameters in this paper the basic values and variation values of the parameters are shown in table 2 the basic values are equal to those in table 1 the variation values of k 2 and k 3 are selected according to their typical range reported in cashman and preene 2012 in the following sections all the calculated results are based on the basic values of parameters unless otherwise specified in section 4 2 the permeability anisotropy is not considered in the numerical model considering most of the excavations are not braced during the ped zheng et al 2014a all the calculation conditions in this study simulate this conventional situation the thickness of the retaining wall is uniformly set to 0 8 m the dewatering time is set to 10 days 4 2 effect of k2 and k3 4 2 1 maximum wall deflections δhm and surface settlements δvm fig 11 shows the wall deflection and surface settlement profiles at the end of 10 day dewatering under different k 2 and k 3 with the increase of k 2 and k 3 the wall deflections and surface settlements enlarge continuously as to the cases of k 2 0 01 and 1 m d and k 3 0 0001 and 0 01 m d the empirical curves for predicting surface settlements proposed by hsieh and ou 1998 are plotted in fig 11 likewise relatively larger mismatches between the calculated and empirical curves are found at the range of d h d 2 but after d h d 2 the two curves match well fig 12 presents δ hm and δ vm and their relationship with k 2 and k 3 both δ hm and δ vm increase nonlinearly with the increase of k 2 and k 3 and the growth rate decreases continuously which indicates that there exist limit values of δ hm and δ vm according to the regression equations the limit values of δ hm and δ vm under different k 2 and k 3 are shown in fig 12 besides the ratios of δ vm to δ hm vary within the interval of 0 45 0 59 according to the calculated results the reasons why δ hm and δ vm differ under different k 2 and k 3 are as follows with the increase of k 2 and k 3 the hydraulic conductivity of the corresponding strata will be higher the groundwater drawdown at the dewatering wells can be more quickly transmitted to the location of the retaining wall which will induce stronger redistribution of earth pressure on the excavated side of the wall this can be seen in fig 13 which is the distribution of the total earth pressure change δσ at the excavated side of the wall after 10 day dewatering under different k 2 and k 3 in fig 13 δσ indicates the decrease of the total earth pressure δσ occurs at most locations along the wall depth which breaks the original balance of the total earth pressure on both sides of the wall hence the inward wall deflections occur as to fig 13 a δσ becomes greater with the increase of k 2 which can be apparently seen at the range of 0 11 m bgs because the soil layer corresponding to k 2 is within 11 m bgs the apparent changes of δσ appear at the corresponding locations as to fig 13 b δσ becomes smaller and turns into δσ gradually with the increase of k 3 which can be seen apparently around and below the 11 m bgs because k 3 is corresponding to the soil layer below the 11 m bgs therefore δ hm and δ vm become larger with the increase of k 2 and k 3 during the excavation in a congested urban environment the pre excavation dewatering should be cautious if soils at the site mainly consist of strong permeable layers meanwhile the monitoring frequency of wall and soil deformations should be increased during the pre excavation dewatering once large increments of wall and soil deformations occur it should reduce the drawdown or stop dewatering so as to avoid the occurrence of large wall and soil deformations before excavation 4 2 2 depth range of wall deflection hc the wall deflections typically occur at a certain range of depth from the wall top h c is adopted in this paper to denote this depth range of wall deflection with the increase of h c the ground loss behind the wall will be more serious peck 1969 and then the soils outside the excavation will move more apparently towards the retaining wall i e the displacement of soils outside the excavation will be greater hence h c is another matter of concern to geotechnical engineers apart from the maximum wall deflection fig 14 presents the relationship between h c and the permeability of soil on semilog coordinate it should be noted that the buried depth of wall with deflection less than 1 mm are excluded in the data of h c in fig 14 in general h c becomes larger with the increase of k 2 and k 3 specifically h c increases slowly and is basically within the range of h d with the increase of k 2 noted that when k 2 changes k 3 remains unchanged at 5 10 4 m d however with the increase of k 3 h c grows rapidly and far surpass h d and h c h d can reach 1 7 these results indicate that when the bottom of h d locates in a thick aquitard e g 8 m thick clayey soils with permeability no greater than 5 10 4 m d with the embedded depth no more than approximately 0 5 times the thickness of the aquitard ped induced h c will not exceed the bottom of the thick aquitard and h c h d varies at the range of 0 7 1 1 however when the thick aquitard is embedded with lenticle of sandy soils thus having a relatively higher vertical permeability e g no less than 1 10 3 m d h c may reach the location of another aquitard below this thick aquitard the reasons why h c differs under different k 2 and k 3 are as follows 1 the dewatering depth in this section approximately locates in the middle of the thick aquitard ① as to the conditions varying k 2 because the permeability of aquitard ① is very low i e k 3 5 10 4 m d vertical seepage occurs in a wide range of the aquitard ① during ped with the seepage surface at the top of aquitard ① horizontal seepage only arises in the aquitard ① near the dewatering well cashman and preene 2012 powers 2007 under the influence of the single drainage boundary the consolidation of the aquitard ① is proceeding but will take some time according to terzaghi consolidation theory terzaghi et al 1996 therefore during a relatively short time ped it is difficult to occur substantial decrease of pore water pressure p w in aquitard ① and p w decrease in strata underlying aquitard ① will even less this can be seen in fig 15 a according to zheng et al 2014a the wall deflection will not be greatly developed in the aquitard ① and the underlying strata due to unapparent transformation of p w to the effective stress in the corresponding strata hence the growth of h c is relatively smaller with the increase of k 2 when the deep buried underground structures such as tunnel and pile foundation arise around deep excavation the effect of ped on the underground structures can be preliminary evaluated according to the relative position between underground structures and the thick aquitard in the field if the underground structures are located below a thick aquitard e g 8 m thick clayey soils with permeability no greater than 5 10 4 m d it can be deduced that the ped will not cause apparent deformation of the underground structures when the dewatering depth does not exceed 0 5 times the thickness of the thick aquitard 2 with the increase of k 3 the consolidation of aquitard ① is accelerated and the hydraulic connection between aquifer ① and aquifer ② becomes stronger hence p w in aquifer ② decreases gradually during dewatering and the larger the k 3 the more the p w decrease in aquifer ② which can be seen in fig 15 b the p w decrease in aquifer ② causes a seepage surface arising at the top of aquitard ② and thus the consolidation of aquitard ② occurs therefore the depth range of strata having p w decrease enlarges downward greatly see fig 15 b p w decreases continuously from aquitard ① to aquitard ② with the increase of k 3 according to zheng et al 2014a wall deflection will occur in the strata having p w decrease hence with the increase of k 3 h c grows continuously and far surpass the range of dewatering depth when the deep excavation is surrounded by deep buried tunnel pile foundation and other underground structures and meanwhile the aquitard between two aquifers in the field is embedded with lenticle of sandy soils leading to strong vertical hydraulic connection between aquifers the determination of dewatering depth should be cautious in this case if the dewatering depth reaches this aquitard h c may enlarge downward greatly and reach the location of another aquitard below this aquitard at this time the surrounding underground structures may be severely affected by pre excavation dewatering if their depths are within h c 4 2 3 piz of ground deformation the deformation range of soil outside the excavation is closely related to h c figs 16 and 17 show the relationship between the primary influence zone piz of soil deformations and h c under different k 2 and k 3 respectively the standards for ascertaining piz and h c are the same as those described in sections 3 2 2 and 4 2 2 respectively in figs 16 and 17 piz of soil vertical deformation δ v and horizontal deformation δ hs are presented in figures a and b respectively to clearly reflect the features of piz as shown in figs 16 and 17 pizh and pizv are employed to represent the maximum distance from the wall and the maximum depth of piz respectively the common points of the four figures are as follows firstly with the increase of k 2 and k 3 both pizh and pizv become larger and their variation are synchronous with h c but their growth rate decreases continuously which indicates that there exist limit values of soil deformation ranges behind the wall after k 2 0 5 m d or k 3 0 001 m d the soil deformation ranges have a little change secondly pizh is greater than pizv and h c in all cases which means that both the horizontal and vertical soil deformations behind the wall are propagated further in the horizontal direction rather than in the vertical direction during ped the primary different points of the four figures are as follows firstly as to piz of δ v as shown in figures a in both figs 16 and 17 pizv is significantly smaller than h c and pizh pizh pizv is ranged from 3 2 to 4 3 causing the piz of δ v to show a long and narrow shape however as to piz of δ hs as shown in figures b in both figs 16 and 17 pizv is equal to h c and pizh pizv ranged from 1 2 to 1 6 is relatively smaller causing that the shape of piz is like a quarter of an arc secondly comparing figures a and b in both figs 16 and 17 both pizh and pizv of δ hs are larger than those of δ v under the same k 2 or k 3 which indicates that the soil horizontal deformation behind the wall induced by ped can be propagated further and deeper compared to the soil vertical deformation besides with the increase of k 3 piz of soil deformations both δ v and δ hs could reach a relatively larger range both in the horizontal and vertical direction which can be seen by comparing figures a or figures b in both figs 16 and 17 in practical project when the thick aquitard in the field is found to be embedded with lenticle of sandy soils thus having a relatively higher vertical permeability it should avoid allocating the pump to reach this thick aquitard during ped if deep buried tunnels and pile foundations arise within the piz of soil deformation 4 3 effect of hd according to the above analysis the ped induced wall deflections and soil deformations have great relation with the permeability of soil below the bottom of dewatering depth h d in this section by changing h d in the numerical model a variety of cases considering soil layers with different permeability appearing below h d are calculated and analyzed fig 18 shows the relative positions between h d and soil layers adopted in this study in fig 18 case 1 5 are corresponding to h d 5 5 m 11 m 16 m 19 m and 21 5 m respectively in general two kinds of conditions are regarded one is the case 1 4 and 5 which are featured by well drained strata appearing below h d the other is the case 2 and 3 which are characterized by aquitard emerging below h d 4 3 1 wall deflection and surface settlement profiles fig 19 shows the wall deflection and surface settlement profiles under different h d with h d increased from 5 5 m to 21 5 m the wall deflections and surface settlements enlarge continuously as to each case of h d the empirical curves for predicting surface settlements proposed by hsieh and ou 1998 are plotted in fig 19 the calculated and empirical curves are in good agreement except the cases of h d 11 and 16 m which are characterized by aquitard emerging below h d according to the analysis above the thick aquitard ① limits the development of wall deflection in aquitard ① and the underlying soil layers causing that h c and pizh of δ v are relatively smaller hence the surface settlements decrease rapidly with the increase of d leading to a relatively larger mismatches between the calculated and empirical curves near the wall besides as to the case of h d 21 5 m the range of soil with apparent differential settlement can reach approximately 40 m behind the wall i e approximately the location of d h d 2 buildings or public facilities within this range may be subject to the influence of severe differential settlement it should be noted that when h d reaches aquifer ② i e the series of h d 21 5 m in fig 19 the corresponding wall deflection curve is totally different with other cases showing a concave shape from approximately 11 m bgs to 24 m bgs this may have a great influence on the bending moment m 0 in the retaining wall fig 20 shows m 0 curves in a unit length of the retaining wall corresponding to the displacement of retaining wall in fig 19 apparently m 0 curve of the series of h d 21 5 m can be easily differentiated from other series showing larger m 0 in both sides of the wall the maximum m 0 is located around the bottom of the aquifer ② if the bottom of the retaining wall is exactly designed close to the bottom of the aquifer ② this is very common because the wall are usually adopted to block groundwater seepage from beyond the excavation wall cracks may appear there due to no steel rebars embedded in the bottom of the wall china academy of building research 2012 technical committee 2013 at this time the designed hydraulic barrier effect of retaining wall in aquifer ② may be invalid since the groundwater outside the excavation could easily flow across the wall cracks and into the range of excavation ped and the follow up staged dewatering during excavation may cause a decrease of the groundwater head outside the excavation wu et al 2016 xu et al 2014 which will result in additional ground settlement and consequently damage the adjacent facilities pujades et al 2014a 2017 wang et al 2016 the reasons why wall deflection curve and m 0 curve of the series of h d 21 5 m is distinguished from those of other series are as follows when h d reaches aquifer ② the groundwater in aquifer ② can be quickly discharged due to better permeability of aquifer ② as shown in fig 21 the pore water pressure p w and total earth pressure in aquifer ② will experience a significant decrease the wall deflection will be greatly developed in the aquifer ② due to the imbalance of earth pressure on both sides of retaining wall in the mean time however the wall deflection increments in the aquitard ① and the upper strata is very little due to the resistance of soils in and above aquitard ① the inconformity of the wall deflection increments in aquifer ② and in its above strata makes the difference of the wall deflection and m 0 curves imagine further if a thicker aquifer ② is encountered in the field if the aquitard ② is lost in some place causing the two aquifers originally isolated by aquitard ② to be connected the aquifer ② will be especially thick ped induced wall deflection increment in aquifer ② will be greater and the inconformity of the wall deflection increments in aquifer ② and in its above strata will be more seriously which may cause even greater bending moment to arise in the aquifer ② from a hydrogeological perspective the aquifer ② is a confined aquifer hence it should avoid discharging groundwater from thick confined aquifers before excavation for a long time and meanwhile the designers should allocate enough steel rebars around the bottom of the confined aquifer preventing the appearance of considerable bending moments and wall cracks there 4 3 2 maximum wall deflection δhm and surface settlement δvm fig 22 shows δ hm and δ vm and their relationship with dewatering depth h d the variation of δ hm and δ vm are synchronous the ratios of δ vm to δ hm vary within the interval of 0 46 0 67 according to the calculated results when h d changes from 5 5 m to 11 m and from 19 m to 21 5 m labelled as condition a1 and a2 respectively δ hm and δ vm experience a rapid growth this indicates that when h d reaches a well drained soil layer greater wall deflection and surface settlement increments will occur if h d is further increased this effect is more apparent when h d reaches the deeper aquifers however when h d changes from 11 m to 19 m labelled as condition b δ hm and δ vm increase slowly but their growth rates increase gradually after h d reaches 16 m i e approximately the center of the thick aquitard ① this indicated that the wall deflection and surface settlement increments could not be obvious with h d increased as to the condition that thick aquitard exists below h d but after h d reaches the center of the thick aquitard the growth rates of wall deflection and surface settlement will increase gradually with the further increase of h d the reasons why δ hm and δ vm increments differ under different interval of h d are as follows 1 as to condition a1 and a2 h d reaches aquifers ① and ② respectively the two layers are well drained the pore water pressure p w in these layers decrease rapidly during dewatering which creates a drainage surface at the top of the underlying aquitards ① and ② respectively therefore the depth range of soil layers having p w decrease and δσ enlarge downward apparently which causes the maximum wall deflection to increase greatly during the excavation in a congested urban environment when the pre excavation dewatering depth is intended to reach a well drained stratum it should be as shallow as possible to allocate the pump and strictly control its position preventing considerable wall deflection and surrounding settlement increments induced by over dewatering i e allocating pump to deeper location than designed 2 as to condition b thick aquitard exists below h d p w in aquitard ① and the underlying strata will not decrease obviously due to the low permeability of aquitard ① there is no essential change in the drainage condition of the aquitard ① during h d increase i e a wide range of the aquitard ① is always affected by the single drainage boundary with the seepage surface at the top of aquitard ① the depth range of soil layers having p w decrease and δσ could not enlarge downward greatly therefore wall deflection increment could not be obvious in this condition it should be noted that with the distance between the bottom of h d to the bottom of aquitard ① getting smaller especially after h d reaches the center of the thick aquitard ① p w and total earth pressure in aquitard ① and the underlying soil layers will decrease gradually which can be seen in fig 21 at this time the growth rate of wall deflection will increase gradually with the increase of h d in practical project the ped depth can be arranged reasonably according to the specific site condition when thick aquitard appears in the field the dewatering depth can be increased appropriately within the thick aquitard but once the dewatering depth reaches the center of the thick aquitard the further increase of dewatering depth should be cautious in order to speed up the ped construction under the condition that the wall deflection and surrounding settlement increments are not much 4 3 3 depth range of wall deflection hc and piz of ground deformation fig 23 presents pizh pizv and h c and their relationship with h d in fig 23 piz of soil vertical deformation δ v and horizontal deformation δ hs are presented in figures a and b respectively pizh pizv and h c become greater with the increase of h d and their variation are synchronous when h d 16 m pizh and pizv increase slowly and their values vary at the range of 0 4 1 4h d for the piz of δ v and 1 2 1 7h d for the piz of δ hs the pizv values are close to the lower bound and the pizh values are close to the upper limit however when h d 16 m i e when h d exceeds the center of the thick aquitard ① pizh and pizv all grow rapidly and their values vary at the range of approximately 1 4 2 3h d for the piz of δ v and 1 7 2 4h d for the piz of δ hs likewise pizv and pizh values are close to the lower and upper bounds respectively besides the h c values always fall around h c 1 4h d see figure a the above results indicate that whether the h d exceeds the center of a thick aquitard has a great influence on h c and the soil deformation range behind the wall after h d exceed the center of a thick aquitard ped induced h c and the soil deformation range will experience a rapid growth the piz of soil deformation will reach a relatively larger range both in the horizontal and vertical direction it should avoid allocating the pump to exceed the center of the thick aquitard during ped if deep buried tunnels and pile foundations arise within the piz of soil deformation 5 concluding remarks this paper establishes a 3d soil fluid coupled fe model to simulate a pre excavation dewatering ped test in tianjin china the model is verified by field observations of wall deflection and groundwater seepage then through extensive 3d numerical simulations the responses of retaining wall and surrounding ground to ped in an alternated multi aquifer aquitard system maas under different soil permeability and dewatering depth are investigated the following conclusions can be drawn based on this research 1 under the common condition of pre excavation dewatering ped the maximum wall defection δ hm and surface settlement δ vm can all reach centimeter level the ratio of δ vm to δ hm varies at the range of 0 45 0 67 the surface settlement within a distance of approximately 1 0 2 0 h d behind the wall is extremely nonuniform buildings or public facilities within this distance may be subject to the influence of severe differential settlement the depth range of wall deflection h c averages about 1 4 times dewatering depth h d the primary influence zone piz of vertical soil deformation δ v behind the wall is a long and narrow shape i e piz of δ v is much larger in the horizontal direction mainly at the range of 1 4 2 3h d in this study compared to in the vertical direction mainly at the range of 0 4 1 4h d piz of horizontal soil deformation δ hs behind the wall is more like a quarter of circle arc with smaller difference in both horizontal mainly at the range of 1 7 2 4h d in this study and vertical direction mainly at the range of 1 2 1 7h d in this study generally piz of δ v is greater than piz of δ hs in both horizontal and vertical directions 2 if the soils within h d have better permeability ped induced wall and soil deformations will be more obvious on this occasion it should be careful to carry out ped and increase the monitoring frequency of wall and soil deformation once large and undesired increments of wall and soil deformations occur it should reduce the drawdown or even stop dewatering 3 if an aquifer appears below h d further increasing h d can induce considerable increments of wall and soil deformations on this occasion it should be as shallow as possible to allocate the pump and avoid the over dewatering if thick aquitard appears below h d the increments of wall and soil deformations induced by further increasing h d is not apparent however once h d exceeds the center of the thick aquitard the further increase of h d will cause wall and soil deformations to experience a rapid growth and the soil deformation zones behind the wall will enlarge significantly it should avoid allocating pump to exceed the center of the thick aquitard during ped if existing underground structures arise in a close proximity to the excavation 4 if the aquitard between two aquifers in the field is embedded with lenticle of sandy soils leading to strong vertical hydraulic connection between aquifers it should avoid allocating the pump to reach this aquitard during ped otherwise h c and soil deformation zones behind the wall will enlarge greatly at this time the surrounding underground structures may be severely affected by ped 5 if h d reaches a thick confined aquifer wall deflection will be greatly developed there which may cause the maximum bending moment in the retaining wall to arise around the bottom of the confined aquifer the designers should consider this condition and allocate enough steel rebars there preventing the appearance of wall cracks in the confined aquifer besides it should avoid discharging groundwater from thick confined aquifers before excavation for a long time

7407,pre excavation dewatering ped is an important construction stage in deep excavation field measurements show that retaining walls can develop obvious deflections during ped which has been rarely considered in the past the characteristics of ped induced wall deflection and the relationship of this deflection to surrounding ground deformation are still unclear in this study a ped test is simulated by a numerical model the model is verified by field observations and used to investigate the responses of retaining wall and surrounding ground to ped results indicate that the maximum wall defection δ hm and surface settlement δ vm can all reach centimeter level under common conditions of ped the ratio of δ vm to δ hm varies at the range of 0 45 0 67 wall and soil deformations will be more obvious if the soils within the dewatering depth h d have better permeability the relative positions between h d and strata i e aquifer or aquitard have great influence on the ped induced deformations if an aquifer appears below h d further increasing h d can induce a rapid growth of wall and soil deformations if thick aquitard appears below h d the deformation increments by further increasing h d are not apparent however once h d exceeds the center of the thick aquitard and reaches a thick confined aquifer the wall deflections and soil deformation zones behind the wall will enlarge significantly meanwhile a large bending moment in the retaining wall will arise around the bottom of the confined aquifer the designers should consider this condition and allocate enough steel rebars there preventing the appearance of wall cracks in the confined aquifer keywords deep excavation dewatering wall deflection ground deformation groundwater seepage numerical simulation 1 introduction in recent years with the rapid development of underground space exploitation in big cities plenty of deep excavations appear in the congested urban environment these excavations are featured by a close proximity to existing underground structures such as metro tunnels and pile foundations see fig 1 the environment deformations induced by deep excavation should be strictly controlled for example the final deformation and differential deformation of existing metro tunnels are demanded to be controlled within 5 20 mm chang et al 2001 chen et al 2016 hu et al 2003 huang et al 2013 liang et al 2018 ng et al 2013 sharma et al 2001 shi et al 2015 xing et al 2016 which is a huge challenge to engineers as is known to all the construction processes of deep excavation consist of many stages such as the construction of retaining wall dewatering staged excavation construction of slabs or struts removal of struts and backfill and the groundwater level recovery as shown in fig 2 in fact the whole construction processes of excavation can cause environment deformation in order to more proactively control the deformation in a planned way and to ensure that the final deformation could meet the strict control requirement the control demand for the final deformation should be decomposed into the control demand in each construction stage and the dynamic control i e the real time control of deformation according to the real time monitoring data of deformation by stages should be conducted xu et al 2016 this indicates that the environment deformations induced by each construction stage need to be controlled within smaller value maybe several millimeters it is clear that the construction in current deep excavation must be conducted more carefully and the deformations induced by the whole construction processes need to be considered and controlled the pre excavation dewatering also called as test pumping and denoted as ped in this paper as shown in fig 2 is an important construction stage before excavation to check the completion quality of dewatering wells and obtain sufficient parameters so that the dewatering system can be optimized cashman and preene 2012 powers 2007 wang et al 2009 2016 2017 wu et al 2016 yao et al 2006 zeng et al 2017a b c zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2014a typically the discharge flow rate of dewatering wells and the drawdown in dewatering wells need to be tested and should meet the design requirement before excavation cashman and preene 2012 powers 2007 wang et al 2017 yao et al 2006 moreover ped is also used as pumping test to evaluate the hydrogeological parameters of aquifers and the hydraulic barrier effect of retaining wall note the retaining wall in our study refers to an underground structure that can not only retain soil but also block groundwater e g the diaphragm wall pujades et al 2014a b shen et al 2015 wu et al 2015a b 2016 xu et al 2014 considering that the retaining wall already existed before ped the retaining wall is expected to be affected by ped and appears deformation response zheng et al 2014a ever reported a case study of ped in a metro excavation in tianjin china inward cantilever deflections were observed for a diaphragm wall in the ped test and the maximum deflection was about 10 mm which reached 37 6 of the allowable wall deflection i e about 27 mm for the project based on numerical simulation zheng et al 2014a pointed out that the seepage force around the dewatering well during ped can cause the inward horizontal displacement of the soil inside the excavation and thus the redistribution of earth pressure on the excavated side of the wall occurs which disequilibrates the original earth pressure on both sides of the wall and leads to the inward wall deflections during ped however in practice it is usually considered that no wall deflection exists before excavation for this reason the existing studies about deep excavation are mainly focused on the deformation induced by staged excavation and bracing including field studies finno and roboski 2005 liu et al 2016 ou et al 1998 tan et al 2016 tan and lu 2017a b analytical and numerical analyses bryson and kotheimer 2011 hashash et al 2006 hsieh et al 2013 osouli et al 2010 ou et al 2013 whittle et al 1993 xing et al 2016 and empirical or semiempirical approaches bryson and zapata medina 2012 clough and o rourke 1990 goh et al 2017 hsieh and ou 1998 2016 moormann 2004 ou et al 1993 these studies only considered the deformations induced during and after excavation and ignored the deformations induced before excavation i e the ped induced retaining wall deflections and surrounding environment deformations although some authors pujades et al 2014a b 2017 wang et al 2009 2016 2017 wu et al 2015a b 2016 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 carried out ped tests and relevant numerical simulations their concerns were the dewatering induced drawdown curve and the soil settlement induced by drawdown they did not investigate wall deflection and its relationship with surrounding ground deformation during ped in fact the wall deflection will induce ground loss behind the wall then the soils outside the excavation will move towards the retaining wall peck 1969 however the characteristics of ped induced wall and surrounding ground movements are still unclear due to the lack of well documented field data or theoretical analyses in this study a three dimensional 3d finite element fe model considering soil fluid coupling is developed to simulate a ped test in tianjin china the model is verified by the field measurements then parametrical studies are performed to investigate the responses of retaining wall and surrounding ground to ped in different hydrogeological environments two parameters are considered in this study which are the soil permeability and the dewatering depth by changing their values in the numerical models a series of 3d numerical simulations are conducted the wall deflections and surrounding ground deformations under different soil permeability and dewatering depth are compared and analyzed on this basis the variation rules of ped induced soil deformation zone behind the wall are obtained and meanwhile a series of optimized design schemes of ped are proposed for reference to designers in order to ensure that the retaining wall and surrounding ground would not develop considerable deformations during ped 2 overview of background fig 3 presents a deep excavation for a metro station in tianjin china this excavation consisted of three sections i e excavation a excavation b and the interchange shaft the excavation depth and width can be seen in fig 3 the retaining structure was a reinforced concrete diaphragm wall that was 0 8 m thick and 33 0 m deep for the excavation a and b several buildings existed around the excavation but the building behaviors were not the target in this study and thus the layouts of the surrounding buildings are not presented in fig 3 the allowable wall deflection for this project is 0 14 of the final excavation depth i e about 27 mm according to the corresponding protection grade specified by the local metro construction standard tianjin construction management committee 2009 according to the geotechnical investigation report as shown in table 1 soils at the site consist of saturated silts silty clays and silty fine sands in the upper 50 m below the ground surface bgs the soil layers can be defined as an alternated multi aquifer aquitard system maas there are one phreatic aquifer and three confined aquifers within the depth of 50 m bgs the aquifers are separated by three aquitards the corresponding soil types and soil properties for the aquifers and aquitards are presented in table 1 where the modified cam clay mcc model roscoe and burland 1968 wood 1990 is a constitutive model used to simulate the behavior of soil during dewatering in the numerical simulation which will be described detailly in section 3 the long term phreatic water level was observed at depths of 0 8 2 9 m bgs the hydrostatic equilibrium for the three confined aquifers were reached at 3 26 4 12 and 5 0 m bgs respectively from the upper to the lower layers since the excavation would be performed below the groundwater level dewatering was adopted to ensure excavation safety as shown in fig 3 there were a total of 9 and 10 wells in excavations a s1 s9 and b s10 s19 respectively the wells were drilled with a diameter of 650 mm and were fitted with a steel well liner with a diameter of 273 mm the liner had a section slotted i e well screen from 2 m bgs to approximately 3 m below the final excavation depth to ensure that the water table could be lowered below the final excavation depth during excavation the borehole annuli were sealed above the screen level with clay the deflections of the diaphragm walls were monitored by fully automatic total station and 14 inclinometer tubes c1 c6 for excavation a and the others for excavation b that were affixed to the steel reinforcement cages and later covered by concrete the fully automatic total station was employed to monitor the horizontal displacement at wall top and the inclinometers were used to monitor the relative deflections between wall sections below the wall top the reason why the two equipment were used in combination is that the inclinometers may just give a relatively accurate result of the relative wall deflections the obtainment of the real or absolute wall deflections depends on the accurate monitoring of the displacement at inclinometer top or toe i e the base point must be determined either at inclinometer top or toe and the displacement at base point must be accurately obtained the traditional method is that choose the inclinometer toe as the base point assume the displacement at inclinometer toe as zero and then compute the wall deflection from down to top based on the zero value at inclinometer toe however since the inclinometer toe may still develop movement even if the inclinometer is installed to the wall toe tan and wei 2012 tan and wang 2013 tan et al 2015 tan and lu 2017b the traditional method to obtain the wall deflection may inappropriate especially in the area with a thick layer of soft soils as a better choice the fully automatic total station is employed and some measures e g for a specific survey area at least 3 reference points are placed at a distance of over 4 times the final excavation depth behind the diaphragm wall are taken to ensure the obtainment of accurate measurements of horizontal displacement at the wall top and then the wall deflections below the wall top can be computed from top to down based on the horizontal displacement at the wall top and the relative wall deflections observed by inclinometers shandong construction department 2009 tan and wei 2012 tan and wang 2013 tan et al 2015 tan and lu 2017b the precision of field measurements for horizontal displacement at the wall top and below the wall top can reach 0 8 mm and 0 02 mm 0 5 m respectively which are all meet the requirements specified by the national construction standard in china shandong construction department 2009 this study focuses on ped test in excavation a and thus the layout of inclinometer tubes in excavation b is not shown in fig 3 in addition the observation wells to monitor the water levels of phreatic aquifer and confined aquifers and the soil and adjacent building settlement markers were also mounted around the excavation however observation results showed no changes of water level and environment deformations were not monitored during ped test in excavation a therefore the specific layouts of observation wells and soil and adjacent building settlement markers are not presented in fig 3 after the diaphragm walls and dewatering wells were installed on site two ped tests t1 and t2 were carried out in excavation a and b respectively to check the completion quality of the wells t1 lasted 10 days during which all of the dewatering wells in excavations a were operating the dewatering target depth is 16 m but this target was expected to achieve by stages i e dewatering with dewatering depth h d of 4 8 12 and 16 m were conducted successively in four stages each stage lasted 2 5 days wall deflections were monitored during t1 the discharge rate was not accurately obtained since flowmeter had not been installed on the wells in excavation a however experienced engineers using visual observations found that the groundwater yield decreased with the time elapsed during each dewatering stage at the end of the dewatering test the measurements of groundwater level in some of the dewatering wells showed that the groundwater level was located at the pump depth which means that the prescribed dewatering depth was reached hence the completion quality of the wells is creditable and can meet the design requirement t2 lasted 5 days the dewatering depth was 15 20 m for different wells each well in excavation b was equipped with a flowmeter due to the approximately identical site condition and well arrangement of excavation a and b it is assumed that the discharge rate observed in excavation b can directly reflect that in excavation a t2 indicated that the discharge rate q ranged from 6 to 20 m3 d for different wells on the first day and decreased to a range of 0 3 7 m3 d after a 5 day dewatering period 3 numerical model and verification 3 1 model setup in this section a 3d fe model is developed in a fe software abaqus which considers the fluid mechanical interaction using the biot consolidation theory biot 1941 then the t1 is simulated the computed wall deflections ground deformations groundwater seepage and discharge rate are analyzed and compared with the test results to validate the model fig 4 shows the mesh of the fe model considering the excavation with dimensions of approximately 200 m by 20 m in plane the dimensions of the model are set to 400 m by 230 m in plane hence the distance of the lateral soil boundary to retaining wall is about 100 m which exceeds the zone of influence of the dewatering well estimated by sichardt s formula cashman and preene 2012 the model is set to 50 m in depth according to the actual soil conditions at the excavation site the model strata are divided into 9 layers besides considering the stress and deformations of soil could undergo a relatively large development around the excavation the horizontal and vertical mesh are refined there in order to obtain relatively accurate results the initial groundwater level is assumed to be located at the ground surface and the soils are considered to be under the normally consolidated state before dewatering zheng et al 2014a the soil movements at the bottom of the model are restrained in all directions grid points over four vertical sides are only free to move in the vertical direction and restrained from movement in other directions besides the lateral soil boundaries are recharged by a constant head at the ground surface the bottom of the soil is impermeable the top of the soil is set on a drainage only flow dof boundary which will be explained in the following the soil is modeled with the 8 node trilinear displacement and pore pressure solid elements the behavior of the soils is assumed to obey the constitutive theory of modified cam clay mcc roscoe and burland 1968 wood 1990 during dewatering table 1 summarizes the main parameters for mcc model of each soil layer λ κ and m are obtained from triaxial tests k 0 is acquired from the pressuremeter test e cs is computed according to the initial stress state initial void ratio e 0 λ and κ of soil wood 1990 k h and k v are determined by numerical inversion based on pumping tests the diaphragm wall is modeled by 8 node linear solid incompatible elements here the incompatible element is used to improve the bending behavior of the diaphragm wall hibbitt et al 2004 the linear elastic model is adopted for the diaphragm wall the young s moduli of the diaphragm wall is 3 107 kpa china academy of building research 2010 the soil structure interface in abaqus is a zero thickness interface formed by duplicated nodes of soil and structure elements in contact it can simulate slip along the soil structure interface the friction behavior governed by a limiting shear slip γ crit and friction coefficient μ complies with the coulomb frictional law in this study γ crit and μ are set to 5 mm and 0 3 respectively diao and zheng 2008 zheng et al 2011 2014a the structure of dewatering well is simulated by 4 node doubly curved shell elements the geometry and distribution of dewatering well in the model is generally in agreement with the description in section 2 as shown in fig 4 for simplicity the borehole annuli of the dewatering well are not considered the linear elastic model is adopted for the dewatering well the young s moduli of the dewatering well is 2 1 108 kpa china academy of building research 2010 the function of dewatering well is simulated by applying a seepage boundary on a zone where the screen of the dewatering well is located in this paper the drainage only flow dof seepage boundary is set on the screen zone zheng et al 2014a the dof boundary assumes that the pore fluid velocity v n which is in the direction outward from the soil element surface is equal to k s p w i e v n k s p w when p w is positive where k s is termed the seepage coefficient and p w is the pore water pressure on the element surface v n will be equal to 0 when p w is negative three features for the practical dewatering process can be considered by the dof boundary 1 groundwater can only flow out from the soil and cannot flow in from the well 2 v n will be larger at deeper locations in the well than at shallow locations and 3 for a specific k s v n will decrease due to p w decrease with the elapsed dewatering time the initial value of ks can be obtained using eq 1 where d is the well diameter l is the length of screening and q is discharge flow rate the derivation process of eq 1 can be referred to zheng et al 2014a q observed in ped tests see section 2 can be adopted to calculate ks although q was not monitored in t1 the observation results for q in t2 can be used because of the approximately identical site conditions and well arrangement of t1 and t2 1 k s q π dlp w the fe modeling is conducted according to t1 presented in section 2 the details of the simulation process can be found in zheng et al 2014a only a brief summary is presented here after the soil initial state is established and the wall and dewatering wells are set up in the model the dof seepage boundary is activated i e the dewatering process is simulated however because the dewatering with dewatering depth h d of 4 8 12 and 16 m were conducted successively every 2 5 days during dewatering test the dof seepage boundary on the corresponding range of screen in the fe model is activated stepwise 3 2 simulation results 3 2 1 groundwater seepage and discharge rate in the fe model pore water pressure p w is used to evaluate whether the soil is saturated or not and the change of p w can reflect the groundwater seepage during the dewatering simulation p w of the soil elements around the dewatering well decrease indicating that the groundwater volume decreases in practice in order to clearly reflect the groundwater seepage inside the excavation during ped a normalized index the degree of drainage η is defined by the ratio of reduction in p w δp w during dewatering to the initial value of p w p w ini before dewatering i e η δp w p w ini η approaches one during the dewatering simulation fig 5 presents the calculated contour of η for the inner soil at section 1 1 see fig 4 of excavation a after each dewatering stage there is a denser contour of η around the well indicating that a high hydraulic gradient i developed the drainage proceeds under the action of i additionally η is higher for the soil closer to the well due to the cone of depression around the well cashman and preene 2012 powers 2007 xue 1986 at the end of the dewatering process i e stage 4 η is no less than 0 8 for the soils immediately adjacent to the dewatering well within dewatering depth i e 16 m which means the groundwater drawdown in or around dewatering wells can basically reach the dewatering depth this conclusion corresponds with the field observation results see section 2 fig 6 shows the calculated contour of η for the soils behind the right wall at the end of dewatering stage 4 the values of η are concentrated at an extremely small range i e 0 0 01 and a huge part of the η values are equal to 0 this is also the reason why the contour of η appears to be disorder this result indicates that the groundwater level outside the excavation is almost unchanged which corresponds with the field observation results see section 2 in fact the reason is that the phreatic aquifer and two confined aquifers are cut off by diaphragm wall and thus the hydraulic connection between inside and outside of the excavation are weak fig 7 presents the calculated real time discharge rate q during each dewatering stage in the first 2 5 days the dewatering depth h d is 4 m and thus the area of water crossing surface is relatively small which leads to the relatively small q and no clear variation of q for that period however q increases sharply when the pumps enter the clayey silts i e h d 8 m that is because the permeability of this layer is relatively better and thus the groundwater recharge from around the dewatering well in this layer is relatively stronger which leads to a larger groundwater yield at the beginning of this dewatering stage i e stage 2 then a decrease in q becomes clear in each dewatering stage over time which is consistent with the observation results see section 2 besides as mentioned in section 2 q was not monitored in t1 but in t2 due to the approximately identical soil condition and well arrangement in t1 and t2 see section 2 and fig 3 it can be assumed that the observed q in t2 can reflect that in t1 based on this assumption it is believed that the observed q in t2 can to some extent be used to check the reasonability of calculated q in t1 e g at least the calculated variation trend of q and the variation range of q should correspond with the observed results if the calculated results are reasonable hence a comparison is conducted between observed q in t2 and calculated q in t1 because the duration of stages 3 and 4 i e 5 days in t1 and the dewatering depth in that period i e 12 16 m are similar to the duration i e 5 days and dewatering depth i e 15 20 m in t2 see section 2 the comparison is made between the calculated q from stages 3 and 4 in t1 and the observed q in t2 as shown in fig 7 on the first day of dewatering the observed q was varying from 6 0 m3 d to 15 6 m3 d averaged about 12 0 m3 d for wells with h d 15 m and from 19 2 m3 d to 19 8 m3 d averaged about 19 5 m3 d for wells with h d 20 m after a 5 day dewatering period the observed q decreased to a range of 0 3 2 5 m3 d averaged about 2 0 m3 d for wells with h d 15 m and a range of 5 2 7 0 m3 d averaged about 6 0 m3 d for wells with h d 20 m since the soil conditions in different dewatering wells may be slightly different the observed values show a certain degree of dispersion the calculated variation trend of q corresponds with the field observation results and the calculated values are basically within the variation range of the observed values 3 2 2 wall deflections and ground deformations fig 8 compares the calculated wall deflections and ground surface settlements at c1 and c3 see fig 3 with the corresponding field observations and empirical prediction curve the empirical prediction curves are reprinted from hsieh and ou 1998 by using the dewatering depth h d to substitute the excavation depth adopted in their literature in order to obtain the relationship between the influence range of surface settlement behind the wall and h d d h d is employed in the graph of surface settlement as one of the horizontal axis where d distance from the wall and the final dewatering depth of 16 m is adopted here for h d the deflection pattern of wall is cantilever type with the maximum wall deflection δ hm at the wall top the calculated wall deflections in the upper 19 m are consistent with those observed meanwhile the calculated curves indicate that the diaphragm wall also develops deflections of 0 1 mm from 19 m bgs to the wall bottom the surface settlement profile is spandrel type which is mainly induced by the ground loss behind the wall due to wall deflection during ped since the mechanism of ped induced surface settlement is similar to that of excavation induced surface settlement the empirical curve of surface settlement proposed by hsieh and ou 1998 is employed as a contrast to the calculated final surface settlements the values corresponding to 10 day dewatering relatively larger mismatches between the calculated and empirical curves are found at the range of d h d 2 however after d h d 2 the two curves match well meanwhile the two curves show that the influence range of surface settlements are almost the same since the empirical curve is obtained by regression analysis based on plenty of field data from excavation and not all of the field data are completely consistent with the empirical curve hsieh and ou 1998 the appearance of incomplete coincidence between calculated and empirical curves is reasonable besides the calculated values show that with d h d increased from 0 to 1 the surface settlement decreases significantly buildings or public facilities within this distance may be subject to the influence of severe differential settlement moreover the ratios of the maximum surface settlement δ vm to the maximum wall deflection δ hm average about 0 50 according to the calculated results shown in fig 8 note δ vm and δ hm adopted here are corresponding to the maximum values in the series of 10 day dewatering fig 9 presents the calculated vertical deformation of soil δ v on the retained side of the wall at the section 1 1 see fig 4 in fig 9 a sections h1 h5 are used to monitor the δ v profile at different depths the spandrel type settlement profile can be seen at h1 h5 in the range of d h d 1 δ v reduces obviously with the increase of soil depth z soil heave cannot be found on the retained side of the wall even at the wall bottom i e z h d 2 0 this is different from the excavation induced ground behaviors which show some degree of soil heave around the wall bottom huang et al 2013 ou et al 2000 xing et al 2016 zheng et al 2014b in fig 9 b the primary influence zone piz of δ v is presented in this paper the piz is defined as an area with soil deformations no less than 1 mm hence δ v in piz of δ v must satisfy δ v 1 mm the piz of δ v in the vertical direction is significantly smaller than that in the horizontal direction this is different from the piz of δ v induced by deep excavation which shows large piz in the vertical direction huang et al 2013 ou et al 2000 xing et al 2016 zheng et al 2014b the reason can be explained as follows the deep excavation will cause apparent soil heave inside the excavation and thus it will occur soil movements from outside to inside of the excavation which makes the piz of δ v enlarge downward however the ped will cause large soil settlements inside the excavation zheng et al 2014a which prevent the soil movements from outside to inside of the excavation therefore the piz of δ v in the vertical direction is relatively smaller during ped fig 10 presents the calculated horizontal deformation of soil δ hs on the retained side of the wall at the section 1 1 in fig 10 a sections v1 v5 are used to monitor the δ hs profile at different distance from the wall d the cantilever type deformation profile can be seen at v1 v5 in the range of z h d 1 δ hs reduces obviously with the increase of d in fig 10 b the piz of δ hs is presented δ hs in piz of δ hs must satisfy δ hs 1 mm the piz of δ hs in both the vertical and horizontal direction have no significant difference and all reach the range of h d besides comparing figs 9 and 10 it can be seen that the soils are more likely to move in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction during ped because both the maximum δ hs and the piz of δ hs are greater than those of δ v 4 parametric study the above analyses indicate that the numerical model is able to simulate the groundwater seepage and wall and ground deformations induced by ped in an alternated multi aquifer aquitard system maas in this section a series of calculations are conducted to study the effect of soil permeability and dewatering depth on the ped induced wall and ground deformations 4 1 parameters value the soils in the field mainly contain silty clays and silts considering that the ped depth is typically within 20 m bgs the permeability of clayey silts k 2 buried from 5 5 m bgs to 11 m bgs i e aquifer ① the permeability of silty clays k 3 buried from 11 m bgs to 19 m bgs i e aquitard ① and the dewatering depth h d are considered as changing parameters in this paper the basic values and variation values of the parameters are shown in table 2 the basic values are equal to those in table 1 the variation values of k 2 and k 3 are selected according to their typical range reported in cashman and preene 2012 in the following sections all the calculated results are based on the basic values of parameters unless otherwise specified in section 4 2 the permeability anisotropy is not considered in the numerical model considering most of the excavations are not braced during the ped zheng et al 2014a all the calculation conditions in this study simulate this conventional situation the thickness of the retaining wall is uniformly set to 0 8 m the dewatering time is set to 10 days 4 2 effect of k2 and k3 4 2 1 maximum wall deflections δhm and surface settlements δvm fig 11 shows the wall deflection and surface settlement profiles at the end of 10 day dewatering under different k 2 and k 3 with the increase of k 2 and k 3 the wall deflections and surface settlements enlarge continuously as to the cases of k 2 0 01 and 1 m d and k 3 0 0001 and 0 01 m d the empirical curves for predicting surface settlements proposed by hsieh and ou 1998 are plotted in fig 11 likewise relatively larger mismatches between the calculated and empirical curves are found at the range of d h d 2 but after d h d 2 the two curves match well fig 12 presents δ hm and δ vm and their relationship with k 2 and k 3 both δ hm and δ vm increase nonlinearly with the increase of k 2 and k 3 and the growth rate decreases continuously which indicates that there exist limit values of δ hm and δ vm according to the regression equations the limit values of δ hm and δ vm under different k 2 and k 3 are shown in fig 12 besides the ratios of δ vm to δ hm vary within the interval of 0 45 0 59 according to the calculated results the reasons why δ hm and δ vm differ under different k 2 and k 3 are as follows with the increase of k 2 and k 3 the hydraulic conductivity of the corresponding strata will be higher the groundwater drawdown at the dewatering wells can be more quickly transmitted to the location of the retaining wall which will induce stronger redistribution of earth pressure on the excavated side of the wall this can be seen in fig 13 which is the distribution of the total earth pressure change δσ at the excavated side of the wall after 10 day dewatering under different k 2 and k 3 in fig 13 δσ indicates the decrease of the total earth pressure δσ occurs at most locations along the wall depth which breaks the original balance of the total earth pressure on both sides of the wall hence the inward wall deflections occur as to fig 13 a δσ becomes greater with the increase of k 2 which can be apparently seen at the range of 0 11 m bgs because the soil layer corresponding to k 2 is within 11 m bgs the apparent changes of δσ appear at the corresponding locations as to fig 13 b δσ becomes smaller and turns into δσ gradually with the increase of k 3 which can be seen apparently around and below the 11 m bgs because k 3 is corresponding to the soil layer below the 11 m bgs therefore δ hm and δ vm become larger with the increase of k 2 and k 3 during the excavation in a congested urban environment the pre excavation dewatering should be cautious if soils at the site mainly consist of strong permeable layers meanwhile the monitoring frequency of wall and soil deformations should be increased during the pre excavation dewatering once large increments of wall and soil deformations occur it should reduce the drawdown or stop dewatering so as to avoid the occurrence of large wall and soil deformations before excavation 4 2 2 depth range of wall deflection hc the wall deflections typically occur at a certain range of depth from the wall top h c is adopted in this paper to denote this depth range of wall deflection with the increase of h c the ground loss behind the wall will be more serious peck 1969 and then the soils outside the excavation will move more apparently towards the retaining wall i e the displacement of soils outside the excavation will be greater hence h c is another matter of concern to geotechnical engineers apart from the maximum wall deflection fig 14 presents the relationship between h c and the permeability of soil on semilog coordinate it should be noted that the buried depth of wall with deflection less than 1 mm are excluded in the data of h c in fig 14 in general h c becomes larger with the increase of k 2 and k 3 specifically h c increases slowly and is basically within the range of h d with the increase of k 2 noted that when k 2 changes k 3 remains unchanged at 5 10 4 m d however with the increase of k 3 h c grows rapidly and far surpass h d and h c h d can reach 1 7 these results indicate that when the bottom of h d locates in a thick aquitard e g 8 m thick clayey soils with permeability no greater than 5 10 4 m d with the embedded depth no more than approximately 0 5 times the thickness of the aquitard ped induced h c will not exceed the bottom of the thick aquitard and h c h d varies at the range of 0 7 1 1 however when the thick aquitard is embedded with lenticle of sandy soils thus having a relatively higher vertical permeability e g no less than 1 10 3 m d h c may reach the location of another aquitard below this thick aquitard the reasons why h c differs under different k 2 and k 3 are as follows 1 the dewatering depth in this section approximately locates in the middle of the thick aquitard ① as to the conditions varying k 2 because the permeability of aquitard ① is very low i e k 3 5 10 4 m d vertical seepage occurs in a wide range of the aquitard ① during ped with the seepage surface at the top of aquitard ① horizontal seepage only arises in the aquitard ① near the dewatering well cashman and preene 2012 powers 2007 under the influence of the single drainage boundary the consolidation of the aquitard ① is proceeding but will take some time according to terzaghi consolidation theory terzaghi et al 1996 therefore during a relatively short time ped it is difficult to occur substantial decrease of pore water pressure p w in aquitard ① and p w decrease in strata underlying aquitard ① will even less this can be seen in fig 15 a according to zheng et al 2014a the wall deflection will not be greatly developed in the aquitard ① and the underlying strata due to unapparent transformation of p w to the effective stress in the corresponding strata hence the growth of h c is relatively smaller with the increase of k 2 when the deep buried underground structures such as tunnel and pile foundation arise around deep excavation the effect of ped on the underground structures can be preliminary evaluated according to the relative position between underground structures and the thick aquitard in the field if the underground structures are located below a thick aquitard e g 8 m thick clayey soils with permeability no greater than 5 10 4 m d it can be deduced that the ped will not cause apparent deformation of the underground structures when the dewatering depth does not exceed 0 5 times the thickness of the thick aquitard 2 with the increase of k 3 the consolidation of aquitard ① is accelerated and the hydraulic connection between aquifer ① and aquifer ② becomes stronger hence p w in aquifer ② decreases gradually during dewatering and the larger the k 3 the more the p w decrease in aquifer ② which can be seen in fig 15 b the p w decrease in aquifer ② causes a seepage surface arising at the top of aquitard ② and thus the consolidation of aquitard ② occurs therefore the depth range of strata having p w decrease enlarges downward greatly see fig 15 b p w decreases continuously from aquitard ① to aquitard ② with the increase of k 3 according to zheng et al 2014a wall deflection will occur in the strata having p w decrease hence with the increase of k 3 h c grows continuously and far surpass the range of dewatering depth when the deep excavation is surrounded by deep buried tunnel pile foundation and other underground structures and meanwhile the aquitard between two aquifers in the field is embedded with lenticle of sandy soils leading to strong vertical hydraulic connection between aquifers the determination of dewatering depth should be cautious in this case if the dewatering depth reaches this aquitard h c may enlarge downward greatly and reach the location of another aquitard below this aquitard at this time the surrounding underground structures may be severely affected by pre excavation dewatering if their depths are within h c 4 2 3 piz of ground deformation the deformation range of soil outside the excavation is closely related to h c figs 16 and 17 show the relationship between the primary influence zone piz of soil deformations and h c under different k 2 and k 3 respectively the standards for ascertaining piz and h c are the same as those described in sections 3 2 2 and 4 2 2 respectively in figs 16 and 17 piz of soil vertical deformation δ v and horizontal deformation δ hs are presented in figures a and b respectively to clearly reflect the features of piz as shown in figs 16 and 17 pizh and pizv are employed to represent the maximum distance from the wall and the maximum depth of piz respectively the common points of the four figures are as follows firstly with the increase of k 2 and k 3 both pizh and pizv become larger and their variation are synchronous with h c but their growth rate decreases continuously which indicates that there exist limit values of soil deformation ranges behind the wall after k 2 0 5 m d or k 3 0 001 m d the soil deformation ranges have a little change secondly pizh is greater than pizv and h c in all cases which means that both the horizontal and vertical soil deformations behind the wall are propagated further in the horizontal direction rather than in the vertical direction during ped the primary different points of the four figures are as follows firstly as to piz of δ v as shown in figures a in both figs 16 and 17 pizv is significantly smaller than h c and pizh pizh pizv is ranged from 3 2 to 4 3 causing the piz of δ v to show a long and narrow shape however as to piz of δ hs as shown in figures b in both figs 16 and 17 pizv is equal to h c and pizh pizv ranged from 1 2 to 1 6 is relatively smaller causing that the shape of piz is like a quarter of an arc secondly comparing figures a and b in both figs 16 and 17 both pizh and pizv of δ hs are larger than those of δ v under the same k 2 or k 3 which indicates that the soil horizontal deformation behind the wall induced by ped can be propagated further and deeper compared to the soil vertical deformation besides with the increase of k 3 piz of soil deformations both δ v and δ hs could reach a relatively larger range both in the horizontal and vertical direction which can be seen by comparing figures a or figures b in both figs 16 and 17 in practical project when the thick aquitard in the field is found to be embedded with lenticle of sandy soils thus having a relatively higher vertical permeability it should avoid allocating the pump to reach this thick aquitard during ped if deep buried tunnels and pile foundations arise within the piz of soil deformation 4 3 effect of hd according to the above analysis the ped induced wall deflections and soil deformations have great relation with the permeability of soil below the bottom of dewatering depth h d in this section by changing h d in the numerical model a variety of cases considering soil layers with different permeability appearing below h d are calculated and analyzed fig 18 shows the relative positions between h d and soil layers adopted in this study in fig 18 case 1 5 are corresponding to h d 5 5 m 11 m 16 m 19 m and 21 5 m respectively in general two kinds of conditions are regarded one is the case 1 4 and 5 which are featured by well drained strata appearing below h d the other is the case 2 and 3 which are characterized by aquitard emerging below h d 4 3 1 wall deflection and surface settlement profiles fig 19 shows the wall deflection and surface settlement profiles under different h d with h d increased from 5 5 m to 21 5 m the wall deflections and surface settlements enlarge continuously as to each case of h d the empirical curves for predicting surface settlements proposed by hsieh and ou 1998 are plotted in fig 19 the calculated and empirical curves are in good agreement except the cases of h d 11 and 16 m which are characterized by aquitard emerging below h d according to the analysis above the thick aquitard ① limits the development of wall deflection in aquitard ① and the underlying soil layers causing that h c and pizh of δ v are relatively smaller hence the surface settlements decrease rapidly with the increase of d leading to a relatively larger mismatches between the calculated and empirical curves near the wall besides as to the case of h d 21 5 m the range of soil with apparent differential settlement can reach approximately 40 m behind the wall i e approximately the location of d h d 2 buildings or public facilities within this range may be subject to the influence of severe differential settlement it should be noted that when h d reaches aquifer ② i e the series of h d 21 5 m in fig 19 the corresponding wall deflection curve is totally different with other cases showing a concave shape from approximately 11 m bgs to 24 m bgs this may have a great influence on the bending moment m 0 in the retaining wall fig 20 shows m 0 curves in a unit length of the retaining wall corresponding to the displacement of retaining wall in fig 19 apparently m 0 curve of the series of h d 21 5 m can be easily differentiated from other series showing larger m 0 in both sides of the wall the maximum m 0 is located around the bottom of the aquifer ② if the bottom of the retaining wall is exactly designed close to the bottom of the aquifer ② this is very common because the wall are usually adopted to block groundwater seepage from beyond the excavation wall cracks may appear there due to no steel rebars embedded in the bottom of the wall china academy of building research 2012 technical committee 2013 at this time the designed hydraulic barrier effect of retaining wall in aquifer ② may be invalid since the groundwater outside the excavation could easily flow across the wall cracks and into the range of excavation ped and the follow up staged dewatering during excavation may cause a decrease of the groundwater head outside the excavation wu et al 2016 xu et al 2014 which will result in additional ground settlement and consequently damage the adjacent facilities pujades et al 2014a 2017 wang et al 2016 the reasons why wall deflection curve and m 0 curve of the series of h d 21 5 m is distinguished from those of other series are as follows when h d reaches aquifer ② the groundwater in aquifer ② can be quickly discharged due to better permeability of aquifer ② as shown in fig 21 the pore water pressure p w and total earth pressure in aquifer ② will experience a significant decrease the wall deflection will be greatly developed in the aquifer ② due to the imbalance of earth pressure on both sides of retaining wall in the mean time however the wall deflection increments in the aquitard ① and the upper strata is very little due to the resistance of soils in and above aquitard ① the inconformity of the wall deflection increments in aquifer ② and in its above strata makes the difference of the wall deflection and m 0 curves imagine further if a thicker aquifer ② is encountered in the field if the aquitard ② is lost in some place causing the two aquifers originally isolated by aquitard ② to be connected the aquifer ② will be especially thick ped induced wall deflection increment in aquifer ② will be greater and the inconformity of the wall deflection increments in aquifer ② and in its above strata will be more seriously which may cause even greater bending moment to arise in the aquifer ② from a hydrogeological perspective the aquifer ② is a confined aquifer hence it should avoid discharging groundwater from thick confined aquifers before excavation for a long time and meanwhile the designers should allocate enough steel rebars around the bottom of the confined aquifer preventing the appearance of considerable bending moments and wall cracks there 4 3 2 maximum wall deflection δhm and surface settlement δvm fig 22 shows δ hm and δ vm and their relationship with dewatering depth h d the variation of δ hm and δ vm are synchronous the ratios of δ vm to δ hm vary within the interval of 0 46 0 67 according to the calculated results when h d changes from 5 5 m to 11 m and from 19 m to 21 5 m labelled as condition a1 and a2 respectively δ hm and δ vm experience a rapid growth this indicates that when h d reaches a well drained soil layer greater wall deflection and surface settlement increments will occur if h d is further increased this effect is more apparent when h d reaches the deeper aquifers however when h d changes from 11 m to 19 m labelled as condition b δ hm and δ vm increase slowly but their growth rates increase gradually after h d reaches 16 m i e approximately the center of the thick aquitard ① this indicated that the wall deflection and surface settlement increments could not be obvious with h d increased as to the condition that thick aquitard exists below h d but after h d reaches the center of the thick aquitard the growth rates of wall deflection and surface settlement will increase gradually with the further increase of h d the reasons why δ hm and δ vm increments differ under different interval of h d are as follows 1 as to condition a1 and a2 h d reaches aquifers ① and ② respectively the two layers are well drained the pore water pressure p w in these layers decrease rapidly during dewatering which creates a drainage surface at the top of the underlying aquitards ① and ② respectively therefore the depth range of soil layers having p w decrease and δσ enlarge downward apparently which causes the maximum wall deflection to increase greatly during the excavation in a congested urban environment when the pre excavation dewatering depth is intended to reach a well drained stratum it should be as shallow as possible to allocate the pump and strictly control its position preventing considerable wall deflection and surrounding settlement increments induced by over dewatering i e allocating pump to deeper location than designed 2 as to condition b thick aquitard exists below h d p w in aquitard ① and the underlying strata will not decrease obviously due to the low permeability of aquitard ① there is no essential change in the drainage condition of the aquitard ① during h d increase i e a wide range of the aquitard ① is always affected by the single drainage boundary with the seepage surface at the top of aquitard ① the depth range of soil layers having p w decrease and δσ could not enlarge downward greatly therefore wall deflection increment could not be obvious in this condition it should be noted that with the distance between the bottom of h d to the bottom of aquitard ① getting smaller especially after h d reaches the center of the thick aquitard ① p w and total earth pressure in aquitard ① and the underlying soil layers will decrease gradually which can be seen in fig 21 at this time the growth rate of wall deflection will increase gradually with the increase of h d in practical project the ped depth can be arranged reasonably according to the specific site condition when thick aquitard appears in the field the dewatering depth can be increased appropriately within the thick aquitard but once the dewatering depth reaches the center of the thick aquitard the further increase of dewatering depth should be cautious in order to speed up the ped construction under the condition that the wall deflection and surrounding settlement increments are not much 4 3 3 depth range of wall deflection hc and piz of ground deformation fig 23 presents pizh pizv and h c and their relationship with h d in fig 23 piz of soil vertical deformation δ v and horizontal deformation δ hs are presented in figures a and b respectively pizh pizv and h c become greater with the increase of h d and their variation are synchronous when h d 16 m pizh and pizv increase slowly and their values vary at the range of 0 4 1 4h d for the piz of δ v and 1 2 1 7h d for the piz of δ hs the pizv values are close to the lower bound and the pizh values are close to the upper limit however when h d 16 m i e when h d exceeds the center of the thick aquitard ① pizh and pizv all grow rapidly and their values vary at the range of approximately 1 4 2 3h d for the piz of δ v and 1 7 2 4h d for the piz of δ hs likewise pizv and pizh values are close to the lower and upper bounds respectively besides the h c values always fall around h c 1 4h d see figure a the above results indicate that whether the h d exceeds the center of a thick aquitard has a great influence on h c and the soil deformation range behind the wall after h d exceed the center of a thick aquitard ped induced h c and the soil deformation range will experience a rapid growth the piz of soil deformation will reach a relatively larger range both in the horizontal and vertical direction it should avoid allocating the pump to exceed the center of the thick aquitard during ped if deep buried tunnels and pile foundations arise within the piz of soil deformation 5 concluding remarks this paper establishes a 3d soil fluid coupled fe model to simulate a pre excavation dewatering ped test in tianjin china the model is verified by field observations of wall deflection and groundwater seepage then through extensive 3d numerical simulations the responses of retaining wall and surrounding ground to ped in an alternated multi aquifer aquitard system maas under different soil permeability and dewatering depth are investigated the following conclusions can be drawn based on this research 1 under the common condition of pre excavation dewatering ped the maximum wall defection δ hm and surface settlement δ vm can all reach centimeter level the ratio of δ vm to δ hm varies at the range of 0 45 0 67 the surface settlement within a distance of approximately 1 0 2 0 h d behind the wall is extremely nonuniform buildings or public facilities within this distance may be subject to the influence of severe differential settlement the depth range of wall deflection h c averages about 1 4 times dewatering depth h d the primary influence zone piz of vertical soil deformation δ v behind the wall is a long and narrow shape i e piz of δ v is much larger in the horizontal direction mainly at the range of 1 4 2 3h d in this study compared to in the vertical direction mainly at the range of 0 4 1 4h d piz of horizontal soil deformation δ hs behind the wall is more like a quarter of circle arc with smaller difference in both horizontal mainly at the range of 1 7 2 4h d in this study and vertical direction mainly at the range of 1 2 1 7h d in this study generally piz of δ v is greater than piz of δ hs in both horizontal and vertical directions 2 if the soils within h d have better permeability ped induced wall and soil deformations will be more obvious on this occasion it should be careful to carry out ped and increase the monitoring frequency of wall and soil deformation once large and undesired increments of wall and soil deformations occur it should reduce the drawdown or even stop dewatering 3 if an aquifer appears below h d further increasing h d can induce considerable increments of wall and soil deformations on this occasion it should be as shallow as possible to allocate the pump and avoid the over dewatering if thick aquitard appears below h d the increments of wall and soil deformations induced by further increasing h d is not apparent however once h d exceeds the center of the thick aquitard the further increase of h d will cause wall and soil deformations to experience a rapid growth and the soil deformation zones behind the wall will enlarge significantly it should avoid allocating pump to exceed the center of the thick aquitard during ped if existing underground structures arise in a close proximity to the excavation 4 if the aquitard between two aquifers in the field is embedded with lenticle of sandy soils leading to strong vertical hydraulic connection between aquifers it should avoid allocating the pump to reach this aquitard during ped otherwise h c and soil deformation zones behind the wall will enlarge greatly at this time the surrounding underground structures may be severely affected by ped 5 if h d reaches a thick confined aquifer wall deflection will be greatly developed there which may cause the maximum bending moment in the retaining wall to arise around the bottom of the confined aquifer the designers should consider this condition and allocate enough steel rebars there preventing the appearance of wall cracks in the confined aquifer besides it should avoid discharging groundwater from thick confined aquifers before excavation for a long time

7408,nineteen private wells were investigated in order to evaluate the groundwater quality and the issues associated with well water use in a fractured metasedimentary aquifer of the canadian shield in western quebec canada groundwater sampling and analysis reveal that the quality of well water is both a potential aesthetic and health concern for the residents aesthetic problems are mainly related to the high levels of hardness and dissolved iron and manganese potential health risks are associated with the occurrence of brackish groundwater high manganese concentrations and arsenic concentrations exceeding the canadian guideline value of 10 µg l brackish groundwater is suspected to be derived from the mixing of fresh groundwaters with deep calcium sodium chloride brines of the canadian shield the occurrences of iron manganese and arsenic primarily derived from the natural weathering of bedrock are highly dependent on the geochemical conditions in groundwater particularly the redox potential arsenic occurs mainly as arsenite as iii and is thought to be released by the dissolution of iron and manganese oxyhydroxides under reducing conditions information obtained from well owners indicates that most households use ion exchange water softeners to minimize aesthetic problems of excessive hardness and dissolved iron and manganese concentrations homeowners generally take protective measures to reduce their exposure to arsenic when they are aware of the contamination the exposure to arsenic and manganese may pose health risks for residents that do not take protective measures the quality of well water is of paramount importance for human health in rural areas information on the contaminant sources and individual mitigation measures is essential to assess the health risks associated with groundwater consumption and to ensure the protection of public health keywords arsenic manganese bedrock aquifers private wells public health abitibi temiscamingue 1 introduction groundwater is an important water resource that is estimated to be the source of one third of freshwater withdrawals and about 50 of current drinking water supplies in the world world water assessment programme 2009 most of the groundwater is abstracted from unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers owing to their wide distribution accessibility and significant groundwater resources margat and van der gun 2013 the crystalline bedrock aquifers consisting of igneous and metamorphic rocks are comparatively less important as sources of groundwater nevertheless domestic wells completed in bedrock aquifers may represent a vital source of water for people living in rural areas such as in sub saharan africa macdonald et al 2008 india perrin et al 2011 northern europe banks and robins 2002 and north america desimone et al 2009 the wells drilled in crystalline rocks generally provide modest yields but supply sufficient water for household use banks and robins 2002 perrin et al 2011 on the other hand the groundwater quality may be adversely affected by the presence of naturally occurring contaminants including dissolved metals and metalloids such as iron fe manganese mn and arsenic as fluoride f and radionuclides in particular radon rn radium ra and uranium u e g ahn 2012 ayotte et al 2003 vinson et al 2009 the occurrence of geogenic arsenic in private bedrock wells is a major public health concern in many parts of the world exposure to as from drinking water has been reported to be associated with serious adverse effects on human health kapaj et al 2006 ravenscroft et al 2009 the presence of as in bedrock groundwater is generally considered to be derived from the weathering of as bearing sulfide minerals often associated with hydrothermally altered zones and metasedimentary rocks bondu et al 2017a ravenscroft et al 2009 ryan et al 2015 however the mobilization of as in groundwater is known to be largely influenced by secondary minerals under oxidizing and near neutral ph conditions dissolved as sorbs strongly onto mineral surfaces especially fe mn oxyhydroxides and clay minerals conversely the dissolution of metal oxyhydroxides under reducing conditions may release as to bedrock groundwater lipfert et al 2006 yang et al 2015 the alkaline conditions have also been suspected to enhance the release of as by promoting the desorption from mineral surfaces ayotte et al 2003 the studies focusing on the arsenic contamination of bedrock groundwater have increased substantially in the last few years and new discoveries are regularly reported bondu et al 2016 in spite of this the factors controlling the mobilization and distribution of as in bedrock groundwater remains challenging in particular owing to the heterogeneity of mineral sources and geochemical conditions in the fractured bedrock o shea et al 2015 yang et al 2015 in addition the speciation of as is still poorly documented even though it has been demonstrated to affect its mobility and toxicity sorg et al 2014 the occurrence of dissolved iron and manganese is also a concern in private wells completed in metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks bhattacharya et al 2012 flanagan et al 2014 gillispie et al 2016 high fe and mn concentrations may cause aesthetic problems and there is now evidence that the exposure to mn in drinking water can cause neurotoxic effects in humans bouchard et al 2011 frisbie et al 2012 the concentrations of fe and mn in groundwater are known to be greatly influenced by the redox and ph conditions hem 1985 however knowledge about manganese contamination of groundwater is still very limited probably because manganese has until recently been regarded only as an aesthetic problem the groundwater quality in rural areas may also be degraded by anthropogenic contaminants including microbes and pharmaceutical compounds from sceptic tanks agricultural chemicals and deicing road salt banks and robins 2002

the province the abitibi temiscamingue region is an important mining area for gold and base metals located in the superior province of the canadian shield in this region the vast majority of wells in

bondu et al 2017b cloutier et al 2015 poissant 1997 in this context the objectives of this paper are to evaluate 1 the occurrence and sources of inorganic contaminants in well water and 2 the potential health risks associated with the use of groundwater from a metasedimentary rock aquifer for this purpose groundwater samples were collected from private bedrock wells and analyzed for stable water isotopes dissolved organic carbon major minor trace elements and arsenic speciation in addition information related to well water use and treatment was obtained from well owners the large variability in well water quality provides an overview of the problems commonly associated with bedrock groundwater 2 study area the study area is located 5 km south of the city of rouyn noranda

from 4 10 9 to 1 10 4 m s in the region cloutier et al 2015 most groundwater flow occurs in the upper part of the bedrock up to 100 m where conductive fractures are abundant in particular subhorizontal fractures rouleau et al 2013 by contrast the archean shear zones are thought to be sealed structures that are poorly permeable the bedrock aquifer is recharged through unconfined bedrock areas the areas confined by glaciolacustrine clays and silts are located further along the flow paths 3 material and method 3 1 groundwater sampling and field measurements groundwater samples were collected from 19 private bedrock wells in august 2014 fig 1 c all available information on well characteristics well water use and treatment was obtained from homeowners during the sampling campaign the sampled wells ranged in depth from 44 to 137 m most wells were 15 2 cm diameter boreholes equipped with submersible pumps some old wells drilled before 1970s were 5 1 cm diameter boreholes equipped with surface pumps groundwater sampling was performed using the production pumps bypassing water treatment systems if present temperature t specific conductance sc ph oxidation reduction potential orp and dissolved oxygen do were measured in the field using a multi parameter probe ysi 556 eh values were obtained from field orp measurements by adding the difference between the measured orp of zobells s solution and the theoretical eh of zobells s solution at the sample temperature prior to sampling bedrock wells were purged approximately 15 20 min until field parameters stabilized in order to ensure that sampled water was taken directly from the aquifer water samples were collected in pre cleaned hdpe bottles and included 1 one unfiltered and unacidified aliquot for alkalinity determination 2 one filtered and unacidified aliquot for anions and stable isotopes δ2h δ18o analyses 3 one filtered and acidified aliquot for cations and trace elements analyses and 4 one filtered

environmental grade anachemia the sample bottles were placed on ice in coolers for transport to the laboratory on the same day and stored at 4 c until analysis 3 2 analytical methods the chemical analyses of major minor and trace elements were performed at the laboratory of the research institute of mining and the environment of the university of quebec in abitibi temiscamingue uqat alkalinity

procedure described in bondu et al 2017b the spe method based on the separation of as species in the field recovery by elution in the laboratory and analysis by icp ms for total as allows the determination of four major dissolved as species inorganic arsenite as iii inorganic arsenate as v monomethylarsonic acid mma v and dimethylarsinic acid dma v calibration standard solutions were prepared from a certified stock standard solution of 10000 mg las scp science the detection limits were below 1 5 µg l for fe 0 4 µg l for mn 0 2 µg l for total as and as iii and 0 03 µg l for as v ma v and dma v quality control procedures included the analysis of a ceaeq standard reference sample blanks and duplicate samples as well as calculation of charge balances within 5 duplicate concentrations for major minor and trace elements were generally within 10 relative standard deviation rsd the precision of the speciation method was better than 2 rsd for each as species as reported in bondu et al 2017b stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were analyzed using a dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer micromass isoprime at the geotop laboratory of the university of quebec in montreal measurement precision 1σ was within 1 for δ2h and 0 05 for δ18o oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios are expressed as per mil deviations from the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the saturation indices si were calculated using the wateq4f thermodynamic database of the phreeqc program parkhurst and appelo 1999 thermodynamic data for secondary as phases were taken from the minteqa2 database allison et al 1991 and drahota and filippi 2009 4 results and discussion 4 1 physico chemical parameters and major ions chemistry a statistical summary of field parameters major ions selected minor and trace element concentrations and stable isotopes from sampled wells is given in table 1 groundwater ph was near neutral with ph values ranging from 6 85 to 7 65 mean 7 22 0 25 field eh measurements indicated mildly reducing conditions to oxidizing conditions range 86 428 mv the total hardness th ranged from 194 to 899 mg l caco3 meaning that all the well waters can be classified as very hard th 180 mg l caco3 according to the world health organization classification who 2011b the high values of hardness were mainly related to the amounts of calcium ca and magnesium mg and to a lesser degree iron fe manganese mn and strontium sr as shown in the piper diagram fig 2 well water was predominantly a calcium bicarbonate type except in two wells which had a calcium sodium bicarbonate chloride composition calcium bicarbonate groundwater characterized by low total dissolved solids tds 380 mg l high eh eh 400 mv and low na ca ratios na ca 0 15 occurred in wells completed in the unconfined bedrock aquifer this type of water likely contains a large proportion of recharge water and thus represents the less chemically evolved groundwater fig 3 by contrast calcium bicarbonate groundwaters characterized by higher tds tds 380 mg l lower eh eh 250 mv and higher na ca ratios are expected to be more chemically evolved waters reflecting the extended interaction with bedrock minerals along the flow paths fig 3 more chemically evolved groundwater occurred in wells completed in the confined bedrock aquifer i e further along the flow paths in particular the ca na hco3 subtype with na ca 0 3 eh 180 mv ph 7 45 and so4 10 mg l is thought to be the most chemically evolved water sampled in wells fig 3 during the chemical evolution of groundwater the redox potential tends to decrease in relation to the oxidation of dissolved organic matter and reduced minerals such as sulfides while the ph tends to increase owing to silicate hydrolysis reactions gascoyne 2004 ryan et al 2013 the increased na concentration is thought to be the result of the slow weathering of na feldspars and ion exchange on clay minerals gascoyne and kamineni 1994 on the other hand ca concentrations may decrease as the result of ion exchange and carbonate precipitation gascoyne 2004 moreover the precipitation of carbonate minerals may explain the decreased tds for the most chemically evolved groundwaters dark blue points in fig 3 the low so4 concentrations were probably related to the reduction of sulfate as evidenced by the strong smell of h2s in some wells the low na ca ratios occurring in two wells with a low eh and a medium tds could be related to the local depletion of the rock matrix in na fig 3 moreover calcium sodium bicarbonate chloride groundwater was characterized by elevated tds tds 1000 mg l mainly resulting from high ca and cl concentrations low eh eh 200 mv and near neutral ph the occurrence of ca na hco3 cl groundwater may result from the use of road deicing salts in particular of sodium and calcium chloride composition but also from the mixing of fresh groundwaters with deep brines the occurrence of hypersaline calcium sodium chloride brines is well documented in the canadian shield bottomley et al 1994 frape et al 1984 mcnutt et al 1990 although brines are generally found at depths exceeding 1000 m they may migrate to shallower depths as the result of groundwater flow rouleau et al 2013 the low nitrate no3 and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations suggest that well waters were not affected by anthropogenic contamination from septic tanks this also suggests that individual homes are unlikely to be a significant source of ca na and cl to groundwater 4 2 stable isotopes of water the δ18o and δ2h values of well water samples ranged from 13 57 to 12 19 and 95 32 to 85 93 respectively table 1 and fig 4 the stable isotope values are distributed along the local meteoric water line lmwl as defined by rey et al 2017 indicating that recharge water was not significantly affected by evaporation the effect of topography on the isotopic composition of precipitation is considered to be negligible owing to the limited elevation range in the study area ca hco3 groundwaters had variable isotopic composition that reflects the seasonal variations with the predominance of groundwater recharged during the snowmelt period for heavy isotope depleted values and during warmer periods for enriched values ca na hco3 groundwater plots around 13 for δ18o and 92 for δ2h which corresponds to the weighted mean annual isotopic composition of precipitation in the region rey et al 2017 this suggests that the most chemically evolved groundwater results from the mixing of fracture waters with different isotopic signatures along the flow paths indeed the seasonal variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation is known to be damped by groundwater mixing in aquifers clark and fritz 1997 the reducing ca hco3 groundwater had δ18o and δ2h values close to the mean annual δ18o and δ2h of precipitation supporting that this groundwater is geochemically evolved and the low na ca ratio is probably related to the rock mineralogy as shown in fig 4 the isotopic values of ca na hco3 cl groundwater were enriched in heavy isotopes with respect to most ca hco3 groundwaters in comparison the calcium sodium chloride brines found in the archean superior province are generally enriched in 2h or depleted in 18o bottomley et al 1994 frape et al 1984 however the proportion of brines must be significant to cause a water sample to plot above the lmwl frape et al 1984 therefore if the salinity results from the mixing with brines the hydrochemical data suggest that the proportion of brines is limited and is unlikely to affect the isotopic signature of groundwater instead the relative heavy isotope enrichment in ca na hco3 cl groundwater likely resulted from the predominance of recently infiltrated water during the summer 4 3 dissolved metals and metalloids in groundwater 4 3 1 iron and manganese as shown in table 1 most bedrock wells contained high fe and mn concentrations dissolved fe concentrations ranged from 2 6 to 3486 7 µg l exceeding the canadian aesthetic objective of 0 3 mg l in 11out of 19wells dissolved mn concentrations ranged between 43 2 and 1694 6 µg l exceeding the canadian aesthetic objective of 0 05 mg l in 18wells the presence of dissolved fe and mn in groundwater is expected to be initially derived from the weathering of ferromagnesian minerals namely biotite and hornblende as well as oxide carbonate and sulfide minerals the metasedimentary rocks underlying the study area are known to contain high fe and mn contents as indicated by the rock chemistry data from the quebec ministry of energy and natural resources mern 2016 the hydrochemical data suggest that fe and mn concentrations are affected by the geochemical conditions in groundwater as illustrated in fig 5 a high dissolved fe concentrations were associated with low redox potentials elevated fe concentrations occurred under mildly reducing conditions at eh 270 mv the phreeqc calculations show that well waters were oversaturated with respect to fe oh 3 goethite feooh and hematite fe2o3 supporting that the precipitation of fe oxyhydroxides is a major process controlling fe concentrations in groundwater the calculation of saturation indices also indicated the precipitation of siderite in low eh waters suggesting that siderite precipitation could play a role in limiting fe concentrations under mildly reducing conditions the precipitation of insoluble iron sulfides is expected to occur only under strongly reducing conditions prevailing in deeper fracture systems elevated mn concentrations were also found to be associated with low eh values since dissolved mn exceeding 200 µg l occurred at eh 270 mv with the exception of one sample in contrast to fe geochemical calculations showed that well waters were undersaturated with respect to mn oxyhydroxides including pyrolusite mno2 birnessite mno2 bixbyite mn2o3 hausmannite mn3o4 and manganite mnooh indeed mn tends to remain dissolved under mildly oxidizing conditions when most fe precipitates as oxyhydroxides bhattacharya et al 2012 hem 1985 in fact it is possible that mn oxyhydroxides only precipitate under the most oxidizing conditions while black deposits attributed to the formation of mn oxyhydroxides have been observed on water treatment filters during the sampling campaign as pointed out by essington 2015 the distribution of mn between the solid and solution phase is difficult to predict because mn oxyhydroxides are generally impure poorly crystalline and contain mn in several oxidation states relative to the pure mineral phases employed in theoretical predictions moreover the relationship of mn with eh may also be explained by the affinity of mn2 for fe oxyhydroxides homoncik et al 2010 the precipitation of fe oxyhydroxides could be responsible for the removal of mn by sorption under oxidizing conditions and conversely the dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides under reducing conditions could lead to the release of mn to groundwater unlike fe mn concentrations also appear to be affected by the ph conditions dissolved mn concentrations were generally lower with increasing ph in particular above ph 7 4 fig 5 b this suggests that mn carbonate precipitation may exert an important control on dissolved mn in groundwater as mentioned in previous studies of alluvial aquifers von brömssen et al 2008 ying et al 2017 in particular the phreeqc calculations indicated the precipitation of rhodochrosite mnco3 in water samples containing high dissolved mn and mildly alkaline conditions the precipitation of mn carbonates could be an important control on dissolved mn in geochemically evolved groundwater while the high solubility of manganese sulfides make them unlikely to influence mn concentrations ying et al 2017 overall the poor linear relationship of dissolved mn with other geochemical parameters may suggest that the release from primary minerals significantly influence the distribution of mn in groundwater although not investigated in this study the rock chemistry and mineralogy can be highly heterogeneous in mineralized bedrock variations in mn rock contents may account for the spatial variability of mn concentrations in the aquifer moreover as recently showed by kiracofe et al 2017 there are multiple mineralogical sources of mn in bedrock aquifers in relation to their stability some minerals may be more likely to release mn such as mn carbonates and oxides in mineralized areas further investigations are required to characterize the mineralogical sources of mn in bedrock groundwater 4 3 2 arsenic the total dissolved as and dissolved as species in well water samples are presented in table 2 total dissolved as concentrations ranged from below 0 7 µg l quantification limit to 219 2 µg l exceeding the canadian guideline value of 10 µg l in 8 out of 19 wells tables 1 and 2 based on a previous study in the region bondu et al 2017a and the mineralogical data from the quebec ministry of energy and natural resources mern 2016 the occurrence of dissolved as in groundwater is thought to be initially derived from the natural weathering of as bearing sulfide minerals in the oxic suboxic zone of the aquifer in particular the initial source of as is suspected to be the oxidation of disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite present in the shear zones and the granada deformation zone the leachates from the mine tailings and waste rocks of the granada mine are not believed to significantly contribute to the groundwater contamination in the study area because groundwater flows northward from the abandoned mining site nevertheless further investigation would be useful to test this hypothesis and eventually distinguish between natural and mining induced as in groundwater which can be a challenging issue in mining areas speciation results show that inorganic as species were dominant over organic species arsenite as iii was the predominant as species in 10 out of 19 wells including 5 out of the 8 wells exceeding 10 μg l as the other 8 wells were dominated by arsenate as v or a mixing between as iii and as v table 2 as shown in fig 6 a the speciation of as was largely determined by the redox conditions as iii prevailed under mildly reducing conditions at eh 250 mv whereas as v prevailed under more oxidizing conditions methylated as species were present at low concentrations with mma v and dma v accounting for on average 3 4 and 6 8 of the speciated as respectively although the data interpretation is limited by the low concentrations of methylated species in several samples the results show that the concentration of methylated as species were strongly correlated to as iii concentrations in particular dma v fig 6 c according to a previous study in oregon maguffin et al 2015 this provides evidence of the microbial methylation of as in the bedrock aquifer on the other hand methylated as was not clearly associated with dissolved organic carbon doc fig 6 d suggesting that doc is not a limiting factor for the biomethylation of as although arsenic is believed to be initially released during the weathering of sulfide minerals the hydrochemical data strongly suggest that secondary sources play a key role in the mobilization of as the highest as concentrations were found under mildly reducing conditions at eh 150 mv fig 6 a although there is no linear correlation the wells with high dissolved as generally contained elevated fe and mn concentrations under these mildly reducing conditions the redox potential could be sufficiently high to oxidize sulfide minerals but too low to promote the formation of secondary fe and mn oxyhydroxides thus causing the release of as to groundwater ryan et al 2013 however the predominance of as iii and the characteristic smell of hydrogen sulfide h2s in several boreholes suggest the occurrence of strong reducing conditions in groundwater open boreholes are likely to intercept multiple water contributing fractures with different chemistry and redox status harte et al 2012 shapiro 2002 some fractures contributing to the well discharge may contain reducing groundwater with high dissolved as as as iii bondu et al 2017b in this sense the mildly reducing conditions measured in well waters could be the result of the mixing and dilution of reducing fracture water with more oxidizing fracture water in reducing fracture waters the elevated as concentrations would result from the dissolution of fe and mn oxyhydroxides which are considered as the main secondary as minerals in the bedrock aquifer and eventually of other common secondary as minerals such as scorodite jarosite and ca arsenates drahota and filippi 2009 foley and ayuso 2008 even though the phreeqc calculations indicate undersaturation with respect to common secondary as minerals in water samples geochemical conditions in fractures may be locally favorable for their precipitation in comparison alkaline desorption from mineral surfaces is probably a minor mobilization mechanism the reducing and alkaline characteristics of chemically evolved groundwater may explain the association between elevated as concentrations and high ph observed in fig 6 b the occurrence of high as concentrations in chemically evolved groundwaters is in agreement with previous studies of bedrock aquifers bondu et al 2017b lipfert et al 2006 ryan et al 2013 on the other hand the reductive dissolution of metal oxyhydroxides is not expected to control the release of as in less chemically evolved groundwater indeed the prevalence of oxidizing conditions and dissolved as as as v suggests that arsenic is directly derived from sulfide oxidation with as release rates from sulfide oxidation exceeding sequestration rates into secondary minerals 4 4 health and aesthetic issues associated with bedrock groundwater use as in many countries or states the quality of water from private wells is not regulated by public authorities in the province of quebec well owners are responsible for the safety of their own domestic water supply by testing water and taking protective actions if necessary in areas prone to groundwater contamination individual mitigation measures to reduce exposure to hazardous contaminants are critical regarding public health in the study area the occurrence of geogenic contaminants in well water may cause aesthetic concerns and potential health risks most aesthetic problems were related to high levels of hardness dissolved fe and mn and hydrogen sulfide high level of hardness is not considered a health risk but represents an aesthetic nuisance and an economic burden by giving a unpleasant taste to water causing scale formation in pipes and kitchen utensils and increasing soap consumption desimone et al 2009 who 2011b elevated fe and mn concentrations impart a metallic taste to water affect foods and beverages and stain laundry and plumbing fixtures desimone et al 2009 homoncik et al 2010 in the study area the information collected during the sampling campaign shows that more than half of the households use ion exchange water softeners point of entry to reduce the aesthetic effects of hardness and high fe and mn concentrations ion exchange water softening replaces divalent ions by monovalent ions principally sodium leading to the supply of sodium enriched and calcium and magnesium depleted water the consumption of softened water may pose health risks especially for people following sodium restricted diets for which drinking water accounts for a substantial proportion of sodium intake talukder et al 2017 yarows et al 1997 high sodium intake is well known to be associated with hypertension cardiovascular disease and stroke who 2012 furthermore there is some evidence that calcium deficiency in drinking water is associated with hypertension while magnesium deficiency increases the risk of cardiovascular disease monarca et al 2006 rubenowitz lundin and hiscock 2013 in particular the use of sodium exchange softeners may be of concern if applied to brackish well waters that already contain high levels of na moreover the occurrence of hydrogen sulfide gas may give a disagreeable taste and odor to water at concentrations present in groundwater health canada 1992 although not measured in this study the characteristic smell of h2s in some wells and the information provided by wells owners indicate that h2s is an aesthetic issue in the study area more concerning is the occurrence of geogenic contaminants at levels that may be harmful to human health there is now strong evidence that the consumption of high mn water is associated with adverse health effects including compulsive behaviors attention disorders and intellectual impairments in children parkinson like disorder manganism in adults and birth defects bouchard et al 2007 frisbie et al 2012 sanders et al 2014 wasserman et al 2006 in particular major studies have reported the neurotoxic effects of mn exposure through groundwater consumption from private bedrock wells in the province of quebec bouchard et al 2007 bouchard et al 2011 oulhote et al 2014 the recent discontinuation of the who guideline value of 0 4 mg l mn has raised legitimate interrogations in the scientific community this value was already considered to be too high to adequately protect public health frisbie et al 2012 ljung and vahter 2007 in relation to this it is likely that a new guideline value for mn in drinking water will be set in the next few years affecting a large number of people that rely on private bedrock wells for their drinking water in the study area the homeowners were not aware of the health risk associated with mn exposure and only considered mn as an aesthetic and economic problem mn concentration in drinking water is limited in households equipped with water softeners and activated carbon filters barbeau et al 2011 but a health risk exists for households without water treatment systems the exposure to arsenic is probably the most serious health risk associated with bedrock groundwater consumption long term exposure to as through drinking water is known to cause numerous adverse health effects including lung skin bladder and kidney cancers respiratory illnesses diabetes cardiovascular diseases and neurological effects kapaj et al 2006 ravenscroft et al 2009 who 2011a in the abitibi temiscamingue region the high concentrations of as in well water have been reported to be associated with diabetes personal history of diabetes and use of oral hypoglycemic agents lampron goulet 2012 a recent study in maine also suggested that the ingestion of as from bedrock wells is responsible for intellectual impairments in children wasserman et al 2014 moreover the joint effects of as and mn exposure are suspected to be harmful to human health particularly for children sanders et al 2014 the results of arsenic speciation show that as iii is the dominant species in particular in the most contaminated wells this has negative implications for human health since as iii is the most toxic species in groundwater the information collected in this study revealed that 5 out of 8 owners of wells exceeding 10 μg l as take protective measures to reduce their exposure the remaining owners were not aware of the contamination arsenic mitigation measures include point of use treatment systems reverse osmosis and distillation or drinking bottled water it is important to note that the efficiency of mitigation measures were not evaluated protection may be incomplete owing to the consumption of water from untreated taps treatment system failure or breakthrough smith et al 2016 spayd et al 2015 5 conclusion groundwater sampling and analysis were conducted in nineteen private wells completed in a fractured metasedimentary aquifer in the canadian shield the results indicate that all the wells contained high levels of hardness th 180 mg lcaco3 two wells contained brackish groundwater tds 1000 mg l eleven wells exceeded the canadian aesthetic objective for fe fe 0 3 mg l eighteen wells exceeded the canadian aesthetic objective for mn mn 0 05 mg l and eight wells exceeded the canadian guideline value for as as 10 µg l the presence of multiple contaminants is believed to be mainly of natural origin both related to the bedrock mineralogy and geochemical conditions in bedrock groundwater the brackish groundwaters are suspected to originate from the mixing of fresh groundwater with deep brines of the canadian shield although a contamination from deicing salts cannot be ruled out the occurrence of dissolved metals appears to be largely controlled by the redox conditions in groundwater high fe concentrations were found under mildly reducing conditions most likely controlled by the precipitation dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides elevated mn concentrations were also measured under mildly reducing conditions and at ph 7 5 probably related to the precipitation dissolution of mn oxyhydroxides and carbonates arsenic generally occurred under mildly reducing conditions in the toxic reduced form of as iii the reductive dissolution of secondary fe and mn oxyhydroxides is expected to be the main mechanism responsible for the mobilization of as in groundwater in order to limit the aesthetic nuisances associated with high levels of hardness and dissolved metals fe and mn most households treat their water using ion exchange water softeners water treatment systems are generally used to reduce as exposure when homeowners are aware of the contamination the results of this study highlight the need for appropriate mitigation measures to protect public health from groundwater contamination in rural areas this research contributes to increase knowledge on the groundwater quality problems commonly associated with fractured bedrock aquifers in particular this study is one of the first to address the mobilization of manganese in bedrock groundwater information on the manganese geochemistry is required because mn is now recognized as a serious neurotoxic and is known to be involved in the fate and transport of multiple contaminants in groundwater including arsenic this work also provides new information on the mobilization and speciation of arsenic in bedrock groundwater the results highlight the importance of considering the speciation of arsenic in exposure assessment and provide data on the organic as species which are still poorly documented in groundwater the results also confirm that the reductive dissolution of metals oxyhydroxides is an important mechanism of as release to groundwater in bedrock aquifers in the study area the primary mineral sources need to be further investigated along with the potential input from the abandoned mining site a project to reopen the granada mine is currently underway and the monitoring of well water quality could be valuable in order to assess the potential impact of mining activities on groundwater the impact of abandoned mining sites on groundwater quality is often challenging in fractured bedrock aquifers moreover the origin of brackish groundwater and the potential contribution of brines to relatively shallow bedrock groundwater used as source of drinking water also deserve further consideration for this purpose isotopic tracers could be particularly useful in particular strontium chlorine and bromine isotopes mcnutt et al 1990 stotler et al 2010 a better understanding of the factors controlling bedrock groundwater quality is of paramount importance to protect public health in rural areas the health risks primarily depend on the distribution and toxicity of contaminants in groundwater as well as the protective behaviors of well users therefore information on the protective behavior of well owners is essential to implement public awareness campaigns which are currently the best way to prevent health hazards associated with groundwater consumption acknowledgments this

7408,nineteen private wells were investigated in order to evaluate the groundwater quality and the issues associated with well water use in a fractured metasedimentary aquifer of the canadian shield in western quebec canada groundwater sampling and analysis reveal that the quality of well water is both a potential aesthetic and health concern for the residents aesthetic problems are mainly related to the high levels of hardness and dissolved iron and manganese potential health risks are associated with the occurrence of brackish groundwater high manganese concentrations and arsenic concentrations exceeding the canadian guideline value of 10 µg l brackish groundwater is suspected to be derived from the mixing of fresh groundwaters with deep calcium sodium chloride brines of the canadian shield the occurrences of iron manganese and arsenic primarily derived from the natural weathering of bedrock are highly dependent on the geochemical conditions in groundwater particularly the redox potential arsenic occurs mainly as arsenite as iii and is thought to be released by the dissolution of iron and manganese oxyhydroxides under reducing conditions information obtained from well owners indicates that most households use ion exchange water softeners to minimize aesthetic problems of excessive hardness and dissolved iron and manganese concentrations homeowners generally take protective measures to reduce their exposure to arsenic when they are aware of the contamination the exposure to arsenic and manganese may pose health risks for residents that do not take protective measures the quality of well water is of paramount importance for human health in rural areas information on the contaminant sources and individual mitigation measures is essential to assess the health risks associated with groundwater consumption and to ensure the protection of public health keywords arsenic manganese bedrock aquifers private wells public health abitibi temiscamingue 1 introduction groundwater is an important water resource that is estimated to be the source of one third of freshwater withdrawals and about 50 of current drinking water supplies in the world world water assessment programme 2009 most of the groundwater is abstracted from unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers owing to their wide distribution accessibility and significant groundwater resources margat and van der gun 2013 the crystalline bedrock aquifers consisting of igneous and metamorphic rocks are comparatively less important as sources of groundwater nevertheless domestic wells completed in bedrock aquifers may represent a vital source of water for people living in rural areas such as in sub saharan africa macdonald et al 2008 india perrin et al 2011 northern europe banks and robins 2002 and north america desimone et al 2009 the wells drilled in crystalline rocks generally provide modest yields but supply sufficient water for household use banks and robins 2002 perrin et al 2011 on the other hand the groundwater quality may be adversely affected by the presence of naturally occurring contaminants including dissolved metals and metalloids such as iron fe manganese mn and arsenic as fluoride f and radionuclides in particular radon rn radium ra and uranium u e g ahn 2012 ayotte et al 2003 vinson et al 2009 the occurrence of geogenic arsenic in private bedrock wells is a major public health concern in many parts of the world exposure to as from drinking water has been reported to be associated with serious adverse effects on human health kapaj et al 2006 ravenscroft et al 2009 the presence of as in bedrock groundwater is generally considered to be derived from the weathering of as bearing sulfide minerals often associated with hydrothermally altered zones and metasedimentary rocks bondu et al 2017a ravenscroft et al 2009 ryan et al 2015 however the mobilization of as in groundwater is known to be largely influenced by secondary minerals under oxidizing and near neutral ph conditions dissolved as sorbs strongly onto mineral surfaces especially fe mn oxyhydroxides and clay minerals conversely the dissolution of metal oxyhydroxides under reducing conditions may release as to bedrock groundwater lipfert et al 2006 yang et al 2015 the alkaline conditions have also been suspected to enhance the release of as by promoting the desorption from mineral surfaces ayotte et al 2003 the studies focusing on the arsenic contamination of bedrock groundwater have increased substantially in the last few years and new discoveries are regularly reported bondu et al 2016 in spite of this the factors controlling the mobilization and distribution of as in bedrock groundwater remains challenging in particular owing to the heterogeneity of mineral sources and geochemical conditions in the fractured bedrock o shea et al 2015 yang et al 2015 in addition the speciation of as is still poorly documented even though it has been demonstrated to affect its mobility and toxicity sorg et al 2014 the occurrence of dissolved iron and manganese is also a concern in private wells completed in metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks bhattacharya et al 2012 flanagan et al 2014 gillispie et al 2016 high fe and mn concentrations may cause aesthetic problems and there is now evidence that the exposure to mn in drinking water can cause neurotoxic effects in humans bouchard et al 2011 frisbie et al 2012 the concentrations of fe and mn in groundwater are known to be greatly influenced by the redox and ph conditions hem 1985 however knowledge about manganese contamination of groundwater is still very limited probably because manganese has until recently been regarded only as an aesthetic problem the groundwater quality in rural areas may also be degraded by anthropogenic contaminants including microbes and pharmaceutical compounds from sceptic tanks agricultural chemicals and deicing road salt banks and robins 2002 kozuskanich et al 2014 saby et al 2017 in mineralized areas abandoned and active mining sites may be significant sources of dissolved metals and metalloids through contaminated mine drainage lottermoser 2010 although many studies have focused either on the geochemistry or health effects of specific contaminants few have considered the overall quality of private groundwater supplies and the associated health risks moreover knowledge on the contaminant sources and individual mitigation strategies are often lacking to adequately assess health risks and protect public health in the province of quebec canada groundwater is the major source of domestic water on 90 of the territory and for 2million people mddelcc 2016 the province is mostly covered by the precambrian crystalline

the province the abitibi temiscamingue region is an important mining area for gold and base metals located in the superior province of the canadian shield in this region the vast majority of wells in rural areas produce from the bedrock aquifer private bedrock wells have been reported to contain inorganic contaminants including fe mn and as in particular those completed in metasedimentary rocks bondu et al 2017b cloutier et al 2015 poissant 1997 in this context the objectives of this paper are to evaluate 1 the occurrence and sources of inorganic contaminants in well water and 2 the potential health risks associated with the use of groundwater from a metasedimentary rock aquifer for this purpose groundwater samples were collected from private bedrock wells and analyzed for stable water isotopes dissolved organic carbon major minor trace elements and arsenic speciation in addition information related to well water use and treatment was obtained from well owners the large variability in well water quality provides an overview of the problems commonly associated with bedrock groundwater 2 study area the study area is located 5 km south of the city of rouyn noranda province of quebec canada fig 1 most of the area is covered by boreal forest with some wetlands in topographic hollows and some pasture lands the topography is gently rolling with elevations ranging from 285 to 320 m above the sea level geologically the study area is underlain by the archean metasedimentary rocks of the pontiac subprovince within the superior province of the canadian shield fig 1 b the archean rocks are composed of polymictic conglomerate of the timiskaming group to the north of the area and greywacke of the pontiac group to the south diop 2011 mern 2016 the contact between the pontiac and timiskaming groups consists of a 200 300 m deformation zone moderately dipping to the north 45 and extending over several kilometers known as the granada deformation zone bedeaux et al 2016 diop 2011 fig 1 b the rocks of the timiscaming group are metamorphosed to the greenschist facies whereas those of the pontiac group are upper greenschist facies with the presence of biotite hornblende and garnet diop 2011 in the study area the metasedimentary rocks present a penetrative schistosity that is parallel to the granada deformation zone bedeaux et al 2016 diop 2011 the major east west trending cadillac larder lake fault zone separating the abitibi subprovince and the pontiac subprovince is located just north of the study area fig 1 b this is one of the most prolific structures for gold and base metals production in eastern canada bedeaux et al 2016 hocq and verpaelst 1994 between the cadillac larder lake fault zone and the granada deformation zone the metasedimentary rocks are affected by a series of shear zones and northeasterly trending sigmoidal faults related to late shearing the shear zones are characterized by sericite and carbonate alteration associated with gold bearing quartz veins and disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite legault and lalonde 2009 the abandoned granada gold mine operated about 180000 tonnes of ores between 1930 and 1935 leaving tailings and waste material mern 2016 fig 1 c the bedrock is generally exposed at the surface in the higher areas and is covered by quaternary sediments in the lower areas fig 1 c the quaternary sediments consist of glacial till overlain by glaciolacustrine clay and silt deposits and varies in thickness from 2 to 12 m mern 2016 private wells completed in the bedrock aquifer are the major source of domestic water for the residents in the study area private bedrock wells generally consist of unscreened boreholes steel cased through the quaternary sediments and open to the bedrock aquifer below the bottom of the casing in the region very few private wells produce from the quaternary clay rich sediments which act as a regional aquitard in the bedrock aquifer the majority of groundwater flow takes place through the fracture network resulting from the rock fracturing during tectonic movements and glacial interglacial cycles rouleau et al 2013 the archean bedrock has a low primary porosity and a variable hydraulic conductivity mostly controlled by the presence and characteristics of fractures cloutier et al 2007 the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock typically ranges from 4 10 9 to 1 10 4 m s in the region cloutier et al 2015 most groundwater flow occurs in the upper part of the bedrock up to 100 m where conductive fractures are abundant in particular subhorizontal fractures rouleau et al 2013 by contrast the archean shear zones are thought to be sealed structures that are poorly permeable the bedrock aquifer is recharged through unconfined bedrock areas the areas confined by glaciolacustrine clays and silts are located further along the flow paths 3 material and method 3 1 groundwater sampling and field measurements groundwater samples were collected from 19 private bedrock wells in august 2014 fig 1 c all available information on well characteristics well water use and treatment was obtained from homeowners during the sampling campaign the sampled wells ranged in depth from 44 to 137 m most wells were 15 2 cm diameter boreholes equipped with submersible pumps some old wells drilled before 1970s were 5 1 cm diameter boreholes equipped with surface pumps groundwater sampling was performed using the production pumps bypassing water treatment systems if present temperature t specific conductance sc ph oxidation reduction potential orp and dissolved oxygen do were measured in the field using a multi parameter probe ysi 556 eh values were obtained from field orp measurements by adding the difference between the measured orp of zobells s solution and the theoretical eh of zobells s solution at the sample temperature prior to sampling bedrock wells were purged approximately 15 20 min until field parameters stabilized in order to ensure that sampled water was taken directly from the aquifer water samples were collected in pre cleaned hdpe bottles and included 1 one unfiltered and unacidified aliquot for alkalinity determination 2 one filtered and unacidified aliquot for anions and stable isotopes δ2h δ18o analyses 3 one filtered and acidified aliquot for cations and trace elements analyses and 4 one filtered

environmental grade anachemia the sample bottles were placed on ice in coolers for transport to the laboratory on the same day and stored at 4 c until analysis 3 2 analytical methods the chemical analyses of major minor and trace elements were performed at the laboratory of the research institute of mining and the environment of the university of quebec in abitibi temiscamingue uqat alkalinity as caco3 was measured by titration with sulfuric acid using an automatic titrator metrohmtitrinoplus 870 kf major anions so4 2 cl no3 f and br were determined by ion chromatography metrohm 881 compact

quebec s ministry of the environment ceaeq 2014 the speciation of arsenic was determined using solid phase extraction spe cartridges according to the method developed by watts et al 2010 following the procedure described in bondu et al 2017b the spe method based on the separation of as species in the field recovery by elution in the laboratory and analysis by icp ms for total as allows the determination of four major dissolved as species inorganic arsenite as iii inorganic arsenate as v monomethylarsonic acid mma v and dimethylarsinic acid dma v calibration standard solutions were prepared from a certified stock standard solution of 10000 mg las scp science the detection limits were below 1 5 µg l for fe 0 4 µg l for mn 0 2 µg l for total as and as iii and 0 03 µg l for as v ma v and dma v quality control procedures included the analysis of a ceaeq standard reference sample blanks and duplicate samples as well as calculation of charge balances within 5 duplicate concentrations for major minor and trace elements were generally within 10 relative standard deviation rsd the precision of the speciation method was better than 2 rsd for each as species as reported in bondu et al 2017b stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were analyzed using a dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer micromass isoprime at the geotop laboratory of the university of quebec in montreal measurement precision 1σ was within 1 for δ2h and 0 05 for δ18o oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios are expressed as per mil deviations from the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the saturation indices si were calculated using the wateq4f thermodynamic database of the phreeqc program parkhurst and appelo 1999 thermodynamic data for secondary as phases were taken from the minteqa2 database allison et al 1991 and drahota and filippi 2009 4 results and discussion 4 1 physico chemical parameters and major ions chemistry a statistical summary of field parameters major ions selected minor and trace element concentrations and stable isotopes from sampled wells is given in table 1 groundwater ph was near neutral with ph values ranging from 6 85 to 7 65 mean 7 22 0 25 field eh measurements indicated mildly reducing conditions to oxidizing conditions range 86 428 mv the total hardness th ranged from 194 to 899 mg l caco3 meaning that all the well waters can be classified as very hard th 180 mg l caco3 according to the world health organization classification who 2011b the high values of hardness were mainly related to the amounts of calcium ca and magnesium mg and to a lesser degree iron fe manganese mn and strontium sr as shown in the piper diagram fig 2 well water was predominantly a calcium bicarbonate type except in two wells which had a calcium sodium bicarbonate chloride composition calcium bicarbonate groundwater characterized by low total dissolved solids tds 380 mg l high eh eh 400 mv and low na ca ratios na ca 0 15 occurred in wells completed in the unconfined bedrock aquifer this type of water likely contains a large proportion of recharge water and thus represents the less chemically evolved groundwater fig 3 by contrast calcium bicarbonate groundwaters characterized by higher tds tds 380 mg l lower eh eh 250 mv and higher na ca ratios are expected to be more chemically evolved waters reflecting the extended interaction with bedrock minerals along the flow paths fig 3 more chemically evolved groundwater occurred in wells completed in the confined bedrock aquifer i e further along the flow paths in particular the ca na hco3 subtype with na ca 0 3 eh 180 mv ph 7 45 and so4 10 mg l is thought to be the most chemically evolved water sampled in wells fig 3 during the chemical evolution of groundwater the redox potential tends to decrease in relation to the oxidation of dissolved organic matter and reduced minerals such as sulfides while the ph tends to increase owing to silicate hydrolysis reactions gascoyne 2004 ryan et al 2013 the increased na concentration is thought to be the result of the slow weathering of na feldspars and ion exchange on clay minerals gascoyne and kamineni 1994 on the other hand ca concentrations may decrease as the result of ion exchange and carbonate precipitation gascoyne 2004 moreover the precipitation of carbonate minerals may explain the decreased tds for the most chemically evolved groundwaters dark blue points in fig 3 the low so4 concentrations were probably related to the reduction of sulfate as evidenced by the strong smell of h2s in some wells the low na ca ratios occurring in two wells with a low eh and a medium tds could be related to the local depletion of the rock matrix in na fig 3 moreover calcium sodium bicarbonate chloride groundwater was characterized by elevated tds tds 1000 mg l mainly resulting from high ca and cl concentrations low eh eh 200 mv and near neutral ph the occurrence of ca na hco3 cl groundwater may result from the use of road deicing salts in particular of sodium and calcium chloride composition but also from the mixing of fresh groundwaters with deep brines the occurrence of hypersaline calcium sodium chloride brines is well documented in the canadian shield bottomley et al 1994 frape et al 1984 mcnutt et al 1990 although brines are generally found at depths exceeding 1000 m they may migrate to shallower depths as the result of groundwater flow rouleau et al 2013 the low nitrate no3 and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations suggest that well waters were not affected by anthropogenic contamination from septic tanks this also suggests that individual homes are unlikely to be a significant source of ca na and cl to groundwater 4 2 stable isotopes of water the δ18o and δ2h values of well water samples ranged from 13 57 to 12 19 and 95 32 to 85 93 respectively table 1 and fig 4 the stable isotope values are distributed along the local meteoric water line lmwl as defined by rey et al 2017 indicating that recharge water was not significantly affected by evaporation the effect of topography on the isotopic composition of precipitation is considered to be negligible owing to the limited elevation range in the study area ca hco3 groundwaters had variable isotopic composition that reflects the seasonal variations with the predominance of groundwater recharged during the snowmelt period for heavy isotope depleted values and during warmer periods for enriched values ca na hco3 groundwater plots around 13 for δ18o and 92 for δ2h which corresponds to the weighted mean annual isotopic composition of precipitation in the region rey et al 2017 this suggests that the most chemically evolved groundwater results from the mixing of fracture waters with different isotopic signatures along the flow paths indeed the seasonal variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation is known to be damped by groundwater mixing in aquifers clark and fritz 1997 the reducing ca hco3 groundwater had δ18o and δ2h values close to the mean annual δ18o and δ2h of precipitation supporting that this groundwater is geochemically evolved and the low na ca ratio is probably related to the rock mineralogy as shown in fig 4 the isotopic values of ca na hco3 cl groundwater were enriched in heavy isotopes with respect to most ca hco3 groundwaters in comparison the calcium sodium chloride brines found in the archean superior province are generally enriched in 2h or depleted in 18o bottomley et al 1994 frape et al 1984 however the proportion of brines must be significant to cause a water sample to plot above the lmwl frape et al 1984 therefore if the salinity results from the mixing with brines the hydrochemical data suggest that the proportion of brines is limited and is unlikely to affect the isotopic signature of groundwater instead the relative heavy isotope enrichment in ca na hco3 cl groundwater likely resulted from the predominance of recently infiltrated water during the summer 4 3 dissolved metals and metalloids in groundwater 4 3 1 iron and manganese as shown in table 1 most bedrock wells contained high fe and mn concentrations dissolved fe concentrations ranged from 2 6 to 3486 7 µg l exceeding the canadian aesthetic objective of 0 3 mg l in 11out of 19wells dissolved mn concentrations ranged between 43 2 and 1694 6 µg l exceeding the canadian aesthetic objective of 0 05 mg l in 18wells the presence of dissolved fe and mn in groundwater is expected to be initially derived from the weathering of ferromagnesian minerals namely biotite and hornblende as well as oxide carbonate and sulfide minerals the metasedimentary rocks underlying the study area are known to contain high fe and mn contents as indicated by the rock chemistry data from the quebec ministry of energy and natural resources mern 2016 the hydrochemical data suggest that fe and mn concentrations are affected by the geochemical conditions in groundwater as illustrated in fig 5 a high dissolved fe concentrations were associated with low redox potentials elevated fe concentrations occurred under mildly reducing conditions at eh 270 mv the phreeqc calculations show that well waters were oversaturated with respect to fe oh 3 goethite feooh and hematite fe2o3 supporting that the precipitation of fe oxyhydroxides is a major process controlling fe concentrations in groundwater the calculation of saturation indices also indicated the precipitation of siderite in low eh waters suggesting that siderite precipitation could play a role in limiting fe concentrations under mildly reducing conditions the precipitation of insoluble iron sulfides is expected to occur only under strongly reducing conditions prevailing in deeper fracture systems elevated mn concentrations were also found to be associated with low eh values since dissolved mn exceeding 200 µg l occurred at eh 270 mv with the exception of one sample in contrast to fe geochemical calculations showed that well waters were undersaturated with respect to mn oxyhydroxides including pyrolusite mno2 birnessite mno2 bixbyite mn2o3 hausmannite mn3o4 and manganite mnooh indeed mn tends to remain dissolved under mildly oxidizing conditions when most fe precipitates as oxyhydroxides bhattacharya et al 2012 hem 1985 in fact it is possible that mn oxyhydroxides only precipitate under the most oxidizing conditions while black deposits attributed to the formation of mn oxyhydroxides have been observed on water treatment filters during the sampling campaign as pointed out by essington 2015 the distribution of mn between the solid and solution phase is difficult to predict because mn oxyhydroxides are generally impure poorly crystalline and contain mn in several oxidation states relative to the pure mineral phases employed in theoretical predictions moreover the relationship of mn with eh may also be explained by the affinity of mn2 for fe oxyhydroxides homoncik et al 2010 the precipitation of fe oxyhydroxides could be responsible for the removal of mn by sorption under oxidizing conditions and conversely the dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides under reducing conditions could lead to the release of mn to groundwater unlike fe mn concentrations also appear to be affected by the ph conditions dissolved mn concentrations were generally lower with increasing ph in particular above ph 7 4 fig 5 b this suggests that mn carbonate precipitation may exert an important control on dissolved mn in groundwater as mentioned in previous studies of alluvial aquifers von brömssen et al 2008 ying et al 2017 in particular the phreeqc calculations indicated the precipitation of rhodochrosite mnco3 in water samples containing high dissolved mn and mildly alkaline conditions the precipitation of mn carbonates could be an important control on dissolved mn in geochemically evolved groundwater while the high solubility of manganese sulfides make them unlikely to influence mn concentrations ying et al 2017 overall the poor linear relationship of dissolved mn with other geochemical parameters may suggest that the release from primary minerals significantly influence the distribution of mn in groundwater although not investigated in this study the rock chemistry and mineralogy can be highly heterogeneous in mineralized bedrock variations in mn rock contents may account for the spatial variability of mn concentrations in the aquifer moreover as recently showed by kiracofe et al 2017 there are multiple mineralogical sources of mn in bedrock aquifers in relation to their stability some minerals may be more likely to release mn such as mn carbonates and oxides in mineralized areas further investigations are required to characterize the mineralogical sources of mn in bedrock groundwater 4 3 2 arsenic the total dissolved as and dissolved as species in well water samples are presented in table 2 total dissolved as concentrations ranged from below 0 7 µg l quantification limit to 219 2 µg l exceeding the canadian guideline value of 10 µg l in 8 out of 19 wells tables 1 and 2 based on a previous study in the region bondu et al 2017a and the mineralogical data from the quebec ministry of energy and natural resources mern 2016 the occurrence of dissolved as in groundwater is thought to be initially derived from the natural weathering of as bearing sulfide minerals in the oxic suboxic zone of the aquifer in particular the initial source of as is suspected to be the oxidation of disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite present in the shear zones and the granada deformation zone the leachates from the mine tailings and waste rocks of the granada mine are not believed to significantly contribute to the groundwater contamination in the study area because groundwater flows northward from the abandoned mining site nevertheless further investigation would be useful to test this hypothesis and eventually distinguish between natural and mining induced as in groundwater which can be a challenging issue in mining areas speciation results show that inorganic as species were dominant over organic species arsenite as iii was the predominant as species in 10 out of 19 wells including 5 out of the 8 wells exceeding 10 μg l as the other 8 wells were dominated by arsenate as v or a mixing between as iii and as v table 2 as shown in fig 6 a the speciation of as was largely determined by the redox conditions as iii prevailed under mildly reducing conditions at eh 250 mv whereas as v prevailed under more oxidizing conditions methylated as species were present at low concentrations with mma v and dma v accounting for on average 3 4 and 6 8 of the speciated as respectively although the data interpretation is limited by the low concentrations of methylated species in several samples the results show that the concentration of methylated as species were strongly correlated to as iii concentrations in particular dma v fig 6 c according to a previous study in oregon maguffin et al 2015 this provides evidence of the microbial methylation of as in the bedrock aquifer on the other hand methylated as was not clearly associated with dissolved organic carbon doc fig 6 d suggesting that doc is not a limiting factor for the biomethylation of as although arsenic is believed to be initially released during the weathering of sulfide minerals the hydrochemical data strongly suggest that secondary sources play a key role in the mobilization of as the highest as concentrations were found under mildly reducing conditions at eh 150 mv fig 6 a although there is no linear correlation the wells with high dissolved as generally contained elevated fe and mn concentrations under these mildly reducing conditions the redox potential could be sufficiently high to oxidize sulfide minerals but too low to promote the formation of secondary fe and mn oxyhydroxides thus causing the release of as to groundwater ryan et al 2013 however the predominance of as iii and the characteristic smell of hydrogen sulfide h2s in several boreholes suggest the occurrence of strong reducing conditions in groundwater open boreholes are likely to intercept multiple water contributing fractures with different chemistry and redox status harte et al 2012 shapiro 2002 some fractures contributing to the well discharge may contain reducing groundwater with high dissolved as as as iii bondu et al 2017b in this sense the mildly reducing conditions measured in well waters could be the result of the mixing and dilution of reducing fracture water with more oxidizing fracture water in reducing fracture waters the elevated as concentrations would result from the dissolution of fe and mn oxyhydroxides which are considered as the main secondary as minerals in the bedrock aquifer and eventually of other common secondary as minerals such as scorodite jarosite and ca arsenates drahota and filippi 2009 foley and ayuso 2008 even though the phreeqc calculations indicate undersaturation with respect to common secondary as minerals in water samples geochemical conditions in fractures may be locally favorable for their precipitation in comparison alkaline desorption from mineral surfaces is probably a minor mobilization mechanism the reducing and alkaline characteristics of chemically evolved groundwater may explain the association between elevated as concentrations and high ph observed in fig 6 b the occurrence of high as concentrations in chemically evolved groundwaters is in agreement with previous studies of bedrock aquifers bondu et al 2017b lipfert et al 2006 ryan et al 2013 on the other hand the reductive dissolution of metal oxyhydroxides is not expected to control the release of as in less chemically evolved groundwater indeed the prevalence of oxidizing conditions and dissolved as as as v suggests that arsenic is directly derived from sulfide oxidation with as release rates from sulfide oxidation exceeding sequestration rates into secondary minerals 4 4 health and aesthetic issues associated with bedrock groundwater use as in many countries or states the quality of water from private wells is not regulated by public authorities in the province of quebec well owners are responsible for the safety of their own domestic water supply by testing water and taking protective actions if necessary in areas prone to groundwater contamination individual mitigation measures to reduce exposure to hazardous contaminants are critical regarding public health in the study area the occurrence of geogenic contaminants in well water may cause aesthetic concerns and potential health risks most aesthetic problems were related to high levels of hardness dissolved fe and mn and hydrogen sulfide high level of hardness is not considered a health risk but represents an aesthetic nuisance and an economic burden by giving a unpleasant taste to water causing scale formation in pipes and kitchen utensils and increasing soap consumption desimone et al 2009 who 2011b elevated fe and mn concentrations impart a metallic taste to water affect foods and beverages and stain laundry and plumbing fixtures desimone et al 2009 homoncik et al 2010 in the study area the information collected during the sampling campaign shows that more than half of the households use ion exchange water softeners point of entry to reduce the aesthetic effects of hardness and high fe and mn concentrations ion exchange water softening replaces divalent ions by monovalent ions principally sodium leading to the supply of sodium enriched and calcium and magnesium depleted water the consumption of softened water may pose health risks especially for people following sodium restricted diets for which drinking water accounts for a substantial proportion of sodium intake talukder et al 2017 yarows et al 1997 high sodium intake is well known to be associated with hypertension cardiovascular disease and stroke who 2012 furthermore there is some evidence that calcium deficiency in drinking water is associated with hypertension while magnesium deficiency increases the risk of cardiovascular disease monarca et al 2006 rubenowitz lundin and hiscock 2013 in particular the use of sodium exchange softeners may be of concern if applied to brackish well waters that already contain high levels of na moreover the occurrence of hydrogen sulfide gas may give a disagreeable taste and odor to water at concentrations present in groundwater health canada 1992 although not measured in this study the characteristic smell of h2s in some wells and the information provided by wells owners indicate that h2s is an aesthetic issue in the study area more concerning is the occurrence of geogenic contaminants at levels that may be harmful to human health there is now strong evidence that the consumption of high mn water is associated with adverse health effects including compulsive behaviors attention disorders and intellectual impairments in children parkinson like disorder manganism in adults and birth defects bouchard et al 2007 frisbie et al 2012 sanders et al 2014 wasserman et al 2006 in particular major studies have reported the neurotoxic effects of mn exposure through groundwater consumption from private bedrock wells in the province of quebec bouchard et al 2007 bouchard et al 2011 oulhote et al 2014 the recent discontinuation of the who guideline value of 0 4 mg l mn has raised legitimate interrogations in the scientific community this value was already considered to be too high to adequately protect public health frisbie et al 2012 ljung and vahter 2007 in relation to this it is likely that a new guideline value for mn in drinking water will be set in the next few years affecting a large number of people that rely on private bedrock wells for their drinking water in the study area the homeowners were not aware of the health risk associated with mn exposure and only considered mn as an aesthetic and economic problem mn concentration in drinking water is limited in households equipped with water softeners and activated carbon filters barbeau et al 2011 but a health risk exists for households without water treatment systems the exposure to arsenic is probably the most serious health risk associated with bedrock groundwater consumption long term exposure to as through drinking water is known to cause numerous adverse health effects including lung skin bladder and kidney cancers respiratory illnesses diabetes cardiovascular diseases and neurological effects kapaj et al 2006 ravenscroft et al 2009 who 2011a in the abitibi temiscamingue region the high concentrations of as in well water have been reported to be associated with diabetes personal history of diabetes and use of oral hypoglycemic agents lampron goulet 2012 a recent study in maine also suggested that the ingestion of as from bedrock wells is responsible for intellectual impairments in children wasserman et al 2014 moreover the joint effects of as and mn exposure are suspected to be harmful to human health particularly for children sanders et al 2014 the results of arsenic speciation show that as iii is the dominant species in particular in the most contaminated wells this has negative implications for human health since as iii is the most toxic species in groundwater the information collected in this study revealed that 5 out of 8 owners of wells exceeding 10 μg l as take protective measures to reduce their exposure the remaining owners were not aware of the contamination arsenic mitigation measures include point of use treatment systems reverse osmosis and distillation or drinking bottled water it is important to note that the efficiency of mitigation measures were not evaluated protection may be incomplete owing to the consumption of water from untreated taps treatment system failure or breakthrough smith et al 2016 spayd et al 2015 5 conclusion groundwater sampling and analysis were conducted in nineteen private wells completed in a fractured metasedimentary aquifer in the canadian shield the results indicate that all the wells contained high levels of hardness th 180 mg lcaco3 two wells contained brackish groundwater tds 1000 mg l eleven wells exceeded the canadian aesthetic objective for fe fe 0 3 mg l eighteen wells exceeded the canadian aesthetic objective for mn mn 0 05 mg l and eight wells exceeded the canadian guideline value for as as 10 µg l the presence of multiple contaminants is believed to be mainly of natural origin both related to the bedrock mineralogy and geochemical conditions in bedrock groundwater the brackish groundwaters are suspected to originate from the mixing of fresh groundwater with deep brines of the canadian shield although a contamination from deicing salts cannot be ruled out the occurrence of dissolved metals appears to be largely controlled by the redox conditions in groundwater high fe concentrations were found under mildly reducing conditions most likely controlled by the precipitation dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides elevated mn concentrations were also measured under mildly reducing conditions and at ph 7 5 probably related to the precipitation dissolution of mn oxyhydroxides and carbonates arsenic generally occurred under mildly reducing conditions in the toxic reduced form of as iii the reductive dissolution of secondary fe and mn oxyhydroxides is expected to be the main mechanism responsible for the mobilization of as in groundwater in order to limit the aesthetic nuisances associated with high levels of hardness and dissolved metals fe and mn most households treat their water using ion exchange water softeners water treatment systems are generally used to reduce as exposure when homeowners are aware of the contamination the results of this study highlight the need for appropriate mitigation measures to protect public health from groundwater contamination in rural areas this research contributes to increase knowledge on the groundwater quality problems commonly associated with fractured bedrock aquifers in particular this study is one of the first to address the mobilization of manganese in bedrock groundwater information on the manganese geochemistry is required because mn is now recognized as a serious neurotoxic and is known to be involved in the fate and transport of multiple contaminants in groundwater including arsenic this work also provides new information on the mobilization and speciation of arsenic in bedrock groundwater the results highlight the importance of considering the speciation of arsenic in exposure assessment and provide data on the organic as species which are still poorly documented in groundwater the results also confirm that the reductive dissolution of metals oxyhydroxides is an important mechanism of as release to groundwater in bedrock aquifers in the study area the primary mineral sources need to be further investigated along with the potential input from the abandoned mining site a project to reopen the granada mine is currently underway and the monitoring of well water quality could be valuable in order to assess the potential impact of mining activities on groundwater the impact of abandoned mining sites on groundwater quality is often challenging in fractured bedrock aquifers moreover the origin of brackish groundwater and the potential contribution of brines to relatively shallow bedrock groundwater used as source of drinking water also deserve further consideration for this purpose isotopic tracers could be particularly useful in particular strontium chlorine and bromine isotopes mcnutt et al 1990 stotler et al 2010 a better understanding of the factors controlling bedrock groundwater quality is of paramount importance to protect public health in rural areas the health risks primarily depend on the distribution and toxicity of contaminants in groundwater as well as the protective behaviors of well users therefore information on the protective behavior of well owners is essential to implement public awareness campaigns which are currently the best way to prevent health hazards associated with groundwater consumption acknowledgments this

7409,the upcoming surface water and ocean topography satellite mission to be launched in 2021 will measure river water surface elevation slope and width with an unprecedented level of accuracy for a remote sensing tool this work investigates the river discharge estimation from synthetic swot observations in the presence of strong uncertainties in the model inputs i e the river bathymetry and bed roughness the estimation problem is solved by a novel variant of the standard variational data assimilation the 4d var method involving the full saint venant 1 5d network hydraulic model sic2 the assimilation scheme simultaneously estimates the discharge bed elevation and bed roughness coefficient and is designed to assimilate both satellite and in situ measurements the method is tested on a 50 km long reach of the garonne river during a five month period of the year 2010 characterized by multiple flooding events first the impact of the sampling frequency on discharge estimation is investigated secondly discharge as well as the spatially distributed bed elevation and bed roughness coefficient are determined simultaneously results demonstrate feasibility and efficiency of the chosen combination of the estimation method and of the hydraulic model assimilation of the swot data results into an accurate estimation of the discharge at observation times and a local improvement

information on trans boundary rivers is simply not shared among neighboring countries wolf et al 1999 sneddon and fox 2006 biancamaria et al 2011b sneddon and fox 2012 hossain et al 2014 gleason and hamdan 2017 a need for alternative and or complementary measuring techniques is therefore essential several nadir altimeters that observe the water height are becoming widely available for the land surface applications such as jason 1 jason 2 envisat cryosat 2 saral altika and the recent near real time operational missions jason 3 and sentinel 3 bonnema et al 2016 in this respect numerous studies have been conducted on the use of satellite altimetry for monitoring terrestrial surface waters alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 papa et al 2006 crétaux and birkett 2006 calmant and seyler 2006 cretaux et al 2011 most of them are focused on observing water surface elevation wse in large rivers and lakes using topex poseidon birkett 1995 birkett 1998 de oliveira campos et al 2001 papa et al 2003 kouraev et al 2004 and envisat missions frappart et al 2006 medina et al 2008 bartsch et al 2009 also wse observations can be derived from synthetic aperture radar sar images of continental water bodies giustarini et al 2011 whereas the existing altimetry missions were initially designed for oceanography the upcoming surface water and ocean topography swot mission to be launched in 2021 in addition to the ocean survey at meso scale will provide a global mapping of continental water by measuring its spatial and temporal variability in lakes reservoirs and large rivers durand et al 2010 pavelsky et al 2014 with regard to rivers swot will observe water surface elevation wse slope and width with unprecedented for a remote sensing tool level of accuracy for wse the standard deviation of about 10 cm is expected when averaged over a 1 km 2 area e g 100 m 10 km durand et al 2010 rodriguez 2012 frasson et al 2017 the global overpass cycle will be 21 days with approximately three times per cycle sampling over the mid latitude though irregularly in time biancamaria et al 2010 2016 discharge estimation from in situ and remote sensing data has been addressed in recent years promoting modern data assimilation da methods instead of conventional flow routing methods used in practical river engineering the da methods which allow us to combine mathematical models data resulting from instrumental measurements and prior information have become an important tool for analysis of complex physical phenomena in the earth sciences with regards to the swot mission early da studies assumed the river bathymetry and the bed roughness to be known a priori andreadis et al 2007 biancamaria et al 2011a the former was estimated in durand et al 2008 yoon et al 2012 but assumed that the bed roughness was well known the complexity of implementing da methods with dynamical models and the difficulty of estimating discharge together with the river bathymetry and the bed roughness have led to the use of simplified models derived from the saint venant equations in this respect four previously published algorithms metropolis manning metroman durand et al 2014 garambois and monnier gamo garambois and monnier 2015 the mean flow and geomorphology mfg durand et al 2016 and the mean flow with constant roughness mfcr durand et al 2016 have been evaluated in durand et al 2016 for 19 rivers of various hydraulic conditions at least one algorithm although not always the same one had a discharge estimate relative root mean squared error less than 35 on the 14 non braided rivers included in the study the one dimensional 1d network models based on the saint venant equations are frequently used in various hydraulic applications for which the computational time and data availability are major limitations these models support a number of key hydraulic phenomena such as tide backwater artificial structures control devices braided and loops configurations storage areas etc several models of this type are reported in the literature such as carima artelia france holly and parrish 1993 mascaret edf france eau et al 2012 mike11 dhi water and environment denmark havnø et al 1995 duflow and sobek delft netherlands clemmens et al 1993 isis halcrow uk infoworks hr wallingford uk liana and vlad 2008 hec ras us corps of engineers usa brunner 1995 to mention a few for modeling essentially two dimensional 2d effects in dynamics for instance dam breaks flooding etc one should use 2d shallow water equations swe based models such as telemac 2d electricité de france edf france lisflood fp the university of bristol uk bates and de roo 2000 mike21 dhi water and environment denmark warren and bach 1992 rma 2 us corps of engineers usa king 1994 rubar 2d institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies pour l environnement et l agriculture irstea france paquier 1999 or dassflow institut de mécanique des fluides de toulouse imft france honnorat et al 2007 however running the 2d models requires significantly more computational resources however when it comes to solving estimation inverse da problems different simplified derivatives from the saint venant equations are often preferred as models among them one can mention the diffusive wave model aricò et al 2009 tsai 2003 durand et al 2008 andreadis and schumann 2014 yoon et al 2012 garća pintado et al 2015a and low froude or zero inertia models gessese et al 2013 garambois and monnier 2015 this choice is usually based on the following arguments the first one is that for certain a priori known hydraulic conditions some phenomena are negligible and the original equations can be simplified to yield a better posed and less expensive estimation problem however for the 1d hydraulic modeling the availability of computational resources is hardly an issue with modern computers unless of course an essentially non gaussian probability distribution of the errors is considered in which case stochastic ensemble estimation methods must be applied see e g durand et al 2014 another argument is that an accurate information on the river bathymetry which is needed to set up the saint venant model is not usually available however a very basic bathymetry can always be specified then tuned during the da process for example such bathymetry may involve a rectangular cross section shape and a constant bed slope and width in the context of the swot mission it is also argued that the sampling frequency of swot observations does not allow the fast temporal dynamics to be recovered this is partially true it depends on the spatial scale unless in addition to swot observations the wse data from other satellites or from a single gauging station located anywhere within the spatial domain of interest are available besides if the wse snapshot has been made during a fast dynamic phase the discharge estimates obtained using the zero inertia model could contain significant errors these arguments support the use of the full saint venant 1d network hydraulic model in the context of the swot data assimilation in particular we use the sic2 model simulation and integration of control for canals which has been under development at irstea for about 30 years succeeding the former cemagref hydraulic models talweg fluvia sirene this model is being used by tens of consultant companies working in water industry river monitoring design and control of irrigation canals and sewage systems etc on data assimilation involving the full saint venant 1d network hydraulic models are rather scarce in this context ensemble da has been applied in a few papers hartnack et al 2006 weerts et al 2010 while more studies have been performed involving simplified hydraulic models see e g garća pintado et al 2015b and munier et al 2015 fewer references reporting the use of the variational da exist because of the difficulty of generating a stable consistent adjoint to the saint venant model following the discretize then optimize approach betts and campbell 2005 ding and wang 2012 reported the variational control for the full saint venant 1d network model however the adjoint model used in the mentioned paper is derived using the optimize then discretize approach i e derived analytically then implemented numerically which yields an inconsistent adjoint the disadvantage of the latter approach is lower accuracy of the gradient and difficulty in applying the framework of constrained optimization the consistent adjoint for the full saint venant model of an industrial status has been reported only recently in gejadze and malaterre 2017 in the case of 2d shallow water equations based models variational da has been reported in honnorat et al 2010 hostache et al 2010 lai and monnier 2009 but for data types temporal spatial scales and unknowns quite different from those considered below in the present paper the variational da method described in detail in gejadze and malaterre 2017 has been applied to solve the discharge estimation problem under uncertainty in the channel bathymetry and the bed roughness synthetic wse observations which emulate the spatial distribution and the level of noise expected from the swot mission are assimilated for the 50 km long reach of the garonne river downstream of tonneins covering the period from 01 01 2010 to 31 05 2010 first we consider the inflow discharge estimation problem assuming exact knowledge on bathymetry and the bed roughness this is to investigate the impact of the sampling frequency from 1 day to 5 day revisit interval on the estimation accuracy secondly the uncertainty in bathymetry and or the bed roughness is introduced and the discharge the bed level and or the roughness coefficient are sought simultaneously this is a significant step forward from what has been reported so far in the literature that is such problems simultaneous state parameter domain estimation are difficult to solve due to the robustness and equifinality issues which are especially noticeable when dealing with realistic hydraulic systems our aim here is to demonstrate the accuracy of the variational da method for discharge estimation using a well studied benchmark the same quality of estimates should be anticipated for more complex test cases for which simplified models methods may not work properly or would not be able to benefit from all available information including gauge wse measurements if any moreover these experiments aim to illustrate how uncertainties in bathymetry and the bed roughness deteriorate the discharge estimation accuracy if not taken into account the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the full saint venant hydraulic model a variant of the standard variational da method specially designed for solving estimation under uncertainty problems in river hydraulics is introduced in section 3 study area and period are presented in section 5 while experiment design are described in section 4 in section 6 the results of numerical experiments along with relevant discussions are presented main findings of this study are summarized in the conclusion 2 hydraulic model the 1d hydraulic system is represented by a set of reaches connected at computational nodes the model uses a compound channel representation also referred to as the 1 5d representation to account for the transversal hydraulic effects that is the main river bed or low flow channel is represented by the minor bed which is the part of the river where it is usually flowing overflowing is accommodated by using the adjacent channels represented by the medium and major beds respectively note that the channel beds have different hydraulic properties due to different factors that impact the flow e g vegetation bathymetry etc the out of bank flow can be accounted for by using storage areas at nodes connected to the reaches the hydraulic variables are computed at a set of computational cross sections s j j 1 n defined along the reach for each section s j the wetted area a z p g the wetted perimeter p z p g the hydraulic radius r z p g and the top width l z p g are computed for a given wse z the p g x refers to the parameters which define the geometry of the corresponding computational cross section including z b the elevation of the lowest point of the cross section with respect to a chosen reference level note that in the present study estimation of bathymetry is limited to the estimation of the bed level z b future work will address the estimation of some other parameters defining the channel geometry for all sections s j j 1 n the shallow water flow in the longitudinal direction x is described by the saint venant equations 1 a t q x q l 2 q t q 2 a x ga z x gas f c l q l v t 0 t where q x t is the local discharge z x t is the wse q l x t is the lateral discharge c l x is the lateral discharge coefficient v x t q a is the mean velocity and s f is the friction term 3 s f q 2 k s 2 a 2 r 4 3 dependent on the strickler coefficient k s x inverse to the manning coefficient the initial condition for eqs 1 and 2 is 4 z x 0 z 0 x q x 0 q 0 x boundary conditions are defined at boundary sections for the upstream section s 1 we specify the inflow discharge 5 q x 1 t q t and the downstream section s n the rating curve 6 q x n t f z x n t p rc where p rc are the rating curve parameters of course the sic2 model supports different types of boundary conditions here we present only those relevant to the chosen test case the four point implicit finite difference method called the preissmann scheme novak et al 2010 is utilized for discretizing the problem 1 6 the fixed point iterations are used to resolve nonlinearity for more details on the solver we refer to malaterre et al 2014 3 data assimilation method let us consider a model m u x describing behavior of a dynamical system which maps the vector of model inputs u u into the model state x x 7 m u x for modeling the system behavior the true input vector u t must be specified in reality some components of u contain uncertainties ξ b thus instead of u t we use its best available guess 8 u b u t ξ b which is known as a background in variational da or as a prior in statistics because of the presence of ξ b the state x evaluated on u b also contains an error let us assume that the state variables are observed in the form 9 y h x y where y is the observation space and h x y is the observation operator now we can define the control to observation nonlinear mapping 10 h x h m u g u y where g u y is a nonlinear operator the actual observations usually contain noise observation uncertainty i e 11 y y t ξ o where y t g u t in particular the full input vector of the hydraulic model presented above consists of the following variables 12 u z 0 q 0 q p rc q l c l k s z b p g p nm t where p g p g z b are the geometry defining parameters excluding z b p nm are parameters of the numerical scheme for given u by solving the model equations 1 6 we obtain the flow fields 13 z q z x i t q x i t i 1 n t 0 t in certain components of the input vector v u the uncertainty is significant and strongly affects the model predictions the aim of data assimilation is to estimate v using observations y i e to improve the prior v b whereas the remaining components u 0 u v are fixed at u b 0 in the present study the inputs of interest are 14 v q t z b x k s x and the assimilated observations are 15 y z x i t j i 1 n s j 1 n t where n s and n t are respectively the numbers of the observed section and timestep in this case the dynamical model m refers to the code of the hydraulic model sic2 while h is a additional module representing the observation operator the variational da method gives the best estimate of the control vector by minimizing a cost function under the gaussian assumption on the observation and the background errors i e ξ b n 0 b and ξ o n 0 r where b and r are the corresponding covariance matrices the conventional formulation of the da problem is as follows 16 v argmin v j v where 17 j v 1 2 r 1 2 g v u b 0 y 2 1 2 b 1 2 v v b 2 a variant of the conventional variational da method useful for solving estimation under uncertainty problems in hydraulic applications is described in detail in gejadze and malaterre 2017 first instead of 17 we consider a modified cost function 18 j v α 1 2 r 1 2 g v u b 0 y 2 α 2 b 1 2 v v b 2 where α 0 is a regularization parameter this is done to reduce the impact of possible errors in assigning b the cost function 18 is used in the tikhonov regularization method tikhonov et al 1977 second we consider the change of variables v v b b 1 2 w in which case the above cost function takes the form 19 j w α 1 2 r 1 2 g v b b 1 2 w u b 0 y 2 α 2 w 2 if the control vector v is composed of heterogeneous components i e flow variables physical parameters and parameters describing the domain geometry then the corresponding parts of the gradient j v could have a very different norm since g is a nonlinear operator this may compromise the robustness of the minimization process the change of variables helps to assign the appropriate weights to the gradient see gejadze and malaterre 2017 let us note that to implement 19 one needs b 1 2 instead of b 1 or b 1 2 in the original formulation 17 this does not pose a problem with our application because only one dimensional controls are considered the optimal choice of the regularization parameter α is a key issue in the tikhonov regularization method for example α can be chosen from the residual principle as follows 20 j w χ 2 m δ where m and δ are the observation space dimension and the confidence level respectively this implies solving the minimization problem for different values of α to satisfy the condition 20 this could be computationally expensive an alternative is to use the iterative regularization method kaltenbacher et al 2008 in which the cost function to be minimized is reduced to its residual term 21 j w 1 2 r 1 2 g v b b 1 2 w u b 0 y 2 this should be complemented with a stopping criterion in order to obtain a regularized solution by early termination of the iterations we employ the residual principle 20 to stop the iterations in the iterative form 22 j w i χ 2 m δ where i is the iteration number the equivalence of these two approaches has been proved in kaltenbacher et al 2008 for a class of the so called regular iterative methods which include the steepest descent conjugate gradient bfgs or l bfgs let us underline that the equivalence is only valid for the cost function in the form 19 this is the third distinctive point of our method the update step of the l bfgs algorithm reads as follows 23 w i 1 w i β i h i 1 b 1 2 j v i w 0 0 24 v i 1 v b b 1 2 w i 1 v 0 v b where h i 1 is the approximated inverse of the hessian built by the algorithm the gradient of the cost function is given by 25 j v i g v i r 1 g v i u b 0 y where g v and g v are respectively the tangent linear and adjoint counterparts of the nonlinear operator g v u b 0 given by the following gateaux derivative 26 g v w lim t 0 g v tw u b 0 g v u b 0 t 27 w g v w u g v w w y w w the tangent linear and adjoint operators associated to the sic2 model have been produced using the automatic differentiation tool tapenade developed at inria hascoët and pascual 2004 one can see that the gradient based minimization involves the use of the tangent linear and the adjoint models while the tangent model represents the forward time integration the adjoint model is regarded as the corresponding backward time integration for the latter the system trajectory needs to be saved at each forward integration time step thus for a long assimilation window e g a few months and a time step consistent with the preissmann numerical scheme e g 20 min the process becomes memory consuming to overcome this limitation we consider a sequential implementation of the variational da approach which operates with assimilation sub windows let us introduce a time lag δ t consistent with the characteristic time of the dynamical system at the start of the da process i e for the first assimilation sub window the initial condition is given by the steady state flow solution consistent with the initial guess i e obtained for q q b t 0 const for any subsequent sub window the initial condition is given by the estimated state at time t δ t from the previous assimilation sub window i e z 0 x z x t δ t and q 0 x q x t δ t whereas the background is given by the estimated discharge at time t δ t i e q b t q t δ t const let us note that the sequential implementation is a new option to the method presented in gejadze and malaterre 2017 4 study area period the garonne river originates from val d aran in the spanish pyrenees flowing to the gironde estuary in south west france the study area is the 50 km long reach from tonneins upstream to la réole downstream passing via mas d agenais and marmande where gauging stations are available the surrounding area has suffered from severe flooding over the last red decade which caused significant damage to infrastructure residential properties and agricultural crops besnard and goutal 2011 we focus on the flooding events that occurred during the period january may 2010 with a maximum value of discharge about 1800 m3 s 5 experiment design one aim of this study is to firstly test the performance of variational da robustness convergence speed computational expenses accuracy when solving the discharge estimation problem under the conditions discussed earlier secondly our aim is to assess the information content of the swot type observations in the majority of previous studies different simplified hydraulic models and da techniques have been utilized durand et al 2016 thus the discharge estimates presented have contained additional errors due to accepted simplifications here we use a sufficiently realistic model and a more accurate da method the long time behavior of a hydraulic system is governed by boundary conditions and lateral sources thus the inverse problem considered in this paper is the boundary control problem we performed a set of numerical experiments where the inflow discharge flood hydrograph at tonneins was estimated see fig 1 in the identical twin experiment framework the synthetic swot type data were generated by the sic2 model given the fictitious true model input in particular the wse data were generated with the spatial step equal to 10 km then were corrupted with the gaussian error uncorrelated standard deviation 10 cm this corresponds to the expected swot spatial coverage and error respectively thus the observation operator is as follows 28 y h z q z t s j j i o where i o is a set of indices of the corresponding sections note that the swot measurements are also subject to systematic and spatially correlated errors introduced by different factors e g satellite roll terrain layover wet troposphere etc these types of errors are not addressed in the present paper and will be subject to future investigation in the first test case we estimated the discharge q t given the true bed level z b x and strickler coefficient k s x investigating the impact of the sampling interval from 1 day to 5 days experiment a in the second test case we solved the discharge estimation problem with perturbed z b x and or k s x experiments b c and d here functions z b x and or k s x are considered as control variables alongside q t the conducted experiments are summarized in table 1 the control step for q t is one day whereas the computational time step is 20 min the spatial control step for z b x and k s x coincides with the spatial discretization step which is 80 m the sequential version of the da algorithm described in section 3 is used with two assimilation sub windows 75 days each and 1 day lag in all experiments presented in this paper the same value of the inflow discharge background q b t is used for the first sub window t 75 days for the second sub window and for all subsequent ones if any q b t is taken equal to the final time minus lag estimate of q from the preceding sub window thus q b t for all sub windows except the first one are no more priors in the classical sense but intermediate variables of the sequential estimation algorithm for the first sub window the value of q b t is chosen to be equal to the mean annual value at tonneins q 482 m 3 s plus 10 q max q 0 where q max and q 0 are the maximum and the initial values over the study period respectively which amounts to a relative error rrmse q b 27 7 note that the presented results are not noticeably sensitive to the background values in principle any available first guess on discharge can be used as long as the resulting dynamics is supported by the hydraulic model sic2 the background covariance matrix b for different control variables is built using the approach presented in gejadze and malaterre 2017 this approach is based on the assumption that the control variable is a distributed function of space or time which belongs to the sobolev space of the second order the square root of the matrix b is obtained using cholesky decomposition note that the computational cost of the gradient obtained using the adjoint model does not depend on the control vector composition thus considering z b and k s alongside with q does not lead to a proportional rise of the computational expenses here all the experiments were conducted on a laptop endowed with 32 gb of ram the corresponding cpu time over the study period under investigation 5 months is presented in table 1 the estimation quality is measured by the relative root mean square error rrmse defined by 29 rrmse q 1 t 0 t q t q t t 1 2 dt 1 2 where q t t is the true reference value of the inflow discharge and t is the full time length of the experiment 6 results and discussion 6 1 discharge estimation given the true bathymetry and friction the results of discharge estimation for different sampling intervals i e experiment a are shown in fig 2 and the corresponding rrmse s are presented in table 2 one can see that the discharge hydrograph is successfully recovered for the 1 day sampling interval rrmse q 2 1 whereas less accurate results are obtained for larger intervals an important factor to bear in mind when comparing these results is the characteristic time of the system for the reach under consideration this is the time a wave propagates from tonneins to la réole i e 1 day since the constant background does not provide information on the hydrograph shape the estimates diverge from the truth especially between the observation times this behavior can be explained by the nyquist sampling theorem asserting that the sampling frequency should be at least twice the highest frequency contained in the signal olshausen and aliasing 2000 one remedy would be to supply an informative background which can be obtained from a hydrological model output of course assimilating high frequency observations from a single gauging station located anywhere within the spatial domain will greatly improve the estimation accuracy one can conclude however that the swot type data would be more useful for larger systems 6 2 discharge estimation under uncertainty in bed level and or friction coefficient in this subsection we consider the inflow discharge estimation under uncertainty in the strickler coefficient k s x and or in the bed level z b x first only the discharge q t is estimated whereas k s x and or z b x are fixed at their background values k s b x and or z b x experiments b c d i then alongside q t either k s x or z b x or both are estimated i e included into the control vector as in the previous subsection the inflow discharge background q b t const for the first assimilation sub window is taken as the mean annual value at tonneins the strickler coefficient background is assumed to be constant over the reach with k s b 40 the bed level background z b is derived from the perturbed initial wse given by the steady state flow solution in these experiments the 1 day sampling interval is considered the results in fig 3 experiments b i and b ii show that given the true bathymetry q t is successfully estimated rrmse q 2 6 which makes 10 3 reduction over the value obtained with fixed k s k s b also k s x is estimated sufficiently well similarly the results in fig 4 experiment c ii show that given the true strickler coefficient q t is successfully estimated rrmse q 3 8 which makes 47 1 reduction over the value obtained with fixed z b however some local improvement in z b over z b can be seen this means that controlling z b only helps a better estimate of the inflow discharge to be obtained under conditions of the current experiment concerning z b it seems unlikely that it can be considered as an improved background for subsequent experiments one may argue that for denser spatial and temporal sampling and higher observation accuracy better estimates of z b x can be achieved as demonstrated for academic test cases in gejadze and malaterre 2017 finally simultaneous estimation of q t k s x and z b x has been considered experiment d ii here we use the same q b and z b as in experiment c and a constant k s b 30 the results are presented in figs 5 6 and the corresponding errors in table 3 one can see that q t is successfully estimated rrmse q 7 1 which makes 33 4 reduction over the value obtained with fixed k s k s b and z b z b b with some local improvement in z b over z b and clearly deteriorated k s over k s b in this experimental set up one may encounter the following difficulties a the rise of inconsistent combinations of a priori or estimated values of the controlled variables leading to hydraulic scenarios which are not supported by the sic2 model e g supercritical flow dry bed etc b the equifinality i e the existence of more than one combination of control variables non uniqueness resulting into nearly the same values of the water surface elevation z in the case of estimating the triplet q z b k s only good estimates of discharge can be obtained however accurate estimates of the river bathymetry and bed roughness are not achieved let us note that simultaneous estimation of q t and z b x at fixed k s k s b experiment d iii leads to comparable results in terms of the achieved accuracy in q in this case the uncertainty in both z b and k s is absorbed by z b which serves here as a generalized model error at the same time the problem d iii is better posed than d ii and therefore is easier to solve more examples and an in depth discussion on the latter issue can be found in gejadze and malaterre 2017 2016 one can see in figs 3 5 that uncertainties in the distributed model parameters z b x and k s x result into a nearly constant in time bias in the discharge estimate this is due to the fact that given the spatial scale of the system under consideration the flow is not too far from being steady state at any time instant an interesting question is whether or not such bias can be removed by properly shifting the bed level by a constant value δ z b to answer this question we investigate simultaneous estimation of q t and δ z b given the true strickler coefficient k s under the same assumptions as in experiment c first we consider the original time scale second a faster dynamics is simulated using temporal rescaling of the upstream hydrograph and all temporal variables time steps assimilation window length each subplot in fig 7 illustrates the discharge estimation error δ q q q t in two cases a control of the distributed parameter z b x and b control of the constant shift δ z b for slow dynamics upper panel the error reduction due to the use of the distributed control instead of the shift control is indeed not too significant rrmse q 3 56 against 4 87 at the same time the shift control should be preferred from the point of view of robustness and associated computational costs faster convergence based on this example the use of the distributed control is questionable however for faster dynamics lower panel the improvement is more significant rrmse q 4 71 against 10 78 especially for some time steps let us mention that slow and fast are relative notions which depend on the characteristic time of the system therefore what seems slow for a given spatial scale could become fast for larger spatial scales this justifies the need of using the distributed controls 7 summary and conclusions this study aims to assess the potential of variational da for solving the river discharge estimation problem using the swot like observations as a hydraulic model we use the full saint venant 1 5d network hydraulic model sic2 the proposed methodology is designed to assimilate both in situ data when available and satellite observations the implemented sequential version allows the long term hydraulic scenario to be studied the method has been applied over the downstream reach of the garonne river during flooding events of the year 2010 using the identical twin experiments framework first assuming no uncertainty in bathymetry and the bed roughness and given a non informative background discharge is successfully estimated for the sampling interval comparable to the characteristic time of the dynamical system one day given the spatial scale considered 50 km the estimation accuracy progressively deteriorates for longer sampling intervals mainly between the observation instants secondly discharge estimation in the presence of significant uncertainty in bathymetry and the bed roughness was considered for the 1 day sampling interval this uncertainty had been subjected to an explicit treatment via simultaneous estimation of the discharge and the bed level and or the strickler coefficient discharge is well estimated with rrsme q 2 6 3 8 and 5 1 in cases b ii c ii and d iii respectively whereas the by product estimates of the bed level and of the strickler coefficient are not usable note that it is sufficient to control only the bed elevation experiment d which also absorbs a major part of the uncertainty in the strickler coefficient moreover if a constant bed shift is controlled instead of the spatially distributed bed elevation the minimization process becomes more robust and less expensive the discharge estimation problem can be reliably solved using variational da without accurate knowledge of the bathymetry and of the bed roughness thus variational da involving the full saint venant model can be used directly to refine the estimates obtained by different simplified methods future work will include solving the discharge estimation problem for a larger river system using data produced by the swot science simulator which is expected to be able to reproduce the actual spatial and temporal sampling patterns and a more realistic observation accuracy acknowledgments the authors would like to thank david dorchies for help

7409,the upcoming surface water and ocean topography satellite mission to be launched in 2021 will measure river water surface elevation slope and width with an unprecedented level of accuracy for a remote sensing tool this work investigates the river discharge estimation from synthetic swot observations in the presence of strong uncertainties in the model inputs i e the river bathymetry and bed roughness the estimation problem is solved by a novel variant of the standard variational data assimilation the 4d var method involving the full saint venant 1 5d network hydraulic model sic2 the assimilation scheme simultaneously estimates the discharge bed elevation and bed roughness coefficient and is designed to assimilate both satellite and in situ measurements the method is tested on a 50 km long reach of the garonne river during a five month period of the year 2010 characterized by multiple flooding events first the impact of the sampling frequency on discharge estimation is investigated secondly discharge as well as the spatially distributed bed elevation and bed roughness coefficient are determined simultaneously results demonstrate feasibility and efficiency of the chosen combination of the estimation method and of the hydraulic model assimilation of the swot data results into an accurate estimation of the discharge at observation times and a local improvement

and terrestrial processes alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 davies and simonovic 2011 reliable information on river discharge at a global scale is vital for understanding the fresh water cycle managing water supplies assessing flooding hazards irrigation withdrawals hydro power production navigating conditions etc in the regions characterized by a high human activity this information is provided by networks of gauging stations unfortunately many of these networks are steadily declining over the years due to associated costs milzow et al 2011 fekete and vörösmarty 2002 in the regions dominated by natural landscapes such networks have originally been sparse or never existed political and security instabilities also reduce the possibility of developing or maintaining such networks moreover the information on trans boundary rivers is simply not shared among neighboring countries wolf et al 1999 sneddon and fox 2006 biancamaria et al 2011b sneddon and fox 2012 hossain et al 2014 gleason and hamdan 2017 a need for alternative and or complementary measuring techniques is therefore essential several nadir altimeters that observe the water height are becoming widely available for the land surface applications such as jason 1 jason 2 envisat cryosat 2 saral altika and the recent near real time operational missions jason 3 and sentinel 3 bonnema et al 2016 in this respect numerous studies have been conducted on the use of satellite altimetry for monitoring terrestrial surface waters alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 papa et al 2006 crétaux and birkett 2006 calmant and seyler 2006 cretaux et al 2011 most of them are focused on observing water surface elevation wse in large rivers and lakes using topex poseidon birkett 1995 birkett 1998 de oliveira campos et al 2001 papa et al 2003 kouraev et al 2004 and envisat missions frappart et al 2006 medina et al 2008 bartsch et al 2009 also wse observations can be derived from synthetic aperture radar sar images of continental water bodies giustarini et al 2011 whereas the existing altimetry missions were initially designed for oceanography the upcoming surface water and ocean topography swot mission to be launched in 2021 in addition to the ocean survey at meso scale will provide a global mapping of continental water by measuring its spatial and temporal variability in lakes reservoirs and large rivers durand et al 2010 pavelsky et al 2014 with regard to rivers swot will observe water surface elevation wse slope and width with unprecedented for a remote sensing tool level of accuracy for wse the standard deviation of about 10 cm is expected when averaged over a 1 km 2 area e g 100 m 10 km durand et al 2010 rodriguez 2012 frasson et al 2017 the global overpass cycle will be 21 days with approximately three times per cycle sampling over the mid latitude though irregularly in time biancamaria et al 2010 2016 discharge estimation from in situ and remote sensing data has been addressed in recent years promoting modern data assimilation da methods instead of conventional flow routing methods used in practical river engineering the da methods which allow us to combine mathematical models data resulting from instrumental measurements and prior information have become an important tool for analysis of complex physical phenomena in the earth sciences with regards to the swot mission early da studies assumed the river bathymetry and the bed roughness to be known a priori andreadis et al 2007 biancamaria et al 2011a the former was estimated in durand et al 2008 yoon et al 2012 but assumed that the bed roughness was well known the complexity of implementing da methods with dynamical models and the difficulty of estimating discharge together with the river bathymetry and the bed roughness have led to the use of simplified models derived from the saint venant equations in this respect four previously published algorithms metropolis manning metroman durand et al 2014 garambois and monnier gamo garambois and monnier 2015 the mean flow and geomorphology mfg durand et al 2016 and the mean flow with constant roughness mfcr durand et al 2016 have been evaluated in durand et al 2016 for 19 rivers of various hydraulic conditions at least one algorithm although not always the same one had a discharge estimate relative root mean squared error less than 35 on the 14 non braided rivers included in the study the one dimensional 1d network models based on the saint venant equations are frequently used in various hydraulic applications for which the computational time and data availability are major limitations these models support a number of key hydraulic phenomena such as tide backwater artificial structures control devices braided and loops configurations storage areas etc several models of this type are reported in the literature such as carima artelia france holly and parrish 1993 mascaret edf france eau et al 2012 mike11 dhi water and environment denmark havnø et al 1995 duflow and sobek delft netherlands clemmens et al 1993 isis halcrow uk infoworks hr wallingford uk liana and vlad 2008 hec ras us corps of engineers usa brunner 1995 to mention a few for modeling essentially two dimensional 2d effects in dynamics for instance dam breaks flooding etc one should use 2d shallow water equations swe based models such as telemac 2d electricité de france edf france lisflood fp the university of bristol uk bates and de roo 2000 mike21 dhi water and environment denmark warren and bach 1992 rma 2 us corps of engineers usa king 1994 rubar 2d institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies pour l environnement et l agriculture irstea france paquier 1999 or dassflow institut de mécanique des fluides de toulouse imft france honnorat et al 2007 however running the 2d models requires significantly more computational resources however when it comes to solving estimation inverse da problems different simplified derivatives from the saint venant equations are often preferred as models among them one can mention the diffusive wave model aricò et al 2009 tsai 2003 durand et al 2008 andreadis and schumann 2014 yoon et al 2012 garća pintado et al 2015a and low froude or zero inertia models gessese et al 2013 garambois and monnier 2015 this choice is usually based on the following arguments the first one is that for certain a priori known hydraulic conditions some phenomena are negligible and the original equations can be simplified to yield a better posed and less expensive estimation problem however for the 1d hydraulic modeling the availability of computational resources is hardly an issue with modern computers unless of course an essentially non gaussian probability distribution of the errors is considered in which case stochastic ensemble estimation methods must be applied see e g durand et al 2014 another argument is that an accurate information on the river bathymetry which is needed to set up the saint venant model is not usually available however a very basic bathymetry can always be specified then tuned during the da process for example such bathymetry may involve a rectangular cross section shape and a constant bed slope and width in the context of the swot mission it is also argued that the sampling frequency of swot observations does not allow the fast temporal dynamics to be recovered this is partially true it depends on the spatial scale unless in addition to swot observations the wse data from other satellites or from a single gauging station located anywhere within the spatial domain of interest are available besides if the wse snapshot has been made during a fast dynamic phase the discharge estimates obtained using the zero inertia model could contain significant errors these arguments support the use of the full saint venant 1d network hydraulic model in the context of the swot data assimilation in particular we use the sic2 model simulation and integration of control for canals which has been under development at irstea for about 30 years succeeding the former cemagref hydraulic models talweg fluvia sirene this model is being used by tens of consultant companies working in water industry river monitoring design and control of irrigation canals and sewage systems etc on data assimilation involving the full saint venant 1d network hydraulic models are rather scarce in this context ensemble da has been applied in a few papers hartnack et al 2006 weerts et al 2010 while more studies have been performed involving simplified hydraulic models see e g garća pintado et al 2015b and munier et al 2015 fewer references reporting the use of the variational da exist because of the difficulty of generating a stable consistent adjoint to the saint venant model following the discretize then optimize approach betts and campbell 2005 ding and wang 2012 reported the variational control for the full saint venant 1d network model however the adjoint model used in the mentioned paper is derived using the optimize then discretize approach i e derived analytically then implemented numerically which yields an inconsistent adjoint the disadvantage of the latter approach is lower accuracy of the gradient and difficulty in applying the framework of constrained optimization the consistent adjoint for the full saint venant model of an industrial status has been reported only recently in gejadze and malaterre 2017 in the case of 2d shallow water equations based models variational da has been reported in honnorat et al 2010 hostache et al 2010 lai and monnier 2009 but for data types temporal spatial scales and unknowns quite different from those considered below in the present paper the variational da method described in detail in gejadze and malaterre 2017 has been applied to solve the discharge estimation problem under uncertainty in the channel bathymetry and the bed roughness synthetic wse observations which emulate the spatial distribution and the level of noise expected from the swot mission are assimilated for the 50 km long reach of the garonne river downstream of tonneins covering the period from 01 01 2010 to 31 05 2010 first we consider the inflow discharge estimation problem assuming exact knowledge on bathymetry and the bed roughness this is to investigate the impact of the sampling frequency from 1 day to 5 day revisit interval on the estimation accuracy secondly the uncertainty in bathymetry and or the bed roughness is introduced and the discharge the bed level and or the roughness coefficient are sought simultaneously this is a significant step forward from what has been reported so far in the literature that is such problems simultaneous state parameter domain estimation are difficult to solve due to the robustness and equifinality issues which are especially noticeable when dealing with realistic hydraulic systems our aim here is to demonstrate the accuracy of the variational da method for discharge estimation using a well studied benchmark the same quality of estimates should be anticipated for more complex test cases for which simplified models methods may not work properly or would not be able to benefit from all available information including gauge wse measurements if any moreover these experiments aim to illustrate how uncertainties in bathymetry and the bed roughness deteriorate the discharge estimation accuracy if not taken into account the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the full saint venant hydraulic model a variant of the standard variational da method specially designed for solving estimation under uncertainty problems in river hydraulics is introduced in section 3 study area and period are presented in section 5 while experiment design are described in section 4 in section 6 the results of numerical experiments along with relevant discussions are presented main findings of this study are summarized in the conclusion 2 hydraulic model the 1d hydraulic system is represented by a set of reaches connected at computational nodes the model uses a compound channel representation also referred to as the 1 5d representation to account for the transversal hydraulic effects that is the main river bed or low flow channel is represented by the minor bed which is the part of the river where it is usually flowing overflowing is accommodated by using the adjacent channels represented by the medium and major beds respectively note that the channel beds have different hydraulic properties due to different factors that impact the flow e g vegetation bathymetry etc the out of bank flow can be accounted for by using storage areas at nodes connected to the reaches the hydraulic variables are computed at a set of computational cross sections s j j 1 n defined along the reach for each section s j the wetted area a z p g the wetted perimeter p z p g the hydraulic radius r z p g and the top width l z p g are computed for a given wse z the p g x refers to the parameters which define the geometry of the corresponding computational cross section including z b the elevation of the lowest point of the cross section with respect to a chosen reference level note that in the present study estimation of bathymetry is limited to the estimation of the bed level z b future work will address the estimation of some other parameters defining the channel geometry for all sections s j j 1 n the shallow water flow in the longitudinal direction x is described by the saint venant equations 1 a t q x q l 2 q t q 2 a x ga z x gas f c l q l v t 0 t where q x t is the local discharge z x t is the wse q l x t is the lateral discharge c l x is the lateral discharge coefficient v x t q a is the mean velocity and s f is the friction term 3 s f q 2 k s 2 a 2 r 4 3 dependent on the strickler coefficient k s x inverse to the manning coefficient the initial condition for eqs 1 and 2 is 4 z x 0 z 0 x q x 0 q 0 x boundary conditions are defined at boundary sections for the upstream section s 1 we specify the inflow discharge 5 q x 1 t q t and the downstream section s n the rating curve 6 q x n t f z x n t p rc where p rc are the rating curve parameters of course the sic2 model supports different types of boundary conditions here we present only those relevant to the chosen test case the four point implicit finite difference method called the preissmann scheme novak et al 2010 is utilized for discretizing the problem 1 6 the fixed point iterations are used to resolve nonlinearity for more details on the solver we refer to malaterre et al 2014 3 data assimilation method let us consider a model m u x describing behavior of a dynamical system which maps the vector of model inputs u u into the model state x x 7 m u x for modeling the system behavior the true input vector u t must be specified in reality some components of u contain uncertainties ξ b thus instead of u t we use its best available guess 8 u b u t ξ b which is known as a background in variational da or as a prior in statistics because of the presence of ξ b the state x evaluated on u b also contains an error let us assume that the state variables are observed in the form 9 y h x y where y is the observation space and h x y is the observation operator now we can define the control to observation nonlinear mapping 10 h x h m u g u y where g u y is a nonlinear operator the actual observations usually contain noise observation uncertainty i e 11 y y t ξ o where y t g u t in particular the full input vector of the hydraulic model presented above consists of the following variables 12 u z 0 q 0 q p rc q l c l k s z b p g p nm t where p g p g z b are the geometry defining parameters excluding z b p nm are parameters of the numerical scheme for given u by solving the model equations 1 6 we obtain the flow fields 13 z q z x i t q x i t i 1 n t 0 t in certain components of the input vector v u the uncertainty is significant and strongly affects the model predictions the aim of data assimilation is to estimate v using observations y i e to improve the prior v b whereas the remaining components u 0 u v are fixed at u b 0 in the present study the inputs of interest are 14 v q t z b x k s x and the assimilated observations are 15 y z x i t j i 1 n s j 1 n t where n s and n t are respectively the numbers of the observed section and timestep in this case the dynamical model m refers to the code of the hydraulic model sic2 while h is a additional module representing the observation operator the variational da method gives the best estimate of the control vector by minimizing a cost function under the gaussian assumption on the observation and the background errors i e ξ b n 0 b and ξ o n 0 r where b and r are the corresponding covariance matrices the conventional formulation of the da problem is as follows 16 v argmin v j v where 17 j v 1 2 r 1 2 g v u b 0 y 2 1 2 b 1 2 v v b 2 a variant of the conventional variational da method useful for solving estimation under uncertainty problems in hydraulic applications is described in detail in gejadze and malaterre 2017 first instead of 17 we consider a modified cost function 18 j v α 1 2 r 1 2 g v u b 0 y 2 α 2 b 1 2 v v b 2 where α 0 is a regularization parameter this is done to reduce the impact of possible errors in assigning b the cost function 18 is used in the tikhonov regularization method tikhonov et al 1977 second we consider the change of variables v v b b 1 2 w in which case the above cost function takes the form 19 j w α 1 2 r 1 2 g v b b 1 2 w u b 0 y 2 α 2 w 2 if the control vector v is composed of heterogeneous components i e flow variables physical parameters and parameters describing the domain geometry then the corresponding parts of the gradient j v could have a very different norm since g is a nonlinear operator this may compromise the robustness of the minimization process the change of variables helps to assign the appropriate weights to the gradient see gejadze and malaterre 2017 let us note that to implement 19 one needs b 1 2 instead of b 1 or b 1 2 in the original formulation 17 this does not pose a problem with our application because only one dimensional controls are considered the optimal choice of the regularization parameter α is a key issue in the tikhonov regularization method for example α can be chosen from the residual principle as follows 20 j w χ 2 m δ where m and δ are the observation space dimension and the confidence level respectively this implies solving the minimization problem for different values of α to satisfy the condition 20 this could be computationally expensive an alternative is to use the iterative regularization method kaltenbacher et al 2008 in which the cost function to be minimized is reduced to its residual term 21 j w 1 2 r 1 2 g v b b 1 2 w u b 0 y 2 this should be complemented with a stopping criterion in order to obtain a regularized solution by early termination of the iterations we employ the residual principle 20 to stop the iterations in the iterative form 22 j w i χ 2 m δ where i is the iteration number the equivalence of these two approaches has been proved in kaltenbacher et al 2008 for a class of the so called regular iterative methods which include the steepest descent conjugate gradient bfgs or l bfgs let us underline that the equivalence is only valid for the cost function in the form 19 this is the third distinctive point of our method the update step of the l bfgs algorithm reads as follows 23 w i 1 w i β i h i 1 b 1 2 j v i w 0 0 24 v i 1 v b b 1 2 w i 1 v 0 v b where h i 1 is the approximated inverse of the hessian built by the algorithm the gradient of the cost function is given by 25 j v i g v i r 1 g v i u b 0 y where g v and g v are respectively the tangent linear and adjoint counterparts of the nonlinear operator g v u b 0 given by the following gateaux derivative 26 g v w lim t 0 g v tw u b 0 g v u b 0 t 27 w g v w u g v w w y w w the tangent linear and adjoint operators associated to the sic2 model have been produced using the automatic differentiation tool tapenade developed at inria hascoët and pascual 2004 one can see that the gradient based minimization involves the use of the tangent linear and the adjoint models while the tangent model represents the forward time integration the adjoint model is regarded as the corresponding backward time integration for the latter the system trajectory needs to be saved at each forward integration time step thus for a long assimilation window e g a few months and a time step consistent with the preissmann numerical scheme e g 20 min the process becomes memory consuming to overcome this limitation we consider a sequential implementation of the variational da approach which operates with assimilation sub windows let us introduce a time lag δ t consistent with the characteristic time of the dynamical system at the start of the da process i e for the first assimilation sub window the initial condition is given by the steady state flow solution consistent with the initial guess i e obtained for q q b t 0 const for any subsequent sub window the initial condition is given by the estimated state at time t δ t from the previous assimilation sub window i e z 0 x z x t δ t and q 0 x q x t δ t whereas the background is given by the estimated discharge at time t δ t i e q b t q t δ t const let us note that the sequential implementation is a new option to the method presented in gejadze and malaterre 2017 4 study area period the garonne river originates from val d aran in the spanish pyrenees flowing to the gironde estuary in south west france the study area is the 50 km long reach from tonneins upstream to la réole downstream passing via mas d agenais and marmande where gauging stations are available the surrounding area has suffered from severe flooding over the last red decade which caused significant damage to infrastructure residential properties and agricultural crops besnard and goutal 2011 we focus on the flooding events that occurred during the period january may 2010 with a maximum value of discharge about 1800 m3 s 5 experiment design one aim of this study is to firstly test the performance of variational da robustness convergence speed computational expenses accuracy when solving the discharge estimation problem under the conditions discussed earlier secondly our aim is to assess the information content of the swot type observations in the majority of previous studies different simplified hydraulic models and da techniques have been utilized durand et al 2016 thus the discharge estimates presented have contained additional errors due to accepted simplifications here we use a sufficiently realistic model and a more accurate da method the long time behavior of a hydraulic system is governed by boundary conditions and lateral sources thus the inverse problem considered in this paper is the boundary control problem we performed a set of numerical experiments where the inflow discharge flood hydrograph at tonneins was estimated see fig 1 in the identical twin experiment framework the synthetic swot type data were generated by the sic2 model given the fictitious true model input in particular the wse data were generated with the spatial step equal to 10 km then were corrupted with the gaussian error uncorrelated standard deviation 10 cm this corresponds to the expected swot spatial coverage and error respectively thus the observation operator is as follows 28 y h z q z t s j j i o where i o is a set of indices of the corresponding sections note that the swot measurements are also subject to systematic and spatially correlated errors introduced by different factors e g satellite roll terrain layover wet troposphere etc these types of errors are not addressed in the present paper and will be subject to future investigation in the first test case we estimated the discharge q t given the true bed level z b x and strickler coefficient k s x investigating the impact of the sampling interval from 1 day to 5 days experiment a in the second test case we solved the discharge estimation problem with perturbed z b x and or k s x experiments b c and d here functions z b x and or k s x are considered as control variables alongside q t the conducted experiments are summarized in table 1 the control step for q t is one day whereas the computational time step is 20 min the spatial control step for z b x and k s x coincides with the spatial discretization step which is 80 m the sequential version of the da algorithm described in section 3 is used with two assimilation sub windows 75 days each and 1 day lag in all experiments presented in this paper the same value of the inflow discharge background q b t is used for the first sub window t 75 days for the second sub window and for all subsequent ones if any q b t is taken equal to the final time minus lag estimate of q from the preceding sub window thus q b t for all sub windows except the first one are no more priors in the classical sense but intermediate variables of the sequential estimation algorithm for the first sub window the value of q b t is chosen to be equal to the mean annual value at tonneins q 482 m 3 s plus 10 q max q 0 where q max and q 0 are the maximum and the initial values over the study period respectively which amounts to a relative error rrmse q b 27 7 note that the presented results are not noticeably sensitive to the background values in principle any available first guess on discharge can be used as long as the resulting dynamics is supported by the hydraulic model sic2 the background covariance matrix b for different control variables is built using the approach presented in gejadze and malaterre 2017 this approach is based on the assumption that the control variable is a distributed function of space or time which belongs to the sobolev space of the second order the square root of the matrix b is obtained using cholesky decomposition note that the computational cost of the gradient obtained using the adjoint model does not depend on the control vector composition thus considering z b and k s alongside with q does not lead to a proportional rise of the computational expenses here all the experiments were conducted on a laptop endowed with 32 gb of ram the corresponding cpu time over the study period under investigation 5 months is presented in table 1 the estimation quality is measured by the relative root mean square error rrmse defined by 29 rrmse q 1 t 0 t q t q t t 1 2 dt 1 2 where q t t is the true reference value of the inflow discharge and t is the full time length of the experiment 6 results and discussion 6 1 discharge estimation given the true bathymetry and friction the results of discharge estimation for different sampling intervals i e experiment a are shown in fig 2 and the corresponding rrmse s are presented in table 2 one can see that the discharge hydrograph is successfully recovered for the 1 day sampling interval rrmse q 2 1 whereas less accurate results are obtained for larger intervals an important factor to bear in mind when comparing these results is the characteristic time of the system for the reach under consideration this is the time a wave propagates from tonneins to la réole i e 1 day since the constant background does not provide information on the hydrograph shape the estimates diverge from the truth especially between the observation times this behavior can be explained by the nyquist sampling theorem asserting that the sampling frequency should be at least twice the highest frequency contained in the signal olshausen and aliasing 2000 one remedy would be to supply an informative background which can be obtained from a hydrological model output of course assimilating high frequency observations from a single gauging station located anywhere within the spatial domain will greatly improve the estimation accuracy one can conclude however that the swot type data would be more useful for larger systems 6 2 discharge estimation under uncertainty in bed level and or friction coefficient in this subsection we consider the inflow discharge estimation under uncertainty in the strickler coefficient k s x and or in the bed level z b x first only the discharge q t is estimated whereas k s x and or z b x are fixed at their background values k s b x and or z b x experiments b c d i then alongside q t either k s x or z b x or both are estimated i e included into the control vector as in the previous subsection the inflow discharge background q b t const for the first assimilation sub window is taken as the mean annual value at tonneins the strickler coefficient background is assumed to be constant over the reach with k s b 40 the bed level background z b is derived from the perturbed initial wse given by the steady state flow solution in these experiments the 1 day sampling interval is considered the results in fig 3 experiments b i and b ii show that given the true bathymetry q t is successfully estimated rrmse q 2 6 which makes 10 3 reduction over the value obtained with fixed k s k s b also k s x is estimated sufficiently well similarly the results in fig 4 experiment c ii show that given the true strickler coefficient q t is successfully estimated rrmse q 3 8 which makes 47 1 reduction over the value obtained with fixed z b however some local improvement in z b over z b can be seen this means that controlling z b only helps a better estimate of the inflow discharge to be obtained under conditions of the current experiment concerning z b it seems unlikely that it can be considered as an improved background for subsequent experiments one may argue that for denser spatial and temporal sampling and higher observation accuracy better estimates of z b x can be achieved as demonstrated for academic test cases in gejadze and malaterre 2017 finally simultaneous estimation of q t k s x and z b x has been considered experiment d ii here we use the same q b and z b as in experiment c and a constant k s b 30 the results are presented in figs 5 6 and the corresponding errors in table 3 one can see that q t is successfully estimated rrmse q 7 1 which makes 33 4 reduction over the value obtained with fixed k s k s b and z b z b b with some local improvement in z b over z b and clearly deteriorated k s over k s b in this experimental set up one may encounter the following difficulties a the rise of inconsistent combinations of a priori or estimated values of the controlled variables leading to hydraulic scenarios which are not supported by the sic2 model e g supercritical flow dry bed etc b the equifinality i e the existence of more than one combination of control variables non uniqueness resulting into nearly the same values of the water surface elevation z in the case of estimating the triplet q z b k s only good estimates of discharge can be obtained however accurate estimates of the river bathymetry and bed roughness are not achieved let us note that simultaneous estimation of q t and z b x at fixed k s k s b experiment d iii leads to comparable results in terms of the achieved accuracy in q in this case the uncertainty in both z b and k s is absorbed by z b which serves here as a generalized model error at the same time the problem d iii is better posed than d ii and therefore is easier to solve more examples and an in depth discussion on the latter issue can be found in gejadze and malaterre 2017 2016 one can see in figs 3 5 that uncertainties in the distributed model parameters z b x and k s x result into a nearly constant in time bias in the discharge estimate this is due to the fact that given the spatial scale of the system under consideration the flow is not too far from being steady state at any time instant an interesting question is whether or not such bias can be removed by properly shifting the bed level by a constant value δ z b to answer this question we investigate simultaneous estimation of q t and δ z b given the true strickler coefficient k s under the same assumptions as in experiment c first we consider the original time scale second a faster dynamics is simulated using temporal rescaling of the upstream hydrograph and all temporal variables time steps assimilation window length each subplot in fig 7 illustrates the discharge estimation error δ q q q t in two cases a control of the distributed parameter z b x and b control of the constant shift δ z b for slow dynamics upper panel the error reduction due to the use of the distributed control instead of the shift control is indeed not too significant rrmse q 3 56 against 4 87 at the same time the shift control should be preferred from the point of view of robustness and associated computational costs faster convergence based on this example the use of the distributed control is questionable however for faster dynamics lower panel the improvement is more significant rrmse q 4 71 against 10 78 especially for some time steps let us mention that slow and fast are relative notions which depend on the characteristic time of the system therefore what seems slow for a given spatial scale could become fast for larger spatial scales this justifies the need of using the distributed controls 7 summary and conclusions this study aims to assess the potential of variational da for solving the river discharge estimation problem using the swot like observations as a hydraulic model we use the full saint venant 1 5d network hydraulic model sic2 the proposed methodology is designed to assimilate both in situ data when available and satellite observations the implemented sequential version allows the long term hydraulic scenario to be studied the method has been applied over the downstream reach of the garonne river during flooding events of the year 2010 using the identical twin experiments framework first assuming no uncertainty in bathymetry and the bed roughness and given a non informative background discharge is successfully estimated for the sampling interval comparable to the characteristic time of the dynamical system one day given the spatial scale considered 50 km the estimation accuracy progressively deteriorates for longer sampling intervals mainly between the observation instants secondly discharge estimation in the presence of significant uncertainty in bathymetry and the bed roughness was considered for the 1 day sampling interval this uncertainty had been subjected to an explicit treatment via simultaneous estimation of the discharge and the bed level and or the strickler coefficient discharge is well estimated with rrsme q 2 6 3 8 and 5 1 in cases b ii c ii and d iii respectively whereas the by product estimates of the bed level and of the strickler coefficient are not usable note that it is sufficient to control only the bed elevation experiment d which also absorbs a major part of the uncertainty in the strickler coefficient moreover if a constant bed shift is controlled instead of the spatially distributed bed elevation the minimization process becomes more robust and less expensive the discharge estimation problem can be reliably solved using variational da without accurate knowledge of the bathymetry and of the bed roughness thus variational da involving the full saint venant model can be used directly to refine the estimates obtained by different simplified methods future work will include solving the discharge estimation problem for a larger river system using data produced by the swot science simulator which is expected to be able to reproduce the actual spatial and temporal sampling patterns and a more realistic observation accuracy acknowledgments the authors would like to thank david dorchies for help
