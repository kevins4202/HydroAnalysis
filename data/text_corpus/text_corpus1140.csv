5700,multi linear analytical models are of high computational convenience to simulate the fluid production out of low permeability unconventional tight and shale reservoirs stimulated with multifractured horizontal wells mfhws but multi linear models cannot accurately describe the flow behavior in such reservoirs since the fluid flow around hydraulic fracture tips is not linear flow this creates barriers for the multi linear models to consider pressure stress dependent fracture and reservoir characteristics in addition multi linear models in the literature cannot consider or fully consider heterogeneity conditions including the reservoir heterogeneity and well completion heterogeneity in this study a composite model is developed to model the fluid flow in unconventional reservoirs with mfhws under various heterogeneity conditions in the composite model the reservoir is divided into sub systems and each sub system is further divided into flow regions the fluid flow in one flow region can be simply linear radial or source sink flow the composite model considers the pressure rate distribution characteristics beyond fracture tips with fast calculations the composite model is applicable to one or combinations of the following three heterogeneous conditions fractured horizontal wells with heterogeneous completions reservoir heterogeneity around the horizontal well and reservoir heterogeneity around a hydraulic fracture the model s applicability in heterogeneous reservoirs is demonstrated by the comparison with the trilinear flow model five region model and numerical solutions in this study solutions of the composite model are utilized to analyze two sets of production data from fractured horizontal wells in heterogeneous conditions keywords

introduction horizontal and slant wells have been applied in aquifer recovery and groundwater remediation for decades hantush and papadopulos 1962 stoeckl and houben 2012 now the advanced horizontal well drilling coupled with multi stage hydraulic fracturing treatments is widely applied to extract hydrocarbon out of low permeability unconventional reservoirs tight reservoirs and shale formations denney 2010 king 2014 multifractured horizontal wells mfhws in unconventional reservoirs not only enhance the hydrocarbon production but also heat the debate about risks imposed on overlying aquifers jasechko and perrone 2017 barth naftilan et al 2018 soeder 2018 therefore the knowledge of fluid flow dynamics in low permeability formations stimulated by mfhws is vital for both unconventional reservoir development and groundwater hydrology when a pressure difference is applied between the horizontal wellbore and in situ rocks the fluids e g hydrocarbon water stored in the naturally fractured intact porous rocks flow into hydraulic fractures then converge in the horizontal wellbore that is connected to the land surface the resulted production is heavily influenced by characteristics of rock matrix hydraulic fractures and or natural fractures low permeability unconventional reservoirs have complex characteristics complex rock mechanics such as time dependent inelasticity sone and zoback 2014 and stress sensitivity moghadam and chalaturnyk 2016 and intricate transport phenomena such as gas adsorption desorption pang et al 2017 and slip flow javadpour 2009 may coexist in many low permeability unconventional reservoirs in particular many unconventional formations are highly heterogeneous in reservoir properties including porosity permeability rock compressibility natural fractures etc zawila et al 2015 in multi stage hydraulic fracturing the heterogeneous formation reacts differently at different fracturing stages and the generated fracture network is also highly heterogeneous wang 2015 johri and zoback 2013 showed a multifractured mfhw in a heterogeneous shale reservoir where hydraulic fractures contributions to production are different at different stages thorough consideration of complex conditions including heterogeneity is extremely important for unconventional reservoir characterization and development existing numerical models mayerhofer et al 2006 medeiros et al 2008 cipolla et al 2011 myers 2012 freeman et al 2013 cohen et al 2014 reagan et al 2015 brownlow et al 2016 taherdangkoo et al 2019 are versatile in considering heterogeneity but considering such complex condition significantly increases the computational cost time of those numerical models and the non convergence problem and large calculation errors are much more likely to occur in numerical models with complex reservoir heterogeneity numerical models still have other disadvantages such as implicit functional relationships of key parameters and the inconvenience in iterative applications brown et al 2011 a plurality of analytical semi analytical models have been developed for horizontal wells with chen and raghavan 1997 yao et al 2013 huang et al 2015 or without zhan 2002 sun and zhan 2006 wang et al 2014 huang et al 2016 liang et al 2017 wang and zhan 2017 hydraulic fractures analytical models can provide fast and accurate calculations identify fluid transport mechanisms verify numerical models and support parametric inversion but analytical models are rarely applicable in complex reservoir conditions such as strong heterogeneity and stress sensitivity so a model would be in demand if it can shorten calculation time provide explicit functional relationships as well as keep the key flow characteristics under complex reservoir heterogeneity conditions the idea of decomposing a formation into discrete parts of independent properties provides possibilities for constructing aforementioned heterogeneous models such idea is not restricted in petroleum engineering the analytic element method strack 2003 majumder and eldho 2019 boundary element method wang et al 2018 and image well theory huang and yeh 2016 are applied to divide heterogeneous aquifers into individual zones with irregular boundaries for a stimulated unconventional reservoir the boundary around a mfhw is usually considered to have regular shapes because of tight horizontal well spacing in the literature radial composite models consider the unconventional formation as a radial composite system that consists of two zones the stimulated reservoir volume srv and the outer intact zone zhao et al 2014 ren and guo 2017 the mfhw is located at the center of radial srv zone fig 1a in fact the hydrocarbon produced out of a mfhw mainly comes from the srv mayerhofer et al 2010 and the reservoir heterogeneity around a mfhw has significant influence on the mfhw production behavior but radial composite analytical semi analytical models in the literature cannot describe such reservoir heterogeneity cinco ley and samaniego v 1981 and guppy et al 1981 first showed the idea of regarding a stimulated reservoir as combinations of different flow regions they developed a bilinear analytical model which combines two rectangular linear flow regions fig 1b here the linear flow refers to the flow with the directions of flow lines parallel each other on the formation plane zhuang 2013 in fig 1b each flow region can have different characterises such as permeability porosity etc lee and brockenbrough 1986 further developed a trilinear flow model for the fractured vertical well by coupling one fracture linear flow region and two formation linear flow regions ozkan et al 2009 and brown et al 2011 proposed that the trilinear model also preserves the key characteristics of fluid flow towards a mfhw in unconventional reservoirs fig 1c in fig 1c the fluid flows in both outer regions beyond fracture tips and inner regions are assumed to be linear stalgorova and mattar 2013 extended the trilinear flow model to a five region model fig 1d in fig 1d region 1 adjacent to the hydraulic fracture region usually has higher permeability than regions 2 4 both trilinear and five region models assume that the production behavior of each hydraulic fracture is the same as other fractures along the wellbore zeng et al 2018 built a seven region model for hydraulic fractures that partially penetrate the target formation wang et al 2015 and yuan et al 2015 improved the trilinear and five region models with considering fractal permeability stress sensitivity and non darcy flow with simple flow equations for each region above multi linear models have advantages in fast calculations and applicability in certain reservoir heterogeneity conditions but those multi linear models in the literature are still limited in two aspects most of the multi linear models assume that the production behavior of each fracture stage is the same but in heterogeneous reservoirs hydraulic fractures contributions to production may be different at different stages in addition the multi linear models all assume that the fluid flow in each region is linear flow but the flow converging towards hydraulic fracture tips is no longer linear flow and more fluids tend to flow toward fracture tips when a high density network of hydraulic fractures is created along a horizontal wellbore in the simulfrac and zipperfrac treatments sesetty and ghassemi 2015 existing multi linear models become inapplicable in describing the flow behavior in formations beyond fracture tips which further weakens their capability in considering pressure stress dependent phenomena such as stress sensitive reservoir permeability in the future to overcome the limitations as well as reserve the advantages this study extends and generalizes the multi linear models with the idea of decomposition the reservoir is regarded as combinations of several sub systems and each sub subsystem is further composed of flow regions the fluid flow in regions can be linear flow radial flow or flow from continuous source sink by coupling solutions of the fluid flow in each region this study finally gives solutions of the production from a mfhw this paper focuses on the application of our composite model in heterogeneous reservoirs in the future this methodology will be applied to model the flow behavior in reservoirs with mfhws under the influnece of stress sensitivity slip flow and gas adsorption desorption 2 mathematical modeling 2 1 background fig 2 gives an example of a mfhw in an unconventional reservoir for the reservoir in both fig 2 and composite models three assumptions are made i the reservoir which contributes to production is simplified as a cuboid with dimension l w h ii the fluid flow behavior inside the horizontal well is ignored and iii all hydraulic fractures are simplified to be vertical bi wing perpendicular to the horizontal wellbore and fully penetrate the target formation in fig 2 the horizontal wellbore is located at the center line and all hydraulic fractures are set to be symmetrical with respect to the wellbore for simplicity in fact the composite methodology in this study is applicable when hydraulic fractures are not symmetrical and or the horizontal wellbore is off the center line in fig 2 the i th hydraulic fracture has fracture half length xfi width wfi permeability kfi and conductivity kfiwfi hydraulic fractures are not equally spaced along the wellbore table 1 lists the details of well and reservoir characteristics in fig 2 furthermore the time td and pressure pd d for dimensionless calculated in this study are dimensionless in respect to real time t and pressure p 1a t d η ref l ref 2 t η ref k ref ϕ ref μ c tref 1b p d 2 π k ref h q ref b o μ p ini p here kref ϕref ctref qref and lref are selected as the reference reservoir permeability reservoir porosity reservoir total compressibility production rate and length for the dimensionless definition respectively appendix a further lists the detailed definitions of all dimensionless variables in this study with aforementioned assumption the three dimensional 3d flow in x y and z directions can be fully represented by the two dimensional 2d distribution in x and y directions fig 3 displays the pressure and streamlines distributions in x and y directions at the dimensionless time td 0 0025 0 025 and 0 1 when the mfhw of fig 2 is producing in a homogeneous reservoir the dimensionless pressure and streamlines are calculated based on the analytical model of yao et al 2013 when the mfhw is producing with constant rate the pressure keeps decreasing and the dimensionless pressure becomes greater the streamlines show that each hydraulic fracture controls a part of the reservoir in which the fluid only flows towards the hydraulic fracture the part of the reservoir that a hydraulic fracture controls is defined as a sub system with all closed boundaries and without flow contributions from other sub systems usually the sub system boundaries are curved however straight dash lines in fig 3 can still represent key parts of the boundaries the sub system boundaries hardly move along the wellbore during production therefore the reservoir in fig 3 can be simplified as six sub systems with fixed straight boundaries inspired by the multi linear models in figs 1c 1d each sub system controlled by a hydraulic fracture can be further divided into several regions and each region has one kind of simple fluid flow take sub systems 2 124 m 220 m in x direction and 5 390 m 465 m in x direction in fig 3 for example the formation 124 m 220 m in x direction 120 m 160 m in y direction beyond the fracture tip of sub system 2 can be represented by a region with fluid converging towards the tip the formation 179 m 220 m in x direction 80 m 120 m in y direction on the right part of sub system 2 can be regarded as one region with x direction linear flow to the fracture plane similarly a region with x direction linear flow towards the fracture plane can describe the formation 124 m 179 m in x direction 80 m 120 m in y direction on the left part of sub system 2 and the half fracture in sub system 2 can be simplified as a region with y direction linear flow towards the wellbore y 80 m for the sub system 5 the formation 390 434 m in x direction 112 m 160 m in y direction beyond the fracture tip is approximated by a region with y direction linear flow which is different from the region with converging flow in sub system 2 2 2 basic flow regions in a reservoir stimulated with mfhws each sub system is regarded as combinations of different flow regions five types of basic flow regions are summarized 1 source sink region 2 radial flow region 4 x direction linear flow region 4 y direction linear flow region and 5 hydraulic fracture region in this study all the 3d flow regions are reduced to 2d representations for simplicity 2 2 1 source sink region in the source sink flow region all fluids flow toward a continuous line source sink from all directions but the fluid contribution from each direction may be different fig 4a shows the basic flow region with the source sink at point a in a 2d map all boundaries of this region at x 0 a and y 0 b are closed the 2d dimensionless governing equation for the

a region with linear flows in x direction there are four boundaries i iv in the linear flow region the fluid flows out of this region through the boundary i other three boundaries can be closed or open to fluid from adjacent regions the boundaries ii and iv can receive flows from adjacent y direction linear flow regions while the boundary iii allows the fluid from adjacent x direction regions

works of serra et al 1983 and brown et al 2011 2 3 region coupling in a sub system combinations of basic flow regions are various in one sub system but there is one guideline of coupling regions the pressure and or flow rates should be same at the interface of two adjacent regions figs 1b 1d give three kinds of region combinations in the literature fig 5 lists another four kinds of region coupling in this study in fig 5a a sub system is comprised of four regions i iv region i is a source sink region regions ii and iii are x direction linear flow regions and region iv is the fracture region the flow rate out of point a in region i is equal to that into the fracture tip of region iv and the pressure at point b in region i is equal to that at the fracture tip in region iv the fluid out of regions ii and iii enters the fracture through planes c and d the hydraulic fracture region iv receives fluid from all other three regions and conducts the flow into the wellbore in fig 5b there are also two x direction linear flow regions regions ii and iii and one hydraulic fracture region region iv different from fig 5a region i in fig 5b is a radial flow region the flow rate and pressure at inner boundary r rw in region i equal those at the fracture tip in region iv the flow rate at outer boundary r re is set to be zero appendix b 1 gives the coupling equations for figs 5a and 5b fig 5c shows that in one sub system there could be one source sink region one hydraulic fracture region and multiple x and y direction linear flow regions fig 5d demonstrates that a sub system could also comprise one hydraulic fracture region multiple x direction linear flow regions and multiple radial flow regions appendix b 3 lists equations for region coupling in figs 5c 5d for a

in supplementary material lists the procedure of determining these parameters for best model performance 2 4 sub system coupling fig 6 shows one sub system combination for the 6 stage mfhw in fig 2 the sub system boundaries should be determined for sub system coupling theoretically any two adjacent sub systems should have same pressure all the time at the shared boundary this provides a basis for the sub system boundary determination sub system boundaries in this study are chosen to minimize the pressure difference of adjacent sub systems at the shared boundaries appendix d in supplementary material gives the detailed procedure of determining boundaries for sub systems when the pressure drop is ignored along the horizontal wellbore the pressure at all the fracture wellbore intersections should be the same under either constant pressure or constant rate production conditions 14 p wfd p 1 f d y 0 d p 2 f d y 0 d p nfd y 0 d by equalizing the pressure of i th and i 1 th

from laplace domain to the qid and pifd in real time domain fig 7 displays the flow chart of a composite model development for a heterogeneous reservoir stimulated by a fractured horizontal well the input parameters of this composite model include reservoir and hydraulic fracture conditions when the maximum half length xfmax in all hydraulic fractures is too small compared with the reservoir i e xfmax y 2 y 0 0 1 the pseudo radial flow late radial flow will occur in the reservoir and this is not handled by the composite model firstly the composite model determines x direction linear regions and boundaries xl xr for all sub systems appendix d then for the formation beyond a fracture tip the flow region selections vs xr xl y 2 y 1 are based on a series of comparisons between this study and analytical numerical software results if xr xl y 2 y 1 is smaller than 1 2 y direction linear flow regions should be applied beyond fracture tips x direction regions should be selected beyond fracture tips when xr xl y 2 y 1 is larger than 5 radial and source sink flow regions are feasible when xr xl y 2 y 1 is in the range 1 2 5 the region coupling beyond fracture tips could be further refined according to the reservoir heterogeneity conditions after all regions are set xb rw and re are calculated for each sub system appendix c finally eq 18 or eq 19 is constructed and solved 3 model verification in many field cases hydraulic fractures along a horizontal wellbore have different fracture properties ambrose et al 2011 nobakht et al 2013 in this section our composite model calculates the pressure behavior of a mfhw with heterogeneous completion under constant rate condition table 2 lists characteristics of a reservoir with a 10 stage fractured horizontal well that are selected based on the database provided by shelley et al 2014 2015 fig 8 shows the well s transient dimensionless bottomhole pressure and pressure derivative calculated by the composite model the semi analytical model of yao et al 2013 and the numerical model of the commercial software kappa workstation the composite model results match well with the semi analytical model and the kappa workstation model in fig 8 the pressure derivative curves show a unit slope black dash dot line when td is bigger than 0 05 it demonstrates that the pressure transient has reached reservoir boundaries and the pseudo steady state pss flow starts fig 9 further compares the rate contribution of each fracture calculated by this composite model and the analytical model yao et al 2013 at td 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 the close match between the two models demonstrates that the decomposition solution scheme in section 2 works well for the mfhws with heterogeneous completion the knowledge of fracture production distribution along a horizontal wellbore gives guidance for future treatments for example fig 9 shows the low rate contribution from no 8 and 9 fractures accordingly refracturing may be necessary to access the untapped hydrocarbon in zones between no 7 and 10 hydraulic fractures 4 model applicability above all the composite methodology and composite models do have limitations as discussed in section 2 4 reservoirs with xfmax y 2 y 0 0 1 are out of the composite methodology s scope in addition all hydraulic fractures in this study are assumed to be orthogonal regarding to the horizontal wellbore but the composite methodology s applicability for fractures that deviate heavily from the orthogonal direction has not been validated yet the composite methodology and composite modes are applicable in complex heterogeneity conditions many mfhws have heterogeneous completion along the kilometer length horizontal wellbore and it is common for a horizontal well to go through zones with different reservoir properties such as porosity ϕ permeability k etc hydraulic fracturing treatments along the horizontal wellbore could reactivate existing natural fractures which results in higher permeability in the formation adjacent to fractures as validated in section 3 the proposed composite methodology is applicable when the mfhw has a heterogeneous completion in this section the composite methodology s applicability in heterogeneous reservoirs is discussed in details 4 1 reservoir heterogeneity along the horizontal wellbore in heterogeneous unconventional reservoirs reservoir properties can be different along the horizontal wellbore medeiros et al 2010 used the boundary element method and green s functions to consider the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on the production decline different from medeiros et al s method this composite model is fast in the calculation and applicable to complex heterogeneous conditions in a composite model each sub system can have a set of reservoirs properties that is different from other sub systems table 3 gives the information of the reservoir with a 10 stage fractured horizontal well fractures with xf 70 m are equally spaced along the wellbore a high permeability zone with length 160 m width 300 m and permeability 0 1md exists in the reservoir and the second stage hydraulic fracture is located at the center of the high permeability zone fig 10 compares the dimensionless pressure pd and pressure derivative dpd dlntd in constant rate condition calculated by the composite model red circles and the numerical simulation of kappa workstation black triangles the good agreement between the two model results verifies that the composite model is applicable when zones with different reservoir characteristics exist along the horizontal wellbore the composite model s computation takes 10 s which smaller than that taken by many commercial software the calculation speed up becomes more pronounced when more fracture are created along the wellbore fig 10 also applies a homogeneous numerical model in kappa workstation to match the calculated pressure behavior of the heterogeneous case black lines in fig 10 are the best match results of a homogeneous model with reservoir permeability k 0 012md there exists obvious discrepancy in pressure derivative curves between the heterogeneous and best match homogeneous cases when td is in 0 1 1 it is concluded that homogeneous models cannot fully evaluate and predict the production behavior of mfhws in heterogeneous reservoirs 4 2 reservoir heterogeneity around a hydraulic fracture the reservoir heterogeneity around a hydraulic fracture has significant influence on mfhws production behavior usually hydraulic fracturing treatments increase the permeability of the formation around hydraulic fractures but fracturing treatments can also cause damage to the vicinal formation and reduce its permeability these heterogeneity conditions can be represented in the composite model by setting different reservoir properties in different regions of one sub system for simplicity only heterogeneity inside one sub system is considered therefore a single stage fractured horizontal well is studied in this section the reservoir stimulated with hydraulic fracture is symmetric in respect to the horizontal wellbore and fig 5a shows the half of the reservoir the trilinear and five region models are also applicable for the single stage fractured horizontal well in fig 5a the permeability of regions ii and iii is set to be different from that of region i table 4 lists the detailed reservoir and well information fig 11 shows the dimensionless pressure pd calculated by the composite model trilinear model brown et al 2011 five region model stalgorova and mattar 2013 and numerical model in kappa workstation when the reservoir permeability is higher around the fracture the results of our composite model lines the trilinear model triangles and five region model circles agree well with the numerical model in kappa workstation and and both the composite model and kappa workstation take 5 s in computation when the reservoir permeability around the fracture is lower neither the trilinear model nor the five region model can match the numerical results after td 1 while the composite model solid green line shows good agreement with the pressure curve calculated by kappa workstation fig 12 gives the reason by showing the comparison of pressure distribution between this composite model and kappa workstation numerical model when the reservoir around the hydraulic fracture has lower permeability the composite model gives a pressure distribution very close to that of numerical solutions at td 10 the composite methodology and composite models can describe more complex heterogeneity around a hydraulic fracture as shown in figs 5c and 5d there could be more than two regions on the left or right of a hydraulic fracture and the composite model works well when each of these regions has a different combination of reservoir properties such as permeability k porosity ϕ and compressibility ct etc 5 field examples composite models generate type curves q vs t and pwf vs t field data analysis with type curves is applied to estimate unknown reservoir and fracture properties two sets of field production data are discussed in this study one is for a mfhw with heterogeneous completion the other is for a mfhw with reservoir heterogeneity around hydraulic fractures 5 1 no 1 field case the data in no 1 field case are taken from grieser et al 2009 for a fractured horizontal well in the barnett shale the well was stimulated by hydraulic fracturing treatments in two stages three perforations in the first stage and two perforations in the second each perforation is assumed to create one hydraulic fracture microseism summary reports estimated the half length of each individual fracture reservoir properties are based on published average values zhao et al 2006 browker 2006 table 5 summarizes the reservoir and wellbore data the reservoir is assumed as homogeneous and flowing bottomhole pressure pwf is constant first two fractures conductivities were kept same since they are in the same stage and so do the other three fractures a composite model with five sub systems is applied and each sub system is divided into regions as in fig 5b a set of type curves q vs t is generated based on different fracture conductivities fig 13 shows the best matching type curve red solid line with the production rate the fracture conductivities were estimated as 1 md ft for the first two fractures and 5 md ft for the other three fractures the type curve matches reasonably well with field data through the entire production time at very early times the production rates remain flat this is a common behavior in shale gas wells and is usually attributed to liquid loading in the wellbore brown et al 2011 in the log log plot the production rates data show a 1 2 slope formation linear flow which starts from the 400th day dash line 5 2 no 2 field case the production data in no 2 field case are taken from wei et al 2015 for a fractured horizontal well in sichuan basin china the well was completed with 12 stage fracturing treatments and each stage was perforated with four clusters table 6 lists the reservoir and wellbore information fig 14 shows the production pressure and rates during 809 days production for accurate production analysis wei et al calculated the material balance time t mba and the modified pseudopressure m p with the method of nobakht et al 2011 the effects of adsorbed gas and apparent permeability in the shale reservoir were considered in t mba and m p furthermore in the transient pressure analysis the pseudopressure data were normalized to include the variation of production rate with time fig 15a shows the rate normalized pseudopressure rnp data vs t mba in fig 15a three flow regimes can be identified 1 linear flow from t mba 1st day to t mba 41st day 2 transitional flow from t mba 42nd day to t mba 310th day and 3 linear flow from t imba 311st day to t mba 2130th day such production behavior demonstrates the existence of reservoir heterogeneity the reservoir diffusivity in the vicinity of hydraulic fractures is lower than that of the formation a little far from fractures one of the reasons for this phenomenon could be the damage to the vicinal reservoir by the hydraulic fracturing fluid when it flows back towards the horizontal wellbore and the reservoir diffusivity becomes higher at further regions when the stimulation effect of hydraulic fracturing exceeds damage effect a single hydraulic fracture is assumed to exist at one stage and a 12 stage fractured horizontal well model is applied for the type curve matching the composite model has 12 sub systems and conditions of all sub systems are assumed to be the same each sub system is divided into eight regions fig 15b the porosity in all regions except hydraulic fracture region is assumed to be the same fig 15a shows the matching results for the rnp data overall the match is satisfactory the fracture conductivity kfwf is determined as 100 md ft the width of damaged zone is estimated as 25ft the ratio of fracture vicinity s reservoir permeability over stimulated reservoir permeability is 0 125 fig 15a also shows the production behavior of the fractured horizontal well when the reservoir is assumed as homogeneous dashed line the calculated rnp with homogeneous reservoir assumption gravely deviates from the field data in transitional and linear flow regimes the two field examples demonstrate the composite model s applicability in production analysis of mfhws in heterogeneous reservoirs type curve matching based on composite models in this study depends on the quality and quantity of available production and well data the analysis results may become different if more field data are provided 6 conclusions in this paper a practical semi analytical composite methodology and composite models are developed for heterogeneous reservoirs with mfhws the principal contributions in this work are summarized as below 1 the composite methodology considers characteristics of pressure distribution in reservoirs stimulated with mfhws and extends and generalizes the multi linear models in the literature the composite model is fast in calculation and becomes a good alternative to multi linear semi analytical analytical and numerical models 2 the composite model is validated and applicable for heterogeneous completion along the horizontal wellbore reservoir heterogeneity along the horizontal wellbore and reservoir heterogeneity around hydraulic fractures 3 the composite model is ready to incorporate complex flow phenomena such as stress sensitivity and slip flow because of the model s simple governing equations and its ability in mapping the pressure distribution beyond fracture tips 4 although nonuniqueness is a problem in heterogeneous reservoirs matching production data with type curves from the composite model gives good estimations of reservoir and fracture

5700,multi linear analytical models are of high computational convenience to simulate the fluid production out of low permeability unconventional tight and shale reservoirs stimulated with multifractured horizontal wells mfhws but multi linear models cannot accurately describe the flow behavior in such reservoirs since the fluid flow around hydraulic fracture tips is not linear flow this creates barriers for the multi linear models to consider pressure stress dependent fracture and reservoir characteristics in addition multi linear models in the literature cannot consider or fully consider heterogeneity conditions including the reservoir heterogeneity and well completion heterogeneity in this study a composite model is developed to model the fluid flow in unconventional reservoirs with mfhws under various heterogeneity conditions in the composite model the reservoir is divided into sub systems and each sub system is further divided into flow regions the fluid flow in one flow region can be simply linear radial or source sink flow the composite model considers the pressure rate distribution characteristics beyond fracture tips with fast calculations the composite model is applicable to one or combinations of the following three heterogeneous conditions fractured horizontal wells with heterogeneous completions reservoir heterogeneity around the horizontal well and reservoir heterogeneity around a hydraulic fracture the model s applicability in heterogeneous reservoirs is demonstrated by the comparison with the trilinear flow model five region model and numerical solutions in this study solutions of the composite model are utilized to analyze two sets of production data from fractured horizontal wells in heterogeneous conditions keywords

introduction horizontal and slant wells have been applied in aquifer recovery and groundwater remediation for decades hantush and papadopulos 1962 stoeckl and houben 2012 now the advanced horizontal well drilling coupled with multi stage hydraulic fracturing treatments is widely applied to extract hydrocarbon out of low permeability unconventional reservoirs tight reservoirs and shale formations denney 2010 king 2014 multifractured horizontal wells mfhws in unconventional reservoirs not only enhance the hydrocarbon production but also heat the debate about risks imposed on overlying aquifers jasechko and perrone 2017 barth naftilan et al 2018 soeder 2018 therefore the knowledge of fluid flow dynamics in low permeability formations stimulated by mfhws is vital for both unconventional reservoir development and groundwater hydrology when a pressure difference is applied between the horizontal wellbore and in situ rocks the fluids e g hydrocarbon water stored in the naturally fractured intact porous rocks flow into hydraulic fractures then converge in the horizontal wellbore that is connected to the land surface the resulted production is heavily influenced by characteristics of rock matrix hydraulic fractures and or natural fractures low permeability unconventional reservoirs have complex characteristics complex rock mechanics such as time dependent inelasticity sone and zoback 2014 and stress sensitivity moghadam and chalaturnyk 2016 and intricate transport phenomena such as gas adsorption desorption pang et al 2017 and slip flow javadpour 2009 may coexist in many low permeability unconventional reservoirs in particular many unconventional formations are highly heterogeneous in reservoir properties including porosity permeability rock compressibility natural fractures etc zawila et al 2015 in multi stage hydraulic fracturing the heterogeneous formation reacts differently at different fracturing stages and the generated fracture network is also highly heterogeneous wang 2015 johri and zoback 2013 showed a multifractured mfhw in a heterogeneous shale reservoir where hydraulic fractures contributions to production are different at different stages thorough consideration of complex conditions including heterogeneity is extremely important for unconventional reservoir characterization and development existing numerical models mayerhofer et al 2006 medeiros et al 2008 cipolla et al 2011 myers 2012 freeman et al 2013 cohen et al 2014 reagan et al 2015 brownlow et al 2016 taherdangkoo et al 2019 are versatile in considering heterogeneity but considering such complex condition significantly increases the computational cost time of those numerical models and the non convergence problem and large calculation errors are much more likely to occur in numerical models with complex reservoir heterogeneity numerical models still have other disadvantages such as implicit functional relationships of key parameters and the inconvenience in iterative applications brown et al 2011 a plurality of analytical semi analytical models have been developed for horizontal wells with chen and raghavan 1997 yao et al 2013 huang et al 2015 or without zhan 2002 sun and zhan 2006 wang et al 2014 huang et al 2016 liang et al 2017 wang and zhan 2017 hydraulic fractures analytical models can provide fast and accurate calculations identify fluid transport mechanisms verify numerical models and support parametric inversion but analytical models are rarely applicable in complex reservoir conditions such as strong heterogeneity and stress sensitivity so a model would be in demand if it can shorten calculation time provide explicit functional relationships as well as keep the key flow characteristics under complex reservoir heterogeneity conditions the idea of decomposing a formation into discrete parts of independent properties provides possibilities for constructing aforementioned heterogeneous models such idea is not restricted in petroleum engineering the analytic element method strack 2003 majumder and eldho 2019 boundary element method wang et al 2018 and image well theory huang and yeh 2016 are applied to divide heterogeneous aquifers into individual zones with irregular boundaries for a stimulated unconventional reservoir the boundary around a mfhw is usually considered to have regular shapes because of tight horizontal well spacing in the literature radial composite models consider the unconventional formation as a radial composite system that consists of two zones the stimulated reservoir volume srv and the outer intact zone zhao et al 2014 ren and guo 2017 the mfhw is located at the center of radial srv zone fig 1a in fact the hydrocarbon produced out of a mfhw mainly comes from the srv mayerhofer et al 2010 and the reservoir heterogeneity around a mfhw has significant influence on the mfhw production behavior but radial composite analytical semi analytical models in the literature cannot describe such reservoir heterogeneity cinco ley and samaniego v 1981 and guppy et al 1981 first showed the idea of regarding a stimulated reservoir as combinations of different flow regions they developed a bilinear analytical model which combines two rectangular linear flow regions fig 1b here the linear flow refers to the flow with the directions of flow lines parallel each other on the formation plane zhuang 2013 in fig 1b each flow region can have different characterises such as permeability porosity etc lee and brockenbrough 1986 further developed a trilinear flow model for the fractured vertical well by coupling one fracture linear flow region and two formation linear flow regions ozkan et al 2009 and brown et al 2011 proposed that the trilinear model also preserves the key characteristics of fluid flow towards a mfhw in unconventional reservoirs fig 1c in fig 1c the fluid flows in both outer regions beyond fracture tips and inner regions are assumed to be linear stalgorova and mattar 2013 extended the trilinear flow model to a five region model fig 1d in fig 1d region 1 adjacent to the hydraulic fracture region usually has higher permeability than regions 2 4 both trilinear and five region models assume that the production behavior of each hydraulic fracture is the same as other fractures along the wellbore zeng et al 2018 built a seven region model for hydraulic fractures that partially penetrate the target formation wang et al 2015 and yuan et al 2015 improved the trilinear and five region models with considering fractal permeability stress sensitivity and non darcy flow with simple flow equations for each region above multi linear models have advantages in fast calculations and applicability in certain reservoir heterogeneity conditions but those multi linear models in the literature are still limited in two aspects most of the multi linear models assume that the production behavior of each fracture stage is the same but in heterogeneous reservoirs hydraulic fractures contributions to production may be different at different stages in addition the multi linear models all assume that the fluid flow in each region is linear flow but the flow converging towards hydraulic fracture tips is no longer linear flow and more fluids tend to flow toward fracture tips when a high density network of hydraulic fractures is created along a horizontal wellbore in the simulfrac and zipperfrac treatments sesetty and ghassemi 2015 existing multi linear models become inapplicable in describing the flow behavior in formations beyond fracture tips which further weakens their capability in considering pressure stress dependent phenomena such as stress sensitive reservoir permeability in the future to overcome the limitations as well as reserve the advantages this study extends and generalizes the multi linear models with the idea of decomposition the reservoir is regarded as combinations of several sub systems and each sub subsystem is further composed of flow regions the fluid flow in regions can be linear flow radial flow or flow from continuous source sink by coupling solutions of the fluid flow in each region this study finally gives solutions of the production from a mfhw this paper focuses on the application of our composite model in heterogeneous reservoirs in the future this methodology will be applied to model the flow behavior in reservoirs with mfhws under the influnece of stress sensitivity slip flow and gas adsorption desorption 2 mathematical modeling 2 1 background fig 2 gives an example of a mfhw in an unconventional reservoir for the reservoir in both fig 2 and composite models three assumptions are made i the reservoir which contributes to production is simplified as a cuboid with dimension l w h ii the fluid flow behavior inside the horizontal well is ignored and iii all hydraulic fractures are simplified to be vertical bi wing perpendicular to the horizontal wellbore and fully penetrate the target formation in fig 2 the horizontal wellbore is located at the center line and all hydraulic fractures are set to be symmetrical with respect to the wellbore for simplicity in fact the composite methodology in this study is applicable when hydraulic fractures are not symmetrical and or the horizontal wellbore is off the center line in fig 2 the i th hydraulic fracture has fracture half length xfi width wfi permeability kfi and conductivity kfiwfi hydraulic fractures are not equally spaced along the wellbore table 1 lists the details of well and reservoir

ref ϕ ref μ c tref 1b p d 2 π k ref h q ref b o μ p ini p here kref ϕref ctref qref and lref are selected as the reference reservoir permeability reservoir porosity reservoir total compressibility production rate and length for the dimensionless definition respectively appendix a further lists the detailed definitions of all dimensionless variables in this study with aforementioned assumption the three dimensional 3d flow in x y and z directions can be fully represented by the two dimensional 2d distribution in x and y directions fig 3 displays the pressure and streamlines distributions in x and y directions at the dimensionless time td 0 0025 0 025 and 0 1 when the mfhw of fig 2 is producing in a homogeneous reservoir the dimensionless pressure and streamlines are calculated based on the analytical model of yao et al 2013 when the mfhw is producing with constant rate the pressure keeps decreasing and the dimensionless pressure becomes greater the streamlines show that each hydraulic fracture controls a part of the reservoir in which the fluid only flows towards the hydraulic fracture the part of the reservoir that a hydraulic fracture controls is defined as a sub system with all closed boundaries and without flow contributions from other sub systems usually the sub system boundaries are curved however straight dash lines in fig 3 can still represent key parts of the boundaries the sub system boundaries hardly move along the wellbore during production therefore the reservoir in fig 3 can be simplified as six sub systems with fixed straight boundaries inspired by the multi linear models in figs 1c 1d each sub system controlled by a hydraulic fracture can be further divided into several regions and each region has one kind of simple fluid flow take sub systems 2 124 m 220 m in x direction and 5 390 m 465 m in x direction in fig 3 for example the formation 124 m 220 m in x direction 120 m 160 m in y direction beyond the fracture tip of sub system 2 can be represented by a region with fluid converging towards the tip the formation 179 m 220 m in x direction 80 m 120 m in y direction on the right part of sub system 2 can be regarded as one region with x direction linear flow to the fracture plane similarly a region with x direction linear flow towards the fracture plane can describe the formation 124 m 179 m in x direction 80 m 120 m in y direction on the left part of sub system 2 and the half fracture in sub system 2 can be simplified as a region with y direction linear flow towards the wellbore y 80 m for the sub system 5 the formation 390 434 m in x direction 112 m 160 m in y direction beyond the fracture tip is approximated by a region with y direction linear flow which is different from the region with converging flow in sub system 2 2 2 basic flow regions in a reservoir stimulated with mfhws each sub system is regarded as combinations of different flow regions five types of basic flow regions are summarized 1 source sink region 2 radial flow region 4 x direction linear flow region 4 y direction linear flow region and 5 hydraulic fracture region in this study all the 3d flow regions are reduced to 2d representations for simplicity 2 2 1 source sink region in the source sink flow region all fluids flow toward a continuous line source sink from all directions but the fluid contribution from each direction may be different fig 4a shows the basic flow region with the source sink at point a in a 2d map all boundaries of this region at x 0 a and y 0 b are closed the 2d dimensionless governing equation for the

a region with linear flows in x direction there are four boundaries i iv in the linear flow region the fluid flows out of this region through the boundary i other three boundaries can be closed or open to fluid from adjacent regions the boundaries ii and iv can receive flows from adjacent y direction linear flow regions while the boundary iii allows the fluid from adjacent x direction regions

works of serra et al 1983 and brown et al 2011 2 3 region coupling in a sub system combinations of basic flow regions are various in one sub system but there is one guideline of coupling regions the pressure and or flow rates should be same at the interface of two adjacent regions figs 1b 1d give three kinds of region combinations in the literature fig 5 lists another four kinds of region coupling in this study in fig 5a a sub system is comprised of four regions i iv region i is a source sink region regions ii and iii are x direction linear flow regions and region iv is the fracture region the flow rate out of point a in region i is equal to that into the fracture tip of region iv and the pressure at point b in region i is equal to that at the fracture tip in region iv the fluid out of regions ii and iii enters the fracture through planes c and d the hydraulic fracture region iv receives fluid from all other three regions and conducts the flow into the wellbore in fig 5b there are also two x direction linear flow regions regions ii and iii and one hydraulic fracture region region iv different from fig 5a region i in fig 5b is a radial flow region the flow rate and pressure at inner boundary r rw in region i equal those at the fracture tip in region iv the flow rate at outer boundary r re is set to be zero appendix b 1 gives the coupling equations for figs 5a and 5b fig 5c shows that in one sub system there could be one source sink region one hydraulic fracture region and multiple x and y direction linear flow regions fig 5d demonstrates that a sub system

in supplementary material lists the procedure of determining these parameters for best model performance 2 4 sub system coupling fig 6 shows one sub system combination for the 6 stage mfhw in fig 2 the sub system boundaries should be determined for sub system coupling theoretically any two adjacent sub systems should have same pressure all the time at the shared boundary this provides a basis for the sub system boundary determination sub system boundaries in this study are chosen to minimize the pressure difference of adjacent sub systems at the shared boundaries appendix d in supplementary material gives the detailed procedure of determining boundaries for sub systems when the pressure drop is ignored along the horizontal wellbore the pressure at all the fracture wellbore

model in fig 8 the pressure derivative curves show a unit slope black dash dot line when td is bigger than 0 05 it demonstrates that the pressure transient has reached reservoir boundaries and the pseudo steady state pss flow starts fig 9 further compares the rate contribution of each fracture calculated by this composite model and the analytical model yao et al 2013 at td 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 the close match between the two models demonstrates that the decomposition solution scheme in section 2 works well for the mfhws with heterogeneous completion the knowledge of fracture production distribution along a horizontal wellbore gives guidance for future treatments for example fig 9 shows the low rate contribution from no 8 and 9 fractures accordingly refracturing may be necessary to access the untapped hydrocarbon in zones between no 7 and 10 hydraulic fractures 4 model applicability above all the composite methodology and composite models do have limitations as discussed in section 2 4 reservoirs with xfmax y 2 y 0 0 1 are out of the composite methodology s scope in addition all hydraulic fractures in this study are assumed to be orthogonal regarding to the horizontal wellbore but the composite methodology s applicability for fractures that deviate heavily from the orthogonal direction has not been validated yet the composite methodology and composite modes are applicable in complex heterogeneity conditions many mfhws have heterogeneous completion along the kilometer length horizontal wellbore and it is common for a horizontal well to go through zones with different reservoir properties such as porosity ϕ permeability k etc hydraulic fracturing treatments along the horizontal wellbore could reactivate existing natural fractures which results in higher permeability in the formation adjacent to fractures as validated in section 3 the proposed composite methodology is applicable when the mfhw has a heterogeneous completion in this section the composite methodology s applicability in heterogeneous reservoirs is discussed in details 4 1 reservoir heterogeneity along the horizontal wellbore in heterogeneous unconventional reservoirs reservoir properties can be different along the horizontal wellbore medeiros et al 2010 used the boundary element method and green s functions to consider the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on the production decline different from medeiros et al s method this composite model is fast in the calculation and applicable to complex heterogeneous conditions in a composite model each sub system can have a set of reservoirs properties that is different from other sub systems table 3 gives the information of the reservoir with a 10 stage fractured horizontal well fractures with xf 70 m are equally spaced along the wellbore a high permeability zone with length 160 m width 300 m and permeability 0 1md exists in the reservoir and the second stage hydraulic fracture is located at the center of the high permeability zone fig 10 compares the dimensionless pressure pd and pressure derivative dpd dlntd in constant rate condition calculated by the composite model red circles and the numerical simulation of kappa workstation black triangles the good agreement between the two model results verifies that the composite model is applicable when zones with different reservoir characteristics exist along the horizontal wellbore the composite model s computation takes 10 s which smaller than that taken by many commercial software the calculation speed up becomes more pronounced when more fracture are created along the wellbore fig 10 also applies a homogeneous numerical model in kappa workstation to match the calculated pressure behavior of the heterogeneous case black lines in fig 10 are the best match results of a homogeneous model with reservoir permeability k 0 012md there exists obvious discrepancy in pressure derivative curves between the heterogeneous and best match homogeneous cases when td is in 0 1 1 it is concluded that homogeneous models cannot fully evaluate and predict the production behavior of mfhws in heterogeneous reservoirs 4 2 reservoir heterogeneity around a hydraulic fracture the reservoir heterogeneity around a hydraulic fracture has significant influence on mfhws production behavior usually hydraulic fracturing treatments increase the permeability of the formation around hydraulic fractures but fracturing treatments can also cause damage to the vicinal formation and reduce its permeability these heterogeneity conditions can be represented in the composite model by setting different reservoir properties in different regions of one sub system for simplicity only heterogeneity inside one sub system is considered therefore a single stage fractured horizontal well is studied in this section the reservoir stimulated with hydraulic fracture is symmetric in respect to the horizontal wellbore and fig 5a shows the half of the reservoir the trilinear and five region models are also applicable for the single stage fractured horizontal well in fig 5a the permeability of regions ii and iii is set to be different from that of region i table 4 lists the detailed reservoir and well information fig 11 shows the dimensionless pressure pd calculated by the composite model trilinear model brown et al 2011 five region model stalgorova and mattar 2013 and numerical model in kappa workstation when the reservoir permeability is higher around the fracture the results of our composite model lines the trilinear model triangles and five region model circles agree well with the numerical model in kappa workstation and and both the composite model and kappa workstation take 5 s in computation when the reservoir permeability around the fracture is lower neither the trilinear model nor the five region model can match the numerical results after td 1 while the composite model solid green line shows good agreement with the pressure curve calculated by kappa workstation fig 12 gives the reason by showing the comparison of pressure distribution between this composite model and kappa workstation numerical model when the reservoir around the hydraulic fracture has lower permeability the composite model gives a pressure distribution very close to that of numerical solutions at td 10 the composite methodology and composite models can describe more complex heterogeneity around a hydraulic fracture as shown in figs 5c and 5d there could be more than two regions on the left or right of a hydraulic fracture and the composite model works well when each of these regions has a different combination of reservoir properties such as permeability k porosity ϕ and compressibility ct etc 5 field examples composite models generate type curves q vs t and pwf vs t field data analysis with type curves is applied to estimate unknown reservoir and fracture properties two sets of field production data are discussed in this study one is for a mfhw with heterogeneous completion the other is for a mfhw with reservoir heterogeneity around hydraulic fractures 5 1 no 1 field case the data in no 1 field case are taken from grieser et al 2009 for a fractured horizontal well in the barnett shale the well was stimulated by hydraulic fracturing treatments in two stages three perforations in the first stage and two perforations in the second each perforation is assumed to create one hydraulic fracture microseism summary reports estimated the half length of each individual fracture reservoir properties are based on published average values zhao et al 2006 browker 2006 table 5 summarizes the reservoir and wellbore data the reservoir is assumed as homogeneous and flowing bottomhole pressure pwf is constant first two fractures conductivities were kept same since they are in the same stage and so do the other three fractures a composite model with five sub systems is applied and each sub system is divided into regions as in fig 5b a set of type curves q vs t is generated based on different fracture conductivities fig 13 shows the best matching type curve red solid line with the production rate the fracture conductivities were estimated as 1 md ft for the first two fractures and 5 md ft for the other three fractures the type curve matches reasonably well with field data through the entire production time at very early times the production rates remain flat this is a common behavior in shale gas wells and is usually attributed to liquid loading in the wellbore brown et al 2011 in the log log plot the production rates data show a 1 2 slope formation linear flow which starts from the 400th day dash line 5 2 no 2 field case the production data in no 2 field case are taken from wei et al 2015 for a fractured horizontal well in sichuan basin china the well was completed with 12 stage fracturing treatments and each stage was perforated with four clusters table 6 lists the reservoir and wellbore information fig 14 shows the production pressure and rates during 809 days production for accurate production analysis wei et al calculated the material balance time t mba and the modified pseudopressure m p with the method of nobakht et al 2011 the effects of adsorbed gas and apparent permeability in the shale reservoir were considered in t mba and m p furthermore in the transient pressure analysis the pseudopressure data were normalized to include the variation of production rate with time fig 15a shows the rate normalized pseudopressure rnp data vs t mba in fig 15a three flow regimes can be identified 1 linear flow from t mba 1st day to t mba 41st day 2 transitional flow from t mba 42nd day to t mba 310th day and 3 linear flow from t imba 311st day to t mba 2130th day such production behavior demonstrates the existence of reservoir heterogeneity the reservoir diffusivity in the vicinity of hydraulic fractures is lower than that of the formation a little far from fractures one of the reasons for this phenomenon could be the damage to the vicinal reservoir by the hydraulic fracturing fluid when it flows back towards the horizontal wellbore and the reservoir diffusivity becomes higher at further regions when the stimulation effect of hydraulic fracturing exceeds damage effect a single hydraulic fracture is assumed to exist at one stage and a 12 stage fractured horizontal well model is applied for the type curve matching the composite model has 12 sub systems and conditions of all sub systems are assumed to be the same each sub system is divided into eight regions fig 15b the porosity in all regions except hydraulic fracture region is assumed to be the same fig 15a shows the matching results for the rnp data overall the match is satisfactory the fracture conductivity kfwf is determined as 100 md ft the width of damaged zone is estimated as 25ft the ratio of fracture vicinity s reservoir permeability over stimulated reservoir permeability is 0 125 fig 15a also shows the production behavior of the fractured horizontal well when the reservoir is assumed as homogeneous dashed line the calculated rnp with homogeneous reservoir assumption gravely deviates from the field data in transitional and linear flow regimes the two field examples demonstrate the composite model s applicability in production analysis of mfhws in heterogeneous reservoirs type curve matching based on composite models in this study depends on the quality and quantity of available production and well data the analysis results may become different if more field data are provided 6 conclusions in this paper a practical semi analytical composite methodology and composite models are developed for heterogeneous reservoirs with mfhws the principal contributions in this work are summarized as below 1 the composite methodology considers characteristics of pressure distribution in reservoirs stimulated with mfhws and extends and generalizes the multi linear models in the literature the composite model is fast in calculation and becomes a good alternative to multi linear semi analytical analytical and numerical models 2 the composite model is validated and applicable for heterogeneous completion along the horizontal wellbore reservoir heterogeneity along the horizontal wellbore and reservoir heterogeneity around hydraulic fractures 3 the composite model is ready to incorporate complex flow phenomena such as stress sensitivity and slip flow because of the model s simple governing equations and its ability in mapping the pressure distribution beyond fracture tips 4 although nonuniqueness is a problem in heterogeneous reservoirs matching production data with type curves from the composite model gives good estimations of reservoir and fracture

5701,the waterproof curtain that is used to block groundwater leaks occasionally during deep excavation and can have a harmful impact on the surroundings this study adopts a three dimensional 3d fluid solid coupled finite element model fem to analyze the impact due to a leakage in the waterproof curtain during excavation dewatering in the model both a user defined one dimensional leakage element and a solid leakage element are incorporated to simulate the leakage the leakage of the curtain in the soil is analysed by monitoring the variation in hydraulic conductivity the simulated results demonstrate that the leaking rate leaking volume groundwater drawdown and ground settlement are closely related to the hydraulic conductivity of the leakage point the results also show that the groundwater head outside the pit declines quickly when the leakage occurs but soil consolidation proceeds slowly in addition the characteristics of the soil that is adjacent to the leakage point also have a tangible effect on the groundwater head and ground settlement the hydraulic conductivity and deformation modulus of the soil has a significant effect on the ground settlement while the influence of the anisotropy of the soil is relatively low keywords waterproof curtain leakage groundwater drawdown ground settlement 1 introduction a large number of underground structures have already been constructed or are being constructed in the coastal regions of china in recent years to solve the problems related to a rapid growth in population as a consequence numerous excavation pits appear in the coastal region tan et al 2018 2019 xu et al 2014 2018 zhang et al 2018 2019 the quaternary soft deposits are distributed in these regions and the groundwater is characterized by a multi aquifer aquitard system with hydraulic connections between the aquifers wu et al 2017 ren et al 2018 atangana njock et al 2020 the groundwater head in the quaternary soft deposits is high and the excavations are usually below the groundwater head when the excavation is performed in these areas the groundwater has a great effect on the safety of the excavation pit shen et al 2017 xu et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 2019a b thus a combination of large diameter wells and waterproof curtains are often applied to lower the groundwater head inside the excavation pit in the course of the excavation pujades et al 2017 serrano juan et al 2017 wang et al 2017 2019a b however defects in the waterproof curtain are inevitable because of limitations in construction technology and poor construction quality wu et al 2015a b tan and lu 2017 fig 1 displays photographs of the leakage in a waterproof curtain above the excavation surface fig 1 a exhibits the water seepage induced by a slight leakage in the joints between the diaphragm walls in shanghai fig 1 b displays quicksand formed because of a hole at the corner joints between the diaphragm walls in tianjin wu et al 2018a b groundwater from outside the pit flows into the pit through these defects resulting in a decline of the groundwater head outside the pit and soil deformation additionally serious leakage may result in significant hazards e g ground settlement ground collapses building tilting and pipeline breaking etc pujades et al 2012 2016 conway 2016 liu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 which will cause high risk of city infrastructures lyu et al 2019 2020a b to prevent construction accidents and potential hazards related to leakage it is crucial to understand whether there is leakage in the waterproof curtain and the location of the leakage before excavation at present geophysical prospection is used to determine the leakage condition of the waterproof curtain such prospection methods include ultrasonic detection the resistivity method and the temperature tracer method paikowsky and chernauskas 2003 rausche 2004 the hydrogeological method known as the pumping test is also used to determine the condition of the waterproof curtain ross and beijin 1998 vilarrasa et al 2011 pujades et al 2012 wu et al 2015a in addition zheng et al 2014a simulated and investigated the mechanism of underground engineering disasters caused by water and soil erosion through laboratory tests they performed the particle flow code computational fluid dynamics pfc cfd to study the variation of the leakage process of sand and water which discovered a critical width of gap in the leakage process when the leakage of the waterproof curtain occurs above the excavation surface even a slight leakage may have an effect on the surrounding environment therefore it is necessary to analyze the effect of leakage of the waterproof curtain on soils deformation and ground settlement in general numerical methods such as two step calculation method partially coupled method and fully coupled method are applied to predict the ground settlement caused by a decline of groundwater head for the two step method variation of groundwater head is firstly calculated by seepage model and then the deformation of soil is computed based on the groundwater head gambolati and freeze 1973 zhou et al 2010 predicted the ground settlement resulted from excavation dewatering in shanghai the partially coupled method couples the groundwater flow model and settlement model together by some parameters such as storage coefficient and compressibility coefficient hydraulic conductivity and pore ratio this approach is generally based on terzaghi s consolidation theory shen and xu 2011 used the three dimensional seepage flow model and one dimensional soil consolidation model to predict the land subsidence caused by groundwater withdrawal in shanghai wu et al 2015a b employed the same method to calculated the ground settlement resulted by excavation dewatering in hangzhou the fully coupled method is based on biot s consolidation theory biot 1941 gambolati et al 1974 first used this model to analyze the land subsidence in italy in the 1970s zeng et al 2018 2019a applied a modified cam clay model to study the surrounding ground deformation caused by the pre excavation dewatering li et al 2019 employed duncan zhang model and kozeny carman equation to explore the land subsidence induced by both load of high rise buildings and groundwater withdrawal in nantong china the above researches mainly focused on groundwater withdrawal induced the ground settlement there are few studies of the effect of leakage of waterproof curtain on ground settlement this study evaluates the effect of leakage above the excavation surface by numerical simulation excluding the quicksand hazard the objectives of this study are as follows i to study the influence of leakage in a waterproof curtain on groundwater head and ground settlement by the fully coupled model and ii to investigate the effect of soil properties on the groundwater head and ground settlement 2 numerical simulation of leakage of waterproof curtain 2 1 problem description to understand the effect of leakage in a waterproof curtain a circular excavation pit is selected as show in fig 2 a the analysis is conducted based on typical strata in shanghai that are common in the coastal regions of china xu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 there is one phreatic aquifer labeled as aq0 and there are two confined aquifers labeled as aqi and aqii that are separated by three aquitards labeled as adi adii and adiii the excavation pit has a diameter of 36 m and a waterproof curtain has been inserted into aqii fig 2 b depicts the leakage in the waterproof curtain above the excavation surface as shown in the figure the excavation surface has reached aqi and the groundwater head in aqi inside the pit is about 1 m below the excavation surface because the waterproof curtain has cut off aqi completely the groundwater head outside the pit does not decrease as the waterproof curtain is working properly the leakage occurring in the waterproof curtain fig 2 b changes the seepage direction and seepage path for the groundwater groundwater outside the pit enters the excavation pit through the leakage point resulting in the decline of the groundwater head moreover if the leakage worsens sand outside the pit will come into the pit with the groundwater under the action of the seepage force and soil pressure leading to the formation of quicksand therefore it is necessary to solve the leakage problem in a timely manner once the leakage occurs 2 2 equations for numerical modelling 2 2 1 biot consolidation theory let us suppose that the deformation of the soil skeleton is linearly elastic and small and that the groundwater seepage obeys darcy s law in saturated media based on the biot consolidation theory the three dimensional fluid solid coupling equations are expressed as follows biot 1941 bear 1979 1 g 2 w x g 1 2 ν x w x x w y y w z z u x 0 g 2 w y g 1 2 ν y w x x w y y w z z u y 0 g 2 w z g 1 2 ν z w x x w y y w z z u z γ t t w x x w y y w

soil and water and kx ky kz hydraulic conductivity along thex y and z directions 2 2 2 constitutive model in this study two elastic plastic models i e the mohr coulomb and modified cam clay model are adopted to calculate the soil deformation for different soil types the mohr coulomb model is mainly used for granular materials and is widely applied in geotechnical engineering the yield function is given by 2 r mc q p tan φ c 0 where φ internal friction angle c effective cohesion q deviatoric stress p mean effective stress and rmc is calculated as follows 3 r mc 1 3 cos φ sin θ π 3 1 3 cos θ π 3 tan φ where θ is defined as cos 3 θ j 3 3 q 3 and j 3 the third invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor the modified cam clay model is widely used in clayey soil as proposed by roscoe and burland 1968 based on the triaxial test of normal consolidation and clay that exhibits low over consolidation the model adopts an elliptical yield surface and the associated flow rule and it uses the plastic volume strain as the hardening parameter the yield equation is expressed as 4 1 q 2 m 2 p 2 p p a e 1 e 0 λ κ ε ν p where m critical stress ratio e0 initial void ratio pa initial pressure λ slope of normal consolidation line κ flow stress ratio ε ν p plastic volumetric strain q deviatoric stress and p mean effective stress 2 2 3 initial and boundary conditions the initial displacement and pore water pressure are expressed as 5 w x y z t t 0 0 6 u x y z t t 0 u 0 x y z where u0 x y z initial pore water pressure at point x y z the initial geostatic stress is expressed as 7 σ z γ t z σ x k n γ

x y z t is the constant head on boundary and θ is the angle between the outward normal and vertical line of the free surface qγ is the flow per unit area through the boundary г4 and μ is the specific yield of soil in addition г1 pore water pressure boundary condition and г4 free surface boundary condition 2 3 specifications for numerical modelling 2 3 1 calculation range this study adopted the finite element analysis software abaqus to simulate the influence of leakage in a waterproof curtain on groundwater seepage and ground settlement based on the strata in shanghai the model field is 1000 m long 1000 m wide and 60 m deep fig 3 shows the finite element mesh fem because the mesh is symmetric fig 3 a displays half of the 3d mesh horizontally the mesh is dense in the excavation pit and around the waterproof curtain it gradually becomes sparse from the excavation outwards vertically the model is divided into 17 layers based on the soil property excavation depth and insertion depth of the waterproof curtain in each layer the numbers of elements and nodes are 2829 and 2920 respectively 2 3 2 initial states and boundary conditions the groundwater head in shanghai was uniform a long time ago groundwater head in confined aquifers gradually declined from 1860 to 2000 due to the groundwater withdrawal sgeaeb 2002 in recent years groundwater heads in confined aquifers rises continuously with decreasing exploitation and increasing recharge in some places the water head in aqi and aqii is close to that in aq0 smbplr 2012 2016 let us suppose that the initial water head in aquifers is 1 0 m below the ground surface and the pore water pressure at the phreatic surface is zero the calculation range is large enough that the model boundary is unaffected by the leakage in the waterproof curtain therefore the head boundary condition of the model is set as a constant head that is equal to the initial water head pore water pressure at the inner side of the waterproof curtain is set as zero after the excavation of the foundation pit the initial displacement is set to be zero in the model the displacement boundary conditions have a fixed value of zero at the bottom of the model they vary freely at the surface while only displacements along the direction of gravity are allowed around the perimeter 2 3 3 simulation of leakage when the leakage occurs in the waterproof curtain groundwater outside the pit flows into the excavation through the point of leakage in real life engineering situations the shape of the surface of the leakage may be linear or planar for example the joint between cutoff walls may have linear leakage and the holes in the walls may have planar leakage the leakage point is modeled so that it is equivalent to a leakage element with a given volume in the fem model ideally the waterproof curtain is impervious so that a very low value of hydraulic conductivity is assigned in the fem model the degree of leakage is simulated by assigning different hydraulic conductivities to the leakage element in this paper two kinds of leakage elements are used solid leakage elements and self defined elements fig 4 presents the simulation of the leakage element a solid leakage element and b self defined leakage element the waterproof curtains are represented by orange elements and the soils inside and outside the excavation pit are represented by white elements as shown in fig 4 b if there is no leakage in the waterproof curtain there are 6 elements when a small leakage area occurs in the waterproof curtain individual mesh should be used to simulate the leakage the element needs to be divided into small elements due to the small leakage area as shown in fig 4 a the existence of the leakage makes the meth increase from one layer to two layers and the number of the element increases to 18 consequently the number of the node also increases that is using the solid element for a small leakage surface leads to a large increase in the number of nodes and elements for the whole model and makes the meshing more complicated moreover too many elements will significantly increase calculation time and risk of non convergence therefore a self defined leakage element which is a two node element is applied to model the small leakage which is shown in fig 4 b the self defined leakage element is a one dimension linear element which shares the nodes with the solid elements of waterproof curtain the number of elements and nodes are unchanged there are two degrees of freedom of each node axial displacement and pore pressure the size of the leakage is determined by giving a value of area except for leakage area hydraulic conductivity and the elasticity modulus are also assigned to a self defined element the leakage degree of waterproof curtain is modeled by variation of the hydraulic conductivity of the leakage element and the mechanical effect can be reduced by changing the elasticity modulus solid leakage elements are used in modeling planar leakages with large areas and self defined elements are applied in punctate or linear leakages in the simulation the location of the leakage point is shown in fig 3 b 2 3 4 parameters for constitutive relationships different constitutive models can be used to calculate the soil deformation induced by groundwater drawdown in general constitutive models are divided into three types elastic model viscoelastic model and elastoplastic models yao et al 2008 2009 shin et al 2012 yin et al 2017 2018 zheng et al 2018 2019 the selection of the constitutive model is dependent on the soil property and stress history in this study the mohr coulomb model and modified cam clay model are selected based on the characteristics of the multi aquifer aquitard system in the coastal region of china the mohr coulomb model is used in silty sand and silt while the modified cam clay model is used in clay table 1 presents the thickness of each layer and the mechanical parameters used in the model the values of the parameters are based on published works in the literature luo et al 2008 shen et al 2015 wu et al 2016 table 2 tabulated the parameters used in the mohr coulomb and modified cam clay model parameters including the deformation modulus internal friction angle and effective cohesion are needed in the mohr coulomb model for the modified cam clay model the compression modulus slope of the compression line slope of the swelling recompression line internal friction angle critical stress ratio over consolidation ratio and the pre consolidation pressure are necessary to obtain the correct values of the parameters please refer to the literature zheng et al 2014b tan et al 2017 2018 zhang et al 2018b the hydraulic conductivity of the waterproof curtain uses the value of concrete 1 10 9 m s wu et al 2016 the elasticity modulus of the waterproof curtain is set as 6900 mpa which is the value of the elastic modulus of the reinforced concrete after reduction liao et al 2008 3 results and analysis to investigate the effect of the leakage of the waterproof curtain on groundwater seepage and settlement five cases are calculated by the simulations table 3 lists the calculation scheme of the leakage it is assumed that the waterproof curtain leaks at a depth of 28 m in aqi with a leakage area of 0 00005 m2 the leakage area is so small that a self defined element is applied several numerical results have been obtained from the 3d fluid solid model by varying the hydraulic conductivity of the leakage point labeled as kl 3 1 leaking rate and volume when leakage occurs in the waterproof curtain groundwater flows towards the leakage point the location closer to the leakage point shows a larger seepage velocity of groundwater the maximum seepage velocity appears near the leakage point fig 5 presents the leakage rate plotted against elapsed time at the leakage point as seen in fig 5 the leakage rate is the largest at the commencement of the leakage it decreases from the maximum value and finally reaches a stable state after 100 min of leakage moreover the leaking rate increases with the increase of kl for instance when kl equals to 1 10 2 m s case 1 the maximum leaking rate is 1 93 10 3 m3 s and when kl equals to 1 10 6 m s case 5 the maximum value is 1 52 10 5 m3 s fig 6 shows the relationship between the leaking volume and the hydraulic conductivity of the leakage point after leaking one day with an increase of kl the leaking volume increases when kl is less than 1 10 5 m s the leaked volume is relatively small due to the low permeability of the leakage point when kl is greater than 1 10 3 m s the leakage point is in complete leaky thus the relationship between the leaking volume and kl is similar to an s shape curve it can be seen from the figure that the leaking volume increases slowly when kl is less than 1 10 5 m s and increases quickly as kl increases from 1 10 5 to 1 10 3 m s when kl is greater than 1 10 3 m s the leaking volume increases slowly with the increase of kl the leaking volume can reach 140 m3 per day as kl is equal to 1 10 2 m s 3 2 groundwater head fig 7 shows the drawdown contour in the confined aquifer i after the groundwater seepage becomes steady for the four cases described in table 1 as shown in the figure with an increase of kl the influence of leakage on the groundwater increases let us suppose that the leakage effect can be ignored because the drawdown in aqi is less than 0 1 m when kl is equal to 1 10 2 m s case 1 the influence range is 280 m when kl equals to 1 10 5 m s case 4 the influence range is 45 m fig 8 illustrates a sectional view of the drawdown in the confined aquifer i along section i i from fig 8 the maximum groundwater drawdown is at the leakage point and the drawdown decreases quickly with an increase in the distance to the excavation pit on the opposite side the variation of groundwater head is relative small for case 1 the maximum drawdown outside the pit caused by leakage is 6 98 m and the drawdown reduces by 15 and 62 7 at a distance of 1 m and 5 m from the leakage point respectively fig 9 depicts the groundwater drawdown in aqi versus time in case 2 at three points take point g1 for example the variation of groundwater drawdown is divided into three periods i period 1 in the early leakage period groundwater declines rapidly and the duration of this period is very short about 4 464 min groundwater drawdown at the end of this period reached 69 of the final drawdown ii period 2 groundwater drawdown declines slower than that in period 1 and the duration is almost 0 15 day the drawdown accounts for 94 of the final drawdown at the end of period 2 iii period 3 the groundwater head decreases slowly and finally reaches a stable state in one day the results indicate that groundwater head near the leakage point will decline rapidly in a short time in the case that the leakage occurs in the waterproof curtain let the center of the excavation pit be the coordinate origin orientation 1 points towards the leakage point orientation 2 is opposite to orientation 1 and orientation 3 is perpendicular to orientations 1 and 2 from fig 9 the drawdown along orientation 1 is greater that along the other two orientations the drawdown along orientation 2 is the minimum 3 3 ground settlement fig 10 depicts the contours of the ground settlement around the excavation pit after a leak lasting a hundred days and representing the four cases it can be observed from the figure that the ground settlement caused by the leakage increases with an increase of kl the maximum extent of the ground settlement is 415 m for case 1 and 30 m for case 4 on the assumption of a settlement of 1 mm based on the different assumptions of settlement and drawdown the influence range of the ground settlement is different from that of groundwater drawdown fig 11 presents a sectional view of the ground settlement after a 100 day leakage for five cases it can be found that the maximum settlement appears near the leakage point the settlement decreases with increasing distance from the excavation pit although the groundwater head on the opposite side has minor changes the ground settlement still occurs for example when kl is equal to 1 10 2 m s the maximum drawdown along orientations 1 and 2 see fig 8 is 6 98 m and 0 46 m see fig 7 and the settlements at the corresponding location are 12 mm and 7 mm respectively fig 12 presents the maximum variation in ground settlement over time for five cases the ground settlement increases with time different from the variation of groundwater drawdown the variation of ground settlement can be divided into four periods taking case 1 as an example we have period 1 when the leaked time labelled as t is less than 0 035 days the ground settlement increases slowly period 2 when t is between 0 035 and 1 05 days the settlement increases quickly at the end of period 2 the settlement reaches 42 of the final settlement such a settlement is mainly induced by the elastic deformation of soil during period 3 when t is greater than 1 05 and less than 29 days the settlement increases rapidly and it accounts for 95 of the final settlement after leaking for 12 days elastic deformation is generated in the early stage of this period and plastic deformation is generated in the later stage period 4 during this period when t is greater than 29 and less than 70 days the ground settlement increases very slowly and the consolidation of the soil has almost finished after leaking for 70 days by comparing fig 9 to fig 12 we find that the groundwater head in aqi declines quickly as soon as the leakage occurs however soil consolidation proceeds slowly when the groundwater head reaches a stable state after leaking for 1 day the ground settlement only reaches 41 percent of the final settlement since the soil in aqi is silty sand which has high permeability groundwater head reaches steady quickly for other aquifers e g aq0 and aqii variation of groundwater head is relatively small due to the weak permeability of aquitards that is the leakage recharge from aq0 and aqii is small thus the long term leakage of waterproof curtain has little effect on groundwater head in aqi moreover when leakage occurs in waterproof curtain in aqi head difference between aqi and adi aqi and adii appears in a short time this makes water head in adi and adii decline slowly until it reaches steady so the deformation caused by groundwater drawdown of silty clay in adi and adii increases gradually ground settlement is the sum of deformations of all layers thus the variation of ground settlement is different from the variation of groundwater head this in turn indicates that when the leakage occurs in the waterproof curtain not only does consolidation occur in the soil where the leakage occurs but also in the soil above it in addition if the leakage is in the sand layer with a large area quicksand may occur resulting in ground collapse thus when leakage occurs in the waterproof curtain of the excavation pit it is very important to take measures to plug the leak as soon as possible 4 discussion in this part the influence of soil properties on the ground settlement around the leakage point is discussed these properties include the soil permeability anisotropy and the deformation modulus it is assumed that the leakage occurs at a depth of 24 67 to 28 m in the waterproof curtain with a length of 3 23 m and the corresponding area is 10 74 m2 the leakage area is large and therefore a solid element is used to simulate the leakage which is different from the former simulation with a small leakage area in addition leakage location of the barrier is also been discussed with area of 3 97 m2 the hydraulic conductivity of the leakage point for all cases is 1 10 5 m s 4 1 hydraulic conductivity of soil to understand the influence of soil permeability on groundwater seepage and ground settlement an fem model with different values of ki hydraulic conductivity of aqi is developed and applied let ki 0 be the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of aqi in shanghai sandy soil further the ratio j of the hydraulic conductivities of aqi in the vertical and horizontal directions is 0 358 except for the value of ki the other parameters including j remain unchanged and the value of ki varies from 0 001 to 10 times the value of ki 0 fig 13 a plots a sectional view of the groundwater drawdown at section i i in aqi and fig 13 b is the enlarged view as shown in fig 13 the variation of groundwater drawdown has the following features i when the distance d from the leakage of the waterproof curtain is less than 4 m the drawdown outside the pit decreases with an increase of ki ii when the distance d is between 4 m and 40 m the drawdown increases with an increase of ki in the case that ki is less than 0 1 ki 0 and the results are the opposite as ki is greater than 0 1 ki 0 iii in the case that ki equals to 0 1 ki 0 the drawdown changes a lot as d is between 40 and 120 m iv when ki is less than 0 1 ki 0 the influence range of the leakage on groundwater seepage increases with an increase of ki while when ki is greater than 0 1 ki 0 the result reverses the results imply that the groundwater drawdown is significant as the hydraulic conductivity of the soil where the leakage of waterproof curtain occurs is close to 0 1 ki 0 thus it is important to make the waterproof curtain intact in engineering excavation particularly at the soil with the hydraulic conductivity of 0 1 ki 0 fig 13 c shows the contour of the pore water pressure for four cases at section ii ii the effect of the hydraulic conductivity of the soil on pore water pressure near the leakage is well illustrated by the figure when ki is equal to 0 001 ki 0 the pore water pressure near the leakage decreases quickly but pore water pressure changes little a bit farther from the leakage when ki equals to 0 1 ki0 the pore water pressure shows the largest variation among the four cases when ki equals to 10 ki0 pore water pressure changes the least although the hydraulic conductivity at the leakage point of the waterproof curtain is the same the groundwater flow into the excavation pit through the leakage varies greatly under different soils fig 14 presents the relationship between the leaked volume and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil after a leak lasting one day with an increase of ki the leaked volume increases if we let j be equal to ki divided by ki0 we see that the leaked volume is very small when j is less than 0 01 and increases quickly when j increases from 0 01 to 10 fig 15 a presents a sectional view of the ground settlement at section i i with different j after a leak lasting 100 days as seen in the figure the maximum ground settlement outside the pit caused by the leakage occurs as ki equals to 0 1 ki0 from fig 13 b we find that when ki is equals to 0 001 ki0 the drawdown is the largest among all cases however the influence of leakage on groundwater is very small as shown in fig 13 b for the case of 0 01 ki0 it has the similar characteristics while the leakage influence on groundwater seepage is large in the case of 0 1 ki0 thus the maximum ground settlement occurs at 0 1 ki0 in the case that ki is less than 0 1 ki 0 we observe that the bigger the ki the larger the ground settlement and the greater the difference between the maximum and the minimum values of ground settlement however when ki is greater than 0 1 ki 0 the result is the opposite from fig 13 a and 15 a it is found that the variation of the drawdown vs soil permeability and that of the ground settlement vs soil permeability are not the same to understand the relationship between soil deformation and hydraulic conductivity of aqi fig 15 b presents the soil deformation of different layers at the distance of 6 m to the leakage location as seen in the figure values of clay deformation in adii are positive and values of soil deformation in adi aqi and ground settlement are negative the positive values indicate that the soil expands and the negative values mean the soil compresses this phenomenon is due to the mandel effect near the boundary of clay strata the phenomenon of soil expansion has been found in excavation dewatering at a metro station in shanghai luan et al 2010 in porous medium studies the mandel cryer effect describes non monotonic pore water pressure evolution in response to loading or to changed stress conditions mandel 1953 cryer 1963 rice et al 1978 since the hydraulic conductivity of adi is very low groundwater head of adi changes little and the deformation of adi is very small for adii the hydraulic conductivity is greater than that of adi thus groundwater in adii moves upward to aqi as leakage occurs in aqi if the hydraulic conductivity is too small the groundwater in adii is difficult to flow into the excavation pit through the leakage therefore the soil expands and the value of expansion decreases with the increase of hydraulic conductivity of aqi moreover the ground settlement is less than the deformation of aqi due to the expansion of clay in adi when ki equals to ki0 the ground settlement is almost the same as the deformation of aqi it s important to note that the soil deformation in adi and adii may be compressed negative values as the hydraulic conductivities of these two layers are relatively big the results indicate that the ground settlement is closely related to soil properties in addition fig 15 b also illustrates the relationship between the ground settlement st and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil ki we observe from the figure that there seems to be a v shaped relationship between st and j the closer the value of j to 0 1 the greater is the value of the settlement the settlement increases rapidly when j is less than 0 03 and increases slowly as j increases from 0 03 to 0 1 on the other hand the settlement decreases gradually when j is greater than 0 1 and is less than 0 2 and decreases quickly when j is greater than 0 2 4 2 anisotropy of aquifer suppose that only the value of vertical hydraulic conductivity of aqi labeled as kv is changed and all other parameters are maintained unchanged four cases are calculated in the simulation and the ratio of the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities in aqi is 0 1 0 4 0 7 and 1 respectively values of the ground settlement have been obtained from the fem by varying kv fig 16 presents the calculated ground settlement values with different kv fig 16 a shows a sectional view of the ground settlement fig 16 b shows the relationship between the maximum ground settlement and the anisotropy of the aquifer it can be seen from the figure that the ground settlement decreases with a decrease of kv but the difference is not significant 4 3 deformation modulus of soil the influence of the modulus of deformation on the ground settlement is analyzed using the fem model it is assumed that all the other parameters remain constant besides the deformation modulus of aqi labeled as e 0 because the hydraulic conductivity of soils and the hydraulic conductivity of the waterproof curtain leakage are identical in all models the variation in groundwater drawdown at different e 0 is the same fig 17 a plots a sectional ground settlement with different e 0 in fig 17 a with an increase in deformation modulus of aqi the settlement increases fig 17 b illustrates the relationship between the maximum settlement and the deformation modulus suppose that deformation modulus of aqi in shanghai is represented by e0i and f is the ratio of e0 to e0i the ground settlement decreases rapidly as f is less than 1 decreases gradually as f varies from 1 to 5 and decreases very slowly as e0 becomes greater than 5 from fig 17 b the maximum value of the ground settlement is 14 6 mm when e0 is equal to e0i the value is 5 2 mm when e0 is equal to 10 e0i and the value is 4 8 mm when e0 is equal to 50 e0i thus the deformation in aqi caused by leakage is 9 8 mm and the total amount of compression in other soils is 4 8 mm this phenomenon indicates that the groundwater drawdown of the soil layer near the leakage leads to the drawdown of the overlying and underlying soil layers the drawdown depends on the permeability of the aquitards therefore besides the soil at the leakage point other soil layers also deform the deformation modulus of soil affects the ground settlement 4 4 leakage of waterproof curtain at different locations to know the influence of leakage location of waterproof curtain on drawdown and ground settlement four cases are considered it is assumed that the four cases have the same area and different locations along the vertical direction in aqi the leakage location is at 21 22 m 24 25 m 27 28 m and 30 31 m respectively fig 18 presents calculated values at section i i with different leakage location a groundwater drawdown and b ground settlement as seen in the figure the influence of leakage on groundwater drawdown and ground settlement increases with the increase of the leakage depth however the difference of drawdown and settlement between 27 and 28 m leakage and 30 to 31 m leakage is little when the leakage location is at the top of aqi the maximum drawdown and ground settlement caused by the leakage of waterproof curtain are 3 51 m and 6 5 mm and the corresponding values are 4 55 m and 8 9 mm respectively moreover comparing with the groundwater drawdown there is great different in ground settlement with different leakage location the reason is that as the leakage of waterproof curtain occurs in aqi groundwater head both in adi and adii varies and consolidation settlement occurs in all soil layers therefore the variation of ground settlement is larger than the variation of drawdown 5 conclusions this study presented a 3d fluid solid coupled model to investigate the impact on surroundings due to a leakage in the waterproof curtain over the excavation surface the following conclusions are reached 1 when a leakage occurs in the waterproof curtain the seepage path and seepage direction outside of the pit change both the leakage rate and leakage volume increase with an increase in the hydraulic conductivity at the leakage point kl the relationship between the leakage volume per day and kl is follows an s shaped curve as the volume of the leakage is constant with an increase of kl the leakage volume per day increases slowly when kl is less than 1 10 5 m s for values of kl equal to or greater than 1 10 5 m s it increases quickly finally the leakage volume grows slowly and becomes stable when kl is 1 10 3 m s 2 the groundwater head outside the pit declines when the groundwater enters into the excavation pit through the leakage points which leads to a ground settlement the groundwater head outside the pit and the ground settlement are related to the hydraulic conductivity of the leakage points the leakage area and leakage length the variation of groundwater drawdown outside the pit with time manifests itself as a decline very quickly at the beginning and reaches stability slowly and steadily in comparison with the time taken for the decline in the groundwater head soil consolidation occurs over a longer time both elastic and plastic deformations of the soil result over time in addition soil consolidation occurs in soils where the groundwater head varies thus less groundwater drawdown may cause a large ground settlement 3 the properties of the soil affecting ground settlement at the point of leakage of the waterproof curtain are its hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and its deformation modulus the hydraulic conductivity of the soil has a great effect on the pore water pressure leaking volume and the ground settlement the relationship between the settlement and hydraulic conductivity of soil presents a v shaped graph the settlement caused by leakage reaches the maximum when kl is equal to 4 86 10 6 m s the anisotropy of the soil has a lesser effect on the settlement the bigger the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the soil the larger is the settlement the deformation modulus of the soil has a little influence on the groundwater drawdown but greatly affects the settlement with an increase of the deformation modulus the settlement decreases quickly at the beginning then decreases gradually

5701,the waterproof curtain that is used to block groundwater leaks occasionally during deep excavation and can have a harmful impact on the surroundings this study adopts a three dimensional 3d fluid solid coupled finite element model fem to analyze the impact due to a leakage in the waterproof curtain during excavation dewatering in the model both a user defined one dimensional leakage element and a solid leakage element are incorporated to simulate the leakage the leakage of the curtain in the soil is analysed by monitoring the variation in hydraulic conductivity the simulated results demonstrate that the leaking rate leaking volume groundwater drawdown and ground settlement are closely related to the hydraulic conductivity of the leakage point the results also show that the groundwater head outside the pit declines quickly when the leakage occurs but soil consolidation proceeds slowly in addition the characteristics of the soil that is adjacent to the leakage point also have a tangible effect on the groundwater head and ground settlement the hydraulic conductivity and deformation modulus of the soil has a significant effect on the ground settlement while the influence of the anisotropy of the soil is relatively low keywords waterproof curtain leakage groundwater drawdown ground settlement 1 introduction a large number of underground structures have already been constructed or are being constructed in the coastal regions of china in recent years to solve the problems related to a rapid growth in population as a consequence numerous excavation pits appear in the coastal region tan et al 2018 2019 xu et al 2014 2018 zhang et al 2018 2019 the quaternary soft deposits are distributed in these regions and the groundwater is characterized by a multi aquifer aquitard system with hydraulic connections between the aquifers wu et al 2017 ren et al 2018 atangana njock et al 2020 the groundwater head in the quaternary soft deposits is high and the excavations are usually below the groundwater head when the excavation is performed in these areas the groundwater has a great effect on the safety of the excavation pit shen et al 2017 xu et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 2019a b thus a combination of large diameter wells and waterproof curtains are often applied to lower the groundwater head inside the excavation pit in the course of the excavation pujades et al 2017 serrano juan et al 2017 wang et al 2017 2019a b however defects in the waterproof curtain are inevitable because of limitations in construction technology and poor construction quality wu et al 2015a b tan and lu 2017 fig 1 displays photographs of the leakage in a waterproof curtain above the excavation surface fig 1 a exhibits the water seepage induced by a slight leakage in the joints between the diaphragm walls in shanghai fig 1 b displays quicksand formed because of a hole at the corner joints between the diaphragm walls in tianjin wu et al 2018a b groundwater from outside the pit flows into the pit through these defects resulting in a decline of the groundwater head outside the pit and soil deformation additionally serious leakage may result in significant hazards e g ground settlement ground collapses building tilting and pipeline breaking etc pujades et al 2012 2016 conway 2016 liu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 which will cause high risk of city infrastructures lyu et al 2019 2020a b to prevent construction accidents and potential hazards related to leakage it is crucial to understand whether there is leakage in the waterproof curtain and the location of the leakage before excavation at present geophysical prospection is used to determine the leakage condition of the waterproof curtain such prospection methods include ultrasonic detection the resistivity method and the temperature tracer method paikowsky and chernauskas 2003 rausche 2004 the hydrogeological method known as the pumping test is also used to determine the condition of the waterproof curtain ross and beijin 1998 vilarrasa et al 2011 pujades et al 2012 wu et al 2015a in addition zheng et al 2014a simulated and investigated the mechanism of underground engineering disasters caused by water and soil erosion through laboratory tests they performed the particle flow code computational fluid dynamics pfc cfd to study the variation of the leakage process of sand and water which discovered a critical width of gap in the leakage process when the leakage of the waterproof curtain occurs above the excavation surface even a slight leakage may have an effect on the surrounding environment therefore it is necessary to analyze the effect of leakage of the waterproof curtain on soils deformation and ground settlement in general numerical methods such as two step calculation method partially coupled method and fully coupled method are applied to predict the ground settlement caused by a decline of groundwater head for the two step method variation of groundwater head is firstly calculated by seepage model and then the deformation of soil is computed based on the groundwater head gambolati and freeze 1973 zhou et al 2010 predicted the ground settlement resulted from excavation dewatering in shanghai the partially coupled method couples the groundwater flow model and settlement model together by some parameters such as storage coefficient and compressibility coefficient hydraulic conductivity and pore ratio this approach is generally based on terzaghi s consolidation theory shen and xu 2011 used the three dimensional seepage flow model and one dimensional soil consolidation model to predict the land subsidence caused by groundwater withdrawal in shanghai wu et al 2015a b employed the same method to calculated the ground settlement resulted by excavation dewatering in hangzhou the fully coupled method is based on biot s consolidation theory biot 1941 gambolati et al 1974 first used this model to analyze the land subsidence in italy in the 1970s zeng et al 2018 2019a applied a modified cam clay model to study the surrounding ground deformation caused by the pre excavation dewatering li et al 2019 employed duncan zhang model and kozeny carman equation to explore the land subsidence induced by both load of high rise buildings and groundwater withdrawal in nantong china the above researches mainly focused on groundwater withdrawal induced the ground settlement there are few studies of the effect of leakage of waterproof curtain on ground settlement this study evaluates the effect of leakage above the excavation surface by numerical simulation excluding the quicksand hazard the objectives of this study are as follows i to study the influence of leakage in a waterproof curtain on groundwater head and ground settlement by the fully coupled model and ii to investigate the effect of soil properties on the groundwater head and ground settlement 2 numerical simulation of leakage of waterproof curtain 2 1 problem description to understand the effect of leakage in a waterproof curtain a circular excavation pit is selected as show in fig 2 a the analysis is conducted based on typical strata in shanghai that are common in the coastal regions of china xu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 there is one phreatic aquifer labeled as aq0 and there are two confined aquifers labeled as aqi and aqii that are separated by three aquitards labeled as adi adii and adiii the excavation pit has a diameter of 36 m and a waterproof curtain has been inserted into aqii fig 2 b depicts the leakage in the waterproof curtain above the excavation surface as shown in the figure the excavation surface has reached aqi and the groundwater head in aqi inside the pit is about 1 m below the excavation surface because the waterproof curtain has cut off aqi completely the groundwater head outside the pit does not decrease as the waterproof curtain is working properly the leakage occurring in the waterproof curtain fig 2 b changes the seepage direction and seepage path for the groundwater groundwater outside the pit enters the excavation pit through the leakage point resulting in the decline of the groundwater head moreover if the leakage worsens sand outside the pit will come into the pit with the groundwater under the action of the seepage force and soil pressure leading to the formation of quicksand therefore it is necessary to solve the leakage problem in a timely manner once the leakage occurs 2 2 equations for numerical modelling 2 2 1 biot consolidation theory let us suppose that the deformation of the soil skeleton is linearly elastic and small and that the groundwater seepage obeys darcy s law in saturated media based on the biot consolidation theory the three dimensional fluid solid coupling

soil and water and kx ky kz hydraulic conductivity along thex y and z directions 2 2 2 constitutive model in this study two elastic plastic models i e the mohr coulomb and modified cam clay model are adopted to calculate the soil deformation for different soil types the mohr coulomb model is mainly used for granular materials and is widely applied in geotechnical engineering the yield function is given by 2 r mc q p tan φ c 0 where φ internal friction angle c effective cohesion q deviatoric stress p mean effective stress and rmc is calculated as follows 3 r mc 1 3 cos φ sin θ π 3 1 3 cos θ π 3 tan φ where θ is defined as cos 3 θ j 3 3 q 3 and j 3 the third invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor the modified cam clay model is widely used in clayey soil as proposed by roscoe and burland 1968 based on the triaxial test of normal consolidation and clay that exhibits low over consolidation the model adopts an elliptical yield surface and the associated flow rule and it uses the plastic volume strain as the hardening parameter the yield equation is expressed as 4 1 q 2 m 2 p 2 p p a e 1 e 0 λ κ ε ν p where m critical stress ratio e0 initial void ratio pa initial pressure λ slope of normal consolidation line κ flow stress ratio ε ν p plastic volumetric strain q deviatoric stress and p mean effective stress 2 2 3 initial and boundary conditions the initial displacement and pore water pressure are expressed as 5 w x y z t t 0 0 6 u x y z t t 0 u 0 x y z where u0 x y z initial pore water pressure at point x y z the initial geostatic stress is expressed as 7 σ z γ t z σ x k n γ

yield of soil in addition г1 pore water pressure boundary condition and г4 free surface boundary condition 2 3 specifications for numerical modelling 2 3 1 calculation range this study adopted the finite element analysis software abaqus to simulate the influence of leakage in a waterproof curtain on groundwater seepage and ground settlement based on the strata in shanghai the model field is 1000 m long 1000 m wide and 60 m deep fig 3 shows the finite element mesh fem because the mesh is symmetric fig 3 a displays half of the 3d mesh horizontally the mesh is dense in the excavation pit and around the waterproof curtain it gradually becomes sparse from the excavation outwards vertically the model is divided into 17 layers based on the soil property excavation depth and insertion depth of the waterproof curtain in each layer the numbers of elements and nodes are 2829 and 2920 respectively 2 3 2 initial states and boundary conditions the groundwater head in shanghai was uniform a long time ago groundwater head in confined aquifers gradually declined from 1860 to 2000 due to the groundwater withdrawal sgeaeb 2002 in recent years groundwater heads in confined aquifers rises continuously with decreasing exploitation and increasing recharge in some places the water head in aqi and aqii is close to that in aq0 smbplr 2012 2016 let us suppose that the initial water head in aquifers is 1 0 m below the ground surface and the pore water pressure at the phreatic surface is zero the calculation range is large enough that the model boundary is unaffected by the leakage in the waterproof curtain therefore the head boundary condition of the model is set as a constant head that is equal to the initial water head pore water pressure at the inner side of the waterproof curtain is set as zero after the excavation of the foundation pit the initial displacement is set to be zero in the model the displacement boundary conditions have a fixed value of zero at the bottom of the model they vary freely at the surface while only displacements along the direction of gravity are allowed around the perimeter 2 3 3 simulation of leakage when the leakage occurs in the waterproof curtain groundwater outside the pit flows into the excavation through the point of leakage in real life engineering situations the shape of the surface of the leakage may be linear or planar for example the joint between cutoff walls may have linear leakage and the holes in the walls may have planar leakage the leakage point is modeled so that it is equivalent to a leakage element with a given volume in the fem model ideally the waterproof curtain is impervious so that a very low value of hydraulic conductivity is assigned in the fem model the degree of leakage is simulated by assigning different hydraulic conductivities to the leakage element in this paper two kinds of leakage elements are used solid leakage elements and self defined elements fig 4 presents the simulation of the leakage element a solid leakage element and b self defined leakage element the waterproof curtains are represented by orange elements and the soils inside and outside the excavation pit are represented by white elements as shown in fig 4 b if there is no leakage in the waterproof curtain there are 6 elements when a small leakage area occurs in the waterproof curtain individual mesh should be used to simulate the leakage the element needs to be divided into small elements due to the small leakage area as shown in fig 4 a the existence of the leakage makes the meth increase from one layer to two layers and the number of the element increases to 18 consequently the number of the node also increases that is using the solid element for a small leakage surface leads to a large increase in the number of nodes and elements for the whole model and makes the meshing more complicated moreover too many elements will significantly increase calculation time and risk of non convergence therefore a self defined leakage element which is a two node element is applied to model the small leakage which is shown in fig 4 b the self defined leakage element is a one dimension linear element which shares the nodes with the solid elements of waterproof curtain the number of elements and nodes are unchanged there are two degrees of freedom of each node axial displacement and pore pressure the size of the leakage is determined by giving a value of area except for leakage area hydraulic conductivity and the elasticity modulus are also assigned to a self defined element the leakage degree of waterproof curtain is modeled by variation of the hydraulic conductivity of the leakage element and the mechanical effect can be reduced by changing the elasticity modulus solid leakage elements are used in modeling planar leakages with large areas and self defined elements are applied in punctate or linear leakages in the simulation the location of the leakage point is shown in fig 3 b 2 3 4 parameters for constitutive relationships different constitutive models can be used to calculate the soil deformation induced by groundwater drawdown in general constitutive models are divided into three types elastic model viscoelastic model and elastoplastic models yao et al 2008 2009 shin et al 2012 yin et al 2017 2018 zheng et al 2018 2019 the selection of the constitutive model is dependent on the soil property and stress history in this study the mohr coulomb model and modified cam clay model are selected based on the characteristics of the multi aquifer aquitard system in the coastal region of china the mohr coulomb model is used in silty sand and silt while the modified cam clay model is used in clay table 1 presents the thickness of each layer and the mechanical parameters used in the model the values of the parameters are based on published works in the literature luo et al 2008 shen et al 2015 wu et al 2016 table 2 tabulated the parameters used in the mohr coulomb and modified cam clay model parameters including the deformation modulus internal friction angle and effective cohesion are needed in the mohr coulomb model for the modified cam clay model the compression modulus slope of the compression line slope of the swelling recompression line internal friction angle critical stress ratio over consolidation ratio and the pre consolidation pressure are necessary to obtain the correct values of the parameters please refer to the literature zheng et al 2014b tan et al 2017 2018 zhang et al 2018b the hydraulic conductivity of the waterproof curtain uses the value of concrete 1 10 9 m s wu et al 2016 the elasticity modulus of the waterproof curtain is set as 6900 mpa which is the value of the elastic modulus of the reinforced concrete after reduction liao et al 2008 3 results and analysis to investigate the effect of the leakage of the waterproof curtain on groundwater seepage and settlement five cases are calculated by the simulations table 3 lists the calculation scheme of the leakage it is assumed that the waterproof curtain leaks at a depth of 28 m in aqi with a leakage area of 0 00005 m2 the leakage area is so small that a self defined element is applied several numerical results have been obtained from the 3d fluid solid model by varying the hydraulic conductivity of the leakage point labeled as kl 3 1 leaking rate and volume when leakage occurs in the waterproof curtain groundwater flows towards the leakage point the location closer to the leakage point shows a larger seepage velocity of groundwater the maximum seepage velocity appears near the leakage point fig 5 presents the leakage rate plotted against elapsed time at the leakage point as seen in fig 5 the leakage rate is the largest at the commencement of the leakage it decreases from the maximum value and finally reaches a stable state after 100 min of leakage moreover the leaking rate increases with the increase of kl for instance when kl equals to 1 10 2 m s case 1 the maximum leaking rate is 1 93 10 3 m3 s and when kl equals to 1 10 6 m s case 5 the maximum value is 1 52 10 5 m3 s fig 6 shows the relationship between the leaking volume and the hydraulic conductivity of the leakage point after leaking one day with an increase of kl the leaking volume increases when kl is less than 1 10 5 m s the leaked volume is relatively small due to the low permeability of the leakage point when kl is greater than 1 10 3 m s the leakage point is in complete leaky thus the relationship between the leaking volume and kl is similar to an s shape curve it can be seen from the figure that the leaking volume increases slowly when kl is less than 1 10 5 m s and increases quickly as kl increases from 1 10 5 to 1 10 3 m s when kl is greater than 1 10 3 m s the leaking volume increases slowly with the increase of kl the leaking volume can reach 140 m3 per day as kl is equal to 1 10 2 m s 3 2 groundwater head fig 7 shows the drawdown contour in the confined aquifer i after the groundwater seepage becomes steady for the four cases described in table 1 as shown in the figure with an increase of kl the influence of leakage on the groundwater increases let us suppose that the leakage effect can be ignored because the drawdown in aqi is less than 0 1 m when kl is equal to 1 10 2 m s case 1 the influence range is 280 m when kl equals to 1 10 5 m s case 4 the influence range is 45 m fig 8 illustrates a sectional view of the drawdown in the confined aquifer i along section i i from fig 8 the maximum groundwater drawdown is at the leakage point and the drawdown decreases quickly with an increase in the distance to the excavation pit on the opposite side the variation of groundwater head is relative small for case 1 the maximum drawdown outside the pit caused by leakage is 6 98 m and the drawdown reduces by 15 and 62 7 at a distance of 1 m and 5 m from the leakage point respectively fig 9 depicts the groundwater drawdown in aqi versus time in case 2 at three points take point g1 for example the variation of groundwater drawdown is divided into three periods i period 1 in the early leakage period groundwater declines rapidly and the duration of this period is very short about 4 464 min groundwater drawdown at the end of this period reached 69 of the final drawdown ii period 2 groundwater drawdown declines slower than that in period 1 and the duration is almost 0 15 day the drawdown accounts for 94 of the final drawdown at the end of period 2 iii period 3 the groundwater head decreases slowly and finally reaches a stable state in one day the results indicate that groundwater head near the leakage point will decline rapidly in a short time in the case that the leakage occurs in the waterproof curtain let the center of the excavation pit be the coordinate origin orientation 1 points towards the leakage point orientation 2 is opposite to orientation 1 and orientation 3 is perpendicular to orientations 1 and 2 from fig 9 the drawdown along orientation 1 is greater that along the other two orientations the drawdown along orientation 2 is the minimum 3 3 ground settlement fig 10 depicts the contours of the ground settlement around the excavation pit after a leak lasting a hundred days and representing the four cases it can be observed from the figure that the ground settlement caused by the leakage increases with an increase of kl the maximum extent of the ground settlement is 415 m for case 1 and 30 m for case 4 on the assumption of a settlement of 1 mm based on the different assumptions of settlement and drawdown the influence range of the ground settlement is different from that of groundwater drawdown fig 11 presents a sectional view of the ground settlement after a 100 day leakage for five cases it can be found that the maximum settlement appears near the leakage point the settlement decreases with increasing distance from the excavation pit although the groundwater head on the opposite side has minor changes the ground settlement still occurs for example when kl is equal to 1 10 2 m s the maximum drawdown along orientations 1 and 2 see fig 8 is 6 98 m and 0 46 m see fig 7 and the settlements at the corresponding location are 12 mm and 7 mm respectively fig 12 presents the maximum variation in ground settlement over time for five cases the ground settlement increases with time different from the variation of groundwater drawdown the variation of ground settlement can be divided into four periods taking case 1 as an example we have period 1 when the leaked time labelled as t is less than 0 035 days the ground settlement increases slowly period 2 when t is between 0 035 and 1 05 days the settlement increases quickly at the end of period 2 the settlement reaches 42 of the final settlement such a settlement is mainly induced by the elastic deformation of soil during period 3 when t is greater than 1 05 and less than 29 days the settlement increases rapidly and it accounts for 95 of the final settlement after leaking for 12 days elastic deformation is generated in the early stage of this period and plastic deformation is generated in the later stage period 4 during this period when t is greater than 29 and less than 70 days the ground settlement increases very slowly and the consolidation of the soil has almost finished after leaking for 70 days by comparing fig 9 to fig 12 we find that the groundwater head in aqi declines quickly as soon as the leakage occurs however soil consolidation proceeds slowly when the groundwater head reaches a stable state after leaking for 1 day the ground settlement only reaches 41 percent of the final settlement since the soil in aqi is silty sand which has high permeability groundwater head reaches steady quickly for other aquifers e g aq0 and aqii variation of groundwater head is relatively small due to the weak permeability of aquitards that is the leakage recharge from aq0 and aqii is small thus the long term leakage of waterproof curtain has little effect on groundwater head in aqi moreover when leakage occurs in waterproof curtain in aqi head difference between aqi and adi aqi and adii appears in a short time this makes water head in adi and adii decline slowly until it reaches steady so the deformation caused by groundwater drawdown of silty clay in adi and adii increases gradually ground settlement is the sum of deformations of all layers thus the variation of ground settlement is different from the variation of groundwater head this in turn indicates that when the leakage occurs in the waterproof curtain not only does consolidation occur in the soil where the leakage occurs but also in the soil above it in addition if the leakage is in the sand layer with a large area quicksand may occur resulting in ground collapse thus when leakage occurs in the waterproof curtain of the excavation pit it is very important to take measures to plug the leak as soon as possible 4 discussion in this part the influence of soil properties on the ground settlement around the leakage point is discussed these properties include the soil permeability anisotropy and the deformation modulus it is assumed that the leakage occurs at a depth of 24 67 to 28 m in the waterproof curtain with a length of 3 23 m and the corresponding area is 10 74 m2 the leakage area is large and therefore a solid element is used to simulate the leakage which is different from the former simulation with a small leakage area in addition leakage location of the barrier is also been discussed with area of 3 97 m2 the hydraulic conductivity of the leakage point for all cases is 1 10 5 m s 4 1 hydraulic conductivity of soil to understand the influence of soil permeability on groundwater seepage and ground settlement an fem model with different values of ki hydraulic conductivity of aqi is developed and applied let ki 0 be the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of aqi in shanghai sandy soil further the ratio j of the hydraulic conductivities of aqi in the vertical and horizontal directions is 0 358 except for the value of ki the other parameters including j remain unchanged and the value of ki varies from 0 001 to 10 times the value of ki 0 fig 13 a plots a sectional view of the groundwater drawdown at section i i in aqi and fig 13 b is the enlarged view as shown in fig 13 the variation of groundwater drawdown has the following features i when the distance d from the leakage of the waterproof curtain is less than 4 m the drawdown outside the pit decreases with an increase of ki ii when the distance d is between 4 m and 40 m the drawdown increases with an increase of ki in the case that ki is less than 0 1 ki 0 and the results are the opposite as ki is greater than 0 1 ki 0 iii in the case that ki equals to 0 1 ki 0 the drawdown changes a lot as d is between 40 and 120 m iv when ki is less than 0 1 ki 0 the influence range of the leakage on groundwater seepage increases with an increase of ki while when ki is greater than 0 1 ki 0 the result reverses the results imply that the groundwater drawdown is significant as the hydraulic conductivity of the soil where the leakage of waterproof curtain occurs is close to 0 1 ki 0 thus it is important to make the waterproof curtain intact in engineering excavation particularly at the soil with the hydraulic conductivity of 0 1 ki 0 fig 13 c shows the contour of the pore water pressure for four cases at section ii ii the effect of the hydraulic conductivity of the soil on pore water pressure near the leakage is well illustrated by the figure when ki is equal to 0 001 ki 0 the pore water pressure near the leakage decreases quickly but pore water pressure changes little a bit farther from the leakage when ki equals to 0 1 ki0 the pore water pressure shows the largest variation among the four cases when ki equals to 10 ki0 pore water pressure changes the least although the hydraulic conductivity at the leakage point of the waterproof curtain is the same the groundwater flow into the excavation pit through the leakage varies greatly under different soils fig 14 presents the relationship between the leaked volume and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil after a leak lasting one day with an increase of ki the leaked volume increases if we let j be equal to ki divided by ki0 we see that the leaked volume is very small when j is less than 0 01 and increases quickly when j increases from 0 01 to 10 fig 15 a presents a sectional view of the ground settlement at section i i with different j after a leak lasting 100 days as seen in the figure the maximum ground settlement outside the pit caused by the leakage occurs as ki equals to 0 1 ki0 from fig 13 b we find that when ki is equals to 0 001 ki0 the drawdown is the largest among all cases however the influence of leakage on groundwater is very small as shown in fig 13 b for the case of 0 01 ki0 it has the similar characteristics while the leakage influence on groundwater seepage is large in the case of 0 1 ki0 thus the maximum ground settlement occurs at 0 1 ki0 in the case that ki is less than 0 1 ki 0 we observe that the bigger the ki the larger the ground settlement and the greater the difference between the maximum and the minimum values of ground settlement however when ki is greater than 0 1 ki 0 the result is the opposite from fig 13 a and 15 a it is found that the variation of the drawdown vs soil permeability and that of the ground settlement vs soil permeability are not the same to understand the relationship between soil deformation and hydraulic conductivity of aqi fig 15 b presents the soil deformation of different layers at the distance of 6 m to the leakage location as seen in the figure values of clay deformation in adii are positive and values of soil deformation in adi aqi and ground settlement are negative the positive values indicate that the soil expands and the negative values mean the soil compresses this phenomenon is due to the mandel effect near the boundary of clay strata the phenomenon of soil expansion has been found in excavation dewatering at a metro station in shanghai luan et al 2010 in porous medium studies the mandel cryer effect describes non monotonic pore water pressure evolution in response to loading or to changed stress conditions mandel 1953 cryer 1963 rice et al 1978 since the hydraulic conductivity of adi is very low groundwater head of adi changes little and the deformation of adi is very small for adii the hydraulic conductivity is greater than that of adi thus groundwater in adii moves upward to aqi as leakage occurs in aqi if the hydraulic conductivity is too small the groundwater in adii is difficult to flow into the excavation pit through the leakage therefore the soil expands and the value of expansion decreases with the increase of hydraulic conductivity of aqi moreover the ground settlement is less than the deformation of aqi due to the expansion of clay in adi when ki equals to ki0 the ground settlement is almost the same as the deformation of aqi it s important to note that the soil deformation in adi and adii may be compressed negative values as the hydraulic conductivities of these two layers are relatively big the results indicate that the ground settlement is closely related to soil properties in addition fig 15 b also illustrates the relationship between the ground settlement st and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil ki we observe from the figure that there seems to be a v shaped relationship between st and j the closer the value of j to 0 1 the greater is the value of the settlement the settlement increases rapidly when j is less than 0 03 and increases slowly as j increases from 0 03 to 0 1 on the other hand the settlement decreases gradually when j is greater than 0 1 and is less than 0 2 and decreases quickly when j is greater than 0 2 4 2 anisotropy of aquifer suppose that only the value of vertical hydraulic conductivity of aqi labeled as kv is changed and all other parameters are maintained unchanged four cases are calculated in the simulation and the ratio of the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities in aqi is 0 1 0 4 0 7 and 1 respectively values of the ground settlement have been obtained from the fem by varying kv fig 16 presents the calculated ground settlement values with different kv fig 16 a shows a sectional view of the ground settlement fig 16 b shows the relationship between the maximum ground settlement and the anisotropy of the aquifer it can be seen from the figure that the ground settlement decreases with a decrease of kv but the difference is not significant 4 3 deformation modulus of soil the influence of the modulus of deformation on the ground settlement is analyzed using the fem model it is assumed that all the other parameters remain constant besides the deformation modulus of aqi labeled as e 0 because the hydraulic conductivity of soils and the hydraulic conductivity of the waterproof curtain leakage are identical in all models the variation in groundwater drawdown at different e 0 is the same fig 17 a plots a sectional ground settlement with different e 0 in fig 17 a with an increase in deformation modulus of aqi the settlement increases fig 17 b illustrates the relationship between the maximum settlement and the deformation modulus suppose that deformation modulus of aqi in shanghai is represented by e0i and f is the ratio of e0 to e0i the ground settlement decreases rapidly as f is less than 1 decreases gradually as f varies from 1 to 5 and decreases very slowly as e0 becomes greater than 5 from fig 17 b the maximum value of the ground settlement is 14 6 mm when e0 is equal to e0i the value is 5 2 mm when e0 is equal to 10 e0i and the value is 4 8 mm when e0 is equal to 50 e0i thus the deformation in aqi caused by leakage is 9 8 mm and the total amount of compression in other soils is 4 8 mm this phenomenon indicates that the groundwater drawdown of the soil layer near the leakage leads to the drawdown of the overlying and underlying soil layers the drawdown depends on the permeability of the aquitards therefore besides the soil at the leakage point other soil layers also deform the deformation modulus of soil affects the ground settlement 4 4 leakage of waterproof curtain at different locations to know the influence of leakage location of waterproof curtain on drawdown and ground settlement four cases are considered it is assumed that the four cases have the same area and different locations along the vertical direction in aqi the leakage location is at 21 22 m 24 25 m 27 28 m and 30 31 m respectively fig 18 presents calculated values at section i i with different leakage location a groundwater drawdown and b ground settlement as seen in the figure the influence of leakage on groundwater drawdown and ground settlement increases with the increase of the leakage depth however the difference of drawdown and settlement between 27 and 28 m leakage and 30 to 31 m leakage is little when the leakage location is at the top of aqi the maximum drawdown and ground settlement caused by the leakage of waterproof curtain are 3 51 m and 6 5 mm and the corresponding values are 4 55 m and 8 9 mm respectively moreover comparing with the groundwater drawdown there is great different in ground settlement with different leakage location the reason is that as the leakage of waterproof curtain occurs in aqi groundwater head both in adi and adii varies and consolidation settlement occurs in all soil layers therefore the variation of ground settlement is larger than the variation of drawdown 5 conclusions this study presented a 3d fluid solid coupled model to investigate the impact on surroundings due to a leakage in the waterproof curtain over the excavation surface the following conclusions are reached 1 when a leakage occurs in the waterproof curtain the seepage path and seepage direction outside of the pit change both the leakage rate and leakage volume increase with an increase in the hydraulic conductivity at the leakage point kl the relationship between the leakage volume per day and kl is follows an s shaped curve as the volume of the leakage is constant with an increase of kl the leakage volume per day increases slowly when kl is less than 1 10 5 m s for values of kl equal to or greater than 1 10 5 m s it increases quickly finally the leakage volume grows slowly and becomes stable when kl is 1 10 3 m s 2 the groundwater head outside the pit declines when the groundwater enters into the excavation pit through the leakage points which leads to a ground settlement the groundwater head outside the pit and the ground settlement are related to the hydraulic conductivity of the leakage points the leakage area and leakage length the variation of groundwater drawdown outside the pit with time manifests itself as a decline very quickly at the beginning and reaches stability slowly and steadily in comparison with the time taken for the decline in the groundwater head soil consolidation occurs over a longer time both elastic and plastic deformations of the soil result over time in addition soil consolidation occurs in soils where the groundwater head varies thus less groundwater drawdown may cause a large ground settlement 3 the properties of the soil affecting ground settlement at the point of leakage of the waterproof curtain are its hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and its deformation modulus the hydraulic conductivity of the soil has a great effect on the pore water pressure leaking volume and the ground settlement the relationship between the settlement and hydraulic conductivity of soil presents a v shaped graph the settlement caused by leakage reaches the maximum when kl is equal to 4 86 10 6 m s the anisotropy of the soil has a lesser effect on the settlement the bigger the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the soil the larger is the settlement the deformation modulus of the soil has a little influence on the groundwater drawdown but greatly affects the settlement with an increase of the deformation modulus the settlement decreases quickly at the beginning then decreases gradually

5702,coseismic changes in water levels and discharges are well known phenomena worldwide reliable hypotheses to explain these hydrological changes qualitatively have been proposed using various data and analyses however there are few quantitative assessments of these changes which require hydrological simulators a dense monitoring network revealed coseismic river and groundwater level changes induced by the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto crustal earthquake associated with many post seismic fracture systems in this study we reproduced these changes using a physically based fully distributed integrated watershed modeling tool getflows in particular the formation of new fracture systems is key to understanding the hydrological changes observed after the earthquake which were incorporated into our model by changing parameters previous studies suggested that the observed water level drop immediately after the earthquake is explained by the drawdown of surface and aquifer waters to fill open spaces in the upper crust along the fracture systems generated under extensional stress field after the initial water drop water levels rose in the long term because additional water sources were released from surrounding mountains due to the coseismic increase in the permeability of the soils and rocks around the compressional fracture systems these hypotheses were validated in our model by adjusting the depths of fracture systems consequently we constructed the three dimensional distribution of these property changes over the study area furthermore the model calculation yielded the volumes of missing and released mountain waters in the studied watershed ca 106 and 108 m3 respectively this study demonstrates the utility of an integrated watershed modeling tool for investigating coseismic hydrological changes in active hydrological systems quantitatively keywords 2016 kumamoto earthquake integrated watershed modeling surface water groundwater coseismic hydrological changes getflows 1 introduction changes in surface and subsurface water flow in response to large earthquakes have been documented in seismic regions around the world e g rojstaczer and wolf 1992 muir wood and king 1993 wang et al 2001 2004 montgomery and manga 2003 elkhoury et al 2006 cox et al 2012 mohr et al 2017 these studies have revealed mechanisms that explain these changes qualitatively e g summarized in wang and manga 2009 however quantitative assessments of these changes that include how much water is transported in which areas via what kind of mechanism have rarely been performed thus little is known about the effects of earthquakes on watershed environments in terms of water volume in regional water flow systems although it is a fundamentally important question for the sustainable use and security of water resources following disasters a numerical simulation is an effective tool for evaluating these processes quantitatively a simulator that can treat surface subsurface water interactions physically and seamlessly is required to understand the transport of waters precisely following aquifer property changes due to seismic activity however few studies have attempted to evaluate coseismic hydrological changes numerically using this type of simulator we obtained an opportunity to study the post seismic hydrological system changes in kumamoto region southern japan by using a physically based fully distributed integrated watershed modeling tool getflows in this paper we present the three dimensional 3d distribution of aquifer property changes and the volume of waters transported following the 2016 kumamoto earthquake by long term assessment using the getflows simulator changes in surface water and groundwater flow systems induced by the 2016 kumamoto earthquake mainshock mw 7 0 01 25 jst 16 april 2016 were identified by a dense monitoring network composed of about 100 wells and 10 observation stations for surface water in the kumamoto plain area close to the epicenter fig 1 spring and river discharges and groundwater levels dropped immediately after the mainshock hosono et al 2019 after these initial water drops the spring discharges recovered gradually after 2 months whereas the groundwater levels at the foot of the west side of the aso caldera mountains increased to several meters higher than the original levels and this continued for at least 1 year after the mainshock hosono et al 2019 mechanisms to explain these hydrological changes have been proposed using a large number of datasets for spring and river discharges water levels strain changes and surface rupture distributions hosono et al 2019 the appearance of newly recognized normal faults and open rupture systems called the suizenji fault systems see fig 1 fujiwara et al 2016 goto et al 2017 induced surface and subsurface water drawdown into the upper crust to fill open cracks immediately after the earthquake causing the initial water level drops around this area other faults and rupture systems were formed in the western aso caldera rim mountains fig 1 and suggested to cause mountain water release due to permeability enhancement e g jónsson et al 2003 wang et al 2004 wang and manga 2015 leading to the water level increase at the downslope in the regional groundwater aquifer systems we assumed that appearance of these rupture systems fig 1 is a fundamental factor controlling changes in regional surface subsurface water flow systems in kumamoto region and thus we used this information to express aquifer property changes in our model these faults and surface ruptures are called fractures throughout this paper a 3d fully physically based watershed model considering surface water and groundwater coupled behavior has been developed for the kumamoto region and continuously updated over more than a decade as an important water resource management tool this model was validated by comparing simulated data with several time transient observed data series including river flow rate groundwater level temperature as well as water quality and isotopic data such as nitrate 3h δ18o and 85kr e g ichiyanagi et al 2012 shimada et al 2012a b a full description of the kumamoto model is being prepared in a separate paper this well structured model which was constructed before the 2016 kumamoto earthquake allowed us to validate the changes in groundwater levels river flow rates and spring discharges by incorporating the post seismic fracture systems observed at the ground surface fujiwara et al 2016 and to evaluate whether our simulation accommodates previously proposed hydrological change models the objective of this study is to reproduce the observed hydrological changes following the 2016 kumamoto earthquake quantitatively using the existing physically coupled surface water and groundwater model by incorporating fracture systems observed at the surface hosono et al 2019 already reported preliminary results to validate coseismic groundwater drops 35 min after the mainshock using the same model however these simulations did not include a comparison test considering other possible scenarios including changes in surface elevation and static strain homogeneously moreover the observed long term groundwater level and spring discharge increase have not yet been tested the present work is a comprehensive simulation of coseismic water flow system changes caused by the 2016 kumamoto earthquake considering all possible scenarios to explain the observed changes over the long term thus we present the 3d distribution of the post seismic fracture systems and assess the volume of waters that were transported after the earthquake 2 materials and methods 2 1 surface water and groundwater flow changes detected after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake the surface ground was displaced in the horizontal and vertical directions around the epicenter by the 2016 kumamoto earthquake for instance fig 1 shows contour lines of the displacement in the horizontal direction the ground moved eastward red and westward green north and south of the futagawa active fault lines respectively http www gsi go jp bousai h27 kumamoto earthquake index html new post seismic fracture systems formed by both extensional and compressional deformations were confirmed in the surface using interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar data fujiwara et al 2016 and are shown as yellow lines in fig 1 extensional stress revealed fracture systems suizenji fault systems fujiwara et al 2016 goto et al 2017 in the kumamoto plain and around lake ezu the major spring fed lakes in the study area simultaneously compressional deformation occurred in and around the western aso caldera rim mountains relative groundwater level change distributions in the confined aquifer 35 min and 6 months after the mainshock of the earthquake are shown in fig 2 data are provided in table s1 a large groundwater drop was identified immediately after the earthquake in the extensional area around lake ezu in addition the groundwater level rose higher than the levels in the annual high water season in the downstream site close to the compressional area these were the most important coseismic water level changes observed in the study area as reported previously hosono et al 2019 fig 3 shows the observed time evolution of the river flow rate of the shira river at yotsugibashi observation station which is located in the suizenji fault area in the extensional field fig 1 data source http www1 river go jp the river flow rate decreased gradually for almost half a day after the mainshock after the decrease the river flow rate became greater than that before the earthquake this is a typical change in river discharge observed just after the mainshock in the suizenji fault area hosono et al 2019 in contrast after the earthquake the volume flux of spring water at tateno spring observation station table s2 which is located at the western foot of the aso caldera rim mountains fig 1 increased gradually fig 4 the distribution of the surface land displacement and post seismic fracture systems fujiwara et al 2016 and all data recording changes in groundwater levels and river and spring discharges are used for our model validation data source shown above 2 2 getflows simulator the general purpose terrestrial fluid flow simulator getflows simulator itoh et al 2000 mori et al 2015 tosaka et al 2000 2010 was used to simulate the hydrological processes in the kumamoto region the getflows simulator is a physically based fully distributed integrated watershed modeling tool many other watershed modeling simulators divide the targeted watershed into several components such as river slope and unsaturated saturated underground zones with each component predefined during the modeling stage the getflows simulator simultaneously treats the transport processes of water air various dissolved and volatilized materials suspended sediments in water and heat from the surface to the underground seamlessly on arbitrary temporal spatial scales fig 5 shows a schematic of the getflows system terms shown in italic and larger font in this figure represent the processes considered in the present study the mass conservation laws for both surface and subsurface fluid flows are used to derive the governing equations as 1 m p ρ p q p ϕ ρ p s p t p w a where is the differential operator m p is the mass flux of the fluid kg m2 s ρ p is the density of the fluid kg m3 q p is the volumetric flux of the sink and source m3 m3 s ϕ is the porosity m3 m3 s p is the saturation of the fluid m3 m3 and t is the time s subscript p in the equation indicates the fluid phase such as air a or water w the porosity for surface fluid flow is set to 1 0 in eq 1 as there is no porous material on the land surface manning s law is applied in a diffusive wave approximation of the two dimensional saint venant equations to compute the velocity field for surface water flow whereas air is regarded as an infinitely mobile fluid that is unable to affect water phase movement in the surface environment a generalized darcy s law is used in 3d space for subsurface fluid flows and surface subsurface fluid flow interactions to describe the fluid velocity field the mass flux of fluid phase p per unit area m p in the flow terms for surface and subsurface flow can be expressed as follows surface fluid 2 m w ρ w r 2 3 n l h l z l s g n h l z l l x y 3 m a ρ a k k r a μ a p a ρ a g z subsurface fluid 4 m p ρ p k k r p μ p p p g ρ p d z p w a here n l is manning s roughness coefficient m 1 3 s r is the hydraulic radius m h is the surface water depth m l is the distance of surface water flow direction m z is the elevation from the datum level m μ p is the viscosity coefficient pa s k is the intrinsic permeability m2 k r p is the relative permeability dimensionless p p is the pressure pa and g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 a main characteristic of the getflows simulator is that fully coupled behaviors between surface and subsurface waters such as rainfall infiltration and groundwater discharges can be treated implicitly in other words the vertical fluid flux that moves across the land surface is not determined empirically but can be evaluated mathematically by using the pressure difference between grid blocks tosaka et al 2000 therefore the simulator requires no a priori assumptions such as the first order exchange coefficient as a empirical parameter e g parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 cathy camporese et al 2010 inhm vanderkwaak 1999 modhms panday and huyakorn 2004 and hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 or the infiltration rate from the surface to underground as a boundary condition which are mandatory in many other watershed modeling tools this unique function is most important to precisely reproduce the changes in river and spring discharges and groundwater levels through changes in surface water groundwater interactions resulting from deformations in the aquifer structures caused by crustal earthquakes 2 3 hydrological watershed model of kumamoto region the simulation area in this study included three major river watersheds shira river basin kikuchi river basin and midori river basin and other small watersheds encompassing an area of 2689 km2 fig 6 within these watershed areas the kumamoto groundwater area hosono et al 2013 develops over an area of 945 km2 fig 6 two major type of aquifers shallow unconfined aquifers ca 70 m depth and deep confined to semi confined aquifers ca 20 250 m which consist mainly of quaternary aso volcanic pyroclastic flow deposits porous lava and alluvial deposits are separated by impermeable lacustrine sediments in this domain e g hosono et al 2013 the model boundary of the coastal area is about 20 km from the coastline and did not inhibit surface and groundwater flow from the land into the sea similarly the bottom face of the model was 2 km below sea level and had no effect on the main groundwater flow in the aso pyroclastic flow deposits hosono et al 2019 fig 7 shows the 3d grid block system colored according to ground surface elevation and geological facies cross sectional views of the geological structure of the 3d grid block system are shown in fig 8 the number of grid blocks in the horizontal plane is 33 274 in the vertical direction the atmospheric and surface domains which were the top and second layers in the grid block system were prepared to set the boundary conditions with meteorological data and to simulate surface water flows additionally the subsurface geology was discretized into 28 layers of variable thickness and thus the total number of grid blocks is 998 220 the numerical model required data on meteorology land use elevation surface soil subsurface geology and water use the meteorological data included precipitation and air temperature data which were used to evaluate the evapotranspiration the land use classification was used to determine manning s roughness coefficient the surface soils and subsurface geology were associated with hydraulic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity estimated from well tests which is converted to intrinsic permeability porosity relative permeability and capillary pressure groundwater pumping water intake from rivers and rice paddy irrigation were included in the water use data the time dependent evolution of hydrological conditions was computed using daily meteorological and water use data the boundary condition of a constant water level at 0 m elevation to the sea area and no flow boundary to the side and bottom surface of this model were used all detailed data sources and conditions such as manning s roughness coefficient hydraulic parameters and water use are provided in hosono et al 2019 the model was validated by trial and error calibrations manually by comparison with the following observed data flow rates of 12 rivers groundwater levels for 123 wells total volume of spring discharge to lake ezu for more than 5 years temperature and hydrochemical and isotopic parameters such as 3h δ18o 85kr and no3 for groundwater from the monitoring wells hosono et al 2013 ichiyanagi et al 2012 shimada et al 2012a b fig s1 shows examples of the comparison of the observed and simulated data for river flow rate groundwater level vertical groundwater temperature distribution oxygen stable isotope ratio nitrate nitrogen concentration and 85kr concentration the measured data agreed well with the model data an orthogonal projection of the 3d streamlines of surface blue lines and subsurface red lines coupled water flow in the equilibrium state are shown in fig s2 as a visualization example based on the validated model a distinctive groundwater flow regime in the kumamoto area in which subsurface water flows over river watershed boundaries was reproduced 2 4 modeling the post seismic fracture systems caused by the 2016 kumamoto earthquake for modeling the post seismic fracture systems we assumed that water filled the open spaces formed in the upper crust during the formation of open spaces we need to consider the effect of both aquifer water expansion and pore pressure decrease as well as the possibility that crustal material expansion and volatilization of air dissolved in water and the water itself might occur simultaneously however to simplify the mathematical treatments the effects of crustal material expansion and volatilization were not considered in this study air could flow into the open spaces directly in the unsaturated zone near the surface thus the change in water saturation was considered instead of modeling a large water pressure decrease in the fracture modeling we assumed that strain changes were concentrated only in each observed fracture line fujiwara et al 2016 and continued vertically in the upper crust considering their normal fault and strike slip signatures and that groundwater flowed in fractures preferentially in the actual field not only vertical but also parallel and inclined fractures should be presented however these effects were not considered to simplify the modeling under this assumption porosity hydraulic conductivity pore water pressure in the saturated zone and water saturation in the unsaturated zone were changed in the grids where the new fractures crosscut these property changes were reflected at and after the time of the 2016 kumamoto earthquake in an actual simulation to validate water transportation near fracture systems precisely and to avoid including more than two fractures in one grid the grid system in the horizontal direction was subdivided more finely than that of the original kumamoto model furthermore to identify the depth of water transportation in the upper crust the bottom face of the model was extended from 2 to 10 km below sea level with a vertical resolution of 1 km a conceptual diagram of the modeling for the post seismic fracture systems is shown in fig 9 changes in porosity pore water pressure and water saturation of the grids including the fractures were calculated according to eqs 5 7 5 ϕ ϕ ε 6 p w p w ε c w ϕ 7 s w s w ϕ ϕ here ϕ s w ε and p w are porosity m3 m3 water saturation m3 m3 strain dimensionless and pore water pressure pa of the grids including the fractures caused by the earthquake respectively ϕ s w and p w are the original porosity water saturation and water pressure before the earthquake respectively and c w is the compressibility of water pa 1 strain ε is treated as a positive value water velocity v m s and hydraulic conductivity k m s based on a steady state hele shaw flow between two infinitely long parallel plates separated by distance b m with constant hydraulic gradient j m m e g bear 1972 witherspoon et al 1980 are described by 8 v ρ g b 2 12 μ j 9 k ρ g b 2 12 μ where ρ is the density of water kg m3 μ is the viscosity coefficient of water pa s and g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 and ρ 1000 kg m3 μ 1 0 10 3 pa s and g 9 80665 m s2 were used as universal values the hydraulic conductivity k m s of a grid of width d m including a fracture of width b m was calculated by eq 10 assuming that groundwater flows in the fractures preferentially 10 k ρ g b 3 12 μ d representative width d of grids including these fractures and the estimated value of averaged coseismic volumetric strain ε were 50 m and 2 5 10 5 hosono et al 2019 respectively in the extensional area about 10 of the grids included fractures in this area therefore concentrated strain ε was estimated as 2 5 10 4 fracture width b can be calculated by values d and ε so the hydraulic conductivity k of grids including extensional fractures is calculated to be approximately 1 0 10 2 m s from eq 10 in contrast d and ε in the compressional area were estimated to be 100 m and 5 0 10 5 hosono et al 2019 respectively most grids included compressional fractures in this area therefore we hypothesized ε had the same absolute value as ε finally k of grids including compressional fractures was estimated to be approximately 1 0 10 3 m s from eq 10 these estimated values were used as intrinsic permeability k converted from hydraulic conductivities k using density ρ gravity acceleration g and viscosity coefficient μ of the universal values in an actual simulation these values are significantly higher than the original hydraulic conductivities in extensional areas of 1 0 10 9 to 2 5 10 3 m s and in compressional areas of 1 0 10 8 to 1 0 10 4 m s these hypothesized values are under ideal conditions that may apply but could also vary according to the heterogeneity in the field we have tested the sensitivity of these parameters and confirmed that these are not fundamental parameters instead we found that the depth of fractures is the most sensitive parameter for reproducing water levels and discharges thus we think these hypothesized values are relevant because it is impossible to observe the depth of each fracture many calculation trials were performed by changing the depth of these fractures manually as unknown parameters until we reproduced the observed changes in groundwater levels river flow rates and spring discharges after the earthquake 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of coseismic change scenarios by different numerical experiments in this study three numerical experiments experiments 1 to 3 were performed in the model incorporating all possible parameter change patterns caused by the earthquake to test the most reliable hypothesis table 1 in experiment 1 the surface elevation changes reported by the geospatial information authority of japan http www gsi go jp bousai h27 kumamoto earthquake index html were considered in which only the shift of the elevation head was reflected in the model in experiment 2 we assumed that the crustal expansion was homogeneous around the suizenji fault area see fig 1 the extensional area where suizenji fault systems developed defined after hosono et al 2019 and compressional faults area in the form of many microcracks and crustal fractures did not crosscut the aquitard and were not across different aquifer systems in this case averaged strain changes were considered homogeneously over the areas in addition to the elevation changes which was modeled by changing the porosity water pressure and water saturation based on eqs 5 7 but concentrated strain ε replaced averaged strain ε the hydraulic conductivity was not changed because the averaged strain less than the order of 10 5 was small and microcracks were assumed to be nonconsecutive a previous study suggested that this hypothesis is unlikely as the major cause to explain the observed hydrological changes based on comparison analysis of changes between water levels and the calculated strain at each screen depth hosono et al 2019 however we conducted this experiment to ensure model reproducibility in experiment 3 the strains induced by the earthquake were assumed to be concentrated in the fractures only which were modeled by changing the hydraulic conductivity in addition to the other parameters fig 10 shows the result of experiment 1 comparing the observed and simulated groundwater level changes 35 min after the mainshock for the wells located in the suizenji fault area for unconfined and confined aquifers there were no significant responses of the groundwater level in the simulated results thus this hypothesis that the surface elevation is changed by coseismic displacement cannot explain the observed water level changes in experiment 2 we could simulate some groundwater level drops in the suizenji fault area depending on the depth of the microcrack area however this scenario could not explain the observations that the river discharge decreased in the suizenji fault area for the first 12 h fig 11 the sharp spring discharge increased for 1 week after the mainshock fig 12 and the groundwater level increased after the initial water drop continuing for at least several months fig 13 therefore experiment 2 did not reproduce the observed changes in water levels and discharges satisfactorily in numerical experiment 3 many trial and error calibrations were conducted by changing the depths of each fracture manually to reproduce the observed changes after the earthquake fig 14 shows the examples of the trial and error calibration of water levels comparing the observed and simulated groundwater level changes 35 min after the mainshock for the wells located in the suizenji fault area for confined aquifers assuming that the fracture depth extends 10 and 5 km uniformly in addition fig 15 shows the examples of the trial and error calibration comparing the measured and simulated groundwater level time series for an observed well downstream of the compressional area in the western aso caldera rim mountains with hypothesized fracture depths of 100 and 500 m it was found that the groundwater level changes could be reproduced by calibrating the fracture depths in addition there were large responses in river flow rate and spring discharge immediately after the mainshock in this modeling scheme the main reason why there was not good agreement in numerical experiment 2 in the long term groundwater level fluctuation river flow rate and spring discharge was the absence of the hydraulic conductivity change thus the scenario supported by experiment 3 is most plausible to explain the hydrological changes observed after the earthquake comprehensively we tried to identify the depth distributions of the post seismic fracture systems more precisely using models in the following section this trial allowed us to calculate transported water volume 3 2 hydrological changes caused by the 2016 kumamoto earthquake quantitative assessment preliminary research using the same model hosono et al 2019 with the same condition shown as experiment 3 reproduced the groundwater level drops 35 min after the mainshock for both unconfined and confined aquifers in the suizenji fault area by adjusting depths of the fracture systems around this area fig 16 the total re distributed water missing water transported into the upper crust volume due to the formation of new extensional fracture systems was estimated as approximately 10 6 m3 hosono et al 2019 here we tried to reproduce the long term coseismic water level changes including the post seismic water level rise after the initial water drops that were greatest in the eastern recharge areas of the regional groundwater flow systems at the western foot of the aso caldera mountains fig 17 shows the long term groundwater level fluctuations of the observed and simulated values for wells a b and c these stations are representative monitoring sites for validating changes in confined aquifers in these areas and are located downstream of the compressional fault area in the western aso caldera rim mountains see fig 6 for their locations the blue circles show observed data and the red lines show the simulated results with the same model conditions as numerical experiment 3 but with variable fracture depths which incorporated changes in parameters including elevation porosity water pressure water saturation and hydraulic conductivity the green dashed lines show the simulation results with the model conditions used in numerical experiment 1 which incorporated surface elevation changes only without the property changes the groundwater levels decrease gradually until the end of june 2016 and then increase in the high water season peaking in august following annual hydrological cycles and thus experiment 1 does not explain the observed water levels for all wells in the observations the water levels dropped immediately after the mainshock although this was not obvious in well a which is located far from the suizenji fault systems after this initial drop the water level rose even during may and june and increased more dramatically during july and august this two step water level increase and even the initial water drop were reproduced by the model including the property changes the rapid recovery of the water level drop in the model means that the pore pressure recovered quickly after the water compensated for the low pressure in the crustal cracks the water increase from may to june reflected the addition of waters coseismically released from the mountains and that from july to august reflected the addition of mountain waters and heavier precipitation in the rainy season fig 18 shows the comparison between measured and simulated with experiments 1 and 3 spring discharges reflecting seasonal fluctuations and coseismic effects at tateno spring observation station located at the mountain foot although the simulated discharges were volumetrically smaller than the measured values the two step water level increase was reproduced well in the spring discharges with the model including the property changes in the monthly data corresponding well to the groundwater level results in addition the sharp increase in spring discharges just after the mainshock was reproduced fairly well in the daily data the spring discharge increase corresponds to the increase in surface river flow rate that began during the 12 h after the mainshock after the initial water level drop during the first 12 h in the suizenji fault area fig 19 however this river discharge increase might be the combination of coseismic mountain water release precipitation and loss of outlet water from the main river due to damage to irrigation channels the distribution of the estimated depths of the coseismic fractures is provided in fig 20 which we used in our model to reproduce observed hydrological changes after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake in general the depths of these fractures in the extensional area are much deeper than those in the compressional area it would be difficult to practically illustrate these 3d fracture distributions by other methods such as geological survey and our results demonstrate the potential usefulness of hydrological analysis to determine subsurface property changes after disasters however these depth distributions are not the only representative view in the field because there must be other fractures under the surface that are hidden at the surface in this case we must have overestimated the fracture depths furthermore our modeling still has limitations in its capacity to visualize field events precisely such as the size of model grids for instance it is difficult to express the locations of the fractures on the field scale and this may produce discrepancies between observations and calculation results other examples include the decrease in river water in the suizenji fault area that is not correctly reproduced within a given time resolution within 12 h fig 19 which may be due to the gap between the field and limited modeling conditions nevertheless our work reveals that only the model with the parameter changes can reproduce the coseismic changes in groundwater levels and river and spring discharges simultaneously identifying the 3d distribution of property changes allows us to calculate transported water volume using the simulation model the volume of released waters from mountains area shown in fig 20 was calculated to be approximately 10 8 m3 from decrease of water levels in the mountains due to the increased permeability caused by fracturing this volume was consistent in order with the volume derived from the net water increase in the kumamoto groundwater area see fig 6 during the 8 months after the earthquake which was obtained by subtracting the water volume calculated in experiment 1 from that calculated in experiment 3 changes in permeability after the earthquake e g by clogging were not considered we confirmed that the released water from mountains are volumetrically greater by 2 orders of magnitude than the missing waters along deep fractures around the suizenji fault area 4 conclusions and implications a recent study revealed that coseismic surface water and groundwater drawdown along crustal fractures occurred immediately after the mainshock of the 2016 kumamoto earthquake the study also suggested that coseismic mountain water release due to the increase in permeability caused by fracturing subsequently increased the water levels in the downslope area our model incorporating property changes in these fracture systems successfully reproduced overall observed hydrological behaviors by changing the depth of fractures this result demonstrated that the observed post seismic hydrological changes can reasonably be explained by the mechanisms proposed in the recent study the result also suggested that coseismic mountain water release played a volumetrically important role in overall hydrological alteration systems after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake however this aspect should be verified in future research to understand variability in volume of water re distribution associated with different earthquakes in other fields our study illustrates that the 3d surface subsurface seamless fully physically based watershed model is useful for understanding changes in surface and groundwater flows caused by earthquakes quantitatively which can be applied broadly elsewhere moreover the constructed 3d distribution of fracture systems improves our understanding of subsurface damage distribution and seismotectonic features further consideration of the time transient hydraulic property changes such as hydraulic conductivity and porosity for instance by clogging is needed to understand complete long term hydrological behaviors after large crustal earthquakes credit authorship contribution statement yasuhiro tawara conceptualization

5702,coseismic changes in water levels and discharges are well known phenomena worldwide reliable hypotheses to explain these hydrological changes qualitatively have been proposed using various data and analyses however there are few quantitative assessments of these changes which require hydrological simulators a dense monitoring network revealed coseismic river and groundwater level changes induced by the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto crustal earthquake associated with many post seismic fracture systems in this study we reproduced these changes using a physically based fully distributed integrated watershed modeling tool getflows in particular the formation of new fracture systems is key to understanding the hydrological changes observed after the earthquake which were incorporated into our model by changing parameters previous studies suggested that the observed water level drop immediately after the earthquake is explained by the drawdown of surface and aquifer waters to fill open spaces in the upper crust along the fracture systems generated under extensional stress field after the initial water drop water levels rose in the long term because additional water sources were released from surrounding mountains due to the coseismic increase in the permeability of the soils and rocks around the compressional fracture systems these hypotheses were validated in our model by adjusting the depths of fracture systems consequently we constructed the three dimensional distribution of these property changes over the study area furthermore the model calculation yielded the volumes of missing and released mountain waters in the studied watershed ca 106 and 108 m3 respectively this study demonstrates the utility of an integrated watershed modeling tool for investigating coseismic hydrological changes in active hydrological systems quantitatively keywords 2016 kumamoto earthquake integrated watershed modeling surface water groundwater coseismic hydrological changes getflows 1 introduction changes in surface and subsurface water flow in response to large earthquakes have been documented in seismic regions around the world e g rojstaczer and wolf 1992 muir wood and king 1993 wang et al 2001 2004 montgomery and manga 2003 elkhoury et al 2006 cox et al 2012 mohr et al 2017 these studies have revealed mechanisms that explain these changes qualitatively e g summarized in wang and manga 2009 however quantitative assessments of these changes that include how much water is transported in which areas via what kind of mechanism have rarely been performed thus little is known about the effects of earthquakes on watershed environments in terms of water volume in regional water flow systems although it is a fundamentally important question for the sustainable use and security of water resources following disasters a numerical simulation is an effective tool for evaluating these processes quantitatively a simulator that can treat surface subsurface water interactions physically and seamlessly is required to understand the transport of waters precisely following aquifer property changes due to seismic activity however few studies have attempted to evaluate coseismic hydrological changes numerically using this type of simulator we obtained an opportunity to study the post seismic hydrological system changes in kumamoto region southern japan by using a physically based fully distributed integrated watershed modeling tool getflows in this paper we present the three dimensional 3d distribution of aquifer property changes and the volume of waters transported following the 2016 kumamoto earthquake by long term assessment using the getflows simulator changes in surface water and groundwater flow systems induced by the 2016 kumamoto earthquake mainshock mw 7 0 01 25 jst 16 april 2016 were identified by a dense monitoring network composed of about 100 wells and 10 observation stations for surface water in the kumamoto plain area close to the epicenter fig 1 spring and river discharges and groundwater levels dropped immediately after the mainshock hosono et al 2019 after these initial water drops the spring discharges recovered gradually after 2 months whereas the groundwater levels at the foot of the west side of the aso caldera mountains increased to several meters higher than the original levels and this continued for at least 1 year after the mainshock hosono et al 2019 mechanisms to explain these hydrological changes have been proposed using a large number of datasets for spring and river discharges water levels strain changes and surface rupture distributions hosono et al 2019 the appearance of newly recognized normal faults and open rupture systems called the suizenji fault systems see fig 1 fujiwara et al 2016 goto et al 2017 induced surface and subsurface water drawdown into the upper crust to fill open cracks immediately after the earthquake causing the initial water level drops around this area other faults and rupture systems were formed in the western aso caldera rim mountains fig 1 and suggested to cause mountain water release due to permeability enhancement e g jónsson et al 2003 wang et al 2004 wang and manga 2015 leading to the water level increase at the downslope in the regional groundwater aquifer systems we assumed that appearance of these rupture systems fig 1 is a fundamental factor controlling changes in regional surface subsurface water flow systems in kumamoto region and thus we used this information to express aquifer property changes in our model these faults and surface ruptures are called fractures throughout this paper a 3d fully physically based watershed model considering surface water and groundwater coupled behavior has been developed for the kumamoto region and continuously updated over more than a decade as an important water resource management tool this model was validated by comparing simulated data with several time transient observed data series including river flow rate groundwater level temperature as well as water quality and isotopic data such as nitrate 3h δ18o and 85kr e g ichiyanagi et al 2012 shimada et al 2012a b a full description of the kumamoto model is being prepared in a separate paper this well structured model which was constructed before the 2016 kumamoto earthquake allowed us to validate the changes in groundwater levels river flow rates and spring discharges by incorporating the post seismic fracture systems observed at the ground surface fujiwara et al 2016 and to evaluate whether our simulation accommodates previously proposed hydrological change models the objective of this study is to reproduce the observed hydrological changes following the 2016 kumamoto earthquake quantitatively using the existing physically coupled surface water and groundwater model by incorporating fracture systems observed at the surface hosono et al 2019 already reported preliminary results to validate coseismic groundwater drops 35 min after the mainshock using the same model however these simulations did not include a comparison test considering other possible scenarios including changes in surface elevation and static strain homogeneously moreover the observed long term groundwater level and spring discharge increase have not yet been tested the present work is a comprehensive simulation of coseismic water flow system changes caused by the 2016 kumamoto earthquake considering all possible scenarios to explain the observed changes over the long term thus we present the 3d distribution of the post seismic fracture systems and assess the volume of waters that were transported after the earthquake 2 materials and methods 2 1 surface water and groundwater flow changes detected after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake the surface ground was displaced in the horizontal and vertical directions around the epicenter by the 2016 kumamoto earthquake for instance fig 1 shows contour lines of the displacement in the horizontal direction the ground moved eastward red and westward green north and south of the futagawa active fault lines respectively http www gsi go jp bousai h27 kumamoto earthquake index html new post seismic fracture systems formed by both extensional and compressional deformations were confirmed in the surface using interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar data fujiwara et al 2016 and are shown as yellow lines in fig 1 extensional stress revealed fracture systems suizenji fault systems fujiwara et al 2016 goto et al 2017 in the kumamoto plain and around lake ezu the major spring fed lakes in the study area simultaneously compressional deformation occurred in and around the western aso caldera rim mountains relative groundwater level change distributions in the confined aquifer 35 min and 6 months after the mainshock of the earthquake are shown in fig 2 data are provided in table s1 a large groundwater drop was identified immediately after the earthquake in the extensional area around lake ezu in addition the groundwater level rose higher than the levels in the annual high water season in the downstream site close to the compressional area these were the most important coseismic water level changes observed in the study area as reported previously hosono et al 2019 fig 3 shows the observed time evolution of the river flow rate of the shira river at yotsugibashi observation station which is located in the suizenji fault area in the extensional field fig 1 data source http www1 river go jp the river flow rate decreased gradually for almost half a day after the mainshock after the decrease the river flow rate became greater than that before the earthquake this is a typical change in river discharge observed just after the mainshock in the suizenji fault area hosono et al 2019 in contrast after the earthquake the volume flux of spring water at tateno spring observation station table s2 which is located at the western foot of the aso caldera rim mountains fig 1 increased gradually fig 4 the distribution of the surface land displacement and post seismic fracture systems fujiwara et al 2016 and all data recording changes in groundwater levels and river and spring discharges are used for our model validation data source shown above 2 2 getflows simulator the general purpose terrestrial fluid flow simulator getflows simulator itoh et al 2000 mori et al 2015 tosaka et al 2000 2010 was used to simulate the hydrological processes in the kumamoto region the getflows simulator is a physically based fully distributed integrated watershed modeling tool many other watershed modeling simulators divide the targeted watershed into several components such as river slope and unsaturated saturated underground zones with each component predefined during the modeling stage the getflows simulator simultaneously treats the transport processes of water air various dissolved and volatilized materials suspended sediments in water and heat from the surface to the underground seamlessly on arbitrary temporal spatial scales fig 5 shows a schematic of the getflows system terms shown in italic and larger font in this figure represent the processes considered in the present study the mass conservation laws for both surface and subsurface fluid flows are used to derive the governing equations as 1 m p ρ p q p ϕ ρ p s p t p w a where is the differential operator m p is the mass flux of the fluid kg m2 s ρ p is the density of the fluid kg m3 q p is the volumetric flux of the sink and source m3 m3 s ϕ is the porosity m3 m3 s p is the saturation of the fluid m3 m3 and t is the time s subscript p in the equation indicates the fluid phase such as air a or water w the porosity for surface fluid flow is set to 1 0 in eq 1 as there is no porous material on the land surface manning s law is applied in a diffusive wave approximation of the two dimensional saint venant equations to compute the velocity field for surface water flow whereas air is regarded as an infinitely mobile fluid that is unable to affect water phase movement in the surface environment a generalized darcy s law is used in 3d space for subsurface fluid flows and surface subsurface fluid flow interactions to describe the fluid velocity field the mass flux of fluid phase p per unit area m p in the flow terms for surface and subsurface flow can be expressed as follows surface fluid 2 m w ρ w r 2 3 n l h l z l s g n h l z l l x y 3 m a ρ a k k r a μ a p a ρ a g z subsurface fluid 4 m p ρ p k k r p μ p p p g ρ p d z p w a here n l is manning s roughness coefficient m 1 3 s r is the hydraulic radius m h is the surface water depth m l is the distance of surface water flow direction m z is the elevation from the datum level m μ p is the viscosity coefficient pa s k is the intrinsic permeability m2 k r p is the relative permeability dimensionless p p is the pressure pa and g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 a main characteristic of the getflows simulator is that fully coupled behaviors between surface and subsurface waters such as rainfall infiltration and groundwater discharges can be treated implicitly in other words the vertical fluid flux that moves across the land surface is not determined empirically but can be evaluated mathematically by using the pressure difference between grid blocks tosaka et al 2000 therefore the simulator requires no a priori assumptions such as the first order exchange coefficient as a empirical parameter e g parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 cathy camporese et al 2010 inhm vanderkwaak 1999 modhms panday and huyakorn 2004 and hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 or the infiltration rate from the surface to underground as a boundary condition which are mandatory in many other watershed modeling tools this unique function is most important to precisely reproduce the changes in river and spring discharges and groundwater levels through changes in surface water groundwater interactions resulting from deformations in the aquifer structures caused by crustal earthquakes 2 3 hydrological watershed model of kumamoto region the simulation area in this study included three major river watersheds shira river basin kikuchi river basin and midori river basin and other small watersheds encompassing an area of 2689 km2 fig 6 within these watershed areas the kumamoto groundwater area hosono et al 2013 develops over an area of 945 km2 fig 6 two major type of aquifers shallow unconfined aquifers ca 70 m depth and deep confined to semi confined aquifers ca 20 250 m which consist mainly of quaternary aso volcanic pyroclastic flow deposits porous lava and alluvial deposits are separated by impermeable lacustrine sediments in this domain e g hosono et al 2013 the model boundary of the coastal area is about 20 km from the coastline and did not inhibit surface and groundwater flow from the land into the sea similarly the bottom face of the model was 2 km below sea level and had no effect on the main groundwater flow in the aso pyroclastic flow deposits hosono et al 2019 fig 7 shows the 3d grid block system colored according to ground surface elevation and geological facies cross sectional views of the geological structure of the 3d grid block system are shown in fig 8 the number of grid blocks in the horizontal plane is 33 274 in the vertical direction the atmospheric and surface domains which were the top and second layers in the grid block system were prepared to set the boundary conditions with meteorological data and to simulate surface water flows additionally the subsurface geology was discretized into 28 layers of variable thickness and thus the total number of grid blocks is 998 220 the numerical model required data on meteorology land use elevation surface soil subsurface geology and water use the meteorological data included precipitation and air temperature data which were used to evaluate the evapotranspiration the land use classification was used to determine manning s roughness coefficient the surface soils and subsurface geology were associated with hydraulic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity estimated from well tests which is converted to intrinsic permeability porosity relative permeability and capillary pressure groundwater pumping water intake from rivers and rice paddy irrigation were included in the water use data the time dependent evolution of hydrological conditions was computed using daily meteorological and water use data the boundary condition of a constant water level at 0 m elevation to the sea area and no flow boundary to the side and bottom surface of this model were used all detailed data sources and conditions such as manning s roughness coefficient hydraulic parameters and water use are provided in hosono et al 2019 the model was validated by trial and error calibrations manually by comparison with the following observed data flow rates of 12 rivers groundwater levels for 123 wells total volume of spring discharge to lake ezu for more than 5 years temperature and hydrochemical and isotopic parameters such as 3h δ18o 85kr and no3 for groundwater from the monitoring wells hosono et al 2013 ichiyanagi et al 2012 shimada et al 2012a b fig s1 shows examples of the comparison of the observed and simulated data for river flow rate groundwater level vertical groundwater temperature distribution oxygen stable isotope ratio nitrate nitrogen concentration and 85kr concentration the measured data agreed well with the model data an orthogonal projection of the 3d streamlines of surface blue lines and subsurface red lines coupled water flow in the equilibrium state are shown in fig s2 as a visualization example based on the validated model a distinctive groundwater flow regime in the kumamoto area in which subsurface water flows over river watershed boundaries was reproduced 2 4 modeling the post seismic fracture systems caused by the 2016 kumamoto earthquake for modeling the post seismic fracture systems we assumed that water filled the open spaces formed in the upper crust during the formation of open spaces we need to consider the effect of both aquifer water expansion and pore pressure decrease as well as the possibility that crustal material expansion and volatilization of air dissolved in water and the water itself might occur simultaneously however to simplify the mathematical treatments the effects of crustal material expansion and volatilization were not considered in this study air could flow into the open spaces directly in the unsaturated zone near the surface thus the change in water saturation was considered instead of modeling a large water pressure decrease in the fracture modeling we assumed that strain changes were concentrated only in each observed fracture line fujiwara et al 2016 and continued vertically in the upper crust considering their normal fault and strike slip signatures and that groundwater flowed in fractures preferentially in the actual field not only vertical but also parallel and inclined fractures should be presented however these effects were not considered to simplify the modeling under this assumption porosity hydraulic conductivity pore water pressure in the saturated zone and water saturation in the unsaturated zone were changed in the grids where the new fractures crosscut these property changes were reflected at and after the time of the 2016 kumamoto earthquake in an actual simulation to validate water transportation near fracture systems precisely and to avoid including more than two fractures in one grid the grid system in the horizontal direction was subdivided more finely than that of the original kumamoto model furthermore to identify the depth of water transportation in the upper crust the bottom face of the model was extended from 2 to 10 km below sea level with a vertical resolution of 1 km a conceptual diagram of the modeling for the post seismic fracture systems is shown in fig 9 changes in porosity pore water pressure and water saturation of the grids including the fractures were calculated according to eqs 5 7 5 ϕ ϕ ε 6 p w p w ε c w ϕ 7 s w s w ϕ ϕ here ϕ s w ε and p w are porosity m3 m3 water saturation m3 m3 strain dimensionless and pore water pressure pa of the grids including the fractures caused by the earthquake respectively ϕ s w and p w are the original porosity water saturation and water pressure before the earthquake respectively and c w is the compressibility of water pa 1 strain ε is treated as a positive value water velocity v m s and hydraulic conductivity k m s based on a steady state hele shaw flow between two infinitely long parallel plates separated by distance b m with constant hydraulic gradient j m m e g bear 1972 witherspoon et al 1980 are described by 8 v ρ g b 2 12 μ j 9 k ρ g b 2 12 μ where ρ is the density of water kg m3 μ is the viscosity coefficient of water pa s and g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 and ρ 1000 kg m3 μ 1 0 10 3 pa s and g 9 80665 m s2 were used as universal values the hydraulic conductivity k m s of a grid of width d m including a fracture of width b m was calculated by eq 10 assuming that groundwater flows in the fractures preferentially 10 k ρ g b 3 12 μ d representative width d of grids including these fractures and the estimated value of averaged coseismic volumetric strain ε were 50 m and 2 5 10 5 hosono et al 2019 respectively in the extensional area about 10 of the grids included fractures in this area therefore concentrated strain ε was estimated as 2 5 10 4 fracture width b can be calculated by values d and ε so the hydraulic conductivity k of grids including extensional fractures is calculated to be approximately 1 0 10 2 m s from eq 10 in contrast d and ε in the compressional area were estimated to be 100 m and 5 0 10 5 hosono et al 2019 respectively most grids included compressional fractures in this area therefore we hypothesized ε had the same absolute value as ε finally k of grids including compressional fractures was estimated to be approximately 1 0 10 3 m s from eq 10 these estimated values were used as intrinsic permeability k converted from hydraulic conductivities k using density ρ gravity acceleration g and viscosity coefficient μ of the universal values in an actual simulation these values are significantly higher than the original hydraulic conductivities in extensional areas of 1 0 10 9 to 2 5 10 3 m s and in compressional areas of 1 0 10 8 to 1 0 10 4 m s these hypothesized values are under ideal conditions that may apply but could also vary according to the heterogeneity in the field we have tested the sensitivity of these parameters and confirmed that these are not fundamental parameters instead we found that the depth of fractures is the most sensitive parameter for reproducing water levels and discharges thus we think these hypothesized values are relevant because it is impossible to observe the depth of each fracture many calculation trials were performed by changing the depth of these fractures manually as unknown parameters until we reproduced the observed changes in groundwater levels river flow rates and spring discharges after the earthquake 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of coseismic change scenarios by different numerical experiments in this study three numerical experiments experiments 1 to 3 were performed in the model incorporating all possible parameter change patterns caused by the earthquake to test the most reliable hypothesis table 1 in experiment 1 the surface elevation changes reported by the geospatial information authority of japan http www gsi go jp bousai h27 kumamoto earthquake index html were considered in which only the shift of the elevation head was reflected in the model in experiment 2 we assumed that the crustal expansion was homogeneous around the suizenji fault area see fig 1 the extensional area where suizenji fault systems developed defined after hosono et al 2019 and compressional faults area in the form of many microcracks and crustal fractures did not crosscut the aquitard and were not across different aquifer systems in this case averaged strain changes were considered homogeneously over the areas in addition to the elevation changes which was modeled by changing the porosity water pressure and water saturation based on eqs 5 7 but concentrated strain ε replaced averaged strain ε the hydraulic conductivity was not changed because the averaged strain less than the order of 10 5 was small and microcracks were assumed to be nonconsecutive a previous study suggested that this hypothesis is unlikely as the major cause to explain the observed hydrological changes based on comparison analysis of changes between water levels and the calculated strain at each screen depth hosono et al 2019 however we conducted this experiment to ensure model reproducibility in experiment 3 the strains induced by the earthquake were assumed to be concentrated in the fractures only which were modeled by changing the hydraulic conductivity in addition to the other parameters fig 10 shows the result of experiment 1 comparing the observed and simulated groundwater level changes 35 min after the mainshock for the wells located in the suizenji fault area for unconfined and confined aquifers there were no significant responses of the groundwater level in the simulated results thus this hypothesis that the surface elevation is changed by coseismic displacement cannot explain the observed water level changes in experiment 2 we could simulate some groundwater level drops in the suizenji fault area depending on the depth of the microcrack area however this scenario could not explain the observations that the river discharge decreased in the suizenji fault area for the first 12 h fig 11 the sharp spring discharge increased for 1 week after the mainshock fig 12 and the groundwater level increased after the initial water drop continuing for at least several months fig 13 therefore experiment 2 did not reproduce the observed changes in water levels and discharges satisfactorily in numerical experiment 3 many trial and error calibrations were conducted by changing the depths of each fracture manually to reproduce the observed changes after the earthquake fig 14 shows the examples of the trial and error calibration of water levels comparing the observed and simulated groundwater level changes 35 min after the mainshock for the wells located in the suizenji fault area for confined aquifers assuming that the fracture depth extends 10 and 5 km uniformly in addition fig 15 shows the examples of the trial and error calibration comparing the measured and simulated groundwater level time series for an observed well downstream of the compressional area in the western aso caldera rim mountains with hypothesized fracture depths of 100 and 500 m it was found that the groundwater level changes could be reproduced by calibrating the fracture depths in addition there were large responses in river flow rate and spring discharge immediately after the mainshock in this modeling scheme the main reason why there was not good agreement in numerical experiment 2 in the long term groundwater level fluctuation river flow rate and spring discharge was the absence of the hydraulic conductivity change thus the scenario supported by experiment 3 is most plausible to explain the hydrological changes observed after the earthquake comprehensively we tried to identify the depth distributions of the post seismic fracture systems more precisely using models in the following section this trial allowed us to calculate transported water volume 3 2 hydrological changes caused by the 2016 kumamoto earthquake quantitative assessment preliminary research using the same model hosono et al 2019 with the same condition shown as experiment 3 reproduced the groundwater level drops 35 min after the mainshock for both unconfined and confined aquifers in the suizenji fault area by adjusting depths of the fracture systems around this area fig 16 the total re distributed water missing water transported into the upper crust volume due to the formation of new extensional fracture systems was estimated as approximately 10 6 m3 hosono et al 2019 here we tried to reproduce the long term coseismic water level changes including the post seismic water level rise after the initial water drops that were greatest in the eastern recharge areas of the regional groundwater flow systems at the western foot of the aso caldera mountains fig 17 shows the long term groundwater level fluctuations of the observed and simulated values for wells a b and c these stations are representative monitoring sites for validating changes in confined aquifers in these areas and are located downstream of the compressional fault area in the western aso caldera rim mountains see fig 6 for their locations the blue circles show observed data and the red lines show the simulated results with the same model conditions as numerical experiment 3 but with variable fracture depths which incorporated changes in parameters including elevation porosity water pressure water saturation and hydraulic conductivity the green dashed lines show the simulation results with the model conditions used in numerical experiment 1 which incorporated surface elevation changes only without the property changes the groundwater levels decrease gradually until the end of june 2016 and then increase in the high water season peaking in august following annual hydrological cycles and thus experiment 1 does not explain the observed water levels for all wells in the observations the water levels dropped immediately after the mainshock although this was not obvious in well a which is located far from the suizenji fault systems after this initial drop the water level rose even during may and june and increased more dramatically during july and august this two step water level increase and even the initial water drop were reproduced by the model including the property changes the rapid recovery of the water level drop in the model means that the pore pressure recovered quickly after the water compensated for the low pressure in the crustal cracks the water increase from may to june reflected the addition of waters coseismically released from the mountains and that from july to august reflected the addition of mountain waters and heavier precipitation in the rainy season fig 18 shows the comparison between measured and simulated with experiments 1 and 3 spring discharges reflecting seasonal fluctuations and coseismic effects at tateno spring observation station located at the mountain foot although the simulated discharges were volumetrically smaller than the measured values the two step water level increase was reproduced well in the spring discharges with the model including the property changes in the monthly data corresponding well to the groundwater level results in addition the sharp increase in spring discharges just after the mainshock was reproduced fairly well in the daily data the spring discharge increase corresponds to the increase in surface river flow rate that began during the 12 h after the mainshock after the initial water level drop during the first 12 h in the suizenji fault area fig 19 however this river discharge increase might be the combination of coseismic mountain water release precipitation and loss of outlet water from the main river due to damage to irrigation channels the distribution of the estimated depths of the coseismic fractures is provided in fig 20 which we used in our model to reproduce observed hydrological changes after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake in general the depths of these fractures in the extensional area are much deeper than those in the compressional area it would be difficult to practically illustrate these 3d fracture distributions by other methods such as geological survey and our results demonstrate the potential usefulness of hydrological analysis to determine subsurface property changes after disasters however these depth distributions are not the only representative view in the field because there must be other fractures under the surface that are hidden at the surface in this case we must have overestimated the fracture depths furthermore our modeling still has limitations in its capacity to visualize field events precisely such as the size of model grids for instance it is difficult to express the locations of the fractures on the field scale and this may produce discrepancies between observations and calculation results other examples include the decrease in river water in the suizenji fault area that is not correctly reproduced within a given time resolution within 12 h fig 19 which may be due to the gap between the field and limited modeling conditions nevertheless our work reveals that only the model with the parameter changes can reproduce the coseismic changes in groundwater levels and river and spring discharges simultaneously identifying the 3d distribution of property changes allows us to calculate transported water volume using the simulation model the volume of released waters from mountains area shown in fig 20 was calculated to be approximately 10 8 m3 from decrease of water levels in the mountains due to the increased permeability caused by fracturing this volume was consistent in order with the volume derived from the net water increase in the kumamoto groundwater area see fig 6 during the 8 months after the earthquake which was obtained by subtracting the water volume calculated in experiment 1 from that calculated in experiment 3 changes in permeability after the earthquake e g by clogging were not considered we confirmed that the released water from mountains are volumetrically greater by 2 orders of magnitude than the missing waters along deep fractures around the suizenji fault area 4 conclusions and implications a recent study revealed that coseismic surface water and groundwater drawdown along crustal fractures occurred immediately after the mainshock of the 2016 kumamoto earthquake the study also suggested that coseismic mountain water release due to the increase in permeability caused by fracturing subsequently increased the water levels in the downslope area our model incorporating property changes in these fracture systems successfully reproduced overall observed hydrological behaviors by changing the depth of fractures this result demonstrated that the observed post seismic hydrological changes can reasonably be explained by the mechanisms proposed in the recent study the result also suggested that coseismic mountain water release played a volumetrically important role in overall hydrological alteration systems after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake however this aspect should be verified in future research to understand variability in volume of water re distribution associated with different earthquakes in other fields our study illustrates that the 3d surface subsurface seamless fully physically based watershed model is useful for understanding changes in surface and groundwater flows caused by earthquakes quantitatively which can be applied broadly elsewhere moreover the constructed 3d distribution of fracture systems improves our understanding of subsurface damage distribution and seismotectonic features further consideration of the time transient hydraulic property changes such as hydraulic conductivity and porosity for instance by clogging is needed to understand complete long term hydrological behaviors after large crustal earthquakes credit authorship contribution statement yasuhiro tawara conceptualization

relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature is of great importance for predicting precipitation extremes in the future given the rapid increase of global warming this study investigates the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature over mainland china based on the china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the soil and water assessment tool cmads the relationship between extreme precipitation and daily maximum temperature before rainfall as well as that between relative humidity and daily mean temperature is investigated the results show that 1 among the patterns of the relationship between extreme precipitation and corresponding daily mean temperature the peak pattern is dominant over mainland china accounting for 95 80 of all the patterns 2 a scaling of extreme precipitation with daily mean temperature greater than that represented by the c c scaling is observed in most parts of china 3 the peak point extreme precipitation decreases from the southeast to the northwest of china whereas the peak point temperature ranges from 15 c to 25 c 4 for most regions of china the decreases in the relative humidity and the cooling effect of heavy extreme precipitation and its synoptic system contribute to the peak or negative pattern of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature and 5 compared with the cooling effect the decrease of relative humidity is the first order reason for the peak or negative pattern of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature keywords c c relationship extreme precipitation temperature reverse pattern cooling effect relative humidity 1 introduction extreme precipitation is one of the most important meteorological factors because of its association with many natural hazards such as floods landslides and debris flows which pose substantial risks to human society johnson et al 2016 katsanos et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 marfai et al 2015 robinson et al 2016 in particular urban flooding caused by extreme precipitation is the primary reason for the recent casualties in urban areas engel et al 2017 singh et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 understanding of changes in precipitation extremes is crucial to improve the resilience of human society to natural hazards caused by extreme precipitation since the complicated dynamics and thermodynamics of precipitation remain poorly understood emori and brown 2005 ma et al 2016 woldemeskel et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 many researchers turn to investigate the relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature to better explain changes in extreme precipitation allen and ingram 2002 peleg et al 2018 pumo et al 2019 the clausius clapeyron c c relation indicates that the water holding capacity of the atmosphere increases with warming at an exponential growth rate of 6 7 per 1 c with constant globally averaged relative humidity hardwick jones et al 2010 o gorman and muller 2010 sherwood et al 2010 soden and held 2006 because it is generally agreed that extreme precipitation tends to precipitate out all of the moisture in the local atmosphere the relationship between precipitation extremes and the temperature is controlled by the c c relationship allen and ingram 2002 gao et al 2018b wang et al 2017 however many studies show that the relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature is not always consistent with the c c relationship and instead varies considerably among regions and seasons ali et al 2018 berg et al 2009 utsumi et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 utsumi et al 2011 identified the global relationship between extreme daily precipitation and daily mean temperature and found that extreme daily precipitation increases decreases monotonously with daily mean atmosphere temperature warming at high low latitudes they also found peaks in the relationship curves between extreme daily precipitation and daily mean temperature at middle latitudes which means that extreme daily precipitation increases with warming at low temperatures and reverses at high temperatures their findings were confirmed by many other studies conducted worldwide chan et al 2016 gao et al 2018b maeda et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 based on global station based observations ali et al 2018 reported that temperature seasonality has a significant effect on the linkage between precipitation extremes and near surface air temperature as well as that between extreme precipitation and the dew point temperature berg et al 2009 found that extreme daily precipitation increases with warming at a rate limited by the c c relationship in winter but decreases at high temperatures in summer in europe however the peak structure of the relationship between precipitation extremes and atmospheric temperature does not imply that an upper limit for future precipitation exists wang et al 2017 found that extreme precipitation and its corresponding temperature at its peak increased with warming based on climate model simulations pfahl et al 2017 decomposed the contributions to the change in daily extreme precipitation into thermodynamic and dynamic factors using a physical diagnostic method their results indicate that the future variation in precipitation extremes with increasing temperature will be caused mainly by dynamic contribution and that the scaling rate between extreme precipitation and temperature might not be constant lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 found that the scaling rate changes from a rate consistent with the c c scaling rate to that approximately twice that value when the temperature increases across 12 c pumo et al 2019 highlighted the importance of using appropriate modelling assumptions and quantified the uncertainty in the estimation of the scaling rate they observed an increasing scaling rate for decreasing rainfall accumulation periods from 60 to 10 min in a semi arid region furthermore they detected the occurrence of peak patterns particularly during the driest season of the year their results are in agreement with those of other analyses in arid and semi arid regions e g berg et al 2009 hardwick jones et al 2010 the deviation of the relationship between precipitation extremes and atmospheric temperature from the c c relationship has been heavily studied in recent years mishra et al 2012 panthou et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 and has been attributed to the following factors 1 the atmospheric moisture at higher temperatures is limited which means that the relative humidity at higher temperatures does not remain stable barbero et al 2018 herath et al 2018 2 the cooling effect of extreme precipitation such as evaporative cooling of the rain can decrease the temperature and move the extreme precipitation to bins with lower temperature bao et al 2017 3 statistical methods that do not consider rainfall duration can also contribute to the decrease in the scaling rate at high temperatures gao et al 2018b wasko et al 2015 and 4 the binning method used to identify the conditioning extreme precipitation on daily temperature combines different rainfall types including stratiform rainfall convective rainfall and the mixing of the two types which might affect the scaling rate monlar et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 among these factors the decrease in relative humidity at higher temperatures and the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation are generally considered to be the main explanations for the peak structure however which theory is disputed some researchers ascribe the downward trend of the relationship between precipitation extremes and daily temperatures at high temperatures to the cooling effect of extreme precipitation and the properties of the synoptic atmosphere such that colder air is generally found in low pressure systems barbero et al 2018 gao et al 2018b this is because the evaporation of precipitation can absorb substantial amounts of latent heat and local saturated downdraughts can cool the atmosphere in addition the temperature bin containing extreme precipitation can be moved to cooler temperature bins because of the cooling effect which enables peak structures or negative scaling to develop based on observations in darwin australia bao et al 2017 found that the daily temperature decreases several days prior to the occurrence of extreme precipitation and reverts to normal levels afterward this phenomenon was more obvious with heavy precipitation extremes than in smaller events therefore they attributed the negative pattern of the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding daily temperatures to the cooling effects of extreme precipitation and atmospheric properties when the precipitation extreme occurs however barbero et al 2018 argued that the variation in daily temperature in the days approaching the extreme precipitation occurrence is caused by the temporal autocorrelation properties of synoptic systems furthermore they verified the argument and obtained the same results as those reported by bao et al 2017 using sampling data based on the temporal autocorrelation of synoptic systems however many studies consider the decrease in relative humidity at high temperatures rather than the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation and its accompanying synoptic systems to be the main reason for the peak or negative pattern of the relationship between precipitation extremes and corresponding temperatures barbero et al 2018 roderick et al 2019 the relative humidity has shown a decreasing trend with increasing temperature at high temperatures hardwick jones et al 2010 lepore et al 2015 panthou et al 2014 peleg et al 2018 this phenomenon undermines the assumption of the c c relationship such that relative humidity tends to remain stable with increasing temperature and implies that the c c law would fail at high temperatures however there may be two main explanations for the decrease of the relative humidity the first explanation is that very high temperatures relate to a large saturation deficit and high specific humidity which decreases the specific humidity gradient from oceans to lands and thus decreases the water transport from oceans to lands the second is that extreme precipitation can lead to decreases in relative humidity utsumi et al 2011 however whether a decrease in relative humidity causes a decrease in extreme precipitation or vice versa is debatable moreover the reason for the peak structure can vary among geographical locations and synoptic types detailed analysis based on data of relatively high spatial resolution at less than tens of kilometers as determined by the coverage of convective precipitation and broader spatial coverage is needed to illustrate whether the cooling effect and the decrease in relative humidity contribute to the peak structure and which factor is dominant to the best of our knowledge such analysis has not been performed in china satellite based and reanalysis datasets are widely used owing to their higher spatial and temporal resolutions particularly in ungauged regions tian et al 2018 zhu et al 2019a b the daily precipitation and temperature employed in the present study were derived from the china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the soil and water assessment tool model cmads this dataset which was developed by china agricultural university incorporates technologies of local analysis and prediction system space time multiscale analysis system laps stmas and is constructed with multiple technologies and scientific methods including loop nesting of data the projection of resampling models and bilinear interpolation www cmads org this study is based on the following objectives 1 to comprehensively investigate the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding daily temperatures over mainland china including ungauged regions such as the tibetan plateau 2 to compare the apparent relationship patterns with the theoretical c c relationship and 3 to identify the reasons for the peak patterns of the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the materials and methods used in this study section 3 presents a detailed analysis of the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures in mainland china which is used to identify the reasons for the peak patterns further discussion is given in section 4 and a short conclusion of the study is presented in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data mainland china was selected as the study area the highly variable topography of this region with altitudes ranging from less than 10 m in the east to more than 5000 m in the west combined with its broad span of latitudes and longitudes result in complex and various climate patterns the five main climate patterns in mainland china include tropical monsoon subtropical monsoon temperate monsoon temperate continental and plateau mountain the daily precipitation and daily atmospheric temperature as well as the relative humidity derived from the cmads v1 1 dataset were used in this study the precipitation data of cmads were merged using the global precipitation products of the climate prediction center morphing method cmorph fan et al 2017 with observations from nearly 40 000 regional stations and 131 radar detection stations as well as data from the national meteorological information center of china the latter contains daily precipitation observations from 2400 national meteorological stations and the cmorph satellite s inversion precipitation products meng et al 2018 a two step data integration method combining probability density function matching and optimal interpolation was used to merge the data the accuracy of the cmads dataset over china has been verified by many studies gao et al 2018a guo et al 2018 liu et al 2018 moreover comparisons of heavy precipitation events between cmads and the monitored data in china show that cmads is able to effectively estimate heavy precipitation events therefore this dataset is appropriate for use in the studies of precipitation extremes meng et al 2018 the air temperature and humidity were integrated through the laps stmas system xie et al 2011 and their accuracy has also been verified in many studies meng et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 the period of the dataset is from january 1 2008 to december 31 2016 and its spatial resolution is 0 25 the study area includes 15 385 grids that are divided by evenly distributed longitudes and latitudes of 0 25 fig 2 all of the data are available online at www cmads org 2 2 methods according to the assumption that extreme precipitation tends to precipitate out all of the available moisture in the air the relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature can be revealed by the c c relationship allen and ingram 2002 which describes the extreme precipitation as a function of temperature in this study we identified the relationships of extreme precipitation and the daily mean temperature on the day of rainfall hereafter referred to simply as daily mean temperature daily maximum temperature of the day before the extreme precipitation tmaxb and dew point temperature on the day of rainfall dpt first the temperature was sliced into many equal bins with a size of 0 5 c and the precipitation was then classified according to the temperature bins for temperature bins having more than 100 precipitation values the average of values greater than the 99th percentile of all precipitation values in a temperature bin were defined as the extreme precipitation of that bin this is because the equal bin method can cause different precipitation samples to be assigned to different temperature bins which means that the same percentile might not represent the same extreme level among the different temperature bins the selected technology has been used to calculate scaling rates in previous studies wang et al 2017 moreover the linear regression method which was used to calculate scaling rates in this and many other studies ali et al 2018 lenderink et al 2018 is theoretically based on average values temperature bins with less than 100 precipitation values were discarded the extracted daily precipitation extremes and the corresponding bin temperatures were smoothed using a six bin moving window averaging method before they were used to identify the scaling relationship linear regression was fitted with the logarithm of extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature to calculate the scaling rates a bootstrapping procedure with 100 bootstraps is used to identify the uncertainty related to the apparent scaling rates peleg et al 2018 in this study the extreme precipitation analysis is based on data gathering on all days of years together rather than that of days in specific seasons in defining the precipitation extremes the 99th percentile was acquired based on all days instead of only rainfall days some studies show that the percentile based on all days is more effective for assessing changes in precipitation extremes than that based on wet days schär et al 2016 wang et al 2017 previous studies show that a binning method with equal width is less robust than that with equal sample numbers on the condition of limited sample size in which each temperature bin has the same number of precipitation values ali et al 2018 barbero et al 2018 wasko et al 2014 pumo et al 2019 however the equal sample number binning method can lead to non uniform temperature coordinates with more temperature coordinates within a relatively small temperature interval because more temperatures at least in mainland china appear in a specific temperature interval consequently this method might not capture the variation in the precipitation temperature curve particularly at high temperatures moreover the actual peak point could be missed because accurate detection of different relation patterns is important for understanding the linkage between precipitation extremes and corresponding temperatures the binning method with equal width was used in this study however it should be noted that the binning method combines different types of precipitation extremes together and can lead to confusion in understanding the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures zhang et al 2017 the average of the precipitation values higher than the 99th percentile of all precipitation values is used to define the extreme precipitation which can lead to errors if abnormal precipitation extreme occur considering such abnormal precipitation extremes the median precipitation values are generally more appropriate however we compared the scaling rates derived from average values and median values and found no apparent difference between them likely because the median and the average of the values higher than the 99th percentile are very close we divided the relationship between the precipitation extremes and the corresponding daily temperatures into three different types positive negative and peak pattern the peak pattern refers to that extreme daily precipitation increases with warming at low temperatures and reverses at high temperatures and was further divided into two categories of positive and negative peak patterns according to the position of the peak point temperature fig 1 gives typical examples of different relationship patterns mathematically two segment piecewise regression pr was used to detect the different relationship patterns because it can be utilized to explore changes in the scaling rate at a certain temperature point pumo et al 2019 based on the pr analysis the break point at which the scaling rate has the largest variation in the temperature series can be identified and the scaling rates before and after the break point can be obtained hereafter s1 and s2 are used to refer to scaling rates before the break point and that after the break point respectively if both s1 and s2 are bigger less than 0 the rainfall temperature pair sets are considered to have a positive negative pattern fig 1 a and b if s1 is bigger than 0 and s2 is less than 0 the rainfall temperature pair sets are considered to have a peak pattern fig 1 c and d for the rainfall temperature pair set with peak pattern a positive peak pattern is considered to have occurred if its peak point temperature is in the right half of the set fig 1 c otherwise it is considered that a negative peak pattern occurred fig 1 d the scaling rate of the temperature dependence of the extreme precipitation was calculated according to different relationship patterns for the rainfall temperature pair set with peak pattern the scaling rate of the more extended rainfall temperature pairs segment was used to represent the scaling rate of the entire rainfall temperature pairs set for the rainfall temperature pair set with positive or negative pattern linear regression was used to calculate the scaling rate 3 results 3 1 relationship between daily extreme precipitation and daily mean temperature the spatial distribution of relationship patterns for daily extreme precipitation and daily mean temperature is shown in fig 2 most of the studied areas showed peak patterns accounting for 95 80 of the studied areas of which 81 15 and 14 65 were positive and negative respectively only 3 74 of all grids in the studied areas had negative patterns whereas 0 46 showed positive patterns the temperature range can be restricted between 5 c and 25 c considering a temperature uncertainty of less than 5 c and above 25 c and the limitation of relative humidity at very high temperatures peleg et al 2018 in such cases the proportion of the peak pattern decreased to 88 48 with positive and the negative patterns accounting 78 23 and 10 25 respectively whereas the proportion of the positive pattern increased to 7 78 however the grids with negative patterns remained stable amounting to 3 74 the peak pattern was also the predominant pattern negative and positive patterns were distributed mostly in western china grids with negative patterns were located mostly in the himalayan kunlun qilian tianshan altai and hengduan mountains whereas those showing positive patterns occurred mostly in the eastern foots of the kunlun qilian and hengduan mountains 3 2 spatial distribution of scaling rates scaling rates were calculated for all grids in the study area fig 3 shows that the scaling rate varied among the grids with the median of the scaling rates of bootstraps used the grids in which the scaling rate was approximately consistent with the c c relationship between 6 and 7 were distributed mostly in the eastern part of the hu line which begins in aihui county in northeastern china and extends to tengchong city in the southwest and is highly consistent with the isohyet of 400 mm gao et al 2018b shenghe et al 2016 the grids with negative scaling rates were mostly distributed in western china particularly in tibet and in the xinjiang province grids with scaling rates greater than 15 were located mostly in north china and central china the proportions of scaling rates at different intervals are shown in table 1 the results show that scaling rates between 10 and 15 accounted for the maximum percentage at 31 0 those between 0 and 5 accounted for the minimum percentage at 3 7 and those greater than 15 accounted for 24 3 we randomly selected one grid for each type of climate pattern to illustrate the uncertainties of the calculated scaling rates as shown in fig 4 the scaling rates were limited by uncertainties in the samples which varied among the climate patterns 3 3 peak point extreme precipitation and corresponding temperature the spatial distribution of the peak point extreme precipitation is shown in fig 5 a the results show that the peak point decreased from the southeast to the northwest regions of china in which the median of the peak point extreme precipitation of all bootstraps was used the peak point extreme precipitations of grids with negative scaling rates were usually less than 50 mm whereas those greater than 150 mm tended to occur in grids with scaling rates between 5 and 10 the spatial distribution of the peak point temperature is shown in fig 5 b the peak point temperature in most regions of china ranged from 15 c to 25 c except for that in the tibetan plateau and some mountainous areas 3 4 relationship between daily extreme precipitation and daily maximum temperature to determine whether the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation and its corresponding synoptic systems was the main cause of the peak or the negative pattern of the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures the relationship between the extreme precipitation and the tmaxb value was analyzed tmaxb is assumed to be less affected by precipitation extremes over china and is relatively robust because the durations of the precipitation extremes are generally short form several hours to about one day gao et al 2018b and the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation and its synoptic system is temporary by comparing the relationship pattern for extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature with that for extreme precipitation and the corresponding tmaxb the cooling effect on the relationship pattern for daily extreme precipitation and daily mean temperature can be proved the spatial distribution of patterns of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding tmaxb is shown in fig 6 the distributions of different patterns of the relationship between extreme precipitation and corresponding tmaxb over china were approximately the same as those of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature peak patterns were found in most areas of china accounting for 96 88 of which the positive and negative peak patterns accounted for 86 88 and 10 00 respectively however monotonic decreasing and increasing patterns were found mostly in mountainous areas of west china amounting to 2 52 and 0 60 respectively compared with the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature that between extreme precipitation and the corresponding tmaxb had a slightly more pronounced peak structure pattern and fewer occurrences of other patterns although the distribution of the patterns of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperatures is similar to that of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding tmaxb in mainland china differences were noted in some local regions the relationship pattern for extreme precipitation and corresponding temperature changed from the peak pattern to the positive pattern when the independent variable changed from the daily mean temperature to tmaxb at those grids we randomly selected two grids with the peak pattern for the relationship between precipitation extremes and the daily mean temperatures and with the positive pattern for the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding tmaxb to illustrate the details of these differences the two types of the relationship for these selected grids are compared in fig 7 the figure shows that the relationship pattern for extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature changed from a peak structure pattern to a monotonically increasing pattern when the independent variable changed from the daily mean temperature to the tmaxb in these randomly selected grids this implies that the peak pattern in the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures was indeed caused by the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation itself and its accompanying synoptic systems in some regions of china however those regions are relatively sparse and the distribution of these regions does not show distinct apparent features 3 5 relationship between daily relative humidity and daily mean temperature to illustrate whether the decrease of relative humidity is the first order reason for the decrease in precipitation extremes we analyzed three types of relationships between the relative humidity and daily mean temperature including that between relative humidity rh0 and daily mean temperature when the extreme precipitation occurs that between relative humidity on the day before the extreme precipitation rhneg and the daily mean temperature and that between the relative humidity of the day after the extreme precipitation rhpos and the daily mean temperature the indicators rh0 rhneg and rhpos are used to identify the effect of extreme precipitation on relative humidity we selected four grids randomly to show the variety in the relative humidity rh0 rhneg and rhpos with increasing daily mean temperatures in different situations of the four grids two showed peak patterns of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature and two showed negative patterns fig 8 illustrates the relationship between relative humidity rh0 rhneg and rhpos and the daily mean temperature at grids showing peak patterns rh0 rhneg and rhpos had apparent downward trends after a specific temperature was reached because the duration of extreme precipitation events in china is usually less than one day gao et al 2018b they cannot affect rhneg physically therefore we can infer that the decrease in relative humidity at high temperatures is not caused by extreme precipitation in addition the change point temperature of relative humidity is highly consistent with the peak point temperature of extreme precipitation this implies that the decrease in relative humidity at high temperatures is the main reason for the peak pattern of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature according to the fluctuation characteristics of the three indicators the decreasing rate of rhpos is obviously less than that of the two other indicators this might be attributed to the relatively lower temperatures on the day after the extreme precipitation owing to the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation and its synoptic system the low temperatures can decrease the maximum moisture capacity of the air therefore this also implies that heavy precipitation can lower the temperature and further promote the generation of peak structures of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature fig 9 illustrates the relationship between the relative humidity rh0 rhneg and rhpos and the daily mean temperature at grids showing negative patterns in the relationship between the extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperatures this situation differs from that shown in fig 8 although the three relative humidity indicators showed decreasing trends at higher temperatures for most grids such as that shown in fig 9 a the relative humidity in some grids remained stable or even increased at high temperatures such as that shown in fig 9 b in these grids the behavior of the precipitation temperature relationship and the rh temperature relationship was not correlated at high temperatures this implies the contribution of other factors to the peak structure such as the cooling effect or rainfall duration grid 174 104 showed a negative pattern for the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature although its relative humidity remained non decreasing the relationship between the extreme precipitation and the tmaxb at this grid was analyzed as shown in fig 10 the relationship between the extreme precipitation and the daily mean temperature had an obviously negative pattern whereas that between the extreme precipitation and the tmaxb did not these results indicate a contradiction such that the decrease in extreme precipitation with non decreasing humidity was caused by the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation and its synoptic system 4 discussion the analysis given in this and many previous studies shows that relative humidity does not always remain stable with increasing temperature in many regions which means that the underlying assumption of the c c relationship is not satisfied because the dew point temperature can exclude the effects of the humidity limitations many researchers have suggested that dpt is a more appropriate primary scaling variable ali et al 2018 barbero et al 2018 wasko et al 2018 lenderink et al 2018 panthou et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 to identify the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding dpt we calculated the dpt using the magnus formula lawrence 2005 which includes relative humidity and temperature as inputs the result showed that the proportions of the peak pattern the positive pattern and the negative pattern for extreme precipitation and dpt were 82 52 8 70 and 8 78 respectively with the positive and negative peak patterns of the first proportion accounting for 73 52 and 9 00 respectively compared with the relationship patterns for extreme precipitation and daily mean temperature the positive and negative patterns for extreme precipitation and dpt increased from 0 64 to 8 70 and 3 74 to 8 78 respectively and the peak pattern for daily extreme precipitation and dpt decreased from 95 80 to 82 52 qualitatively the relationship between the precipitation extreme and the corresponding dpt were closer to the c c with more regions showing positive patterns however the peak structure also controls most areas of mainland china which also implies that factors other than relative humidity affect the relationship between extreme precipitation and corresponding temperature because cmads does not provide accurate dew point temperature data and the method used for its calculation can cause uncertainties because of some parameters used in the calculation we focused only on the relationship patterns for extreme precipitation and the corresponding dew point temperature in this study to further understand this relationship accurate dew point temperature data are needed the temperature dependence of extreme precipitation in mainland china has been investigated in previous research gao et al 2018b wang et al 2017 wasko et al 2016 although these studies confirm the overwhelming distribution of the peak pattern wang et al 2017 and the variation in scaling rates gao et al 2018b wasko et al 2016 over mainland china they do not explain the deviation between the apparent relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures and the c c relationship based on data analysis the scaling rates identified in this study are slightly less than those of wasko et al 2016 which can be attributed to different definitions of extreme precipitation the 99th percentile was used to define the extreme precipitation in this study whereas the 90th percentile is used by wasko et al 2016 other research pumo et al 2019 showed that a higher percentile leads to higher scaling rates some studies demonstrated that rainfall intermittency has a significant impact on the relationship patterns for extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature and on scaling rates gao et al 2018b ali et al 2018 schleiss 2018 and contributes to the deviation of relationship patterns from the c c schleiss 2018 proposed a new model considering rainfall intermittency to describe the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures this model can describe a relationship pattern for extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature and scaling rates close to that reflected by the c c relation however the model s consideration of the effect of rainfall intermittency on scaling rates focuses more on the precipitation intensity than the amount given that the model introduces a multiplicative correction term to modify the precipitation amount in the new model the variable of precipitation amount is essentially the average intensity of a precipitation event within a specific precipitation duration the relationship between the average intensity extremes of a precipitation event and the corresponding temperatures over mainland china have been described in previous research using observed hourly precipitation data gao et al 2018b in most regions positive patterns were observed such as those described by c c the present study did not consider the effect of rainfall intermittency because data with sufficient temporal resolution were not available however because high precipitation intensity does not necessarily represent large amounts of precipitation the prediction of precipitation amount extremes in a relatively larger timescale such as daily is to some extent meaningful for flood management in large basins the daily precipitation data used in this study were derived from cmads which incorporates the global precipitation products of cmorph with observations from nearly 40 000 regional stations and data from 131 radar detection stations in china as well as the data of the national meteorological information center of china although many studies gao et al 2018a guo et al 2018 liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 have proved its capacity for estimating precipitation including extreme events the cmads products still have limitations most of the observation stations used to merge the dataset including regional stations national meteorological stations and radar detection stations are located in eastern china this can lead to relatively low accuracy of the dataset in northwestern and southwestern china moreover the interpolation used to produce the dataset might ignore the impacts of local topography which can lead to underestimation of some extreme precipitation these limitations can result in uncertainties in the scaling rates further studies based on multiple data sources should be performed to improve the credibility of the results presented in this study although research based on daily data is meaningful in many hydrological applications such as flood control and water resource management studies based on sub daily data are important for understanding the influence of dynamic factors on the temperature dependence of extreme precipitation peleg et al 2018 pumo et al 2019 schleiss 2018 wasko et al 2015 the present study focuses on the relationship between daily extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperatures owing to the limitations of the dataset therefore to further investigate the reason for the deviation between the apparent scaling rates and the c c relation in mainland china studies based on sub daily data are needed 5 conclusions the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature is of great importance for understanding the thermodynamic characteristics of extreme precipitation and for predicting extreme precipitation in the warming future this study comprehensively investigated the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature over china based on the cmads merge with satellite based data reanalysis data and gauge observations compared the apparent relationship patterns for extreme precipitation and daily mean temperature with the c c relation and identified the reason for the peak or negative patterns in the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature the following conclusions were drawn 1 the peak pattern of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature was the dominant pattern over mainland china accounting for 95 80 2 the scaling of extreme precipitation with the corresponding daily mean temperature varied significantly throughout mainland china and the scaling of extreme precipitation with daily mean temperature greater than that represented by the c c scaling is observed in most parts of china 3 the peak point extreme precipitation decreased from the southeast to the northwest in mainland china and the peak point temperature ranged from 15 c to 25 c 4 for most regions of china the peak or negative pattern of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature was caused by the coupling effects of the decrease in relative humidity and the cooling effect of extreme heavy precipitation and its synoptic system and 5 the decrease in relative humidity was the first order reason for reverse or negative patterns even though the cooling effect was the main cause in some regions credit authorship contribution statement xichao gao conceptualization methodology software validation

introduction extreme precipitation is one of the most important meteorological factors because of its association with many natural hazards such as floods landslides and debris flows which pose substantial risks to human society johnson et al 2016 katsanos et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 marfai et al 2015 robinson et al 2016 in particular urban flooding caused by extreme precipitation is the primary reason for the recent casualties in urban areas engel et al 2017 singh et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 understanding of changes in precipitation extremes is crucial to improve the resilience of human society to natural hazards caused by extreme precipitation since the complicated dynamics and thermodynamics of precipitation remain poorly understood emori and brown 2005 ma et al 2016 woldemeskel et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 many researchers turn to investigate the relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature to better explain changes in extreme precipitation allen and ingram 2002 peleg et al 2018 pumo et al 2019 the clausius clapeyron c c relation indicates that the water holding capacity of the atmosphere increases with warming at an exponential growth rate of 6 7 per 1 c with constant globally averaged relative humidity hardwick jones et al 2010 o gorman and muller 2010 sherwood et al 2010 soden and held 2006 because it is generally agreed that extreme precipitation tends to precipitate out all of the moisture in the local atmosphere the relationship between precipitation extremes and the temperature is controlled by the c c relationship allen and ingram 2002 gao et al 2018b wang et al 2017 however many studies show that the relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature is not always consistent with the c c relationship and instead varies considerably among regions and seasons ali et al 2018 berg et al 2009 utsumi et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 utsumi et al 2011 identified the global relationship between extreme daily precipitation and daily mean temperature and found that extreme daily precipitation increases decreases monotonously with daily mean atmosphere temperature warming at high low latitudes they also found peaks in the relationship curves between extreme daily precipitation and daily mean temperature at middle latitudes which means that extreme daily precipitation increases with warming at low temperatures and reverses at high temperatures their findings were confirmed by many other studies conducted worldwide chan et al 2016 gao et al 2018b maeda et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 based on global station based observations ali et al 2018 reported that temperature seasonality has a significant effect on the linkage between precipitation extremes and near surface air temperature as well as that between extreme precipitation and the dew point temperature berg et al 2009 found that extreme daily precipitation increases with warming at a rate limited by the c c relationship in winter but decreases at high temperatures in summer in europe however the peak structure of the relationship between precipitation extremes and atmospheric temperature does not imply that an upper limit for future precipitation exists wang et al 2017 found that extreme precipitation and its corresponding temperature at its peak increased with warming based on climate model simulations pfahl et al 2017 decomposed the contributions to the change in daily extreme precipitation into thermodynamic and dynamic factors using a physical diagnostic method their results indicate that the future variation in precipitation extremes with increasing temperature will be caused mainly by dynamic contribution and that the scaling rate between extreme precipitation and temperature might not be constant lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 found that the scaling rate changes from a rate consistent with the c c scaling rate to that approximately twice that value when the temperature increases across 12 c pumo et al 2019 highlighted the importance of using appropriate modelling assumptions and quantified the uncertainty in the estimation of the scaling rate they observed an increasing scaling rate for decreasing rainfall accumulation periods from 60 to 10 min in a semi arid region furthermore they detected the occurrence of peak patterns particularly during the driest season of the year their results are in agreement with those of other analyses in arid and semi arid regions e g berg et al 2009 hardwick jones et al 2010 the deviation of the relationship between precipitation extremes and atmospheric temperature from the c c relationship has been heavily studied in recent years mishra et al 2012 panthou et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 and has been attributed to the following factors 1 the atmospheric moisture at higher temperatures is limited which means that the relative humidity at higher temperatures does not remain stable barbero et al 2018 herath et al 2018 2 the cooling effect of extreme precipitation such as evaporative cooling of the rain can decrease the temperature and move the extreme precipitation to bins with lower temperature bao et al 2017 3 statistical methods that do not consider rainfall duration can also contribute to the decrease in the scaling rate at high temperatures gao et al 2018b wasko et al 2015 and 4 the binning method used to identify the conditioning extreme precipitation on daily temperature combines different rainfall types including stratiform rainfall convective rainfall and the mixing of the two types which might affect the scaling rate monlar et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 among these factors the decrease in relative humidity at higher temperatures and the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation are generally considered to be the main explanations for the peak structure however which theory is disputed some researchers ascribe the downward trend of the relationship between precipitation extremes and daily temperatures at high temperatures to the cooling effect of extreme precipitation and the properties of the synoptic atmosphere such that colder air is generally found in low pressure systems barbero et al 2018 gao et al 2018b this is because the evaporation of precipitation can absorb substantial amounts of latent heat and local saturated downdraughts can cool the atmosphere in addition the temperature bin containing extreme precipitation can be moved to cooler temperature bins because of the cooling effect which enables peak structures or negative scaling to develop based on observations in darwin australia bao et al 2017 found that the daily temperature decreases several days prior to the occurrence of extreme precipitation and reverts to normal levels afterward this phenomenon was more obvious with heavy precipitation extremes than in smaller events therefore they attributed the negative pattern of the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding daily temperatures to the cooling effects of extreme precipitation and atmospheric properties when the precipitation extreme occurs however barbero et al 2018 argued that the variation in daily temperature in the days approaching the extreme precipitation occurrence is caused by the temporal autocorrelation properties of synoptic systems furthermore they verified the argument and obtained the same results as those reported by bao et al 2017 using sampling data based on the temporal autocorrelation of synoptic systems however many studies consider the decrease in relative humidity at high temperatures rather than the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation and its accompanying synoptic systems to be the main reason for the peak or negative pattern of the relationship between precipitation extremes and corresponding temperatures barbero et al 2018 roderick et al 2019 the relative humidity has shown a decreasing trend with increasing temperature at high temperatures hardwick jones et al 2010 lepore et al 2015 panthou et al 2014 peleg et al 2018 this phenomenon undermines the assumption of the c c relationship such that relative humidity tends to remain stable with increasing temperature and implies that the c c law would fail at high temperatures however there may be two main explanations for the decrease of the relative humidity the first explanation is that very high temperatures relate to a large saturation deficit and high specific humidity which decreases the specific humidity gradient from oceans to lands and thus decreases the water transport from oceans to lands the second is that extreme precipitation can lead to decreases in relative humidity utsumi et al 2011 however whether a decrease in relative humidity causes a decrease in extreme precipitation or vice versa is debatable moreover the reason for the peak structure can vary among geographical locations and synoptic types detailed analysis based on data of relatively high spatial resolution at less than tens of kilometers as determined by the coverage of convective precipitation and broader spatial coverage is needed to illustrate whether the cooling effect and the decrease in relative humidity contribute to the peak structure and which factor is dominant to the best of our knowledge such analysis has not been performed in china satellite based and reanalysis datasets are widely used owing to their higher spatial and temporal resolutions particularly in ungauged regions tian et al 2018 zhu et al 2019a b the daily precipitation and temperature employed in the present study were derived from the china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the soil and water assessment tool model cmads this dataset which was developed by china agricultural university incorporates technologies of local analysis and prediction system space time multiscale analysis system laps stmas and is constructed with multiple technologies and scientific methods including loop nesting of data the projection of resampling models and bilinear interpolation www cmads org this study is based on the following objectives 1 to comprehensively investigate the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding daily temperatures over mainland china including ungauged regions such as the tibetan plateau 2 to compare the apparent relationship patterns with the theoretical c c relationship and 3 to identify the reasons for the peak patterns of the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the materials and methods used in this study section 3 presents a detailed analysis of the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures in mainland china which is used to identify the reasons for the peak patterns further discussion is given in section 4 and a short conclusion of the study is presented in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data mainland china was selected as the study area the highly variable topography of this region with altitudes ranging from less than 10 m in the east to more than 5000 m in the west combined with its broad span of latitudes and longitudes result in complex and various climate patterns the five main climate patterns in mainland china include tropical monsoon subtropical monsoon temperate monsoon temperate continental and plateau mountain the daily precipitation and daily atmospheric temperature as well as the relative humidity derived from the cmads v1 1 dataset were used in this study the precipitation data of cmads were merged using the global precipitation products of the climate prediction center morphing method cmorph fan et al 2017 with observations from nearly 40 000 regional stations and 131 radar detection stations as well as data from the national meteorological information center of china the latter contains daily precipitation observations from 2400 national meteorological stations and the cmorph satellite s inversion precipitation products meng et al 2018 a two step data integration method combining probability density function matching and optimal interpolation was used to merge the data the accuracy of the cmads dataset over china has been verified by many studies gao et al 2018a guo et al 2018 liu et al 2018 moreover comparisons of heavy precipitation events between cmads and the monitored data in china show that cmads is able to effectively estimate heavy precipitation events therefore this dataset is appropriate for use in the studies of precipitation extremes meng et al 2018 the air temperature and humidity were integrated through the laps stmas system xie et al 2011 and their accuracy has also been verified in many studies meng et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 the period of the dataset is from january 1 2008 to december 31 2016 and its spatial resolution is 0 25 the study area includes 15 385 grids that are divided by evenly distributed longitudes and latitudes of 0 25 fig 2 all of the data are available online at www cmads org 2 2 methods according to the assumption that extreme precipitation tends to precipitate out all of the available moisture in the air the relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature can be revealed by the c c relationship allen and ingram 2002 which describes the extreme precipitation as a function of temperature in this study we identified the relationships of extreme precipitation and the daily mean temperature on the day of rainfall hereafter referred to simply as daily mean temperature daily maximum temperature of the day before the extreme precipitation tmaxb and dew point temperature on the day of rainfall dpt first the temperature was sliced into many equal bins with a size of 0 5 c and the precipitation was then classified according to the temperature bins for temperature bins having more than 100 precipitation values the average of values greater than the 99th percentile of all precipitation values in a temperature bin were defined as the extreme precipitation of that bin this is because the equal bin method can cause different precipitation samples to be assigned to different temperature bins which means that the same percentile might not represent the same extreme level among the different temperature bins the selected technology has been used to calculate scaling rates in previous studies wang et al 2017 moreover the linear regression method which was used to calculate scaling rates in this and many other studies ali et al 2018 lenderink et al 2018 is theoretically based on average values temperature bins with less than 100 precipitation values were discarded the extracted daily precipitation extremes and the corresponding bin temperatures were smoothed using a six bin moving window averaging method before they were used to identify the scaling relationship linear regression was fitted with the logarithm of extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature to calculate the scaling rates a bootstrapping procedure with 100 bootstraps is used to identify the uncertainty related to the apparent scaling rates peleg et al 2018 in this study the extreme precipitation analysis is based on data gathering on all days of years together rather than that of days in specific seasons in defining the precipitation extremes the 99th percentile was acquired based on all days instead of only rainfall days some studies show that the percentile based on all days is more effective for assessing changes in precipitation extremes than that based on wet days schär et al 2016 wang et al 2017 previous studies show that a binning method with equal width is less robust than that with equal sample numbers on the condition of limited sample size in which each temperature bin has the same number of precipitation values ali et al 2018 barbero et al 2018 wasko et al 2014 pumo et al 2019 however the equal sample number binning method can lead to non uniform temperature coordinates with more temperature coordinates within a relatively small temperature interval because more temperatures at least in mainland china appear in a specific temperature interval consequently this method might not capture the variation in the precipitation temperature curve particularly at high temperatures moreover the actual peak point could be missed because accurate detection of different relation patterns is important for understanding the linkage between precipitation extremes and corresponding temperatures the binning method with equal width was used in this study however it should be noted that the binning method combines different types of precipitation extremes together and can lead to confusion in understanding the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures zhang et al 2017 the average of the precipitation values higher than the 99th percentile of all precipitation values is used to define the extreme precipitation which can lead to errors if abnormal precipitation extreme occur considering such abnormal precipitation extremes the median precipitation values are generally more appropriate however we compared the scaling rates derived from average values and median values and found no apparent difference between them likely because the median and the average of the values higher than the 99th percentile are very close we divided the relationship between the precipitation extremes and the corresponding daily temperatures into three different types positive negative and peak pattern the peak pattern refers to that extreme daily precipitation increases with warming at low temperatures and reverses at high temperatures and was further divided into two categories of positive and negative peak patterns according to the position of the peak point temperature fig 1 gives typical examples of different relationship patterns mathematically two segment piecewise regression pr was used to detect the different relationship patterns because it can be utilized to explore changes in the scaling rate at a certain temperature point pumo et al 2019 based on the pr analysis the break point at which the scaling rate has the largest variation in the temperature series can be identified and the scaling rates before and after the break point can be obtained hereafter s1 and s2 are used to refer to scaling rates before the break point and that after the break point respectively if both s1 and s2 are bigger less than 0 the rainfall temperature pair sets are considered to have a positive negative pattern fig 1 a and b if s1 is bigger than 0 and s2 is less than 0 the rainfall temperature pair sets are considered to have a peak pattern fig 1 c and d for the rainfall temperature pair set with peak pattern a positive peak pattern is considered to have occurred if its peak point temperature is in the right half of the set fig 1 c otherwise it is considered that a negative peak pattern occurred fig 1 d the scaling rate of the temperature dependence of the extreme precipitation was calculated according to different relationship patterns for the rainfall temperature pair set with peak pattern the scaling rate of the more extended rainfall temperature pairs segment was used to represent the scaling rate of the entire rainfall temperature pairs set for the rainfall temperature pair set with positive or negative pattern linear regression was used to calculate the scaling rate 3 results 3 1 relationship between daily extreme precipitation and daily mean temperature the spatial distribution of relationship patterns for daily extreme precipitation and daily mean temperature is shown in fig 2 most of the studied areas showed peak patterns accounting for 95 80 of the studied areas of which 81 15 and 14 65 were positive and negative respectively only 3 74 of all grids in the studied areas had negative patterns whereas 0 46 showed positive patterns the temperature range can be restricted between 5 c and 25 c considering a temperature uncertainty of less than 5 c and above 25 c and the limitation of relative humidity at very high temperatures peleg et al 2018 in such cases the proportion of the peak pattern decreased to 88 48 with positive and the negative patterns accounting 78 23 and 10 25 respectively whereas the proportion of the positive pattern increased to 7 78 however the grids with negative patterns remained stable amounting to 3 74 the peak pattern was also the predominant pattern negative and positive patterns were distributed mostly in western china grids with negative patterns were located mostly in the himalayan kunlun qilian tianshan altai and hengduan mountains whereas those showing positive patterns occurred mostly in the eastern foots of the kunlun qilian and hengduan mountains 3 2 spatial distribution of scaling rates scaling rates were calculated for all grids in the study area fig 3 shows that the scaling rate varied among the grids with the median of the scaling rates of bootstraps used the grids in which the scaling rate was approximately consistent with the c c relationship between 6 and 7 were distributed mostly in the eastern part of the hu line which begins in aihui county in northeastern china and extends to tengchong city in the southwest and is highly consistent with the isohyet of 400 mm gao et al 2018b shenghe et al 2016 the grids with negative scaling rates were mostly distributed in western china particularly in tibet and in the xinjiang province grids with scaling rates greater than 15 were located mostly in north china and central china the proportions of scaling rates at different intervals are shown in table 1 the results show that scaling rates between 10 and 15 accounted for the maximum percentage at 31 0 those between 0 and 5 accounted for the minimum percentage at 3 7 and those greater than 15 accounted for 24 3 we randomly selected one grid for each type of climate pattern to illustrate the uncertainties of the calculated scaling rates as shown in fig 4 the scaling rates were limited by uncertainties in the samples which varied among the climate patterns 3 3 peak point extreme precipitation and corresponding temperature the spatial distribution of the peak point extreme precipitation is shown in fig 5 a the results show that the peak point decreased from the southeast to the northwest regions of china in which the median of the peak point extreme precipitation of all bootstraps was used the peak point extreme precipitations of grids with negative scaling rates were usually less than 50 mm whereas those greater than 150 mm tended to occur in grids with scaling rates between 5 and 10 the spatial distribution of the peak point temperature is shown in fig 5 b the peak point temperature in most regions of china ranged from 15 c to 25 c except for that in the tibetan plateau and some mountainous areas 3 4 relationship between daily extreme precipitation and daily maximum temperature to determine whether the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation and its corresponding synoptic systems was the main cause of the peak or the negative pattern of the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures the relationship between the extreme precipitation and the tmaxb value was analyzed tmaxb is assumed to be less affected by precipitation extremes over china and is relatively robust because the durations of the precipitation extremes are generally short form several hours to about one day gao et al 2018b and the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation and its synoptic system is temporary by comparing the relationship pattern for extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature with that for extreme precipitation and the corresponding tmaxb the cooling effect on the relationship pattern for daily extreme precipitation and daily mean temperature can be proved the spatial distribution of patterns of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding tmaxb is shown in fig 6 the distributions of different patterns of the relationship between extreme precipitation and corresponding tmaxb over china were approximately the same as those of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature peak patterns were found in most areas of china accounting for 96 88 of which the positive and negative peak patterns accounted for 86 88 and 10 00 respectively however monotonic decreasing and increasing patterns were found mostly in mountainous areas of west china amounting to 2 52 and 0 60 respectively compared with the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature that between extreme precipitation and the corresponding tmaxb had a slightly more pronounced peak structure pattern and fewer occurrences of other patterns although the distribution of the patterns of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperatures is similar to that of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding tmaxb in mainland china differences were noted in some local regions the relationship pattern for extreme precipitation and corresponding temperature changed from the peak pattern to the positive pattern when the independent variable changed from the daily mean temperature to tmaxb at those grids we randomly selected two grids with the peak pattern for the relationship between precipitation extremes and the daily mean temperatures and with the positive pattern for the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding tmaxb to illustrate the details of these differences the two types of the relationship for these selected grids are compared in fig 7 the figure shows that the relationship pattern for extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature changed from a peak structure pattern to a monotonically increasing pattern when the independent variable changed from the daily mean temperature to the tmaxb in these randomly selected grids this implies that the peak pattern in the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures was indeed caused by the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation itself and its accompanying synoptic systems in some regions of china however those regions are relatively sparse and the distribution of these regions does not show distinct apparent features 3 5 relationship between daily relative humidity and daily mean temperature to illustrate whether the decrease of relative humidity is the first order reason for the decrease in precipitation extremes we analyzed three types of relationships between the relative humidity and daily mean temperature including that between relative humidity rh0 and daily mean temperature when the extreme precipitation occurs that between relative humidity on the day before the extreme precipitation rhneg and the daily mean temperature and that between the relative humidity of the day after the extreme precipitation rhpos and the daily mean temperature the indicators rh0 rhneg and rhpos are used to identify the effect of extreme precipitation on relative humidity we selected four grids randomly to show the variety in the relative humidity rh0 rhneg and rhpos with increasing daily mean temperatures in different situations of the four grids two showed peak patterns of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature and two showed negative patterns fig 8 illustrates the relationship between relative humidity rh0 rhneg and rhpos and the daily mean temperature at grids showing peak patterns rh0 rhneg and rhpos had apparent downward trends after a specific temperature was reached because the duration of extreme precipitation events in china is usually less than one day gao et al 2018b they cannot affect rhneg physically therefore we can infer that the decrease in relative humidity at high temperatures is not caused by extreme precipitation in addition the change point temperature of relative humidity is highly consistent with the peak point temperature of extreme precipitation this implies that the decrease in relative humidity at high temperatures is the main reason for the peak pattern of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature according to the fluctuation characteristics of the three indicators the decreasing rate of rhpos is obviously less than that of the two other indicators this might be attributed to the relatively lower temperatures on the day after the extreme precipitation owing to the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation and its synoptic system the low temperatures can decrease the maximum moisture capacity of the air therefore this also implies that heavy precipitation can lower the temperature and further promote the generation of peak structures of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature fig 9 illustrates the relationship between the relative humidity rh0 rhneg and rhpos and the daily mean temperature at grids showing negative patterns in the relationship between the extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperatures this situation differs from that shown in fig 8 although the three relative humidity indicators showed decreasing trends at higher temperatures for most grids such as that shown in fig 9 a the relative humidity in some grids remained stable or even increased at high temperatures such as that shown in fig 9 b in these grids the behavior of the precipitation temperature relationship and the rh temperature relationship was not correlated at high temperatures this implies the contribution of other factors to the peak structure such as the cooling effect or rainfall duration grid 174 104 showed a negative pattern for the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature although its relative humidity remained non decreasing the relationship between the extreme precipitation and the tmaxb at this grid was analyzed as shown in fig 10 the relationship between the extreme precipitation and the daily mean temperature had an obviously negative pattern whereas that between the extreme precipitation and the tmaxb did not these results indicate a contradiction such that the decrease in extreme precipitation with non decreasing humidity was caused by the cooling effect of the extreme precipitation and its synoptic system 4 discussion the analysis given in this and many previous studies shows that relative humidity does not always remain stable with increasing temperature in many regions which means that the underlying assumption of the c c relationship is not satisfied because the dew point temperature can exclude the effects of the humidity limitations many researchers have suggested that dpt is a more appropriate primary scaling variable ali et al 2018 barbero et al 2018 wasko et al 2018 lenderink et al 2018 panthou et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 to identify the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding dpt we calculated the dpt using the magnus formula lawrence 2005 which includes relative humidity and temperature as inputs the result showed that the proportions of the peak pattern the positive pattern and the negative pattern for extreme precipitation and dpt were 82 52 8 70 and 8 78 respectively with the positive and negative peak patterns of the first proportion accounting for 73 52 and 9 00 respectively compared with the relationship patterns for extreme precipitation and daily mean temperature the positive and negative patterns for extreme precipitation and dpt increased from 0 64 to 8 70 and 3 74 to 8 78 respectively and the peak pattern for daily extreme precipitation and dpt decreased from 95 80 to 82 52 qualitatively the relationship between the precipitation extreme and the corresponding dpt were closer to the c c with more regions showing positive patterns however the peak structure also controls most areas of mainland china which also implies that factors other than relative humidity affect the relationship between extreme precipitation and corresponding temperature because cmads does not provide accurate dew point temperature data and the method used for its calculation can cause uncertainties because of some parameters used in the calculation we focused only on the relationship patterns for extreme precipitation and the corresponding dew point temperature in this study to further understand this relationship accurate dew point temperature data are needed the temperature dependence of extreme precipitation in mainland china has been investigated in previous research gao et al 2018b wang et al 2017 wasko et al 2016 although these studies confirm the overwhelming distribution of the peak pattern wang et al 2017 and the variation in scaling rates gao et al 2018b wasko et al 2016 over mainland china they do not explain the deviation between the apparent relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures and the c c relationship based on data analysis the scaling rates identified in this study are slightly less than those of wasko et al 2016 which can be attributed to different definitions of extreme precipitation the 99th percentile was used to define the extreme precipitation in this study whereas the 90th percentile is used by wasko et al 2016 other research pumo et al 2019 showed that a higher percentile leads to higher scaling rates some studies demonstrated that rainfall intermittency has a significant impact on the relationship patterns for extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature and on scaling rates gao et al 2018b ali et al 2018 schleiss 2018 and contributes to the deviation of relationship patterns from the c c schleiss 2018 proposed a new model considering rainfall intermittency to describe the relationship between precipitation extremes and the corresponding temperatures this model can describe a relationship pattern for extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature and scaling rates close to that reflected by the c c relation however the model s consideration of the effect of rainfall intermittency on scaling rates focuses more on the precipitation intensity than the amount given that the model introduces a multiplicative correction term to modify the precipitation amount in the new model the variable of precipitation amount is essentially the average intensity of a precipitation event within a specific precipitation duration the relationship between the average intensity extremes of a precipitation event and the corresponding temperatures over mainland china have been described in previous research using observed hourly precipitation data gao et al 2018b in most regions positive patterns were observed such as those described by c c the present study did not consider the effect of rainfall intermittency because data with sufficient temporal resolution were not available however because high precipitation intensity does not necessarily represent large amounts of precipitation the prediction of precipitation amount extremes in a relatively larger timescale such as daily is to some extent meaningful for flood management in large basins the daily precipitation data used in this study were derived from cmads which incorporates the global precipitation products of cmorph with observations from nearly 40 000 regional stations and data from 131 radar detection stations in china as well as the data of the national meteorological information center of china although many studies gao et al 2018a guo et al 2018 liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 have proved its capacity for estimating precipitation including extreme events the cmads products still have limitations most of the observation stations used to merge the dataset including regional stations national meteorological stations and radar detection stations are located in eastern china this can lead to relatively low accuracy of the dataset in northwestern and southwestern china moreover the interpolation used to produce the dataset might ignore the impacts of local topography which can lead to underestimation of some extreme precipitation these limitations can result in uncertainties in the scaling rates further studies based on multiple data sources should be performed to improve the credibility of the results presented in this study although research based on daily data is meaningful in many hydrological applications such as flood control and water resource management studies based on sub daily data are important for understanding the influence of dynamic factors on the temperature dependence of extreme precipitation peleg et al 2018 pumo et al 2019 schleiss 2018 wasko et al 2015 the present study focuses on the relationship between daily extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperatures owing to the limitations of the dataset therefore to further investigate the reason for the deviation between the apparent scaling rates and the c c relation in mainland china studies based on sub daily data are needed 5 conclusions the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature is of great importance for understanding the thermodynamic characteristics of extreme precipitation and for predicting extreme precipitation in the warming future this study comprehensively investigated the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature over china based on the cmads merge with satellite based data reanalysis data and gauge observations compared the apparent relationship patterns for extreme precipitation and daily mean temperature with the c c relation and identified the reason for the peak or negative patterns in the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature the following conclusions were drawn 1 the peak pattern of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature was the dominant pattern over mainland china accounting for 95 80 2 the scaling of extreme precipitation with the corresponding daily mean temperature varied significantly throughout mainland china and the scaling of extreme precipitation with daily mean temperature greater than that represented by the c c scaling is observed in most parts of china 3 the peak point extreme precipitation decreased from the southeast to the northwest in mainland china and the peak point temperature ranged from 15 c to 25 c 4 for most regions of china the peak or negative pattern of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature was caused by the coupling effects of the decrease in relative humidity and the cooling effect of extreme heavy precipitation and its synoptic system and 5 the decrease in relative humidity was the first order reason for reverse or negative patterns even though the cooling effect was the main cause in some regions credit authorship contribution statement xichao gao conceptualization methodology software validation

5704,the hydrologic responses of two similar in size watersheds in the lake kinneret basin are examined karstic hermon watershed and basaltic meshushim watershed the streamflow properties at these watersheds are different in their surface flow to baseflow ratio runoff coefficients and response to extreme rainfall events the hydrological model for karst environment hymke model developed to simulate daily flow in karst formation was modified to address the basaltic formation at the meshushim watershed water fluxes simulations were used to compare the hydrologic processes between the watersheds the twice higher annual precipitation in the hermon watershed generates annual streamflow that is five times more than in the meshushim this amplification of the rainfall streamflow ratio between the watersheds is because larger fraction of the rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration at the basaltic meshushim watershed and larger portion of the rainfall percolates to the karstic aquifer through preferential flow and appear as baseflow at the hermon watershed during large rainfall events when soil water content is near saturation lower rainfall amount over the meshushim watershed generates larger peak flow than the hermon watershed in both watersheds surface flow was generated only when the soil water content is at or near saturation conditions the streamflow dependency on soil water content suggests high sensitivity of streamflow generation to the intra annual variability of precipitation understanding the hydrologic response of the different sources of lake kinneret improves the ability to forecast its inflow keywords lake kinneret basin karst hydrologic response basalt hydrologic response runoff coefficient 1 introduction lake kinneret known also as sea of galilee located in the north central part of the jordan rift valley is the largest freshwater lake in israel the surface flow into lake kinneret comes from the upper jordan river watershed 1600 km2 and streams that directly drain into the lake 965 km2 lake kinneret watershed consists of four distinctive geologic formations that vary in their hydrologic response to precipitation rimmer and givati 2014 sade et al 2016 1 the jurassic mountainous karst of mount hermon characterized by faults and semi impermeable layers 2 the basalt plateau of the golan heights 3 the cenomanian turonian carbonaceous karst of the eastern galilee mountains and 4 the flat alluvial and peat formations of the hula valley fig 1 the development of a hydrologic model for the entire watershed to simulate inflow into lake kinneret is an on going research challenge recognizing the hydrologic complexity of the lake s watershed the hydrological model for karst environment hymke rimmer and salinger 2006 was developed to address the hydrologic complexity caused by the karstic formation of the hermon mountain which its tributaries provide the majority of the perennial contribution to the upper jordan river that feeds into lake kinneret since its development hymke was used in many hydrological studies of the lake kinneret watershed e g samuels et al 2009 samuels et al 2010 rimmer et al 2011 hartmann et al 2013 gilboa et al 2015 rimmer and hartmann 2014 sade et al 2016 in addition the model has been used as an operational tool by the israeli hydrological service for hydrological nowcasting of daily streamflow in the tributaries of the hermon mountain although hymke provides for a well founded hydrologic modeling strategy it requires enhancements in order to adequately represent the other hydrologic formations over the lake kinneret basin in this study we compare the hydrologic processes in two relatively small watersheds with similar sizes located in the mount hermon and the golan heights hydrologic units following a detailed analysis of the watersheds responses we modified the hymke to simulate streamflow at the basaltic formation of the golan heights and used it to examine the hydrologic differences between the two watersheds our objective in this study is to understand the dominant hydrologic processes differences between the two watersheds and to develop a robust and reliable hydrologic model that captures the nuance differences in the hydrological processes between the two hydrologic units this understanding serves the broader objective of developing a hydrologic model for the kinneret basin that appropriately captures the hydrologic response of the different contributing tributaries 2 experimental setup 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the perennial streams of the hermon and meshushim watersheds located at the hermon mountain and golan heights hydrologic units respectively the hermon watershed 147 km2 200 2200 a m s l which is located in the hermon mountain hydrologic unit is the largest source of water to the upper jordan river with an average annual flow at the outlet of the hermon stream of 111 106 m3 year fig 1 the hermon mountain range is an elongated anticline of mostly karstic limestone of jurassic age with thickness greater than 2000 m michelson 1979 gilad 1980 gilad and schwartz 1978 the karst formation with its large cavities and interconnected network of channels is characterized by preferential flow pathways that convey surface water to the deep aquifer e g gilad 1980 the soil in the hermon watershed is classified as terra rossa that is typically overlaid on hard limestone rock singer 2007 the land surface of the watershed is pitted with karst features such as dolines and sinkholes frumkin et al 1998 land cover in the lower elevation below 1300 m is classified as drought resistant evergreen shrubland forest dominated by palestine oak quercus calliprinos the higher part of the watershed 1300 1900 m is covered by a xero montane open forest composed of winter deciduous trees and shrubs that can withstand low temperatures and strong wind the highest elevation above 1900 m is classified as subalpine tragacanthic belt typical of arid alpine regions and composed of shrubs and short herbaceous species auerbach and shmida 1993 danin 1988 in addition to intermittent contribution of surface runoff the main contribution of flow to the hermon perennial stream is from a series of springs to include the banias sa ar kezinim and si on during the winter a snowpack is formed at the high elevation above 1400 1900 m a m s l to completely ablate during the spring march may e g shmida 1977 gilad and bonne 1990 sade et al 2014 the meshushim watershed 160 km2 150 1000 a m s l drains the central golan heights into lake kinneret fig 1 the golan heights is a basalt covered plateau that gently slopes from north to south with a steep slope in the western edge of the plateau as it approaches the hulla valley in the upper jordan river and lake kinneret the watershed is covered by basalt of pliocene pleistocene age mor 1986 heimann 1990 from the bashan geological group mor 1986 the shallow channel at the meshushim s headwater deepens as it flows downstream towards the lake kinneret the average flow at the outlet of the meshushim stream is 27 5 106 m3 year most of the flow at the meshushim stream is from winter precipitation events that trigger surface runoff however the perennial flow at the meshushim is attributed to a relatively shallow aquifer at the headwater that seeps into the channel at the interface with the channels walls dafny et al 2003 2006 the streamflow at the outlet of the meshushim watershed represents a natural flow regime with little disturbance by upstream reservoirs and agricultural practices shtober zisu and inbar 2005 the vertisols soil at the lower portion of the watershed had originated from eroded soil of the higher portion of the watershed the upper portion of the watershed has shallower soil that consists of alfisols brown and red mediterranean soils singer 2007 the basalt soil in the golan heights has low hydraulic conductivity 0 1 0 3 m hour causing low infiltration rate and surface runoff generation that is highly dependent of rainfall intensity which also yield a high erosivity level of the soil singer 1987 the higher parts of the meshushim watershed higher than 500 m a s i are covered with oak woodland that is dominated by palestine oak the lower part of the watershed is mainly barren and rocky with shrub steppe cover dotted with tabor oak quercus ithaburensis danin 1988 some cultivated areas exist mainly in the lower portion of the basin where the soil is deeper the low hydraulic conductivity less than 1 m day of the basalt rocks yields a slow recharge rate of the groundwater aquifer dafny et al 2003 in addition the basaltic rock column is composed of repeated layers of basalt rocks from different eruptions separated by clayey paleosols material this composition causes the vertical hydraulic conductivity to be substantially lower than the horizontal hydraulic conductivity anisotropy of low hydraulic conductivity to form many small springs that are fed from the limited perched aquifers dafny et al 2003 the climate of the lake kinneret watershed is classified as mediterranean with average annual rainfall ranges from 1200 mm year in the north to less than 500 mm year in its southern part most precipitation events which occur during the winter season november march are triggered by the so called cyprus low synoptic system these are low pressure systems that are formed near cyprus that move eastward towards the eastern mediterranean shore the passage of these systems is accompanied by westerly winds that transport moist air over the warm mediterranean sea where it becomes increasingly moist and conditionally unstable before it is transported over northern israel ziv et al 2014 in general the rainfall spatial distribution over lake kinneret watershed can be characterized by its north south decreasing gradient attributed to increasing distance from the main mediterranean cyclone track west east decreasing gradient attributed to depleted moisture further away from the mediterranean sea the source of the air moisture and increase rainfall with elevation attributed to orographic enhancement e g kutiel 1987 shamir et al 2016 shentsis et al 2018 2 2 observations daily mean areal rainfall was estimated for each watershed using the observation network of the israeli meteorological service ims table 1 for the hermon watershed we adopted the 1976 2001 interpolated time series from rimmer and salingar 2006 who used a seasonally varying linear regression with elevation as the predictor to estimate the mean areal precipitation over the entire basin such interpolation is required since the north most rain gauge is located at the golan heights at an elevation of 960 a m s l and no reliable observed precipitation record is available for the high elevation of the hermon mountain e g shamir et al 2016 using a denser network of rain gauges for the golan heights the mean areal rainfall for the meshushim watershed was estimated for 1976 2013 as the average of the quality controlled records from five observation stations fig 1 daily streamflow discharge data are available for the outlet of both watersheds from hydrometric stations operated by the israeli hydrologic service daily climatological potential evapotranspiration pet the amount of evapotranspiration that would occur if sufficient water source are available were calculated by assigning a sine function that describes the seasonal variability to long term 1970 2000 daily pan evaporation observations as suggested by rimmer and salingar 2006 2 3 hydrologic response analysis the differences in the hydrologic regimes between the two watersheds are exemplified in fig 2 the cumulative distributions of the total water year 1 october 30 september rainfall and the mean average discharge over the hermon watershed are significantly higher than the meshushim watershed fig 2a b note that throughout the manuscript the term annual denotes water year the average differences between the watersheds are noteworthy since the hermon is two to five times larger than meshushim when comparing the annual rainfall and daily average annual discharge respectively to further understand rainfall runoff response we analyzed the cumulative distributions of the daily rainfall and daily streamflow annual maxima series i e the series of maximum daily values during each of the water years fig 2c d as expected the extreme daily rainfall values in the hermon are larger than the meshushim however the discharge maxima series in the meshushim are larger than the hermon this suggests that smaller rainfall events trigger larger flow events in the meshushim the differences in the transformation of rainfall to streamflow in the two watersheds are further examined in fig 3 where the total observed flow and the estimated baseflow component are shown the baseflow component the slowly changing discharge that is contributed to the streamflow with a considerable delay following rainfall events was estimated herein using a recursive digital filter method to separate high from low frequency signals we used the eckhardt s 2005 method in which the streamflow is described as follows 1 q j q bj q sj where q is the total observed streamflow q s is the direct surface runoff q b is the baseflow and the j subscript represents the time steps to calculate the baseflow we used a robust filter with two empirical parameters α and β eckhardt 2005 rimmer and hartmann 2014 2 q bj 1 β α q bj 1 1 α β q j 1 α β q bj q j the β is a scaling parameter and α corresponds to the recession constant as seen in eq 3 for the special case that β is set to zero 3 q bj α q bj 1 for the hermon we set the α and β values as recommended by rimmer and salingar 2006 for the meshushim the α parameter was sequentially estimated by optimizing eq 3 and then selecting a β parameter as outlined in rimmer and hartmann 2014 in the hermon watershed the baseflow component comprises of about 75 of the total streamflow 84 106 m3 year and the daily baseflow exhibits a distinct seasonal cycle ranging between 1 1 4 6 m3 sec during march and november respectively during large flow events in the hermon the surface flow is up to about 7 times of its baseflow fig 3b the baseflow as measured at the meshushim outlet is only about 17 5 4 8 103 m3 year of the total streamflow the streamflow at the hydrometric station is mainly attributed to surface flow that occurred after the soil water content has reached saturation there is almost no observed variation in baseflow during the winter and the daily baseflow ranged between 0 08 and 0 26 103 m3 sec in march and november respectively the surface flow increased by 250 times more than before the flooding events fig 3a the annual runoff coefficient rc the ratio of water year flow and mean areal rainfall volumes are shown for the watersheds in fig 4 as a function of the water year rainfall compared with the hermon watershed the rc for meshushim is smaller and has a noticeable positive dependency on the annual rainfall the annual rainfall explains 60 and 40 of the rc inter annual variability for the meshushim and hermon respectively these results of rc dependency on the rainfall imply that at the hermon streamflow generation is dominated by multiyear climate conditions while at the meshushim the rainfall pattern of the current year is the dominant factor a key reason for the annual rainfall being a limited predictor of the rc is the watersheds capacity to absorb and retain water in the soil at the beginning of the water year october 1st after the long warm and dry summer season june september the soil is completely dry in both watersheds surface flow events were not observed before on average 250 and 220 mm of rainfall occurred since october 1st which is about 18 and 34 of the annual totals in the hermon and meshushim respectively table 2 the large variability of rainfall amount that is required for the first surface runoff event is attributed to the characteristics of the sequence of rainfall events at the beginning of the wet season during dry spells between rainfall events evapotranspiration and percolation processes deplete the water content of the soil and therefore the frequency and duration of these dry spells control the surface runoff generation 3 hydrologic model we used the hymke for the hermon watershed as implemented in rimmer and salingar 2006 the hymke formulation is in appendix a the hymke consists of four modules the surface layer 0 the vadose zone layer 1 groundwater aquifer 2 and surface flow 3 because of the large difference in depth to groundwater between the watersheds greater than 2000 m in the hermon watershed gilad 1980 and 100 600 m at the meshushim watershed dafny et al 2006 in addition to the differences in percolation characteristics the baseflow recession at the meshushim watershed is better represented by eliminating the vadose zone layer and implementing two parallel groundwater linear reservoirs rimmer and hartmann 2012 thus the groundwater module for the meshushim was modified to simulate the sum of two linear reservoirs fig 5 a the first linear reservoir represents the regional aquifer and the second represents perched aquifers that lay above the paleosols clay layers parts of the meshushim watershed feed the golan heights side springs that are downstream of the hydrometric station and do not contribute water to the baseflow of the meshushim stream dafny et al 2006 the model coefficients that distribute the surface water entry to the two linear groundwater reservoirs table 3 are summed to 90 while the remaining 10 is assumed to feed the side springs a modified procedure to calculate the daily actual evapotranspiration e aj mm was introduced in this hymke version in this modified procedure the e aj is calculated as a function of the water content of the upper soil the formulation of this modification is summarized in appendix a 3 1 parameters estimation we used a split sample methodology in which the parameters were calibrated using the 1976 1996 data and evaluated on the remaining time series 1997 2013 for meshushim and 1997 2001 for the hermon a description of the parameters and their selected values are given in table 3 to estimate the parameters we used a multistep automatic calibration approach an approach that combines the strengths of the manual and automatic calibration strategies hogue et al 2000 the observed discharge data was separated to baseflow and fast flow components as shown in eq 2 the model parameters were divided into parameters that dominate the simulations of the baseflow and the fast flow the parameters of each group were estimated by minimizing the error between the simulated and observed time series for both the baseflow and surface flow we used the microsoft excel solver premium solver platform 2010 to select parameter sets that minimized the sum of the squared residuals using a comprehensive and iterative trial and error experiments the calibration was carried in two steps first we selected the parameters that optimize the surface flow and second fixing the surface flow parameters we selected parameters that optimize the simulation of baseflow we used the following two goodness of fit coefficients to evaluate the model performance 1 the coefficient of determination r2 which represents the linear association between two time series and 2 the normalized benchmark simple model bsm efficiency coefficient which indicates the model s ability to predict the streamflow relative to a simple baseline model schaefli and gupta 2007 rimmer and hartmann 2014 the modified bsm substitutes the climatology component in the coefficient s denominator with two simple models benchmark models one for baseflow and one for surface flow eq 4 4 bsm 1 j 1 n q obsj q simj 2 j 1 n q obsj q bmj 2 where q obsj and q simj are the observed and simulated flow at the j s time step the q bmj is the benchmark model simulation calculated as described in eqs 5 and 6 the bsm efficiency values range from to 1 and a bsm value of 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the simulated and observed data an efficiency of 0 bsm 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the alternative simple baseline model and efficiency values of less than zero bsm 0 indicate that the simple model serves as a better predictor than the model the benchmark model for the baseflow consisted of a cyclic function sine that calculates the baseflow as a function of the day in the year according to the following equation 5 q simj b 1 a sin λ jd ω were jd is the day of the year a and b are scaling coefficients 1000 m3 λ is the angular frequency rad and ω is the phase shift the benchmark model for surface flow calculates the flow with the daily rain according to the following equation 6 q simj q obs a r obs a r j l a g where q obs and r obs are the average annual observed streamflow and rainfall respectively j represents daily time steps r j l a g is the daily rain lag represents the duration days between rain events to peak flow and a is the drainage area of the watershed in both watersheds the response of the streamflow to rainfall is within a day and therefore the lag parameter was set to one day 4 results 4 1 model evaluation a summary of the model evaluation results for both the calibration and validation durations are given in table 4 as mentioned above both watersheds were calibrated on 1973 1993 data and evaluated for 1976 2015 and 1976 2001 in the meshushim and hermon respectively it is seen that the simulations for the hermon performed better than for the meshushim and the simulated baseflow outperforms the simulated surface flow the bsm indices indicate that the model simulations outperformed the simulations of the baseflow and surface flow models in both watersheds 4 2 hydrologic response the hydrologic response differences between the two watersheds were further examined using the hydrologic model simulations the average fraction of the simulated water fluxes of evapotranspiration surface flow flux and are summarized in table 5 the sum of these three fluxes in each water year is about equal to the annual rain the small deviation of the total fluxes from the annual rainfall is attributed to model s numerical error of 0 001 and 0 036 in the meshushim and hermon respectively in this region because we assume that by the end of the long and dry summer june september the soil is dry year to year differences in soil water storage at the beginning of the water year october are negligible the differences in the partitioning of the water fluxes between the two watersheds are apparent as expected since the rainfall in the hermon is more than double of the meshushim watershed the absolute values in the hermon are larger for all fluxes however in relative terms the only flux with larger fraction in the hermon is water percolation into the aquifer annual distribution of the flux partitioning fig 6 shows the large inter annual variability of the surface flow in the meshushim and the relatively low variability in the hermon the evapotranspiration fluxes in both watersheds have small changes from year to year however in both watershed more pronounced in the meshushim during dry years the relative fraction of evapotranspiration is higher the seasonal wetting and drying dynamics of the soil is a key factor that controls both the generation of baseflow and surface flow increase water content of the soil increase the groundwater recharge rate due to increase of the percolation rate it is only when the top soil reaches saturation the excess water becomes available for percolation to the sub surface and surface flow is generated during wetter years the soil water content is higher for longer duration which yields higher efficiency in transformation of rainfall to streamflow the dynamic variability in soil water content during the year is similar in the two watersheds because of the strong correspondence in precipitation events between the two watersheds this strong correspondence is realized in the magnitude the timing and the number of rainfall events the soil water content and the rainfall of two typical dry and wet hydrologic years 1986 1987 and 1985 1986 respectively are shown for the two watersheds fig 7 although the dynamic of these two years were different the two watersheds exhibit a similar soil water content dynamic this similarity in the soil water dynamic is shown in spite of the hermon watershed experiencing more rainfall fig 7 the surface flow in both watersheds observed and simulated appeared only when the soil had reached saturation and during the period in which the soil had been saturated in both years and watersheds rainfall events that occurred before and after the saturated soil period did not trigger streamflow in the watersheds outlets 5 discussion surface runoff is usually generated when either precipitation rate exceeds the infiltration rate infiltration excess or precipitation falls on saturated land surface saturation excess the daily contribution surface flow to the total flow in the studied watersheds is clearly associated with the seasonal wetting and drying dynamics of the upper soil at the beginning of the hydrologic year october coming out of a long dry and warm summer when the soil is dry no surface runoff was observed in both watersheds regardless of the observed rainfall intensity surface runoff was observed in the hermon and meshushim watersheds only after mean areal precipitation of about 250 and 200 mm had accumulated since october 1 respectively this suggests that runoff generation in these watersheds is dominated by saturation excess processes saturation access as the major runoff generation process was previously reported in several other mediterranean climate studies e g coastal israel peleg et al 2015 plot scale experiments in jerusalem and the galilee mountains lavee et al 1998 galilee mountains ben zvi 1988 a mountainous watershed in the pyrenees gallart et al 2002 latron et al 2008 we note however that infiltration excess processes may occur in temporal and spatial scales that are finer than the analysis conducted in our study e g ries et al 2017 during the winter months december february the soil is becoming saturated and rainfall events often trigger surface flow during this period groundwater levels rise from percolation through preferential flow and matrix flow processes to increase the baseflow in the outlet of the watersheds during the fall and summer the soil is drying and surface flow events are infrequent while baseflow is gradually declining this dependency of streamflow on the soil water content of the upper soil was found to be stronger in the basaltic meshushim watershed because of the larger fraction of surface flow that is contributed to the total streamflow in the mostly karstic hermon watershed the percolation flux contributes to baseflow regardless of the soil saturation conditions at the upper soil the implication of such dependency is that the rainfall temporal and intra annual variability is a key factor that controls the surface flow generation and total streamflow in seasons with long dry spells between events the upper soil desiccates by evaporation and percolation processes and surface runoff is being suppressed this dependency on intra annual variability is demonstrated by dubrovský et al 2014 who showed that decrease in the numbers of rain events required larger rain events to saturate the soil and generate surface flow in addition the decrease in number of rainy days increased the total evapotranspiration increased the percolation flux and decreased the total streamflow future climate study of the region projected a decrease of total annual precipitation decrease in consecutive rainy days decrease in the number of wet days and increase in extreme rainfall events samuels et al 2017 sade et al 2016 peleg et al 2015 rimmer et al 2011 although the impact of the projected future precipitation regime on the water balance of the two watersheds will be manifested differently it is likely that surface runoff will decrease and the fraction of the evapotranspiration flux will increase in both watersheds in the meshushim watershed a larger fraction of the rainfall will be lost to evapotranspiration which will substantially decrease the proportion of rainfall that transforms into streamflow in the hermon watershed because of the dominance of the percolation flux the proportion of rainfall that is transformed to streamflow will be less affected in this study the watersheds were treated as uniform units without accounting for their internal spatial variability their spatial variability can be expressed in the variability of the hydrologic input and variability in the spatial characteristics of the land surface moreover the model parameters were selected to optimize the integrated response of the watersheds despite these potential sources of uncertainty the model simulations describe well the dominant processes in the watersheds this good performance enables the use of the model simulations to diagnose the unique hydrologic responses of the two watersheds and better understand their differences in this study the watersheds were treated as uniform units without accounting for their internal spatial variability their spatial variability can be expressed in the variability of the hydrologic input and variability in the spatial characteristics of the land surface moreover the model parameters were selected to optimize the integrated response of the watersheds despite these potential sources of uncertainty the model simulations describe well the dominant processes in the watersheds this good performance enables the use of the model simulations to diagnose the unique hydrologic responses of the two watersheds and better understand their differences our work highlights the strong dependency of streamflow generation on the soil water content of the watersheds this dependency implies that in order to accurately capture the hydrologic response of the watersheds it is important to describe in addition to the magnitude of the precipitation events the precipitation intra annual temporal characteristics these precipitation features should be considered and analyzed in climate models projections in order to appropriately projects future water resources inflow to lake kinneret 6 conclusions we examined the hydrologic response differences between two similar in size watersheds in a karstic hermon and a basaltic meshushim geologic formations these watersheds which are located in lake kinneret basin represent different hydrologic regimes the hydrologic response differences between the watersheds are expressed in the surface flow to baseflow ratio the runoff coefficient and their response to extreme rainfall the hymke model which was originally developed to simulate daily surface flow at the hermon karstic geologic formation was modified to capture the hydrologic response of the basaltic geologic formation at the meshushim watershed the simulated water fluxes among the various model compartments were examined to infer on the dominant processes in the watersheds although the prevailing precipitation events in both watersheds are commonly generated by the same weather synoptic system the annual precipitation in the hermon watershed is about twice as much as in the meshushim watershed this difference between the watersheds is magnified to five times when the annual streamflow are compared between the basins the magnifying of the streamflow ratio between the two watersheds is attributed to a higher fraction of evapotranspiration in the meshushim watershed and larger portion of rainfall that percolates to the aquifer and contributes to the stream through baseflow in the hermon watershed although lesser rainfall at the meshushim during the winter when the soil water content is at or near saturation surface flow at the meshushim is larger than the hermon this is because the large portion that percolates through preferential flow to the aquifer in the hermon watershed and the longer duration of the flood hydrograph which attenuates and reduces the peak flow in both watersheds surface flow is generated only when the soil water content is at or near saturation conditions this dependency of streamflow on soil water content makes the generation of surface flow highly sensitive to the intra annual variability of rainfall declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

5704,the hydrologic responses of two similar in size watersheds in the lake kinneret basin are examined karstic hermon watershed and basaltic meshushim watershed the streamflow properties at these watersheds are different in their surface flow to baseflow ratio runoff coefficients and response to extreme rainfall events the hydrological model for karst environment hymke model developed to simulate daily flow in karst formation was modified to address the basaltic formation at the meshushim watershed water fluxes simulations were used to compare the hydrologic processes between the watersheds the twice higher annual precipitation in the hermon watershed generates annual streamflow that is five times more than in the meshushim this amplification of the rainfall streamflow ratio between the watersheds is because larger fraction of the rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration at the basaltic meshushim watershed and larger portion of the rainfall percolates to the karstic aquifer through preferential flow and appear as baseflow at the hermon watershed during large rainfall events when soil water content is near saturation lower rainfall amount over the meshushim watershed generates larger peak flow than the hermon watershed in both watersheds surface flow was generated only when the soil water content is at or near saturation conditions the streamflow dependency on soil water content suggests high sensitivity of streamflow generation to the intra annual variability of precipitation understanding the hydrologic response of the different sources of lake kinneret improves the ability to forecast its inflow keywords lake kinneret basin karst hydrologic response basalt hydrologic response runoff coefficient 1 introduction lake kinneret known also as sea of galilee located in the north central part of the jordan rift valley is the largest freshwater lake in israel the surface flow into lake kinneret comes from the upper jordan river watershed 1600 km2 and streams that directly drain into the lake 965 km2 lake kinneret watershed consists of four distinctive geologic formations that vary in their hydrologic response to precipitation rimmer and givati 2014 sade et al 2016 1 the jurassic mountainous karst of mount hermon characterized by faults and semi impermeable layers 2 the basalt plateau of the golan heights 3 the cenomanian turonian carbonaceous karst of the eastern galilee mountains and 4 the flat alluvial and peat formations of the hula valley fig 1 the development of a hydrologic model for the entire watershed to simulate inflow into lake kinneret is an on going research challenge recognizing the hydrologic complexity of the lake s watershed the hydrological model for karst environment hymke rimmer and salinger 2006 was developed to address the hydrologic complexity caused by the karstic formation of the hermon mountain which its tributaries provide the majority of the perennial contribution to the upper jordan river that feeds into lake kinneret since its development hymke was used in many hydrological studies of the lake kinneret watershed e g samuels et al 2009 samuels et al 2010 rimmer et al 2011 hartmann et al 2013 gilboa et al 2015 rimmer and hartmann 2014 sade et al 2016 in addition the model has been used as an operational tool by the israeli hydrological service for hydrological nowcasting of daily streamflow in the tributaries of the hermon mountain although hymke provides for a well founded hydrologic modeling strategy it requires enhancements in order to adequately represent the other hydrologic formations over the lake kinneret basin in this study we compare the hydrologic processes in two relatively small watersheds with similar sizes located in the mount hermon and the golan heights hydrologic units following a detailed analysis of the watersheds responses we modified the hymke to simulate streamflow at the basaltic formation of the golan heights and used it to examine the hydrologic differences between the two watersheds our objective in this study is to understand the dominant hydrologic processes differences between the two watersheds and to develop a robust and reliable hydrologic model that captures the nuance differences in the hydrological processes between the two hydrologic units this understanding serves the broader objective of developing a hydrologic model for the kinneret basin that appropriately captures the hydrologic response of the different contributing tributaries 2 experimental setup 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the perennial streams of the hermon and meshushim watersheds located at the hermon mountain and golan heights hydrologic units respectively the hermon watershed 147 km2 200 2200 a m s l which is located in the hermon mountain hydrologic unit is the largest source of water to the upper jordan river with an average annual flow at the outlet of the hermon stream of 111 106 m3 year fig 1 the hermon mountain range is an elongated anticline of mostly karstic limestone of jurassic age with thickness greater than 2000 m michelson 1979 gilad 1980 gilad and schwartz 1978 the karst formation with its large cavities and interconnected network of channels is characterized by preferential flow pathways that convey surface water to the deep aquifer e g gilad 1980 the soil in the hermon watershed is classified as terra rossa that is typically overlaid on hard limestone rock singer 2007 the land surface of the watershed is pitted with karst features such as dolines and sinkholes frumkin et al 1998 land cover in the lower elevation below 1300 m is classified as drought resistant evergreen shrubland forest dominated by palestine oak quercus calliprinos the higher part of the watershed 1300 1900 m is covered by a xero montane open forest composed of winter deciduous trees and shrubs that can withstand low temperatures and strong wind the highest elevation above 1900 m is classified as subalpine tragacanthic belt typical of arid alpine regions and composed of shrubs and short herbaceous species auerbach and shmida 1993 danin 1988 in addition to intermittent contribution of surface runoff the main contribution of flow to the hermon perennial stream is from a series of springs to include the banias sa ar kezinim and si on during the winter a snowpack is formed at the high elevation above 1400 1900 m a m s l to completely ablate during the spring march may e g shmida 1977 gilad and bonne 1990 sade et al 2014 the meshushim watershed 160 km2 150 1000 a m s l drains the central golan heights into lake kinneret fig 1 the golan heights is a basalt covered plateau that gently slopes from north to south with a steep slope in the western edge of the plateau as it approaches the hulla valley in the upper jordan river and lake kinneret the watershed is covered by basalt of pliocene pleistocene age mor 1986 heimann 1990 from the bashan geological group mor 1986 the shallow channel at the meshushim s headwater deepens as it flows downstream towards the lake kinneret the average flow at the outlet of the meshushim stream is 27 5 106 m3 year most of the flow at the meshushim stream is from winter precipitation events that trigger surface runoff however the perennial flow at the meshushim is attributed to a relatively shallow aquifer at the headwater that seeps into the channel at the interface with the channels walls dafny et al 2003 2006 the streamflow at the outlet of the meshushim watershed represents a natural flow regime with little disturbance by upstream reservoirs and agricultural practices shtober zisu and inbar 2005 the vertisols soil at the lower portion of the watershed had originated from eroded soil of the higher portion of the watershed the upper portion of the watershed has shallower soil that consists of alfisols brown and red mediterranean soils singer 2007 the basalt soil in the golan heights has low hydraulic conductivity 0 1 0 3 m hour causing low infiltration rate and surface runoff generation that is highly dependent of rainfall intensity which also yield a high erosivity level of the soil singer 1987 the higher parts of the meshushim watershed higher than 500 m a s i are covered with oak woodland that is dominated by palestine oak the lower part of the watershed is mainly barren and rocky with shrub steppe cover dotted with tabor oak quercus ithaburensis danin 1988 some cultivated areas exist mainly in the lower portion of the basin where the soil is deeper the low hydraulic conductivity less than 1 m day of the basalt rocks yields a slow recharge rate of the groundwater aquifer dafny et al 2003 in addition the basaltic rock column is composed of repeated layers of basalt rocks from different eruptions separated by clayey paleosols material this composition causes the vertical hydraulic conductivity to be substantially lower than the horizontal hydraulic conductivity anisotropy of low hydraulic conductivity to form many small springs that are fed from the limited perched aquifers dafny et al 2003 the climate of the lake kinneret watershed is classified as mediterranean with average annual rainfall ranges from 1200 mm year in the north to less than 500 mm year in its southern part most precipitation events which occur during the winter season november march are triggered by the so called cyprus low synoptic system these are low pressure systems that are formed near cyprus that move eastward towards the eastern mediterranean shore the passage of these systems is accompanied by westerly winds that transport moist air over the warm mediterranean sea where it becomes increasingly moist and conditionally unstable before it is transported over northern israel ziv et al 2014 in general the rainfall spatial distribution over lake kinneret watershed can be characterized by its north south decreasing gradient attributed to increasing distance from the main mediterranean cyclone track west east decreasing gradient attributed to depleted moisture further away from the mediterranean sea the source of the air moisture and increase rainfall with elevation attributed to orographic enhancement e g kutiel 1987 shamir et al 2016 shentsis et al 2018 2 2 observations daily mean areal rainfall was estimated for each watershed using the observation network of the israeli meteorological service ims table 1 for the hermon watershed we adopted the 1976 2001 interpolated time series from rimmer and salingar 2006 who used a seasonally varying linear regression with elevation as the predictor to estimate the mean areal precipitation over the entire basin such interpolation is required since the north most rain gauge is located at the golan heights at an elevation of 960 a m s l and no reliable observed precipitation record is available for the high elevation of the hermon mountain e g shamir et al 2016 using a denser network of rain gauges for the golan heights the mean areal rainfall for the meshushim watershed was estimated for 1976 2013 as the average of the quality controlled records from five observation stations fig 1 daily streamflow discharge data are available for the outlet of both watersheds from hydrometric stations operated by the israeli hydrologic service daily climatological potential evapotranspiration pet the amount of evapotranspiration that would occur if sufficient water source are available were calculated by assigning a sine function that describes the seasonal variability to long term 1970 2000 daily pan evaporation observations as suggested by rimmer and salingar 2006 2 3 hydrologic response analysis the differences in the hydrologic regimes between the two watersheds are exemplified in fig 2 the cumulative distributions of the total water year 1 october 30 september rainfall and the mean average discharge over the hermon watershed are significantly higher than the meshushim watershed fig 2a b note that throughout the manuscript the term annual denotes water year the average differences between the watersheds are noteworthy since the hermon is two to five times larger than meshushim when comparing the annual rainfall and daily average annual discharge respectively to further understand rainfall runoff response we analyzed the cumulative distributions of the daily rainfall and daily streamflow annual maxima series i e the series of maximum daily values during each of the water years fig 2c d as expected the extreme daily rainfall values in the hermon are larger than the meshushim however the discharge maxima series in the meshushim are larger than the hermon this suggests that smaller rainfall events trigger larger flow events in the meshushim the differences in the transformation of rainfall to streamflow in the two watersheds are further examined in fig 3 where the total observed flow and the estimated baseflow component are shown the baseflow component the slowly changing discharge that is contributed to the streamflow with a considerable delay following rainfall events was estimated herein using a recursive digital filter method to separate high from low frequency signals we used the eckhardt s 2005 method in which the streamflow is described as follows 1 q j q bj q sj where q is the total observed streamflow q s is the direct surface runoff q b is the baseflow and the j subscript represents the time steps to calculate the baseflow we used a robust filter with two empirical parameters α and β eckhardt 2005 rimmer and hartmann 2014 2 q bj 1 β α q bj 1 1 α β q j 1 α β q bj q j the β is a scaling parameter and α corresponds to the recession constant as seen in eq 3 for the special case that β is set to zero 3 q bj α q bj 1 for the hermon we set the α and β values as recommended by rimmer and salingar 2006 for the meshushim the α parameter was sequentially estimated by optimizing eq 3 and then selecting a β parameter as outlined in rimmer and hartmann 2014 in the hermon watershed the baseflow component comprises of about 75 of the total streamflow 84 106 m3 year and the daily baseflow exhibits a distinct seasonal cycle ranging between 1 1 4 6 m3 sec during march and november respectively during large flow events in the hermon the surface flow is up to about 7 times of its baseflow fig 3b the baseflow as measured at the meshushim outlet is only about 17 5 4 8 103 m3 year of the total streamflow the streamflow at the hydrometric station is mainly attributed to surface flow that occurred after the soil water content has reached saturation there is almost no observed variation in baseflow during the winter and the daily baseflow ranged between 0 08 and 0 26 103 m3 sec in march and november respectively the surface flow increased by 250 times more than before the flooding events fig 3a the annual runoff coefficient rc the ratio of water year flow and mean areal rainfall volumes are shown for the watersheds in fig 4 as a function of the water year rainfall compared with the hermon watershed the rc for meshushim is smaller and has a noticeable positive dependency on the annual rainfall the annual rainfall explains 60 and 40 of the rc inter annual variability for the meshushim and hermon respectively these results of rc dependency on the rainfall imply that at the hermon streamflow generation is dominated by multiyear climate conditions while at the meshushim the rainfall pattern of the current year is the dominant factor a key reason for the annual rainfall being a limited predictor of the rc is the watersheds capacity to absorb and retain water in the soil at the beginning of the water year october 1st after the long warm and dry summer season june september the soil is completely dry in both watersheds surface flow events were not observed before on average 250 and 220 mm of rainfall occurred since october 1st which is about 18 and 34 of the annual totals in the hermon and meshushim respectively table 2 the large variability of rainfall amount that is required for the first surface runoff event is attributed to the characteristics of the sequence of rainfall events at the beginning of the wet season during dry spells between rainfall events evapotranspiration and percolation processes deplete the water content of the soil and therefore the frequency and duration of these dry spells control the surface runoff generation 3 hydrologic model we used the hymke for the hermon watershed as implemented in rimmer and salingar 2006 the hymke formulation is in appendix a the hymke consists of four modules the surface layer 0 the vadose zone layer 1 groundwater aquifer 2 and surface flow 3 because of the large difference in depth to groundwater between the watersheds greater than 2000 m in the hermon watershed gilad 1980 and 100 600 m at the meshushim watershed dafny et al 2006 in addition to the differences in percolation characteristics the baseflow recession at the meshushim watershed is better represented by eliminating the vadose zone layer and implementing two parallel groundwater linear reservoirs rimmer and hartmann 2012 thus the groundwater module for the meshushim was modified to simulate the sum of two linear reservoirs fig 5 a the first linear reservoir represents the regional aquifer and the second represents perched aquifers that lay above the paleosols clay layers parts of the meshushim watershed feed the golan heights side springs that are downstream of the hydrometric station and do not contribute water to the baseflow of the meshushim stream dafny et al 2006 the model coefficients that distribute the surface water entry to the two linear groundwater reservoirs table 3 are summed to 90 while the remaining 10 is assumed to feed the side springs a modified procedure to calculate the daily actual evapotranspiration e aj mm was introduced in this hymke version in this modified procedure the e aj is calculated as a function of the water content of the upper soil the formulation of this modification is summarized in appendix a 3 1 parameters estimation we used a split sample methodology in which the parameters were calibrated using the 1976 1996 data and evaluated on the remaining time series 1997 2013 for meshushim and 1997 2001 for the hermon a description of the parameters and their selected values are given in table 3 to estimate the parameters we used a multistep automatic calibration approach an approach that combines the strengths of the manual and automatic calibration strategies hogue et al 2000 the observed discharge data was separated to baseflow and fast flow components as shown in eq 2 the model parameters were divided into parameters that dominate the simulations of the baseflow and the fast flow the parameters of each group were estimated by minimizing the error between the simulated and observed time series for both the baseflow and surface flow we used the microsoft excel solver premium solver platform 2010 to select parameter sets that minimized the sum of the squared residuals using a comprehensive and iterative trial and error experiments the calibration was carried in two steps first we selected the parameters that optimize the surface flow and second fixing the surface flow parameters we selected parameters that optimize the simulation of baseflow we used the following two goodness of fit coefficients to evaluate the model performance 1 the coefficient of determination r2 which represents the linear association between two time series and 2 the normalized benchmark simple model bsm efficiency coefficient which indicates the model s ability to predict the streamflow relative to a simple baseline model schaefli and gupta 2007 rimmer and hartmann 2014 the modified bsm substitutes the climatology component in the coefficient s denominator with two simple models benchmark models one for baseflow and one for surface flow eq 4 4 bsm 1 j 1 n q obsj q simj 2 j 1 n q obsj q bmj 2 where q obsj and q simj are the observed and simulated flow at the j s time step the q bmj is the benchmark model simulation calculated as described in eqs 5 and 6 the bsm efficiency values range from to 1 and a bsm value of 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the simulated and observed data an efficiency of 0 bsm 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the alternative simple baseline model and efficiency values of less than zero bsm 0 indicate that the simple model serves as a better predictor than the model the benchmark model for the baseflow consisted of a cyclic function sine that calculates the baseflow as a function of the day in the year according to the following equation 5 q simj b 1 a sin λ jd ω were jd is the day of the year a and b are scaling coefficients 1000 m3 λ is the angular frequency rad and ω is the phase shift the benchmark model for surface flow calculates the flow with the daily rain according to the following equation 6 q simj q obs a r obs a r j l a g where q obs and r obs are the average annual observed streamflow and rainfall respectively j represents daily time steps r j l a g is the daily rain lag represents the duration days between rain events to peak flow and a is the drainage area of the watershed in both watersheds the response of the streamflow to rainfall is within a day and therefore the lag parameter was set to one day 4 results 4 1 model evaluation a summary of the model evaluation results for both the calibration and validation durations are given in table 4 as mentioned above both watersheds were calibrated on 1973 1993 data and evaluated for 1976 2015 and 1976 2001 in the meshushim and hermon respectively it is seen that the simulations for the hermon performed better than for the meshushim and the simulated baseflow outperforms the simulated surface flow the bsm indices indicate that the model simulations outperformed the simulations of the baseflow and surface flow models in both watersheds 4 2 hydrologic response the hydrologic response differences between the two watersheds were further examined using the hydrologic model simulations the average fraction of the simulated water fluxes of evapotranspiration surface flow flux and are summarized in table 5 the sum of these three fluxes in each water year is about equal to the annual rain the small deviation of the total fluxes from the annual rainfall is attributed to model s numerical error of 0 001 and 0 036 in the meshushim and hermon respectively in this region because we assume that by the end of the long and dry summer june september the soil is dry year to year differences in soil water storage at the beginning of the water year october are negligible the differences in the partitioning of the water fluxes between the two watersheds are apparent as expected since the rainfall in the hermon is more than double of the meshushim watershed the absolute values in the hermon are larger for all fluxes however in relative terms the only flux with larger fraction in the hermon is water percolation into the aquifer annual distribution of the flux partitioning fig 6 shows the large inter annual variability of the surface flow in the meshushim and the relatively low variability in the hermon the evapotranspiration fluxes in both watersheds have small changes from year to year however in both watershed more pronounced in the meshushim during dry years the relative fraction of evapotranspiration is higher the seasonal wetting and drying dynamics of the soil is a key factor that controls both the generation of baseflow and surface flow increase water content of the soil increase the groundwater recharge rate due to increase of the percolation rate it is only when the top soil reaches saturation the excess water becomes available for percolation to the sub surface and surface flow is generated during wetter years the soil water content is higher for longer duration which yields higher efficiency in transformation of rainfall to streamflow the dynamic variability in soil water content during the year is similar in the two watersheds because of the strong correspondence in precipitation events between the two watersheds this strong correspondence is realized in the magnitude the timing and the number of rainfall events the soil water content and the rainfall of two typical dry and wet hydrologic years 1986 1987 and 1985 1986 respectively are shown for the two watersheds fig 7 although the dynamic of these two years were different the two watersheds exhibit a similar soil water content dynamic this similarity in the soil water dynamic is shown in spite of the hermon watershed experiencing more rainfall fig 7 the surface flow in both watersheds observed and simulated appeared only when the soil had reached saturation and during the period in which the soil had been saturated in both years and watersheds rainfall events that occurred before and after the saturated soil period did not trigger streamflow in the watersheds outlets 5 discussion surface runoff is usually generated when either precipitation rate exceeds the infiltration rate infiltration excess or precipitation falls on saturated land surface saturation excess the daily contribution surface flow to the total flow in the studied watersheds is clearly associated with the seasonal wetting and drying dynamics of the upper soil at the beginning of the hydrologic year october coming out of a long dry and warm summer when the soil is dry no surface runoff was observed in both watersheds regardless of the observed rainfall intensity surface runoff was observed in the hermon and meshushim watersheds only after mean areal precipitation of about 250 and 200 mm had accumulated since october 1 respectively this suggests that runoff generation in these watersheds is dominated by saturation excess processes saturation access as the major runoff generation process was previously reported in several other mediterranean climate studies e g coastal israel peleg et al 2015 plot scale experiments in jerusalem and the galilee mountains lavee et al 1998 galilee mountains ben zvi 1988 a mountainous watershed in the pyrenees gallart et al 2002 latron et al 2008 we note however that infiltration excess processes may occur in temporal and spatial scales that are finer than the analysis conducted in our study e g ries et al 2017 during the winter months december february the soil is becoming saturated and rainfall events often trigger surface flow during this period groundwater levels rise from percolation through preferential flow and matrix flow processes to increase the baseflow in the outlet of the watersheds during the fall and summer the soil is drying and surface flow events are infrequent while baseflow is gradually declining this dependency of streamflow on the soil water content of the upper soil was found to be stronger in the basaltic meshushim watershed because of the larger fraction of surface flow that is contributed to the total streamflow in the mostly karstic hermon watershed the percolation flux contributes to baseflow regardless of the soil saturation conditions at the upper soil the implication of such dependency is that the rainfall temporal and intra annual variability is a key factor that controls the surface flow generation and total streamflow in seasons with long dry spells between events the upper soil desiccates by evaporation and percolation processes and surface runoff is being suppressed this dependency on intra annual variability is demonstrated by dubrovský et al 2014 who showed that decrease in the numbers of rain events required larger rain events to saturate the soil and generate surface flow in addition the decrease in number of rainy days increased the total evapotranspiration increased the percolation flux and decreased the total streamflow future climate study of the region projected a decrease of total annual precipitation decrease in consecutive rainy days decrease in the number of wet days and increase in extreme rainfall events samuels et al 2017 sade et al 2016 peleg et al 2015 rimmer et al 2011 although the impact of the projected future precipitation regime on the water balance of the two watersheds will be manifested differently it is likely that surface runoff will decrease and the fraction of the evapotranspiration flux will increase in both watersheds in the meshushim watershed a larger fraction of the rainfall will be lost to evapotranspiration which will substantially decrease the proportion of rainfall that transforms into streamflow in the hermon watershed because of the dominance of the percolation flux the proportion of rainfall that is transformed to streamflow will be less affected in this study the watersheds were treated as uniform units without accounting for their internal spatial variability their spatial variability can be expressed in the variability of the hydrologic input and variability in the spatial characteristics of the land surface moreover the model parameters were selected to optimize the integrated response of the watersheds despite these potential sources of uncertainty the model simulations describe well the dominant processes in the watersheds this good performance enables the use of the model simulations to diagnose the unique hydrologic responses of the two watersheds and better understand their differences in this study the

model simulations describe well the dominant processes in the watersheds this good performance enables the use of the model simulations to diagnose the unique hydrologic responses of the two watersheds and better understand their differences our work highlights the strong dependency of streamflow generation on the soil water content of the watersheds this dependency implies that in order to accurately capture the hydrologic response of the watersheds it is important to describe in addition to the magnitude of the precipitation events the precipitation intra annual temporal characteristics these precipitation features should be considered and analyzed in climate models projections in order to appropriately projects future water resources inflow to lake kinneret 6 conclusions we examined the hydrologic response differences between two similar in size watersheds in a karstic hermon and a basaltic meshushim geologic formations these watersheds which are located in lake kinneret basin represent different hydrologic regimes the hydrologic response differences between the watersheds are expressed in the surface flow to baseflow ratio the runoff coefficient and their response to extreme rainfall the hymke model which was originally developed to simulate daily surface flow at the hermon karstic geologic formation was modified to capture the hydrologic response of the basaltic geologic formation at the meshushim watershed the simulated water fluxes among the various model compartments were examined to infer on the dominant processes in the watersheds although the prevailing precipitation events in both watersheds are commonly generated by the same weather synoptic system the annual precipitation in the hermon watershed is about twice as much as in the meshushim watershed this difference between the watersheds is magnified to five times when the annual streamflow are compared between the basins the magnifying of the streamflow ratio between the two watersheds is attributed to a higher fraction of evapotranspiration in the meshushim watershed and larger portion of rainfall that percolates to the aquifer and contributes to the stream through baseflow in the hermon watershed although lesser rainfall at the meshushim during the winter when the soil water content is at or near saturation surface flow at the meshushim is larger than the hermon this is because the large portion that percolates through preferential flow to the aquifer in the hermon watershed and the longer duration of the flood hydrograph which attenuates and reduces the peak flow in both watersheds surface flow is generated only when the soil water content is at or near saturation conditions this dependency of streamflow on soil water content makes the generation of surface flow highly sensitive to the intra annual variability of rainfall declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
