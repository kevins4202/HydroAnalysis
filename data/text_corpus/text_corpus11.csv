55,when soils dry water flow and nutrient diffusion cease as the hydraulic microenvironments vital for soil life become fragmented to delay soil drying locally and related adverse effects bacteria and plants modify their surroundings by releasing extracellular polymeric substances eps as a result the physical properties of hotspots like biological soil crusts or the rhizosphere differ from those of the surrounding bulk soil specifically the presence of eps delays evaporative soil drying despite the evidence of reduced evaporation from eps amended soils the mechanisms controlling soil water content dynamics remain elusive thus our study aimed to elucidate the potential of bacteria to modify their local environment when exposed to oscillations in soil water content induced by evaporative drying we incubated sand microcosms with two contrasting strains of bacillus subtilis for one week in a flow cabinet at the end of the incubation period local water loss was quantified and spatially resolved using time series neutron radiography strain ncib 3610 a complex biofilm producer steadily modified soil evaporation dynamics during the incubation period resulting in a substantial delay in soil drying due to hydraulic decoupling of the evaporation front from the soil surface evaporation dynamics remained largely unaltered in the microcosms inoculated with the domesticated strain 168 trp compared to the control treatment the mechanism of hydraulic decoupling induced by ncib 3610 was verified by estimates of diffusive fluxes and the position of the evaporation plane in the microcosm

numerous challenges including soil water content fluctuations that fundamentally affect the hydraulic microenvironment and thus bacterial growth and reproduction schimel 2018 tecon and or 2017 during soil drying the diminished water connectivity of the pore space limits nutrient diffusion and water flow central to these processes are the high surface tension and the low viscosity of water which govern the dynamics of liquid connectivity in bacterial aqueous habitats bacteria and plants evolved a common strategy to counteract eventual disruptions in transport and hydration conditions the resulting soil water dynamics of the rhizosphere and biological soil crusts are thus different from bulk soil conditions carminati et al 2010 rossi et al 2018 verrecchia et al 1995 these modifications are commonly ascribed to extracellular polymeric substances eps or mucilage released by bacteria and plant roots respectively bacterial and plant derived eps are polymeric blends that share main chemical and physical properties benard et al 2019 despite their high compositional diversity flemming and wingender 2010 naveed et al 2019 the interconnected network formed by eps retains large quantities of water flemming and wingender 2001 mccully and boyer 1997 read et al 1999 roberson and firestone 1992 segura campos et al 2014 and reduces soil hydraulic conductivity benard et al 2019 kroener et al 2018 or et al 2007 rosenzweig et al 2013 zheng et al 2018 dissolved polymers also increase the viscosity of the soil solution flemming and wingender 2001 2010 naveed et al 2017 stoodley et al 2002a and reduce the surface tension of liquids cooper et al 1981 raaijmakers et al 2010 read et al 2003 all these features decelerate soil drying and reduce fluctuations in soil transport properties during evaporative soil drying water drawn from the wet soil profile is lost to the unsaturated atmosphere at the soil surface in wet soils the evaporative demand of the atmosphere is met by transport of water to the soil surface via capillary action termed stage one evaporation once the evaporative demand at the soil surface can no longer be supplied by capillary flow the vaporization plane recedes into the soil profile and water loss is governed by diffusion of water vapor through the air filled pore space so called stage two evaporation lehmann et al 2008 shokri and or 2011 this second stage is accompanied by substantial reduction of evaporation rates and a deceleration of soil drying that leads to hydraulic decoupling the onset of stage two evaporation is a function of capillary forces soil hydraulic conductivity and the evaporative demand of the atmosphere a mismatch between the evaporative demand and the soil water supply arises when capillary forces or soil hydraulic conductivity are too low to sustain the evaporative fluxes as eps were shown to lower surface tension hence capillary forces and reduce soil hydraulic conductivity they promote hydraulic decoupling by accelerating the transition to stage two evaporation this might explain the reduced water loss during evaporation from soils inoculated with eps producing bacteria volk et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 soils amended with eps or et al 2007 and inoculated soil micromodels deng et al 2015 although microbially induced reduction of evaporative water loss is ascribed an adaptation to the challenging soil environment the time needed for adaptation and water related stress are mostly disregarded the same holds true for local soil water dynamics which are likely heterogeneous in space but are rarely quantified here we quantify the potential of bacteria to engineer their porous environment when they are exposed to repeated wetting and drying cycles we hypothesize that hydraulic decoupling between the soil surface and the evaporation front caused by bacterial growth and eps production shelters soil water from evaporation to test our hypothesis we used sand microcosms inoculated with either bacillus subtilis ncib 3610 which is known for complex biofilm formation or its domesticated counterpart bacillus subtilis 168 trp gallegos monterrosa et al 2016 mcloon et al 2011 sand microcosms were subject to daily wetting drying cycles for one week at the end of this adaptation period local water loss was monitored during evaporative drying with time series neutron radiography to spatially map the distribution of water losses additionally we verified the observed drying dynamics in microcosms inoculated with strain ncib 3610 by estimating the thickness of the sub viscous atmospheric boundary layer and the depth of the evaporation plane and confirmed the role of polymeric substances in hydraulic decoupling by conducting an evaporation experiment using sand amended with xanthan as an eps analogue 2 methods 2 1 choice of bacterial strains two bacillus subtilis strains were selected based on their contrasting biofilm forming potential gallegos monterrosa et al 2016 mcloon et al 2011 and were used to inoculate sand microcosms both strains were stored at 80 c in glycerol and lysogeny broth lb media the wildtype strain b subtilis ncib 3610 stanley et al 2014 and the domesticated strain b subtilis 168 trp tanous et al 2008 differ in their ability to develop robust biofilms in liquid media and on solid agar due to several genes associated with extracellular matrix production that are altered in the domesticated strain mcloon et al 2011 the domestication of b subtilis with respect to biofilm formation could be traced to five genetic alterations between strain 168 and ncib 3610 point mutations in coding sequences sfp epsc and swra a promotor mutation in degq and the absence of a plasmid borne gene rapp mcloon et al 2011 although the strain 168 trp a tryptophan prototrophic derivative of 168 was also found to develop architecturally complex colonies under certain conditions it carries the point mutation epsc gallegos monterrosa et al 2016 furthermore the biofilm formation is repressed under high salinity conditions rath et al 2020 that likely occurred in our microcosm experiment during evaporative drying that increases the salt concentration over time hence we expect the wildtype to reduce evaporation from microcosms due to its biofilm forming potential and the production of eps which is a gel like matrix consisting of macromolecules like polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids branda et al 2005 stoodley et al 2002b 2 2 pre culture and growth rates in liquid culture strains were transferred from a frozen 80 c stock to a 5 ml tsb tryptic soy broth vwr international liquid culture and incubated overnight in a shaking incubator at 28 c and 280 rpm the stationary stage cultures were diluted 1 32 and re grown for two hours before plating on tsb agar 1 5 w v european bacteriological agar lab logistics group gmbh for further use a monoclonal colony of each strain was inoculated in liquid overnight cultures used in the microcosm experiment agar plates were stored at room temperature due to the sensitivity of b subtilis to low temperatures the strains displayed contrasting phenotypes when spotted on fresh tsb agar plates with high liquid content the dense colonies of the wildtype were able to take up liquid from the plates that resulted in extruded structures si fig 1b overall the wildtype displayed the expected intricate biofilm architecture that was absent in the domesticated strain as previously reported mcloon et al 2011 to compare the growth potential of the two strains we determined their maximal growth rates triplicate liquid cultures containing 15 ml tsb in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks were inoculated with 100 μl of an overnight culture optical density od dynamics at 600 nm od600 ultrospec 10 cell density meter amerham biosciences were recorded by extracting 1 ml from the cultures at different timepoints to account for non linearity of od600 measurement readings were corrected using a relative density rd approach for calibration of od600 lin et al 2010 to estimate growth rates during exponential phase we used linear regression on the logarithm of rd timeseries normalized to initial conditions at inoculation si fig 1a 2 3 sand microcosms and treatments to evaluate the impact of bacterial growth and eps release on soil drying dynamics a sterile control and two treatments incubated with the contrasting strains of b subtilis were prepared acid washed and autoclaved quartz sand 0 1 0 3 mm carlo bernasconi ag switzerland was filled to 2 5 mm below the upper edge of aluminum containers 16 mm x 6 mm x 30 mm to test whether aluminum impaired the growth of the two strains containers were placed on tsb agar plates and inoculated with 100 μl of each strain s liquid culture at od600 of 0 1 no inhibition of growth was observed near containers even after prolonged exposure of several weeks microcosms were closed from the bottom with a membrane 20 µm mesh size to allow drainage of excess liquid prepared containers were buried so that 2 3 or the lower 20 mm of each container was immersed in glass beads 1 mm diameter to allow drainage and to limit evaporation from the bottom all containers were placed in a laminar flow cabinet ef s4 clean air techniek b v to ensure constant evaporation by air flow the cabinet was sterilized by uv light exposure 15 min prior to inoculation on day one 0 8 ml of sterile tsb tryptic soy broth vwr international solution was applied at the surface of all control treatment replicates this negative control without cell inoculum was used to account for potential effects of tsb on evaporation dynamics and to test for contamination microcosms of the other two treatments were inoculated with 0 8 ml of diluted 1 32 overnight cultures that were re grown in tsb for four hours to ensure cells were in exponential growth phase before diluting to an od600 of 0 1 the microcosms of each treatment were placed on balances to monitor cumulative changes in weight during the adaptation period every 24 h 0 8 ml of sterile dilute 0 1 tsb solution was applied to the surface of each microcosm a second set of larger glass containers 76 mm x 10 mm x 200 mm were prepared with a coarser sand from the same manufacturer 0 3 0 9 mm diameter carlo bernasconi ag switzerland saturated with a xanthan solution e 415 solegraells at a content of 2 mg xanthan per gram of sand and a control column saturated with deionized water the evaporation dynamics of this sand were previously analyzed lehmann et al 2008 and this material was chosen because the capillary flow paths are relatively short in the range of 100 mm thus disruption of capillary flow occurred after a few days of evaporation for the finer sand used in inoculated microcosms the experiment would last several weeks until the flow paths break containers were placed on scales and evaporation dynamics of both treatments were derived from recorded mass loss over time the profile of gravimetric water content was obtained after 12 3 days by oven drying individual layers of wet sand removed from containers at 10 mm increments this experiment was conducted to study the effect of evaporation suppression due to an eps analogue and to support the observations made for microcosms inoculated with b subtilis ncib 3610 2 4 dynamics of cell counts and biomass every 24 h a replicate of each treatment was destructively sampled to determine the number of colony forming units cfu and the liquid extractable biomass sand was removed from the containers and cells were extracted by suspension in 10 ml phosphate buffered saline pbs phosphate buffered saline ph 7 4 gibco followed by 10 s of vortexing at maximum speed and 2 min in an ultrasonic bath the od600 of the extraction was recorded with reference to pure pbs to determine cfu counts the suspension was serially diluted 1 103 1 104 and 1 105 and 100 μl were plated on tsb agar 1 5 w v at the highest dilution 1 105 also undiluted suspensions were spotted on agar plates to serve as controls negative control for treatment without cells and positive control for others the weight of the dry sand was recorded prior to cell extraction in addition 5 ml of the extracted pbs solution were filtered using isopore millipore with 0 4 μm pore size the filters were weighed after airdrying for 24 h to estimate the amount of extractable biomass extractable biomass and cfu counts were measured between day 1 and 6 of the experiment on day 7 the microcosms were sealed with parafilm parafilm m laboratory film bemis to prevent evaporation prior to the monitored dry down experiment on day 8 by means of neutron radiography dynamics of cell counts and biomass are summarized in the supplementary materials si fig 2 2 5 time series neutron radiography the loss of water from the upper sand surface of each microcosm was monitored with time series neutron radiography at intervals of about 10 minutes neutron radiography is highly sensitive to h rich liquids like water or tsb in porous media due to their strong attenuation of neutrons moradi et al 2009 this allows for non invasive quantification of liquid volume distribution carminati et al 2007 by analysis of the differences between signals of dry and wet samples the direct computation based on the neutron cross section of the constituting materials is not possible due to the heterogeneity of the sand material time series neutron radiography was conducted at the icon imaging with cold neutrons beamline of the paul scherrer institute villigen switzerland kaestner et al 2011 a ccd camera with a field of view of 15 15 cm was used to capture the mean local decrease in liquid volume across microcosms i e across 0 6 cm thickness of porous sand at a pixel size of 85 µm over a period of 52 h the attenuation coefficient corresponding to the signal of a given thickness of liquid was derived by use of step wedges of specific thickness in direction of the neutron beam filled with the respective liquid resulting neutron attenuation coefficient of water and undiluted tsb solution were nearly identical si fig 3 acquired images were also corrected for neutron scattering boillat et al 2018 carminati et al 2019 normalized spot cleaned and filtered 2 6 estimation of diffusive fluxes from evaporation plane to validate if hydraulic decoupling is a plausible mechanism in the microcosms inoculated with b subtilis ncib 3610 we estimated the thickness of the sub viscous atmospheric boundary layer and the depth of the evaporation plane at stage two i e the thickness of the dry sand layer based on the observed total water losses from the time series neutron radiography measurements at stage one evaporation the evaporation rate q m s 1 is determined by diffusion across the sub viscous atmospheric boundary layer l air m for a given cross sectional area and a density of water 1000 kg m 3 we fitted l air to match the observed evaporation rate then the diffusion length through the dry sand layer l sand was fitted to match observed rate q at the beginning of stage two evaporation assuming diffusion across the sand and air boundary layers arranged in series parameters were derived using matlab version 2020a the mathworks inc by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed q at the two time points q is calculated according to 1 q j a with diffusion flux j kg s 1 m 2 and cross sectional area of column surface a m2 j is derived according to fick 1855 as 2 j d e f f δ c l a i r l s a n d with l air m and l sand m as diffusion length through air and dry sand respectively using the difference in vapor concentration c kg m 3 across the porous and atmospheric domains an effective diffusion coefficient deff m2 s 1 is estimated based on the concept of resistors arranged in series weighted harmonic averaging 3 d e f f l a i r l s a n d l a i r d a i r l s a n d d s a n d with the

of 0 5 and a volumetric air content ε of 0 48 for the dry sand 4 d s a n d ε 10 3 ϕ 2 d a i r the difference in vapor concentration c is derived according to the ideal gas law defined as 5 δ c p s a t

of 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and temperature t of 293 k 20 c 3 results the difference in maximal exponential growth rates in liquid culture between the two b subtilis strains was smaller than the uncertainty of the triplicate measurements 0 75 0 02 h 1 and 0 77 0 02 h 1 for 168 trp and ncib 3610 respectively values were consistent with previous reports of 0 75 h 1 for 168 trp jules et al 2009 and correspond to a minimum generation time of approximately one hour shaking of liquid cultures of strain 168 trp resulted in quickly dispersing foam while for liquid cultures of ncib 3610 stable foam was created that persisted for several hours the biomass extracted from the sand microcosms and the obtained cfu counts fluctuated over time but did not display systematic differences between the two strains thus we assumed similar cell densities and fitness for both strains throughout the microcosm experiment si fig 2b no cross contamination was detected in undiluted suspensions extracted and spotted on agar plates the following qualitative observations were made for which no quantities were derived during the growth period prior to neutron imaging microcosms inoculated with either strain of b subtilis developed a robust crust like sand layer of a few mm in thickness at the surface after two days into the experiment this robust sand layer might have been the reason for the reduced infiltrability resulting in temporal ponding of applied nutrient solution observed thereafter no alteration of infiltrability nor a change in sand cohesion was observed in the control treatment with rapid infiltration of the nutrient solution after each application also the porosity in microcosms inoculated with strain ncib 3610 increased over time which led to a lift of the sand surface of about 2 5 mm although both strains appeared to alter infiltration to a similar degree evaporation dynamics were distinctly different between microcosms inoculated with either strain monitored fluctuations in weight between liquid applications for each treatment showed a continuous adaptation of evaporation dynamics for microcosms inoculated with strain ncib 3610 si fig 4a 5 over the growth period the early evaporation rate increased for microcosms inoculated with either strain near the end of the incubation period on day six the initially high evaporation rate was followed by a similar characteristic decrease for the ncib 3610 treatment as observed subsequently with time series neutron radiography note that the captured cumulative weights for each treatment during the growth period might include weight differences caused by evaporation of liquid which drained from the microcosms into the coarse glass bead packing below the mean cumulative water losses across six microcosms of each treatment were monitored with time series neutron radiography fig 1 a in treatments inoculated with strain ncib 3610 water loss was reduced by about 58 after 52 h when compared to the control treatment water loss from the ncib 3610 treatment was reduced by about 51 in comparison to microcosms inoculated with strain 168 trp the water loss from ncib 3610 treatments was initially accelerated and ceased after ca 15 h fig 1b from 5 4 mm day 1 to a stable rate of ca 0 8 mm day 1 evaporation from control treatments and microcosms inoculated with b subtilis 168 trp decreased gradually from 3 5 mm day 1 to about 2 3 mm day 1 and 1 8 mm day 1 after 52 h respectively for the treatment with b subtilis ncib 3610 an immediate decrease in evaporation rate i e a transition from stage one to stage two evaporation was observed initial water loss by evaporation from the soil surface was followed by a detachment of the evaporation plane from the surface and diffusion of water vapor through a dry soil layer stage two lehmann et al 2008 note that the evaporation front did not gradually recede but abruptly jumped to form a new evaporation plane at deeper layers shokri and or 2011 the water loss dynamics over depth show a similar average profile of water depletion for the control and the 168 trp treatments fig 2 a initial water losses occurred at a comparable depth and magnitude with a gradual increase in depletion depth over time for the ncib 3610 treatment high initial water losses were observed within the first few millimeters of the profile and ceased after 15 h followed by minor depletion at a reduced mean evaporation rate i e fig 2b estimates of the atmospheric boundary layer thickness and the depth of the dry sand layer were derived for the ncib 3610 treatment which displayed a clear separation of two soil drying stages by considering an initial mean evaporation rate of 5 4 mm day 1 and a reduced evaporation rate of 0 8 mm day 1 which was reached after ca 15 h at the onset of stage two see fig 1 the estimated atmospheric boundary layer thickness was 1 3 mm and soil dry depth was 1 9 mm derived values are consistent with the observed rapid water loss near the sand surface in ncib 3610 treatments fig 2a the average profile of water losses shows increased depletion near the surface and up to ca 10 mm depth and slightly reduced loss below this depth for the 168 trp treatment fig 2b similarly high water loss occurred near the surface of microcosms inoculated with b subtilis ncib 3610 while the cumulative water loss below this region was markedly reduced the results indicate that the evaporation from columns inoculated with ncib 3610 was limited after a thin surface layer of a few millimeters had dried to confirm that evaporation losses in the microcosms inoculated with ncib 3610 could be caused by eps we conducted additional experiments using sand columns amended with xanthan as an eps analogue the drying dynamics measured for the sand xanthan mixture were similar as for the microcosms modified by b subtilis ncib 3610 an initially high evaporation rate was followed by a relatively constant low rate of water loss fig 3 a the period of stage one evaporation for the initially water saturated control lasted for six days before the transition to stage two evaporation occurred the stage two evaporation rate of the control was higher than for the xanthan treatment after eight days this difference could have been caused by dry xanthan structures deposited in the pores above the evaporation plane limiting water vapor diffusion reduced gas diffusion was reported for coarse sand amended with dried seed mucilage haupenthal et al 2021 the distribution of soil liquid content over depth after 12 3 days showed that the top 20 mm were completely dry for the xanthan column indicating that the evaporation plane was at the depth of about 20 mm at the end of the experiment below 50 mm the column was nearly saturated fig 3b in the control column the evaporation plane was at depth of about 10 mm completely dry top layer of 10 mm thickness below this dry layer the water content increased gradually with depth and was similar to the spatial profile of water loss observed with neutron radiography in the control treatment and the microcosms inoculated with b subtilis 168 trp fig 2a 4 discussion the comparison of evaporative water loss illuminates the potential impact of complex microbiome processes on soil water dynamics the substantial decrease in evaporative water loss observed after a growth period of one week for microcosms inoculated with b subtilis ncib 3610 is explained by eps production and likely its accumulation in the pore space the modification of soil properties requires time indicated by the change in evaporation dynamics during the growth period si fig 4 a 5 the observed deceleration of evaporative soil drying resulted in a substantial reduction of total water loss differences between the treatments are caused by an accelerated shift from stage one to stage two evaporation that effectively decouples the evaporation front from the soil surface allowing only the slow diffusion of water vapor from the retreating evaporation plane across the dry soil layer decoupling of the evaporation front was followed by an overall reduced water loss at greater depth fig 2a also the depth time profiles of local water loss were much smoother and less scattered when compared to the other treatments the overall reduction in water loss is caused by a shift from capillary transport of water towards the soil surface to diffusion of water from the profile towards the surface this transition occurred immediately after initiation of evaporative soil drying typically at stage two the evaporation rate gradually declines as the evaporation plane moves downwards in our case the evaporation rate remained fairly constant after 15 h 0 8 mm day 1 indicating no considerable retreat of the evaporation plane the estimated diffusion length at stage two was in good agreement with the thickness of the dry region obtained from neutron imaging this suggests that hydraulic decoupling is a plausible mechanism for the observed dynamics of evaporative water loss we observed equivalent dynamics with the formation of a retreating evaporation plane and a dry layer near the surface for xanthan treated sand this suggests that eps could limit the capillary flow to the evaporating plane the reduced water loss near ca 1 cm in depth in treatments with strain ncib 3610 could be the result of decreased water retention i e water content in this region caused by locally increased pore sizes neither the control treatment nor the microcosms inoculated with b subtilis strain 168 trp exhibited evaporation dynamics or spatially differentiated water loss comparable to changes induced by strain ncib 3610 nevertheless the 168 trp treatment showed a tendency for increased water loss near the soil surface and a slight decrease in water loss at greater depth this alteration might have been caused by the accumulation of bacterial cells near the surface which could potentially induce a reduction in soil hydraulic conductivity due to pore clogging which would also explain the decrease of liquid infiltration observed despite the substantial fluctuations in water content both strains appeared to thrive within the porous environment reflected by the cfus obtained si fig 2b the decrease in extracted biomass over time with exception of the extract at day 4 could be related to the accumulation of eps in the pore space that might have impaired the extraction process we conclude that structurally complex polymeric substances and an adaptive period are required to induce the observed modifications to the evaporation dynamics the observed early shift to diffusion limited water loss could be caused by multiple soil physical alterations however potential modifications caused by strain 168 trp were comparably ineffective in this context for example bacteria can reduce the surface tension of the gas liquid interface raaijmakers et al 2010 this modification causes a decrease in capillary forces responsible for transporting water to the soil surface and reduce water flow i e by facilitating quick depletion of soil water near the surface in presence of strain ncib 3610 an increase in porosity of the sand in microcosms was observed which led to a rise of the soil profile by about 2 5 mm this increase might have been caused by surface active substances which lead to the formation of stable gas bubbles when water infiltrated from the sand surface stable foam razafindralambo et al 1996 in liquid cultures of strain ncib 3610 is associated with the production of surfactin that is absent in strain 168 julkowska et al 2005 surfactin is a bacterial lipopeptide surfactant that lowers the surface tension of water and is produced extensively in the presence of solid carriers yeh et al 2008 the skimming of such foam was used by cooper et al 1981 to quantify the production of surfactin which was reported to lower the surface tension to a minimum of 27 mn m 1 mixtures of surfactant and polymers can enhance foam stability pugh 2016 which could explain the observed increase in porosity additionally bacterial eps decrease the soil hydraulic conductivity rosenzweig et al 2013 thus limiting the capillary flow to the soil surface therefore the reduced capillary forces and higher friction i e reduced soil hydraulic conductivity can simultaneously contribute to the observed hydraulic decoupling for both bacterial treatments reduced infiltration resulting in the short term ponding of the daily applied nutrient solution occurred after two days this reduction was accompanied by the formation of a stable crust at the sand surface of a few millimeters these observations emphasize the effect of bacterial activity on soil hydraulic conductivity several studies showed a marked decrease of soil hydraulic conductivity in presence of polymeric substances benard et al 2019 colica et al 2014 rosenzweig et al 2013 volk et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 such reduction would also explain the rapid hydraulic decoupling of capillary flow from the surface observed in the ncib 3610 treatment as high eps content is usually associated with the formation of a stable crust at the soil surface rossi et al 2018 however similar ponding of liquid and the formation of a stable crust was also observed in the 168 trp treatment since the distinct hydraulic decoupling during evaporative drying was exclusively observed in sand inoculated with strain ncib 3610 both strains appear to have modified infiltration dynamics by different means 5 conclusions hydraulic decoupling of the evaporation plane from the surface during evaporative soil drying reduces water losses and can be induced by bacteria the process is explained by the eps mediated reduction of soil hydraulic conductivity and capillary forces that can effectively reduce water loss from the soil surface by sheltering water below a layer of dry soil as validated by use of xanthan amended sand these modifications of soil physical properties occurred during a period of fluctuations in soil water content and appeared to be part of a continuous adaptive process the comparison of the control treatment and treatments with b subtilis 168 trp and b subtilis ncib 3610 highlights the impact of differences in soil bacterial genetic traits beyond growth rates and population sizes although infiltration was similarly decreased in the presence of both strains the cumulative and local water losses during evaporation were distinctly different and hydraulic decoupling was solely observed in microcosms modified by the complex biofilm producer ncib 3610 this wild type strain has the potential to drastically engineer the architecture of the soil pore space that shapes the rates and spatial distribution of soil water losses our study demonstrates how bacterial induced modifications of soil physical properties can affect evaporative soil drying beyond what we observed eps in soil and its effect on local soil water distribution and soil water dynamics remains surprisingly unexplored especially in regions like the rhizosphere where microbial growth is stimulated by exudates released from plant roots the processes underlying microbial modifications of soil water dynamics remain schematic and hypothetical understanding the potential of bacteria to divert soil water fluxes during dry periods is critical for unraveling the role of specific genetic traits in the adaptation to environmental changes to draw conclusions for more complex environments such as the rhizosphere or biological soil crusts the interplay of distinct microbial traits taxa and associated dynamics in resource availability need to be considered credit authorship contribution statement pascal benard

55,when soils dry water flow and nutrient diffusion cease as the hydraulic microenvironments vital for soil life become fragmented to delay soil drying locally and related adverse effects bacteria and

numerous challenges including soil water content fluctuations that fundamentally affect the hydraulic microenvironment and thus bacterial growth and reproduction schimel 2018 tecon and or 2017 during

et al 2002a and reduce the surface tension of liquids cooper et al 1981 raaijmakers et al 2010 read et al 2003 all these features decelerate soil drying and reduce fluctuations in soil transport properties during evaporative soil drying water drawn from the wet soil profile is lost to the unsaturated atmosphere at the soil surface in wet soils the evaporative demand of the atmosphere is met by transport of water to the soil surface via capillary action termed stage one evaporation once the evaporative demand at the soil surface can no longer be supplied by capillary flow the vaporization plane recedes into the soil profile and water loss is governed by diffusion of water vapor through the air filled pore space so called stage two evaporation lehmann et al 2008 shokri and or 2011 this second stage is accompanied by substantial reduction of evaporation rates and a deceleration of soil drying that leads to hydraulic decoupling the onset of stage two evaporation is a function of capillary forces soil hydraulic conductivity and the evaporative demand of the atmosphere a mismatch between the evaporative demand and the soil water supply arises when capillary forces or soil hydraulic conductivity are too low to sustain the evaporative fluxes as eps were shown to lower surface tension hence capillary forces and reduce soil hydraulic conductivity they promote hydraulic decoupling by accelerating the transition to stage two evaporation this might explain the reduced water loss during evaporation from soils inoculated with eps producing bacteria volk et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 soils amended with eps or et al 2007 and inoculated soil micromodels deng et al 2015 although microbially induced reduction of evaporative water loss is ascribed an adaptation to the challenging soil environment the time needed for adaptation and water related stress are mostly disregarded the same holds true for local soil water dynamics which are likely heterogeneous in space but are rarely quantified here we quantify the potential of bacteria to engineer their porous environment when they are exposed to repeated wetting and drying cycles we hypothesize that hydraulic decoupling between the soil surface and the evaporation front caused by bacterial growth and eps production shelters soil water from evaporation to test our hypothesis we used sand microcosms inoculated with either bacillus subtilis ncib 3610 which is known for complex biofilm formation or its domesticated counterpart bacillus subtilis 168 trp gallegos monterrosa et al 2016 mcloon et al 2011 sand microcosms were subject to daily wetting drying cycles for one week at the end of this adaptation period local water loss was monitored during evaporative drying with time series neutron radiography to spatially map the distribution of water losses additionally we verified the observed drying dynamics in microcosms inoculated with strain ncib 3610 by estimating the thickness of the sub viscous atmospheric boundary layer and the depth of the evaporation plane and confirmed the role of polymeric substances in hydraulic decoupling by conducting an evaporation experiment using sand amended with xanthan as an eps analogue 2 methods 2 1 choice of bacterial strains two bacillus subtilis strains were selected based on their contrasting biofilm forming potential gallegos monterrosa et al 2016 mcloon et al 2011 and were used to inoculate sand microcosms both strains were stored at 80 c in glycerol and lysogeny broth lb media the wildtype strain b subtilis ncib 3610 stanley et al 2014 and the domesticated strain b subtilis 168 trp tanous et al 2008 differ in their ability to develop robust biofilms in liquid media and on solid agar due to several genes associated with extracellular matrix production that are altered in the domesticated strain mcloon et al 2011 the domestication of b subtilis with respect to biofilm formation could be traced to five genetic alterations between strain 168 and ncib 3610 point mutations in coding sequences sfp epsc and swra a promotor mutation in degq and the absence of a plasmid borne gene rapp mcloon et al 2011 although the strain 168 trp a tryptophan prototrophic derivative of 168 was also found to develop architecturally complex colonies under certain conditions it carries the point mutation epsc gallegos monterrosa et al 2016 furthermore the biofilm formation is repressed under high salinity conditions rath et al 2020 that likely occurred in our microcosm experiment during evaporative drying that increases the salt concentration over time hence we expect the wildtype to reduce evaporation from microcosms due to its biofilm forming potential and the production of eps which is a gel like matrix consisting of macromolecules like polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids branda et al 2005 stoodley et al 2002b 2 2 pre culture and growth rates in liquid culture strains were transferred from a frozen 80 c stock to a 5 ml tsb tryptic soy broth vwr international liquid culture and incubated overnight in a shaking incubator at 28 c and 280 rpm the stationary stage cultures were diluted 1 32 and re grown for two hours before plating on tsb agar 1 5 w v european bacteriological agar lab logistics group gmbh for further use a monoclonal colony of each strain was inoculated in liquid overnight cultures used in the microcosm experiment agar plates were stored at room temperature due to the sensitivity of b subtilis to low temperatures the strains displayed contrasting phenotypes when spotted on fresh tsb agar plates with high liquid content the dense colonies of the wildtype were able to take up liquid from the plates that resulted in extruded structures si fig 1b overall the wildtype displayed the expected intricate biofilm architecture that was absent in the domesticated strain as previously reported mcloon et al 2011 to compare the growth potential of the two strains we determined their maximal growth rates triplicate liquid cultures containing 15 ml tsb in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks were inoculated with 100 μl of an overnight culture optical density od dynamics at 600 nm od600 ultrospec 10 cell density meter amerham biosciences were recorded by extracting 1 ml from the cultures at different timepoints to account for non linearity of od600 measurement readings were corrected using a relative density rd approach for calibration of od600 lin et al 2010 to estimate growth rates during exponential phase we used linear regression on the logarithm of rd timeseries normalized to initial conditions at inoculation si fig 1a 2 3 sand microcosms and treatments to evaluate the impact of bacterial growth and eps release on soil drying dynamics a sterile control and two treatments incubated with the contrasting strains of b subtilis were prepared acid washed and autoclaved quartz sand 0 1 0 3 mm carlo bernasconi ag switzerland was filled to 2 5 mm below the upper edge of aluminum containers 16 mm x 6 mm x 30 mm to test whether aluminum impaired the growth of the two strains containers were placed on tsb agar plates and inoculated with 100 μl of each strain s liquid culture at od600 of 0 1 no inhibition of growth was observed near containers even after prolonged exposure of several weeks microcosms were closed from the bottom with a membrane 20 µm mesh size to allow drainage of excess liquid prepared containers were buried so that 2 3 or the lower 20 mm of each container was immersed in glass beads 1 mm diameter to allow drainage and to limit evaporation from the bottom all containers were placed in a laminar flow cabinet ef s4 clean air techniek b v to ensure constant evaporation by air flow the cabinet was sterilized by uv light exposure 15 min prior to inoculation on day one 0 8 ml of sterile tsb tryptic soy broth vwr international solution was applied at the surface of all control treatment replicates this negative control without cell inoculum was used to account for potential effects of tsb on evaporation dynamics and to test for contamination microcosms of the other two treatments were inoculated with 0 8 ml of diluted 1 32 overnight cultures that were re grown in tsb for four hours to ensure cells were in exponential growth phase before diluting to an od600 of 0 1 the microcosms of each treatment were placed on balances to monitor cumulative changes in weight during the adaptation period every 24 h 0 8 ml of sterile dilute 0 1 tsb solution was applied to the surface of each microcosm a second set of larger glass containers 76 mm x 10 mm x 200 mm were prepared with a coarser sand from the same manufacturer 0 3 0 9 mm diameter carlo bernasconi ag switzerland saturated with a xanthan solution e 415 solegraells at a content of 2 mg xanthan per gram of sand and a control column saturated with deionized water the evaporation dynamics of this sand were previously analyzed lehmann et al 2008 and this material was chosen because the capillary flow paths are relatively short in the range of 100 mm thus disruption of capillary flow occurred after a few days of evaporation for the finer sand used in inoculated microcosms the experiment would last several weeks until the flow paths break containers were placed on scales and evaporation dynamics of both treatments were derived from recorded mass loss over time the profile of gravimetric water content was obtained after 12 3 days by oven drying individual layers of wet sand removed from containers at 10 mm increments this experiment was conducted to study the effect of evaporation suppression due to an eps analogue and to support the observations made for microcosms inoculated with b subtilis ncib 3610 2 4 dynamics of cell counts and biomass every 24 h a replicate of each treatment was destructively sampled to determine the number of colony forming units cfu and the liquid extractable biomass sand was removed from the containers and cells were extracted by suspension in 10 ml phosphate buffered saline pbs phosphate buffered saline ph 7 4 gibco followed by 10 s of vortexing at maximum speed and 2 min in an ultrasonic bath the od600 of the extraction was recorded with reference to pure pbs to determine cfu counts the suspension was serially diluted 1 103 1 104 and 1 105 and 100 μl were plated on tsb agar 1 5 w v at the highest dilution 1 105 also undiluted suspensions were spotted on agar plates to serve as controls negative control for treatment without cells and positive control for others the weight of the dry sand was recorded prior to cell extraction in addition 5 ml of the extracted pbs solution were filtered using isopore millipore with 0 4 μm pore size the filters were weighed after airdrying for 24 h to estimate the amount of extractable biomass extractable biomass and cfu counts were measured between day 1 and 6 of the experiment on day 7 the microcosms were sealed with parafilm parafilm m laboratory film bemis to prevent evaporation prior to the monitored dry down experiment on day 8 by means of neutron radiography dynamics of cell counts and biomass are summarized in the supplementary materials si fig 2 2 5 time series neutron radiography the loss of water from the upper sand surface of each microcosm was monitored with time series neutron radiography at intervals of about 10 minutes neutron radiography is highly sensitive to h rich liquids like water or tsb in porous media due to their strong attenuation of neutrons moradi et al 2009 this allows for non invasive quantification of liquid volume distribution carminati et al 2007 by analysis of the differences between signals of dry and wet samples the direct computation based on the neutron cross section of the constituting materials is not possible due to the heterogeneity of the sand material time series neutron radiography was conducted at the icon imaging with cold neutrons beamline of the paul scherrer institute villigen switzerland kaestner et al 2011 a ccd camera with a field of view of 15 15 cm was used to capture the mean local decrease in liquid volume across microcosms i e across 0 6 cm thickness of porous sand at a pixel size of 85 µm over a period of 52 h the attenuation coefficient corresponding to the signal of a given thickness of liquid was derived by use of step wedges of specific thickness in direction of the neutron beam filled with the respective liquid resulting neutron attenuation coefficient of water and undiluted tsb solution were nearly identical si fig 3 acquired images were also corrected for neutron scattering boillat et al 2018 carminati et al 2019 normalized spot cleaned and filtered 2 6 estimation of diffusive fluxes from evaporation plane to validate if hydraulic decoupling is a plausible mechanism in the microcosms inoculated with b subtilis ncib 3610 we estimated the thickness of the sub viscous atmospheric boundary layer and the depth of the evaporation plane at stage two i e the thickness of the dry sand layer based on the observed total water losses from the time series neutron radiography measurements at stage one evaporation the evaporation rate q m s 1 is determined by diffusion across the sub viscous atmospheric boundary layer l air m for a given cross sectional area and a density of water 1000 kg m 3 we fitted l air to match the observed evaporation rate then the diffusion length through the dry sand layer l sand was fitted to match observed rate q at the beginning of stage two evaporation assuming diffusion across the sand and air boundary layers arranged in series parameters were derived using matlab version 2020a the mathworks inc by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed q at the two time points q is calculated according to 1 q j a with diffusion flux j kg s 1 m 2 and cross sectional area of column surface a m2 j is derived according to fick 1855 as 2 j d e f f δ c l a i r l s a n d with l air m and l sand m as diffusion length through air and dry sand respectively using the difference in vapor concentration c kg m 3 across the porous and atmospheric domains an effective diffusion coefficient deff m2 s 1 is estimated based on the concept of resistors arranged in series weighted harmonic averaging 3 d e f f l a i r l s a n d l a i r d a i r l s a n d d s a n d with the

of 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and temperature t of 293 k 20 c 3 results the difference in maximal exponential growth rates in liquid culture between the two b subtilis strains was smaller than the uncertainty of the triplicate measurements 0 75 0 02 h 1 and 0 77 0 02 h 1 for 168 trp and ncib 3610 respectively values were consistent with previous reports of 0 75 h 1 for 168 trp jules et al 2009 and correspond to a minimum generation time of approximately one hour shaking of liquid cultures of strain 168 trp resulted in quickly dispersing foam while for liquid cultures of ncib 3610 stable foam was created that persisted for several hours the biomass extracted from the sand microcosms and the obtained cfu counts fluctuated over time but did not display systematic differences between the two strains thus we assumed similar cell densities and fitness for both strains throughout the microcosm experiment si fig 2b no cross contamination was detected in undiluted suspensions extracted and spotted on agar plates the following qualitative observations were made for which no quantities were derived during the growth period prior to neutron imaging microcosms inoculated with either strain of b subtilis developed a robust crust like sand layer of a few mm in thickness at the surface after two days into the experiment this robust sand layer might have been the reason for the reduced infiltrability resulting in temporal ponding of applied nutrient solution observed thereafter no alteration of infiltrability nor a change in sand cohesion was observed in the control treatment with rapid infiltration of the nutrient solution after each application also the porosity in microcosms inoculated with strain ncib 3610 increased over time which led to a lift of the sand surface of about 2 5 mm although both strains appeared to alter infiltration to a similar degree evaporation dynamics were distinctly different between microcosms inoculated with either strain monitored fluctuations in weight between liquid applications for each treatment showed a continuous adaptation of evaporation dynamics for microcosms inoculated with strain ncib 3610 si fig 4a 5 over the growth period the early evaporation rate increased for microcosms inoculated with either strain near the end of the incubation period on day six the initially high evaporation rate was followed by a similar characteristic decrease for the ncib 3610 treatment as observed subsequently with time series neutron radiography note that the captured cumulative weights for each treatment during the growth period might include weight differences caused by evaporation of liquid which drained from the microcosms into the coarse glass bead packing below the mean cumulative water losses across six microcosms of each treatment were monitored with time series neutron radiography fig 1 a in treatments inoculated with strain ncib 3610 water loss was reduced by about 58 after 52 h when compared to the control treatment water loss from the ncib 3610 treatment was reduced by about 51 in comparison to microcosms inoculated with strain 168 trp the water loss from ncib 3610 treatments was initially accelerated and ceased after ca 15 h fig 1b from 5 4 mm day 1 to a stable rate of ca 0 8 mm day 1 evaporation from control treatments and microcosms inoculated with b subtilis 168 trp decreased gradually from 3 5 mm day 1 to about 2 3 mm day 1 and 1 8 mm day 1 after 52 h respectively for the treatment with b subtilis ncib 3610 an immediate decrease in evaporation rate i e a transition from stage one to stage two evaporation was observed initial water loss by evaporation from the soil surface was followed by a detachment of the evaporation plane from the surface and diffusion of water vapor through a dry soil layer stage two lehmann et al 2008 note that the evaporation front did not gradually recede but abruptly jumped to form a new evaporation plane at deeper layers shokri and or 2011 the water loss dynamics over depth show a similar average profile of water depletion for the control and the 168 trp treatments fig 2 a initial water losses occurred at a comparable depth and magnitude with a gradual increase in depletion depth over time for the ncib 3610 treatment high initial water losses were observed within the first few millimeters of the profile and ceased after 15 h followed by minor depletion at a reduced mean evaporation rate i e fig 2b estimates of the atmospheric boundary layer thickness and the depth of the dry sand layer were derived for the ncib 3610 treatment which displayed a clear separation of two soil drying stages by considering an initial mean evaporation rate of 5 4 mm day 1 and a reduced evaporation rate of 0 8 mm day 1 which was reached after ca 15 h at the onset of stage two see fig 1 the estimated atmospheric boundary layer thickness was 1 3 mm and soil dry depth was 1 9 mm derived values are consistent with the observed rapid water loss near the sand surface in ncib 3610 treatments fig 2a the average profile of water losses shows increased depletion near the surface and up to ca 10 mm depth and slightly reduced loss below this depth for the 168 trp treatment fig 2b similarly high water loss occurred near the surface of microcosms inoculated with b subtilis ncib 3610 while the cumulative water loss below this region was markedly reduced the results indicate that the evaporation from columns inoculated with ncib 3610 was limited after a thin surface layer of a few millimeters had dried to confirm that evaporation losses in the microcosms inoculated with ncib 3610 could be caused by eps we conducted additional experiments using sand columns amended with xanthan as an eps analogue the drying dynamics measured for the sand xanthan mixture were similar as for the microcosms modified by b subtilis ncib 3610 an initially high evaporation rate was followed by a relatively constant low rate of water loss fig 3 a the period of stage one evaporation for the initially water saturated control lasted for six days before the transition to stage two evaporation occurred the stage two evaporation rate of the control was higher than for the xanthan treatment after eight days this difference could have been caused by dry xanthan structures deposited in the pores above the evaporation plane limiting water vapor diffusion reduced gas diffusion was reported for coarse sand amended with dried seed mucilage haupenthal et al 2021 the distribution of soil liquid content over depth after 12 3 days showed that the top 20 mm were completely dry for the xanthan column indicating that the evaporation plane was at the depth of about 20 mm at the end of the experiment below 50 mm the column was nearly saturated fig 3b in the control column the evaporation plane was at depth of about 10 mm completely dry top layer of 10 mm thickness below this dry layer the water content increased gradually with depth and was similar to the spatial profile of water loss observed with neutron radiography in the control treatment and the microcosms inoculated with b subtilis 168 trp fig 2a 4 discussion the comparison of evaporative water loss illuminates the potential impact of complex microbiome processes on soil water dynamics the substantial decrease in evaporative water loss observed after a growth period of one week for microcosms inoculated with b subtilis ncib 3610 is explained by eps production and likely its accumulation in the pore space the modification of soil properties requires time indicated by the change in evaporation dynamics during the growth period si fig 4 a 5 the observed deceleration of evaporative soil drying resulted in a substantial reduction of total water loss differences between the treatments are caused by an accelerated shift from stage one to stage two evaporation that effectively decouples the evaporation front from the soil surface allowing only the slow diffusion of water vapor from the retreating evaporation plane across the dry soil layer decoupling of the evaporation front was followed by an overall reduced water loss at greater depth fig 2a also the depth time profiles of local water loss were much smoother and less scattered when compared to the other treatments the overall reduction in water loss is caused by a shift from capillary transport of water towards the soil surface to diffusion of water from the profile towards the surface this transition occurred immediately after initiation of evaporative soil drying typically at stage two the evaporation rate gradually declines as the evaporation plane moves downwards in our case the evaporation rate remained fairly constant after 15 h 0 8 mm day 1 indicating no considerable retreat of the evaporation plane the estimated diffusion length at stage two was in good agreement with the thickness of the dry region obtained from neutron imaging this suggests that hydraulic decoupling is a plausible mechanism for the observed dynamics of evaporative water loss we observed equivalent dynamics with the formation of a retreating evaporation plane and a dry layer near the surface for xanthan treated sand this suggests that eps could limit the capillary flow to the evaporating plane the reduced water loss near ca 1 cm in depth in treatments with strain ncib 3610 could be the result of decreased water retention i e water content in this region caused by locally increased pore sizes neither the control treatment nor the microcosms inoculated with b subtilis strain 168 trp exhibited evaporation dynamics or spatially differentiated water loss comparable to changes induced by strain ncib 3610 nevertheless the 168 trp treatment showed a tendency for increased water loss near the soil surface and a slight decrease in water loss at greater depth this alteration might have been caused by the accumulation of bacterial cells near the surface which could potentially induce a reduction in soil hydraulic conductivity due to pore clogging which would also explain the decrease of liquid infiltration observed despite the substantial fluctuations in water content both strains appeared to thrive within the porous environment reflected by the cfus obtained si fig 2b the decrease in extracted biomass over time with exception of the extract at day 4 could be related to the accumulation of eps in the pore space that might have impaired the extraction process we conclude that structurally complex polymeric substances and an adaptive period are required to induce the observed modifications to the evaporation dynamics the observed early shift to diffusion limited water loss could be caused by multiple soil physical alterations however potential modifications caused by strain 168 trp were comparably ineffective in this context for example bacteria can reduce the surface tension of the gas liquid interface raaijmakers et al 2010 this modification causes a decrease in capillary forces responsible for transporting water to the soil surface and reduce water flow i e by facilitating quick depletion of soil water near the surface in presence of strain ncib 3610 an increase in porosity of the sand in microcosms was observed which led to a rise of the soil profile by about 2 5 mm this increase might have been caused by surface active substances which lead to the formation of stable gas bubbles when water infiltrated from the sand surface stable foam razafindralambo et al 1996 in liquid cultures of strain ncib 3610 is associated with the production of surfactin that is absent in strain 168 julkowska et al 2005 surfactin is a bacterial lipopeptide surfactant that lowers the surface tension of water and is produced extensively in the presence of solid carriers yeh et al 2008 the skimming of such foam was used by cooper et al 1981 to quantify the production of surfactin which was reported to lower the surface tension to a minimum of 27 mn m 1 mixtures of surfactant and polymers can enhance foam stability pugh 2016 which could explain the observed increase in porosity additionally bacterial eps decrease the soil hydraulic conductivity rosenzweig et al 2013 thus limiting the capillary flow to the soil surface therefore the reduced capillary forces and higher friction i e reduced soil hydraulic conductivity can simultaneously contribute to the observed hydraulic decoupling for both bacterial treatments reduced infiltration resulting in the short term ponding of the daily applied nutrient solution occurred after two days this reduction was accompanied by the formation of a stable crust at the sand surface of a few millimeters these observations emphasize the effect of bacterial activity on soil hydraulic conductivity several studies showed a marked decrease of soil hydraulic conductivity in presence of polymeric substances benard et al 2019 colica et al 2014 rosenzweig et al 2013 volk et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 such reduction would also explain the rapid hydraulic decoupling of capillary flow from the surface observed in the ncib 3610 treatment as high eps content is usually associated with the formation of a stable crust at the soil surface rossi et al 2018 however similar ponding of liquid and the formation of a stable crust was also observed in the 168 trp treatment since the distinct hydraulic decoupling during evaporative drying was exclusively observed in sand inoculated with strain ncib 3610 both strains appear to have modified infiltration dynamics by different means 5 conclusions hydraulic decoupling of the evaporation plane from the surface during evaporative soil drying reduces water losses and can be induced by bacteria the process is explained by the eps mediated reduction of soil hydraulic conductivity and capillary forces that can effectively reduce water loss from the soil surface by sheltering water below a layer of dry soil as validated by use of xanthan amended sand these modifications of soil physical properties occurred during a period of fluctuations in soil water content and appeared to be part of a continuous adaptive process the comparison of the control treatment and treatments with b subtilis 168 trp and b subtilis ncib 3610 highlights the impact of differences in soil bacterial genetic traits beyond growth rates and population sizes although infiltration was similarly decreased in the presence of both strains the cumulative and local water losses during evaporation were distinctly different and hydraulic decoupling was solely observed in microcosms modified by the complex biofilm producer ncib 3610 this wild type strain has the potential to drastically engineer the architecture of the soil pore space that shapes the rates and spatial distribution of soil water losses our study demonstrates how bacterial induced modifications of soil physical properties can affect evaporative soil drying beyond what we observed eps in soil and its effect on local soil water distribution and soil water dynamics remains surprisingly unexplored especially in regions like the rhizosphere where microbial growth is stimulated by exudates released from plant roots the processes underlying microbial modifications of soil water dynamics remain schematic and hypothetical understanding the potential of bacteria to divert soil water fluxes during dry periods is critical for unraveling the role of specific genetic traits in the adaptation to environmental changes to draw conclusions for more complex environments such as the rhizosphere or biological soil crusts the interplay of distinct microbial traits taxa and associated dynamics in resource availability need to be considered credit authorship contribution statement pascal benard

56,the infiltration of fluids into porous media frequently presents anomalous features in which the fluid front displacement varies in time with an exponent ν different from the expected fickean value of 1 2 a variety of transport models in fractal media predict the anomalies in this process and in related diffusion problems but the associated exponents are non universal i e they depend not only on the fractal dimensions d f but also on other geometric properties here we study the horizontal infiltration in layered porous media where the matrices of higher conductivity have fractal distributions d f 1 of lower conductivity inclusions when the conductivity contrast is high this process exhibits universal superdiffusive infiltration with ν 1 1 d f this result is first demonstrated for inclusion patterns modeled by cantor sets but we argue that it extends to any fractal distributions of the inclusions under the condition of no spatial anisotropy in the rescaling of the observation size randomized versions of the cantor sets are presented as possible realizations of disordered fractal patterns and confirm the universal relation by considering properties of typical granular media and various soils numerical calculations indicate that this universal superdiffusive infiltration could be observed in physically realizable laboratory and field settings keywords infiltration green ampt

large scientific and technological interest with applications in rock weathering transport of water and contaminants in the soil deterioration of building materials and many other problems dullien 1992 perfect et al 2014 steefel et al 2015 noiriel 2015 van der perk 2001 you et al 2020 here we consider pressure driven unidirectional infiltration into a porous medium with a constant cross section

a fickean scaling ℓ t 1 2 voller 2015 a transport that matches the behavior of normal diffusion processes indeed if the infiltration is controlled by the darcy law it has a parallel with the concentration driven infiltration of a solute in a static pore fluid in the same medium aarão reis and voller 2019 however when the infiltrated media is highly inhomogeneous the infiltration may deviate from the classical scaling küntz and lavallée 2001 lockington and parlange 2003 el abd and milczarek 2004 wilson et al 2003 voller 2015 filipovitch et al 2016 el abd 2015 balankin et al 2016 typically as 1 ℓ t ν with ν 1 2 similar deviations are observed in other processes of mass heat or charge transport in highly disordered media and are usually termed anomalous transport metzler and

frequency dependent kernels vainstein et al 2006 in this range of examples however an explicit connection between the morphology of the porous media and the superdiffusive transport is presented only in a small number of works e g infiltration from fractal or point sources into fractal media embedded in two or three dimensions aarão reis et al 2018 aarão reis and voller 2019 further in keeping with studies of subdiffusion the infiltration exponents in these particular systems do not depend solely on the fractal dimensions relations between anomalous transport and fractal structure are also expected in geological materials the pore size distributions of rocks from submicrometer scale to some millimeters frequently have fractal properties anovitz and cole 2015 recent reviews illustrate these features in clayey aggregates van damme 1998 silty and sandy soils rieu and perrier 2018 simple approaches show how this can impact the variation of permeability with the observation length fuentes et al 2018 at larger length scales soil inhomogeneities also affect water transport even considering that the conductivities of sand clay and other geological materials assume constant values at those scales for instance a soil may be formed by domains whose sizes range from centimeters to a few meters and whose conductivities vary by more than four orders of magnitude adams and gelhar 1992 these features motivated stochastic treatments of the disorder of such media to predict hydrological properties dagan 1986 gelhar 1997 in this work we investigate possible anomalies in moisture infiltration into layered porous media that exhibit fractal distributions of low conductivity inclusions in high conductivity matrices to the best of our knowledge no previous study has addressed this problem even in the simplest case of flow normal to the gravity direction which is the assumption of our work the layered geometry is easily visualized in some geological and manufactured systems blum et al 2018 navarre sitchler et al 2009 sadeghi et al 2014 pettersson et al 2020 behrens et al 2021 for instance horizons of a deep soil may have very different physical structures and consequently different conductivities blum et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2014 green roofs are formed by layers with different functionalities pettersson et al 2020 some corestones have centimeter scale layers with different properties navarre sitchler et al 2009 behrens et al 2021 and lower permeability lenses are observed in higher permeability gravel beds lindsey et al 1998 jussel et al 1994a b moreover some studies show layered fractal geometry of sedimentary soils bailey and smith 2005 richards 2002 the layered structure implies a one dimensional symmetry so the low conductivity parts of the media studied here have fractal dimensions d f 1 to begin we consider inclusion distributions as in cantor sets and provide a closed analytical algebraic solution for the infiltration next we consider cases of disordered fractal media for which randomized versions of cantor sets are presented as possible realizations if the hydraulic conductivity contrast between matrix and inclusions is high all these systems show superdiffusive propagation of the infiltration front with an exponent ν that depends only on the fractal dimension of the set of inclusions these developments are made assuming our system involves well sorted and similarly packed spheroidal grains we point towards general applications by showing through a scaling analysis and use of numerical simulations that the identified universal superdiffusive infiltration behavior can be observed in physical settings in particular in soil domains with fine granular mixtures 2 model and methods 2 1 infiltration front model in general during unidirectional infiltration into a porous medium there is not a sharp front between the wet and dry regions but rather a diffusive region with a decreasing saturation in the flow direction a situation that leads to a capillary suction drawing in moisture however in tracking infiltration it is often valid to invoke the so called green ampt approximation green and ampt 1911 neuman 1976 where the unsaturated region is collapsed to an equivalent sharp infiltration front separating a fully saturated region from a region at an initial moisture content to account for the capillary suction this model imposes a negative potential the matric potential on the infiltration front neuman 1976 our model domain consists of a 1d horizontal tube at 0 x l containing a granular porous medium fig 1a we will assume that the medium has a very low initial moisture with the vast majority of pores space filed with air at any time the end of the tube at x 0 is connected to a water reservoir held at the fixed head h 0 t h 0 under the green ampt approximation the subsequent moisture infiltration into the tube can be modeled by considering the advance of an infiltration wetting front s t separating the saturated and dry regions in our theoretical developments we will assume that the grain sizes of our porous media are sufficiently large enough that the matric potential on the infiltration front is negligible when compared to the reservoir head h 0 as such it is reasonable to set the pressure head on and beyond the front to zero h x s t 0 and without loss of generality set the reservoir head to h 0 1 in our discussion of applications section 5 we show that relaxing the assumption of a negligible matric pressure which would be the case when considering fine grain soils does not change our conclusions at any point during the infiltration into our model tube the head value h x t monotonically decreases from h 0 t 1 to h s t 0 and the specific discharge q t flow volume per unit area per unit time is constant in space but varies over time the green ampt approximation implies that darcy s law holds within the saturated region i e 2 q k h x where k x is the hydraulic conductivity in units of length per unit time from the discharge we can also determine the velocity of the fluid in the pore space as v x t q t ϕ x where ϕ x is the porosity together with eq 2 this allows us to relate the velocity of the infiltration front the discharge and darcy s law as 3 ϕ d s d t q t k h x 2 2 model of layered media as a general starting point illustrated in fig 1b we will consider the case where our tube domain is made up of m segments lenses of length c with lens conductivities k j and lens porosities ϕ j j 1 m the domain length is l m c for simplicity we set c 1 in analytical and numerical calculations the position x j denotes the end of the j th lens and h j t is the head at this position we assume a physical scenario in which each lens is a well sorted spheroidal granular medium with low grain size dispersion so that it can be considered homogeneous however the grains in a particular lens can be anywhere in the range from very fine sand size 0 1 mm to gravel size 100 mm allowing for the possibility of a high conductivity contrast as we move from one lens to another indeed the conductivity of very find sand can be more than 4 orders of magnitude smaller than that of gravel strack 1989 such high contrasts are actually observed in soils at some sites adams and gelhar 1992 bierkens 1994 however despite the wide differences in grain sizes we can expect that the porosities of the grain packings have low variability lying in the range 0 25 optimum packing to 0 44 very loose random packing for monodispersed sizes dullien 1992 torquato 2001 2 3 fractal patterns based on cantor sets in order to induce non fickian behaviors we consider layered media with the patterns of cantor sets in which the segments are made of only two materials resistors whose hydraulic conductivity is k r and spaces whose conductivity is k s the respective porosities are ϕ r and ϕ s fig 2 a shows the first orders of construction of cantor sets with scaling factors n 3 and n 4 the order n 1 is the generator of the fractal which consists of 2 resistors separated by n 2 spaces the second order is created by separating two first order sets by a space of length n 2 2 n and by recursion the order n is created by separating two sets of order n 1 by a space of length n n 2 n n 1 after infinite iterations of this rule the fractal dimension of the resistor set cantor set dimension is 4 d f log 2 log n as an alternative description of the construction of a cantor set we consider that the order n 1 is obtained by replacing each resistor of the pattern of order n 1 by the generator and by increasing the system size by the scaling factor n this description helps to define the randomized cantor sets which are one dimensional generalizations of the regular random fractals formerly defined in two and three dimensions martin and keefer 1985 aarão reis 1996 aarão reis and voller 2021 in a randomized set several generators order n 1 are built by randomly distributing the 2 resistors and the n 2 spaces in series thus there are n 2 different generators the order n is built by replacing each resistor of the order n 1 by a randomly chosen generator and rescaling the system by the factor n fig 2 b illustrates the construction of randomized cantor sets with n 4 the fractal dimension is also given by eq 4 3 results 3 1 infiltration into a layered medium since any lens of the layered medium is homogeneous the head decrease across each lens is linear when the infiltration front is in the j th lens i e j 1 s t j we can determine the discharge q t in two ways the first in terms of the head gradient between the end of the j 1 th lens and the current position 5 q k j h j 1 t 0 s j 1 and the second in terms of the head gradient between the origin x 0 and the end of j 1 th lens 6 q k j 1 e 1 h j 1 t j 1 where k i e is the effective conductivity over the first i lenses given by 7 k i e 1 i l 1 i 1 k l 1 on eliminating h j t from eqs 5 and 6 we obtain 8 q j 1 k j 1 e s j 1 k j 1 j 1 s j substituting this expression in eq 3 and integrating the time interval required for the front to move through the j th lens is 9 δ t j ϕ j j 1 j j 1 k j 1 e s j 1 k j d s ϕ j j 1 k j 1 e 0 5 k j j 1 2 m summing all the contributing time intervals the time for the infiltration front to reach s j is 10 t j i 1 j δ t i i 1 j ϕ i i 1 k i 1 e 0 5 k i i 1 j ϕ i p 1 i 1 1 k p 0 5 k i where eq 7 was used note that the flux in eq 8 has the same dependence on the effective conductivity as the flux in steady state conditions although the infiltration time in eq 10 shows a nontrivial dependence on partial sums of effective conductivities this occurs because the head distribution is treated in a quasi stationary approximation whereas the infiltration front position continuously increase in time defining the equivalent resistance 11 r i p 1 i 1 k p we can use eq 10 to develop a recursive algorithm for tracking the infiltration front as follows 12 t 1 ϕ 1 0 5 k 1 r 1 1 k 1 t j t j 1 ϕ j r j 1 0 5 k j r j r j 1 1 k j t m t m 1 ϕ m r m 1 0 5 k m this recursion provides a vector t t 1 t 2 t m of the times to reach the end of each lens given by the vector of front locations s 1 2 3 m by construction the times in t are exact and with a sufficiently large number of lenses linear interpolation of the s t plot recovers an accurate approximation of the front movement s t we can also determine the head profile in the tube at time t j we can use continuity and the effective conductivity eq 7 to write the discharge at any integer position p j as 13 q k p e 1 h p t j p k j e j where we have recognized that h j t j 0 on rearranging the last two terms we obtain a discrete expression for the head profile at t j 14 h p t j 1 p k p e j k j e 1 i 1 p 1 k i i 1 j 1 k i p j since the conductivity is constant in each lens the pressure drop across the lens will be linear thus fitting piecewise linear segments through the pressures heads in eq 14 will provide the complete head profile again while only providing profile expressions at discrete time values the head profile in eq 14 is exact a simplification can be made in the infiltration arrival time based on the expected physical scenario of low porosity variability among the lenses assuming that the packing of different lenses is similar so that the porosity takes a constant value ϕ eq 10 simplifies to 15 t j ϕ i 1 j j 0 5 i k i from this point forward unless otherwise stated we will retain this assumption in section 5 by comparing the predictive performance between eq 10 with lens dependent porosity and theory derived from eq 15 we show that this choice has no consequence for our main findings a particular use of eq 15 is when the tube is homogeneous i e all the lenses have identical properties in this case t j ϕ k j 2 2 implying that the movement of the infiltration front follows the expected fickian behavior s t 2 k ϕ t 1 2 voller 2010 3 2 infiltration into cantor tubes 3 2 1 general solution we now consider cases where the conductivities of the layers of a tube are arranged as in regular cantor sets fig 2 a from eq 15 we calculate the time t n t n n to traverse the length j n n of the n th order as t n ϕ i 1 n n n n 0 5 i k i due to the symmetry of this set however we see that k i k n n 1 i allowing us to also calculate this transition time as t n ϕ i 1 n n i 0 5 k i averaging between these two expressions we arrive at a transition time 16 t n ϕ n n 2 i 1 n n 1 k i further on noting that the order n has 2 n resistors and n n 2 n spaces we obtain the effective conductivity for the n th order pattern as 17 k n n e 2 n n n k r n n 2 n n n k s 1 n n k r k s 2 n k s k r n n k r and rewrite the transition time as 18 t n ϕ n 2 n 2 k n n e ϕ n 2 n k s 1 n n 2 n k r 1 k s 1 2 3 2 2 the case of very large k s fractal resistor distribution now consider that the space conductivity is much larger than the resistor conductivity so that a high conductivity medium has a fractal pattern of low conductivity inclusions taking the limit k s 1 0 we neglect the terms proportional to k s 1 in eq 18 in comparison with those proportional to k r 1 and obtain 19 t n 2 n 1 n n ϕ k r 1 the corresponding displacement of the infiltration front is s n n so eq 19 leads to 20 s a t ν with ν log n log 2 n and a 2 k r ϕ ν this gives 1 2 ν 1 for any n 3 so the movement of the infiltration front is superdiffusive we can also write the power law exponent in eq 20 as 21 ν 1 1 d f where 0 d f 1 for fractals embedded in one dimensional space thus the infiltration front displacement can be expressed directly and solely in terms of the fractal dimension 22 s t 2 k r ϕ 1 1 d f t 1 1 d f 3 2 3 head profile at any time through eq 14 the head profile h x t will be made up of piecewise segments providing a monotonic decrease form the value 1 at x 0 to the value of 0 at the front s t this profile will have close to horizontal slopes in spaces and constant significantly steeper slopes in resistors at time t n when the infiltration front is at s t n n n there will be 2 n resistors each providing a head drop of δ h 2 n on noting that each lower order p n has 2 p resistors we can pick out at time t t n the exact head values at the ends of each lower order 23 h n p t n 1 2 p 2 n p 1 2 n we can readily show that these point values are exactly fit by the continuous profile 24 h x t n 1 x d f where we define a normalized position 25 x x s t n 0 x s t n in section 3 4 we show that this expression is a good approximation of the actual piecewise profile 3 3 infiltration into random layered fractal media here we consider a general case of a layered fractal system in which the resistor distribution has fractal dimension d f the randomized cantor sets shown in fig 2 b are possible realizations of such fractal media if the medium with a dimensionless size m l c is scaled to a size m l c the number of resistors increases from n r to n r these quantities are related to the fractal dimension by 26 d f ln n r n r ln m m eq 15 with j m gives the total time for the infiltration front to cross the medium of length m considering infinitely large conductivity in the spaces k s and finite k r the terms inversely proportional to k s in eq 15 vanish and the infiltration time can be written in terms of the contributions of the resistors only 27 t m ϕ m 1 n r m x r m 0 5 k r ϕ k r m 1 2 x r n r where x r m is the position of the end of the m th resistor m 1 n r and x r denotes the spatial average of these positions in a large medium m 1 2 m in eq 27 for a symmetric distribution of resistors which is the case of the regular cantor sets x r m 2 in other cases such as the randomized cantor sets the values of x r m are distributed between 1 and m 1 but this distribution may not be symmetric for instance consider patterns initiated by the generators a and f in fig 2 b which have the resistor positions concentrated in the smallest and largest possible values respectively in an order with length m 1 the pattern generated by a has x r m 4 and the pattern generated by f has x r 3 m 4 in a random fractal the iterative reproduction of patterns like a and f in several orders is unlikely such reproductions might lead to x r m and x r m respectively thus in general we expect that 28 x r c m where c is a constant smaller than 1 but of order 0 1 1 eq 27 then gives 29 t m 1 c ϕ 2 k r m n r where 0 1 c 1 c 1 2 for the regular cantor sets eq 29 also applies to the infiltration time t m in the medium with length m and n r resistors if there is no spatial anisotropy in the distribution of the inclusions the constant c in eq 29 will be the same in this rescaled medium this is the case in the randomized cantor sets in which the generators are chosen with equal probability to replace each of the resistors of the pattern in the previous order fig 2 b the ratio of infiltration times is 30 t m t m m m 1 d f where eq 26 was used noting that the front displacements are s m c and s m c at the respective total infiltration times we obtain eq 20 with the same superdiffusive exponent ν of eq 21 and 31 a k r 1 c ϕ ν thus the superdiffusive infiltration with an exponent dependent only on the dimension of the medium is expected for any fractal distribution of the low conductivity inclusions in the layered media the randomized cantor sets are examples of such media this is an important result for applications to real materials because the advance of the infiltration front is related to a single geometric property the only condition for this result to be valid is that under rescaling of the observation size there is no spatial anisotropy in the distribution of the inclusions in the randomized cantor sets we may alternatively look at the average infiltration time t m in all patterns of length m due to the symmetry of the generators fig 2 b the configurational and spatial average of resistor positions is x r m 2 so eqs 29 and 31 are applicable with c 1 2 the superdiffusive infiltration obtained in this averaging is exactly the same as in the corresponding regular cantor set 3 4 demonstration with direct simulation for a given fractal distribution of resistors we use eq 10 to track the infiltration progress from lens to lens and compare the resulting discrete tracking of the front s t j with the continuous theoretical expression s t provided by eq 22 in any realization to avoid an initial rapid infiltration with nearly zero time interval we commence tracking with eq 10 from an origin x 0 replaced on the left hand side of the location of the first resistor further in all realizations we set ϕ 0 4 k r 0 4 and k s 4000 which are typical values for granular media with high conductivity contrast see section 2 2 some cases with more modest conductivity contrasts and variable porosity are investigated in section 5 figs 3 a and 3 b compare theoretical and simulational results for regular and randomized cantor sets respectively in the regular fractals the infiltration front positions obtained in the simulations have small oscillations but they tightly follow the theoretical predictions for n 3 the slope of the best linear fit to that plot is ν 0 6151 which is very close to the theoretical value ν log 3 log 6 0 6131 eq 21 in the randomized fractals with n 3 fig 3 b front oscillations are slightly more pronounced however the slopes of the linear fits of each of the 10 realizations shown in fig 3 b are typically within 3 of the theoretical value this is consistent with the analysis of section 3 3 which predicts the universal exponent of eq 21 for any realization of a randomized fractal however the intercepts of those linear fits exhibit notable differences between different realizations for example in 3 sets of 50 realizations not shown in fig 3 b the measured intercepts give values of a eq 20 in the ranges 0 47 1 93 0 62 2 11 and 0 55 2 42 thus despite the universal superdiffusive scaling the random distribution of the resistors in a given realization does influence the transition time of the infiltration through the tube this is consistent with eq 31 because the value of a is related to the value of the constant c which depends on the spatial distribution of the resistors in a given realization figs 4 a and 4 b show suitably displaced head profiles 1 h x t n as a function of the normalized position x eq 25 at the times t t n in tubes with regular and randomized cantor set inclusions respectively the direct simulations from eq 14 are compared with the theoretical predictions of eq 24 in the regular fractals the theoretical predictions form an upper bound on the simulation predictions which clearly have the theoretical slope d f in fig 4 b the theoretical curve is contained within the simulations of the randomized fractals which also have slopes close to d f this shows that the power law nature of the head profile in eq 24 is recovered in regular and randomized fractals 3 5 finite size effects to obtain the superdiffusive infiltration we assumed that the conductivity of spaces was much larger than that of resistors i e k s 1 k r 1 however in passing from eq 18 to eq 19 for the regular cantor set or in passing from eq 15 to eq 27 for fractal layered systems in general the actual assumption was that the full terms proportional to k s 1 could be neglected eq 18 shows that these terms depend on the length m n n so the superdiffusive behavior is limited by finite size effects we first consider the case of the regular cantor set patterns in eq 18 for the terms proportional to k s 1 to be negligible in comparison with those proportional to k r 1 it is necessary that n 2 n k s 1 n n 2 n k s 1 n n 2 n k r 1 assuming that n 2 n 1 which is reasonable for large lengths it gives 32 k s k r n 2 n considering that the dimensionless length is m n n l c where c is the length of a single resistor eq 32 can be written in terms of physically measurable quantities as 33 l c k s k r 1 1 d f where eq 4 was used this relation was obtained under the assumption that resistors and spaces have the same porosity otherwise eq 10 suggests that as a rough approximation the conductivities k s and k r in eq 33 can be divided by the respective porosities now consider the more general case of layered systems in which eq 15 has contributions of terms proportional to k s 1 and k r 1 for the former to be negligible compared to the latter and eq 27 to be valid it is necessary that 34 ϕ k 1 m n r m x s k 0 5 k s ϕ m 1 n r m x r m 0 5 k r where x s k denotes the position of the k th space for very large m we have m 1 n r x r m k 1 m n r x s k m 2 2 and from eq 28 m 1 n r x r m c m n r with c 1 since n r m in such limit we obtain k 1 m n r x s k m 2 2 eq 34 then gives 35 k s k r m n r where we omitted a factor 2 1 c that is expected to be of order 1 an alternative relation can be obtained in terms of characteristic lengths of the medium which is more helpful for applications let l m i n be the minimum length in which fractal features are observed and f m i n be the fraction of this cutoff length with resistors in eq 26 we assume that the prime superindex refers to this system i e m l m i n c and n r f m i n l m i n c where now c can be any length below l m i n for a macroscopic system of interest m l c so that m n r l l m i n d f 1 f m i n eq 35 can then be rewritten as 36 l l m i n f m i n k s k r 1 1 d f eq 36 is a universal relation that sets the range of system sizes in which superdiffusive scaling can be observed in terms of the conductivity contrast between spaces and resistors and in terms of the fractal dimension if that relation fails we expect that a crossover to fickean scaling will appear because the fractal properties are relevant only at short scales this crossover is always expected to occur in sufficiently large systems 4 applications 4 1 laboratory and field settings to check whether the universal superdiffusion behavior may be observed in real systems consider the example of section 2 2 in which the medium has two types of layers gravel which can have a hydraulic conductivity of k 1 0 2 m s and very fine sand which can take the value k 1 0 6 m s strack 1989 in the laboratory it is certainly possible to build inhomogeneous media with these materials but similar inhomogeneities may also be found in soils if the two types of layer are distributed according to the rules of a cantor set with n 3 eq 33 gives l c 7 10 10 in the case of a set with n 10 it gives l c 5 10 5 these conditions can certainly be achieved for any realistic value of the size c of the homogeneous resistors in laboratory or in field applications for instance in field scale settings with inclusions of millimeter or centimeter size the suggested conductivity contrast will allow the observation of superdiffusion over tens of meters or more in small laboratory scale settings however it may be possible to observe superdiffusion over shorter length scales with more modest conductivity contrasts to illustrate how a laboratory bench scale experiment could be constructed let us consider medium to coarse sands grain diameters 0 25 1 mm exhibiting hydraulic conductivities in the range 1 0 4 1 0 2 m s and depending on the grain packing porosities in the range 0 25 0 4 with these materials we can readily select two well sorted mixtures that will have a modest conductivity ratio e g k s 2 1 0 2 k r 4 1 0 4 k s k r 50 for a cantor tube with n 3 eq 33 gives l c 4 1 0 4 if the low conductivity layers medium sands have length c 10 mm we can then construct an order n 5 of that fractal with total length 2 43 m and observe the expected superdiffusive transport this proposed experiment has parallels in some recent works for instance in recent studies of reactive flow in packed columns of magnesite and quartz length scale 22 cm those materials were organized in cylinders parallel to the flow or in a three layer configuration for comparison with the dissolution of mixed samples salehikhoo et al 2013 li et al 2014 4 2 simulation at laboratory scale considering changes in porosity to assess the performance of the experiment proposed in the previous section we compare infiltration time predictions from the direct simulation of the general layer model lm eq 10 and those obtained from the theoretical expression in eq 22 here we are considering porosity contrast between lenses so it is more consistent to report the results in terms of infiltration length ℓ t as opposed to the front position s t to recall the length ℓ t is defined as the volume of infiltrated fluid divided by the cross sectional area after the calculation of the time value t j from eq 12 the associated increase in infiltration length is determined as ℓ j ℓ j 1 ϕ j c j 1 2 ℓ 0 0 the theoretical prediction for the position of the infiltration front s t uses the matrix porosity in eq 22 so the theoretical prediction for the infiltration length ℓ t is obtained by multiplying this value by the matrix porosity fig 5 reports two lm simulations the first assuming similar loose random packing in both the resistor and space providing a constant porosity of ϕ r ϕ s 0 4 throughout the medium the second assuming porosities ϕ s 0 4 and ϕ r 0 25 in a departure from the theory used to derive eq 22 note that these porosity values are close to the extremes of the expected range for well sorted grains the results with a constant porosity show excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions confirming that even with a modest conductivity ratio of 50 the length ratio l c 243 is sufficiently small to invoke superdiffusive transport with a porosity contrast while there is a slight early time shift the infiltration still provides a good match to the anomalous behavior observed with a constant porosity this indicates that relaxing our assumption of a constant tube porosity does not change our main results indeed fig 5 confirms that superdiffusive infiltration can be physically realized in bench scales cantor set lens patterns constructed with common geological materials 4 3 infiltration with initial moisture and contrasts in matric potential in our theoretical development we simplified the green ampt treatment by assuming that the initial moisture in the porous medium and the matric potential at the infiltration front were negligible we argued that provided the reservoir head is large enough and the granular media is in the sand to gravel range these assumptions are reasonable however in many porous materials in particular fine grained soils e g sands loams and clays these assumptions may no longer be valid for these cases in addition to providing a value for the hydraulic conductivity we will also need to account for the initial moisture and matric potential wetted front capillary pressure based on extensive data sets rawls et al 1983 have provided appropriate values of soil parameters to use with the green ampt model these values effective porosity hydraulic conductivity and matric potential converted to si units for sand and three finer textured soils are provided in table 1 note that in finer grained soils the residual moisture θ r e the moisture retained in the soil after drying is not necessarily an insignificant fraction of the porosity thus as provided in table 1 a more appropriate measure of the moisture infiltrated into the saturated region is not the porosity of the soil ϕ but an effective porosity ϕ e θ s a t θ r e where θ s a t ϕ is the moisture fraction at saturation further note that the matric potential for use in the green ampt model can be associated with the integration of the relative permeability over the decreasing pressure potential ahead of the advancing fully saturated region neuman 1976 the values listed in table 1 assume that this region is homogeneous in layered porous media however we can expect a non monotonic change in the green ampt matric potential depending on the soil properties ahead of the infiltration front a simple accounting of this process used here is to set the front matric potential in each lens to the value associated with the soil type that makes up that lens using the data in table 1 we calculate the infiltration length ℓ t using our general layer model lm eq 10 whose form is identical to the model used in section 4 2 the only difference is a revised definition for the layer porosity term ϕ j in deriving the revised lm we replace the zero pressure head in the numerator of the discharge expression in eq 5 with the matric potential h s and for generality we replace the unit surface x 0 pressure head in the numerator of the discharge expression in eq 6 with h 0 the subsequent algebra follows as before arriving at an identical form to eq 10 for the time for the infiltration front s t to pass through the j th lens 37 δ t j ϕ j j 1 k j 1 e 0 5 k j j 1 2 m here the porosity term ϕ in the original lm has been replaced by the parameter 38 ϕ j ϕ e j h 0 h s j the effective porosity of the layer divided by the total head drop over 0 s j the associated change in the infiltration length for this time is δ ℓ j ϕ e j c fig 6 shows the modified lm model simulations in the same laboratory setting as the simulations reported in fig 5 however now the pressure head at x 0 takes a nominal value of h 0 0 1 m the matrix is sand and the inclusions are lenses of finer soils with 0 01 m of length loam sandy clay loam or sandy clay in all simulations regardless of the contrasts in matrix and lens properties listed in table 2 superdiffusive behavior is predicted the slopes of linear fits through the simulation data closely match the universal time scaling exponent ν 0 6132 the difference between the simulated value and the theoretical value ranges from 3 3 for the smallest contrast in saturated conductivity k c o n 35 to 1 9 for the largest contrast k c o n 196 a trend that is consistent with our finite size analysis section 3 5 interestingly with reference to table 2 we note that the closest match to our theory sandy clay inclusions is the case where the contrasts in the conductivity effective porosity and matrix potential are the largest from the predictions reported in fig 6 we conclude that the universal superdiffusive scaling developed for well sorted granular media in the sand to gravel range where contrasts in matric potential can be neglected also holds up for finer soils even in cases where there is a large contrast in matric potential values between the matrix and the inclusions 5 relations with other models the superdiffusive infiltration predicted here can be physically interpreted in analogy with ctrw with power law distributions of transition times when the fluid front passes from the pattern of a given order to the next order pattern n n 1 it encounters a larger density of high conductivity lenses which can be traversed in very short times thus the distribution of transition times is narrower than that of a homogeneous system in the ctrw this narrowing may bring the power law exponent to an absolute value below the fickean range which is known to produce superdiffusive behavior dentz et al 2004 kang et al 2016 the general fluid infiltration model defined in section 2 1 can be related to the diffusion of a solute in the same medium with a source of constant concentration at the same points where the fluid head is constant aarão reis 2016 aarão reis and voller 2019 such diffusion process can be described with random walk models an important feature of random walks defined in cantor sets is that the walker positions are restricted to the points of those sets since they are disconnected sets the trajectories are not continuous over them moreover different random walk definitions are possible in the same set for instance different relations between the hopping probability and the distance may be defined as in lévy walks balankin et al 2018 zaburdaev et al 2015 thus different scaling exponents may be obtained superdiffusion is a frequent feature because long distance hops across the gaps of the set become more frequent as larger regions of the set are explored golmankhaneh and balankin 2018 it is not unexpected that some of those definitions lead to the same exponent ν obtained here indeed this is the case of a scaled random walk model in which the hop probability between two points of the disconnected set is inversely proportional to the distance between those points takahashi and tamura 2005 however in our model the fluid infiltrates the whole one dimensional lattice defined at each stage of construction of the cantor set so it cannot be physically related to random walks whose positions are restricted to the cantor set despite the similarities in scaling exponents in addition to the study of random walk diffusion models there has also been works on fluid transport in cantor set patterns for example in ref tang et al 2008 the cantor set with n 3 was used to model a medium composed of layers of fine and coarse sediments in that work effective conductivities at different orders are obtained from simulations of steady state flow with different volumetric water contents but no scaling laws similar to those obtained here are derived 6 conclusion to study fluid infiltration into layered porous media we considered a model of a one dimensional tube of porous granular lenses with a constant head at the entrance when the conditions are such that a sharp interface between the wet and dry regions can be assumed we can write down an algebraic recursion to exactly track the passage of this interface through each lens under the circumstances that the material in each lens is well sorted this expression reduces to a summation expression when in addition low conductivity lenses are laid out in the pattern of a cantor set embedded in a high conductivity matrix we arrive at an exact expression for the transition time through each order of the pattern in the limit of a very large hydraulic conductivity contrast between those lenses we show that the infiltration is superdiffusive further from the expression for the transition time we obtain an explicit value of the superdiffusive time exponent solely as a function of the fractal dimension of the cantor set through appropriate rescaling we also show that the same exponent is obtained for infiltration into any other layered medium with the same fractal dimension of low conductivity inclusions this universal feature is explicitly verified in randomized versions of the cantor sets the authors are unaware of this form of universality in other anomalous infiltration and diffusion examples where exponent values depend on additional geometric properties beyond just the fractal dimension we confirmed our theoretical results by comparison with a general recursive model for infiltration into a tube of porous granular lenses with this general recursive calculation we also demonstrated that superdiffusive behavior can be observed in realistic setting involving modest conductivity contrasts and non ideal porosity and matric potential values in particular we have shown that our theory is fully consistent with direct simulations based on the green ampt model of horizontal infiltration into a sand matrix containing inclusions of finer grained soils thus our model has direct application in problems of hydrological interest more generally our model may also provide a simple explanation for observed superdiffusive infiltration in porous materials of interest in engineering geoscience and other fields providing a direct connection between the observed behavior and the geometry of the porous material from a broader point of view in subsurface hydrology although our work does not present a solution to a specific real problem it overcomes some limitations that were reported among the reasons for the low practical impact of stochastic models cirpka and valocchi 2016 for instance we highlight the consequences of high contrasts in conductivities in opposition to studies of small variability in conductivity fields moreover results from individual configurations i e without ensemble averaging show the predicted superdiffusive infiltration fig 3 b which permits application to an specific problem that fits the physical assumptions of the model declaration of competing interest the authors

56,the infiltration of fluids into porous media frequently presents anomalous features in which the fluid front displacement varies in time with an exponent ν different from the expected fickean value of 1 2 a variety of transport models in fractal media predict the anomalies in this process and in related diffusion problems but the associated exponents are non universal i e they depend not only on the fractal dimensions d f but also on other geometric properties here we study the horizontal infiltration in layered porous media where the matrices of higher conductivity have fractal distributions d f 1 of lower conductivity inclusions when the conductivity contrast is high this process exhibits universal superdiffusive infiltration with ν 1 1 d f this result is first demonstrated for inclusion patterns modeled by cantor sets but we argue that it extends to any fractal distributions of the inclusions under the condition of no spatial anisotropy in the rescaling of the observation size randomized versions of the cantor sets are presented as possible realizations of disordered fractal patterns and confirm the universal relation by considering properties of typical granular media and various soils numerical calculations indicate that this universal superdiffusive infiltration could be observed in physically realizable laboratory and field settings keywords infiltration green ampt

large scientific and technological interest with applications in rock weathering transport of water and contaminants in the soil deterioration of building materials and many other problems dullien 1992 perfect et al 2014 steefel et al 2015 noiriel 2015 van der perk 2001 you et al 2020 here we consider pressure driven unidirectional infiltration into a porous medium with a constant cross section if the flow direction is normal to the gravity direction and the porous media is homogeneous the infiltration length ℓ volume of fluid in the domain divided by the cross section is expected to follow a fickean scaling ℓ t 1 2 voller 2015 a transport that matches the behavior of normal diffusion processes indeed if the infiltration is controlled by the darcy law it has a parallel with the concentration driven infiltration of a solute in a static pore fluid in the same medium aarão reis and voller 2019 however when the infiltrated media is highly inhomogeneous the infiltration may deviate from the classical scaling küntz and lavallée 2001 lockington and parlange 2003 el abd and milczarek 2004 wilson et al 2003 voller 2015 filipovitch et al 2016 el abd 2015 balankin et al 2016 typically as 1 ℓ t ν with ν 1 2 similar deviations are observed in other processes of mass heat or charge transport in highly disordered media and are usually termed anomalous transport metzler and klafter 2000 havlin and ben avraham 2002 metzler et al 2014 oliveira et al 2019 self similar distributions of obstacles of disordered materials are responsible for the delay in the transport to long distances and lead to subdiffusive scaling i e ν 1 2 random walk models in fractal media are frequently used to correlate the subdiffusive transport with the geometrical properties metzler and klafter

time random walks ctrw berkowitz et al 2006 metzler et al 2014 several exact and approximate solutions have already shown that the exponent ν depends on the details of the systems geometry not only on their fractal dimensions d f havlin and ben avraham 2002 this is confirmed in recent studies in regular and randomized fractals voller and aarão reis 2021 aarão reis and voller 2021 superdiffusive infiltration i e ν 1 2 has also been observed in several experiments and models such as moisture infiltration in building materials küntz and lavallée 2001 lockington and parlange 2003 el abd and milczarek 2004 el abd 2015 flow in disordered structures in which preferential pathways and stagnant zones simultaneously appear kang et al 2016 yin et al 2020 infiltration of a reactive solute that

frequency dependent kernels vainstein et al 2006 in this range of examples however an explicit connection between the morphology of the porous media and the superdiffusive transport is presented only in a small number of works e g infiltration from fractal or point sources into fractal media embedded in two or three dimensions aarão reis et al 2018 aarão reis and voller 2019 further in keeping with studies of subdiffusion the infiltration exponents in these particular systems do not depend solely on the fractal dimensions relations between anomalous transport and fractal structure are also expected in geological materials the pore size distributions of rocks from submicrometer scale to some millimeters frequently have fractal properties anovitz and cole 2015 recent reviews illustrate these features in clayey aggregates van damme 1998 silty and sandy soils rieu and perrier 2018 simple approaches show how this can impact the variation of permeability with the observation length fuentes et al 2018 at larger length scales soil inhomogeneities also affect water transport even considering that the conductivities of sand clay and other geological materials assume constant values at those scales for instance a soil may be formed by domains whose sizes range from centimeters to a few meters and whose conductivities vary by more than four orders of magnitude adams and gelhar 1992 these features motivated stochastic treatments of the disorder of such media to predict hydrological properties dagan 1986 gelhar 1997 in this work we investigate possible anomalies in moisture infiltration into layered porous media that exhibit fractal distributions of low conductivity inclusions in high conductivity matrices to the best of our knowledge no previous study has addressed this problem even in the simplest case of flow normal to the gravity direction which is the assumption of our work the layered geometry is easily visualized in some geological and manufactured systems blum et al 2018 navarre sitchler et al 2009 sadeghi et al 2014 pettersson et al 2020 behrens et al 2021 for instance horizons of a deep soil may have very different physical structures and consequently different conductivities blum et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2014 green roofs are formed by layers with different functionalities pettersson et al 2020 some corestones have centimeter scale layers with different properties navarre sitchler et al 2009 behrens et al 2021 and lower permeability lenses are observed in higher permeability gravel beds lindsey et al 1998 jussel et al 1994a b moreover some studies show layered fractal geometry of sedimentary soils bailey and smith 2005 richards 2002 the layered structure implies a one dimensional symmetry so the low conductivity parts of the media studied here have fractal dimensions d f 1 to begin we consider inclusion distributions as in cantor sets and provide a closed analytical algebraic solution for the infiltration next we consider cases of disordered fractal media for which randomized versions of cantor sets are presented as possible realizations if the hydraulic conductivity contrast between matrix and inclusions is high all these systems show superdiffusive propagation of the infiltration front with an exponent ν that depends only on the fractal dimension of the set of inclusions these developments are made assuming our system involves well sorted and similarly packed spheroidal grains we point towards general applications by showing through a scaling analysis and use of numerical simulations that the identified universal superdiffusive infiltration behavior can be observed in physical settings in particular in soil domains with fine granular mixtures 2 model and methods 2 1 infiltration front model in general during unidirectional infiltration into a porous medium there is not a sharp front between the wet and dry regions but rather a diffusive region with a decreasing saturation in the flow direction a situation that leads to a capillary suction drawing in moisture however in tracking infiltration it is often valid to invoke the so called green ampt approximation green and ampt 1911 neuman 1976 where the unsaturated region is collapsed to an equivalent sharp infiltration front separating a fully saturated region from a region at an initial moisture content to account for the capillary suction this model imposes a negative potential the matric potential on the infiltration front neuman 1976 our model domain consists of a 1d horizontal tube at 0 x l containing a granular porous medium fig 1a we will assume that the medium has a very low initial moisture with the vast majority of pores space filed with air at any time the end of the tube at x 0 is connected to a water reservoir held at the fixed head h 0 t h 0 under the green ampt approximation the subsequent moisture infiltration into the tube can be modeled by considering the advance of an infiltration wetting front s t separating the saturated and dry regions in our theoretical developments we will assume that the grain sizes of our porous media are sufficiently large enough that the matric potential on the infiltration front is negligible when compared to the reservoir head h 0 as such it is reasonable to set the pressure head on and beyond the front to zero h x s t 0 and without loss of generality set the reservoir head to h 0 1 in our discussion of applications section 5 we show that relaxing the assumption of a negligible matric pressure which would be the case when considering fine grain soils does not change our conclusions at any point during the infiltration into our model tube the head value h x t monotonically decreases from h 0 t 1 to h s t 0 and the specific discharge q t flow volume per unit area per unit time is constant in space but varies over time the green ampt approximation implies that darcy s law holds within the saturated region i e 2 q k h x where k x is the hydraulic conductivity in units of length per unit time from the discharge we can also determine the velocity of the fluid in the pore space as v x t q t ϕ x where ϕ x is the porosity together with eq 2 this allows us to relate the velocity of the infiltration front the discharge and darcy s law as 3 ϕ d s d t q t k h x 2 2 model of layered media as a general starting point illustrated in fig 1b we will consider the case where our tube domain is made up of m segments lenses of length c with lens conductivities k j and lens porosities ϕ j j 1 m the domain length is l m c for simplicity we set c 1 in analytical and numerical calculations the position x j denotes the end of the j th lens and h j t is the head at this position we assume a physical scenario in which each lens is a well sorted spheroidal granular medium with low grain size dispersion so that it can be considered homogeneous however the grains in a particular lens can be anywhere in the range from very fine sand size 0 1 mm to gravel size 100 mm allowing for the possibility of a high conductivity contrast as we move from one lens to another indeed the conductivity of very find sand can be more than 4 orders of magnitude smaller than that of gravel strack 1989 such high contrasts are actually observed in soils at some sites adams and gelhar 1992 bierkens 1994 however despite the wide differences in grain sizes we can expect that the porosities of the grain packings have low variability lying in the range 0 25 optimum packing to 0 44 very loose random packing for monodispersed sizes dullien 1992 torquato 2001 2 3 fractal patterns based on cantor sets in order to induce non fickian behaviors we consider layered media with the patterns of cantor sets in which the segments are made of only two materials resistors whose hydraulic conductivity is k r and spaces whose conductivity is k s the respective porosities are ϕ r and ϕ s fig 2 a shows the first orders of construction of cantor sets with scaling factors n 3 and n 4 the order n 1 is the generator of the fractal which consists of 2 resistors separated by n 2 spaces the second order is created by separating two first order sets by a space of length n 2 2 n and by recursion the order n is created by separating two sets of order n 1 by a space of length n n 2 n n 1 after infinite iterations of this rule the fractal dimension of the resistor set cantor set dimension is 4 d f log 2 log n as an alternative description of the construction of a cantor set we consider that the order n 1 is obtained by replacing each resistor of the pattern of order n 1 by the generator and by increasing the system size by the scaling factor n this description helps to define the randomized cantor sets which are one dimensional generalizations of the regular random fractals formerly defined in two and three dimensions martin and keefer 1985 aarão reis 1996 aarão reis and voller 2021 in a randomized set several generators order n 1 are built by randomly distributing the 2 resistors and the n 2 spaces in series thus there are n 2 different generators the order n is built by replacing each resistor of the order n 1 by a randomly chosen generator and rescaling the system by the factor n fig 2 b illustrates the construction of randomized cantor sets with n 4 the fractal dimension is also given by eq 4 3 results 3 1 infiltration into a layered medium since any lens of the layered medium is homogeneous the head decrease across each lens is linear when the infiltration front is in the j th lens i e j 1 s t j we can determine the discharge q t in two ways the first in terms of the head gradient between the end of the j 1 th lens and the current position 5 q k j h j 1 t 0 s j 1 and the second in terms of the head gradient between the origin x 0 and the end of j 1 th lens 6 q k j 1 e 1 h j 1 t j 1 where k i e is the effective conductivity over the first i lenses given by 7 k i e 1 i l 1 i 1 k l 1 on eliminating h j t from eqs 5 and 6 we obtain 8 q j 1 k j 1 e s j 1 k j 1 j 1 s j substituting this expression in eq 3 and integrating the time interval required for the front to move through the j th lens is 9 δ t j ϕ j j 1 j j 1 k j 1 e s j 1 k j d s ϕ j j 1 k j 1 e 0 5 k j j 1 2 m summing all the contributing time intervals the time for the infiltration front to reach s j is 10 t j i 1 j δ t i i 1 j ϕ i i 1 k i 1 e 0 5 k i i 1 j ϕ i p 1 i 1 1 k p 0 5 k i where eq 7 was used note that the flux in eq 8 has the same dependence on the effective conductivity as the flux in steady state conditions although the infiltration time in eq 10 shows a nontrivial dependence on partial sums of effective conductivities this occurs because the head distribution is treated in a quasi stationary approximation whereas the infiltration front position continuously increase in time defining the equivalent resistance 11 r i p 1 i 1 k p we can use eq 10 to develop a recursive algorithm for tracking the infiltration front as follows 12 t 1 ϕ 1 0 5 k 1 r 1 1 k 1 t j t j 1 ϕ j r j 1 0 5 k j r j r j 1 1 k j t m t m 1 ϕ m r m 1 0 5 k m this recursion provides a vector t t 1 t 2 t m of the times to reach the end of each lens given by the vector of front locations s 1 2 3 m by construction the times in t are exact and with a sufficiently large number of lenses linear interpolation of the s t plot recovers an accurate approximation of the front movement s t we can also determine the head profile in the tube at time t j we can use continuity and the effective conductivity eq 7 to write the discharge at any integer position p j as 13 q k p e 1 h p t j p k j e j where we have recognized that h j t j 0 on rearranging the last two terms we obtain a discrete expression for the head profile at t j 14 h p t j 1 p k p e j k j e 1 i 1 p 1 k i i 1 j 1 k i p j since the conductivity is constant in each lens the pressure drop across the lens will be linear thus fitting piecewise linear segments through the pressures heads in eq 14 will provide the complete head profile again while only providing profile expressions at discrete time values the head profile in eq 14 is exact a simplification can be made in the infiltration arrival time based on the expected physical scenario of low porosity variability among the lenses assuming that the packing of different lenses is similar so that the porosity takes a constant value ϕ eq 10 simplifies to 15 t j ϕ i 1 j j 0 5 i k i from this point forward unless otherwise stated we will retain this assumption in section 5 by comparing the predictive performance between eq 10 with lens dependent porosity and theory derived from eq 15 we show that this choice has no consequence for our main findings a particular use of eq 15 is when the tube is homogeneous i e all the lenses have identical properties in this case t j ϕ k j 2 2 implying that the movement of the infiltration front follows the expected fickian behavior s t 2 k ϕ t 1 2 voller 2010 3 2 infiltration into cantor tubes 3 2 1 general solution we now consider cases where the conductivities of the layers of a tube are arranged as in regular cantor sets fig 2 a from eq 15 we calculate the time t n t n n to traverse the length j n n of the n th order as t n ϕ i 1 n n n n 0 5 i k i due to the symmetry of this set however we see that k i k n n 1 i allowing us to also calculate this transition time as t n ϕ i 1 n n i 0 5 k i averaging between these two expressions we arrive at a transition time 16 t n ϕ n n 2 i 1 n n 1 k i further on noting that the order n has 2 n resistors and n n 2 n spaces we obtain the effective conductivity for the n th order pattern as 17 k n n e 2 n n n k r n n 2 n n n k s 1 n n k r k s 2 n k s k r n n k r and rewrite the transition time as 18 t n ϕ n 2 n 2 k n n e ϕ n 2 n k s 1 n n 2 n k r 1 k s 1 2 3 2 2 the case of very large k s fractal resistor distribution now consider that the space conductivity is much larger than the resistor conductivity so that a high conductivity medium has a fractal pattern of low conductivity inclusions taking the limit k s 1 0 we neglect the terms proportional to k s 1 in eq 18 in comparison with those proportional to k r 1 and obtain 19 t n 2 n 1 n n ϕ k r 1 the corresponding displacement of the infiltration front is s n n so eq 19 leads to 20 s a t ν with ν log n log 2 n and a 2 k r ϕ ν this gives 1 2 ν 1 for any n 3 so the movement of the infiltration front is superdiffusive we can also write the power law exponent in eq 20 as 21 ν 1 1 d f where 0 d f 1 for fractals embedded in one dimensional space thus the infiltration front displacement can be expressed directly and solely in terms of the fractal dimension 22 s t 2 k r ϕ 1 1 d f t 1 1 d f 3 2 3 head profile at any time through eq 14 the head profile h x t will be made up of piecewise segments providing a monotonic decrease form the value 1 at x 0 to the value of 0 at the front s t this profile will have close to horizontal slopes in spaces and constant significantly steeper slopes in resistors at time t n when the infiltration front is at s t n n n there will be 2 n resistors each providing a head drop of δ h 2 n on noting that each lower order p n has 2 p resistors we can pick out at time t t n the exact head values at the ends of each lower order 23 h n p t n 1 2 p 2 n p 1 2 n we can readily show that these point values are exactly fit by the continuous profile 24 h x t n 1 x d f where we define a normalized position 25 x x s t n 0 x s t n in section 3 4 we show that this expression is a good approximation of the actual piecewise profile 3 3 infiltration into random layered fractal media here we consider a general case of a layered fractal system in which the resistor distribution has fractal dimension d f the randomized cantor sets shown in fig 2 b are possible realizations of such fractal media if the medium with a dimensionless size m l c is scaled to a size m l c the number of resistors increases from n r to n r these quantities are related to the fractal dimension by 26 d f ln n r n r ln m m eq 15 with j m gives the total time for the infiltration front to cross the medium of length m considering infinitely large conductivity in the spaces k s and finite k r the terms inversely proportional to k s in eq 15 vanish and the infiltration time can be written in terms of the contributions of the resistors only 27 t m ϕ m 1 n r m x r m 0 5 k r ϕ k r m 1 2 x r n r where x r m is the position of the end of the m th resistor m 1 n r and x r denotes the spatial average of these positions in a large medium m 1 2 m in eq 27 for a symmetric distribution of resistors which is the case of the regular cantor sets x r m 2 in other cases such as the randomized cantor sets the values of x r m are distributed between 1 and m 1 but this distribution may not be symmetric for instance consider patterns initiated by the generators a and f in fig 2 b which have the resistor positions concentrated in the smallest and largest possible values respectively in an order with length m 1 the pattern generated by a has x r m 4 and the pattern generated by f has x r 3 m 4 in a random fractal the iterative reproduction of patterns like a and f in several orders is unlikely such reproductions might lead to x r m and x r m respectively thus in general we expect that 28 x r c m where c is a constant smaller than 1 but of order 0 1 1 eq 27 then gives 29 t m 1 c ϕ 2 k r m n r where 0 1 c 1 c 1 2 for the regular cantor sets eq 29 also applies to the infiltration time t m in the medium with length m and n r resistors if there is no spatial anisotropy in the distribution of the inclusions the constant c in eq 29 will be the same in this rescaled medium this is the case in the randomized cantor sets in which the generators are chosen with equal probability to replace each of the resistors of the pattern in the previous order fig 2 b the ratio of infiltration times is 30 t m t m m m 1 d f where eq 26 was used noting that the front displacements are s m c and s m c at the respective total infiltration times we obtain eq 20 with the same superdiffusive exponent ν of eq 21 and 31 a k r 1 c ϕ ν thus the superdiffusive infiltration with an exponent dependent only on the dimension of the medium is expected for any fractal distribution of the low conductivity inclusions in the layered media the randomized cantor sets are examples of such media this is an important result for applications to real materials because the advance of the infiltration front is related to a single geometric property the only condition for this result to be valid is that under rescaling of the observation size there is no spatial anisotropy in the distribution of the inclusions in the randomized cantor sets we may alternatively look at the average infiltration time t m in all patterns of length m due to the symmetry of the generators fig 2 b the configurational and spatial average of resistor positions is x r m 2 so eqs 29 and 31 are applicable with c 1 2 the superdiffusive infiltration obtained in this averaging is exactly the same as in the corresponding regular cantor set 3 4 demonstration with direct simulation for a given fractal distribution of resistors we use eq 10 to track the infiltration progress from lens to lens and compare the resulting discrete tracking of the front s t j with the continuous theoretical expression s t provided by eq 22 in any realization to avoid an initial rapid infiltration with nearly zero time interval we commence tracking with eq 10 from an origin x 0 replaced on the left hand side of the location of the first resistor further in all realizations we set ϕ 0 4 k r 0 4 and k s 4000 which are typical values for granular media with high conductivity contrast see section 2 2 some cases with more modest conductivity contrasts and variable porosity are investigated in section 5 figs 3 a and 3 b compare theoretical and simulational results for regular and randomized cantor sets respectively in the regular fractals the infiltration front positions obtained in the simulations have small oscillations but they tightly follow the theoretical predictions for n 3 the slope of the best linear fit to that plot is ν 0 6151 which is very close to the theoretical value ν log 3 log 6 0 6131 eq 21 in the randomized fractals with n 3 fig 3 b front oscillations are slightly more pronounced however the slopes of the linear fits of each of the 10 realizations shown in fig 3 b are typically within 3 of the theoretical value this is consistent with the analysis of section 3 3 which predicts the universal exponent of eq 21 for any realization of a randomized fractal however the intercepts of those linear fits exhibit notable differences between different realizations for example in 3 sets of 50 realizations not shown in fig 3 b the measured intercepts give values of a eq 20 in the ranges 0 47 1 93 0 62 2 11 and 0 55 2 42 thus despite the universal superdiffusive scaling the random distribution of the resistors in a given realization does influence the transition time of the infiltration through the tube this is consistent with eq 31 because the value of a is related to the value of the constant c which depends on the spatial distribution of the resistors in a given realization figs 4 a and 4 b show suitably displaced head profiles 1 h x t n as a function of the normalized position x eq 25 at the times t t n in tubes with regular and randomized cantor set inclusions respectively the direct simulations from eq 14 are compared with the theoretical predictions of eq 24 in the regular fractals the theoretical predictions form an upper bound on the simulation predictions which clearly have the theoretical slope d f in fig 4 b the theoretical curve is contained within the simulations of the randomized fractals which also have slopes close to d f this shows that the power law nature of the head profile in eq 24 is recovered in regular and randomized fractals 3 5 finite size effects to obtain the superdiffusive infiltration we assumed that the conductivity of spaces was much larger than that of resistors i e k s 1 k r 1 however in passing from eq 18 to eq 19 for the regular cantor set or in passing from eq 15 to eq 27 for fractal layered systems in general the actual assumption was that the full terms proportional to k s 1 could be neglected eq 18 shows that these terms depend on the length m n n so the superdiffusive behavior is limited by finite size effects we first consider the case of the regular cantor set patterns in eq 18 for the terms proportional to k s 1 to be negligible in comparison with those proportional to k r 1 it is necessary that n 2 n k s 1 n n 2 n k s 1 n n 2 n k r 1 assuming that n 2 n 1 which is reasonable for large lengths it gives 32 k s k r n 2 n considering that the dimensionless length is m n n l c where c is the length of a single resistor eq 32 can be written in terms of physically measurable quantities as 33 l c k s k r 1 1 d f where eq 4 was used this relation was obtained under the assumption that resistors and spaces have the same porosity otherwise eq 10 suggests that as a rough approximation the conductivities k s and k r in eq 33 can be divided by the respective porosities now consider the more general case of layered systems in which eq 15 has contributions of terms proportional to k s 1 and k r 1 for the former to be negligible compared to the latter and eq 27 to be valid it is necessary that 34 ϕ k 1 m n r m x s k 0 5 k s ϕ m 1 n r m x r m 0 5 k r where x s k denotes the position of the k th space for very large m we have m 1 n r x r m k 1 m n r x s k m 2 2 and from eq 28 m 1 n r x r m c m n r with c 1 since n r m in such limit we obtain k 1 m n r x s k m 2 2 eq 34 then gives 35 k s k r m n r where we omitted a factor 2 1 c that is expected to be of order 1 an alternative relation can be obtained in terms of characteristic lengths of the medium which is more helpful for applications let l m i n be the minimum length in which fractal features are observed and f m i n be the fraction of this cutoff length with resistors in eq 26 we assume that the prime superindex refers to this system i e m l m i n c and n r f m i n l m i n c where now c can be any length below l m i n for a macroscopic system of interest m l c so that m n r l l m i n d f 1 f m i n eq 35 can then be rewritten as 36 l l m i n f m i n k s k r 1 1 d f eq 36 is a universal relation that sets the range of system sizes in which superdiffusive scaling can be observed in terms of the conductivity contrast between spaces and resistors and in terms of the fractal dimension if that relation fails we expect that a crossover to fickean scaling will appear because the fractal properties are relevant only at short scales this crossover is always expected to occur in sufficiently large systems 4 applications 4 1 laboratory and field settings to check whether the universal superdiffusion behavior may be observed in real systems consider the example of section 2 2 in which the medium has two types of layers gravel which can have a hydraulic conductivity of k 1 0 2 m s and very fine sand which can take the value k 1 0 6 m s strack 1989 in the laboratory it is certainly possible to build inhomogeneous media with these materials but similar inhomogeneities may also be found in soils if the two types of layer are distributed according to the rules of a cantor set with n 3 eq 33 gives l c 7 10 10 in the case of a set with n 10 it gives l c 5 10 5 these conditions can certainly be achieved for any realistic value of the size c of the homogeneous resistors in laboratory or in field applications for instance in field scale settings with inclusions of millimeter or centimeter size the suggested conductivity contrast will allow the observation of superdiffusion over tens of meters or more in small laboratory scale settings however it may be possible to observe superdiffusion over shorter length scales with more modest conductivity contrasts to illustrate how a laboratory bench scale experiment could be constructed let us consider medium to coarse sands grain diameters 0 25 1 mm exhibiting hydraulic conductivities in the range 1 0 4 1 0 2 m s and depending on the grain packing porosities in the range 0 25 0 4 with these materials we can readily select two well sorted mixtures that will have a modest conductivity ratio e g k s 2 1 0 2 k r 4 1 0 4 k s k r 50 for a cantor tube with n 3 eq 33 gives l c 4 1 0 4 if the low conductivity layers medium sands have length c 10 mm we can then construct an order n 5 of that fractal with total length 2 43 m and observe the expected superdiffusive transport this proposed experiment has parallels in some recent works for instance in recent studies of reactive flow in packed columns of magnesite and quartz length scale 22 cm those materials were organized in cylinders parallel to the flow or in a three layer configuration for comparison with the dissolution of mixed samples salehikhoo et al 2013 li et al 2014 4 2 simulation at laboratory scale considering changes in porosity to assess the performance of the experiment proposed in the previous section we compare infiltration time predictions from the direct simulation of the general layer model lm eq 10 and those obtained from the theoretical expression in eq 22 here we are considering porosity contrast between lenses so it is more consistent to report the results in terms of infiltration length ℓ t as opposed to the front position s t to recall the length ℓ t is defined as the volume of infiltrated fluid divided by the cross sectional area after the calculation of the time value t j from eq 12 the associated increase in infiltration length is determined as ℓ j ℓ j 1 ϕ j c j 1 2 ℓ 0 0 the theoretical prediction for the position of the infiltration front s t uses the matrix porosity in eq 22 so the theoretical prediction for the infiltration length ℓ t is obtained by multiplying this value by the matrix porosity fig 5 reports two lm simulations the first assuming similar loose random packing in both the resistor and space providing a constant porosity of ϕ r ϕ s 0 4 throughout the medium the second assuming porosities ϕ s 0 4 and ϕ r 0 25 in a departure from the theory used to derive eq 22 note that these porosity values are close to the extremes of the expected range for well sorted grains the results with a constant porosity show excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions confirming that even with a modest conductivity ratio of 50 the length ratio l c 243 is sufficiently small to invoke superdiffusive transport with a porosity contrast while there is a slight early time shift the infiltration still provides a good match to the anomalous behavior observed with a constant porosity this indicates that relaxing our assumption of a constant tube porosity does not change our main results indeed fig 5 confirms that superdiffusive infiltration can be physically realized in bench scales cantor set lens patterns constructed with common geological materials 4 3 infiltration with initial moisture and contrasts in matric potential in our theoretical development we simplified the green ampt treatment by assuming that the initial moisture in the porous medium and the matric potential at the infiltration front were negligible we argued that provided the reservoir head is large enough and the granular media is in the sand to gravel range these assumptions are reasonable however in many porous materials in particular fine grained soils e g sands loams and clays these assumptions may no longer be valid for these cases in addition to providing a value for the hydraulic conductivity we will also need to account for the initial moisture and matric potential wetted front capillary pressure based on extensive data sets rawls et al 1983 have provided appropriate values of soil parameters to use with the green ampt model these values effective porosity hydraulic conductivity and matric potential converted to si units for sand and three finer textured soils are provided in table 1 note that in finer grained soils the residual moisture θ r e the moisture retained in the soil after drying is not necessarily an insignificant fraction of the porosity thus as provided in table 1 a more appropriate measure of the moisture infiltrated into the saturated region is not the porosity of the soil ϕ but an effective porosity ϕ e θ s a t θ r e where θ s a t ϕ is the moisture fraction at saturation further note that the matric potential for use in the green ampt model can be associated with the integration of the relative permeability over the decreasing pressure potential ahead of the advancing fully saturated region neuman 1976 the values listed in table 1 assume that this region is homogeneous in layered porous media however we can expect a non monotonic change in the green ampt matric potential depending on the soil properties ahead of the infiltration front a simple accounting of this process used here is to set the front matric potential in each lens to the value associated with the soil type that makes up that lens using the data in table 1 we calculate the infiltration length ℓ t using our general layer model lm eq 10 whose form is identical to the model used in section 4 2 the only difference is a revised definition for the layer porosity term ϕ j in deriving the revised lm we replace the zero pressure head in the numerator of the discharge expression in eq 5 with the matric potential h s and for generality we replace the unit surface x 0 pressure head in the numerator of the discharge expression in eq 6 with h 0 the subsequent algebra follows as before arriving at an identical form to eq 10 for the time for the infiltration front s t to pass through the j th lens 37 δ t j ϕ j j 1 k j 1 e 0 5 k j j 1 2 m here the porosity term ϕ in the original lm has been replaced by the parameter 38 ϕ j ϕ e j h 0 h s j the effective porosity of the layer divided by the total head drop over 0 s j the associated change in the infiltration length for this time is δ ℓ j ϕ e j c fig 6 shows the modified lm model simulations in the same laboratory setting as the simulations reported in fig 5 however now the pressure head at x 0 takes a nominal value of h 0 0 1 m the matrix is sand and the inclusions are lenses of finer soils with 0 01 m of length loam sandy clay loam or sandy clay in all simulations regardless of the contrasts in matrix and lens properties listed in table 2 superdiffusive behavior is predicted the slopes of linear fits through the simulation data closely match the universal time scaling exponent ν 0 6132 the difference between the simulated value and the theoretical value ranges from 3 3 for the smallest contrast in saturated conductivity k c o n 35 to 1 9 for the largest contrast k c o n 196 a trend that is consistent with our finite size analysis section 3 5 interestingly with reference to table 2 we note that the closest match to our theory sandy clay inclusions is the case where the contrasts in the conductivity effective porosity and matrix potential are the largest from the predictions reported in fig 6 we conclude that the universal superdiffusive scaling developed for well sorted granular media in the sand to gravel range where contrasts in matric potential can be neglected also holds up for finer soils even in cases where there is a large contrast in matric potential values between the matrix and the inclusions 5 relations with other models the superdiffusive infiltration predicted here can be physically interpreted in analogy with ctrw with power law distributions of transition times when the fluid front passes from the pattern of a given order to the next order pattern n n 1 it encounters a larger density of high conductivity lenses which can be traversed in very short times thus the distribution of transition times is narrower than that of a homogeneous system in the ctrw this narrowing may bring the power law exponent to an absolute value below the fickean range which is known to produce superdiffusive behavior dentz et al 2004 kang et al 2016 the general fluid infiltration model defined in section 2 1 can be related to the diffusion of a solute in the same medium with a source of constant concentration at the same points where the fluid head is constant aarão reis 2016 aarão reis and voller 2019 such diffusion process can be described with random walk models an important feature of random walks defined in cantor sets is that the walker positions are restricted to the points of those sets since they are disconnected sets the trajectories are not continuous over them moreover different random walk definitions are possible in the same set for instance different relations between the hopping probability and the distance may be defined as in lévy walks balankin et al 2018 zaburdaev et al 2015 thus different scaling exponents may be obtained superdiffusion is a frequent feature because long distance hops across the gaps of the set become more frequent as larger regions of the set are explored golmankhaneh and balankin 2018 it is not unexpected that some of those definitions lead to the same exponent ν obtained here indeed this is the case of a scaled random walk model in which the hop probability between two points of the disconnected set is inversely proportional to the distance between those points takahashi and tamura 2005 however in our model the fluid infiltrates the whole one dimensional lattice defined at each stage of construction of the cantor set so it cannot be physically related to random walks whose positions are restricted to the cantor set despite the similarities in scaling exponents in addition to the study of random walk diffusion models there has also been works on fluid transport in cantor set patterns for example in ref tang et al 2008 the cantor set with n 3 was used to model a medium composed of layers of fine and coarse sediments in that work effective conductivities at different orders are obtained from simulations of steady state flow with different volumetric water contents but no scaling laws similar to those obtained here are derived 6 conclusion to study fluid infiltration into layered porous media we considered a model of a one dimensional tube of porous granular lenses with a constant head at the entrance when the conditions are such that a sharp interface between the wet and dry regions can be assumed we can write down an algebraic recursion to exactly track the passage of this interface through each lens under the circumstances that the material in each lens is well sorted this expression reduces to a summation expression when in addition low conductivity lenses are laid out in the pattern of a cantor set embedded in a high conductivity matrix we arrive at an exact expression for the transition time through each order of the pattern in the limit of a very large hydraulic conductivity contrast between those lenses we show that the infiltration is superdiffusive further from the expression for the transition time we obtain an explicit value of the superdiffusive time exponent solely as a function of the fractal dimension of the cantor set through appropriate rescaling we also show that the same exponent is obtained for infiltration into any other layered medium with the same fractal dimension of low conductivity inclusions this universal feature is explicitly verified in randomized versions of the cantor sets the authors are unaware of this form of universality in other anomalous infiltration and diffusion examples where exponent values depend on additional geometric properties beyond just the fractal dimension we confirmed our theoretical results by comparison with a general recursive model for infiltration into a tube of porous granular lenses with this general recursive calculation we also demonstrated that superdiffusive behavior can be observed in realistic setting involving modest conductivity contrasts and non ideal porosity and matric potential values in particular we have shown that our theory is fully consistent with direct simulations based on the green ampt model of horizontal infiltration into a sand matrix containing inclusions of finer grained soils thus our model has direct application in problems of hydrological interest more generally our model may also provide a simple explanation for observed superdiffusive infiltration in porous materials of interest in engineering geoscience and other fields providing a direct connection between the observed behavior and the geometry of the porous material from a broader point of view in subsurface hydrology although our work does not present a solution to a specific real problem it overcomes some limitations that were reported among the reasons for the low practical impact of stochastic models cirpka and valocchi 2016 for instance we highlight the consequences of high contrasts in conductivities in opposition to studies of small variability in conductivity fields moreover results from individual configurations i e without ensemble averaging show the predicted superdiffusive infiltration fig 3 b which permits application to an specific problem that fits the physical assumptions of the model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement f d a a r acknowledges

57,soil temperature is an important environmental factor affecting biogeochemical processes in salt marshes and further wetland ecological functions this study conducted field investigation and numerical simulations to examine temperature distributions and variations in a creek marsh section subjected to estuarine and meteorological forcing conditions the results showed that periodic tidal inundation induced water and heat exchange across sediment water interfaces and thus modified diurnal temperature variations in shallow soil layers caused by meteorological fluctuations the combination of periodic tidal inundation and sediment atmosphere heat exchange led to the formation of three characteristic soil temperature zones along the creek marsh section a high elevation marsh zone with diurnal temperature variations influenced by meteorological fluctuations a near creek zone where tide induced porewater circulations regulated soil temperatures and a low elevation and sloping zone where sediment atmosphere heat exchange decreased with the reduced marsh elevation sensitivity analyses demonstrated that a larger hydraulic conductivity facilitated the porewater circulation and heat transport in the near creek zone enhancing temperature fluctuations an increased soil thermal conductivity intensified vertical heat exchange across sediment water atmosphere interfaces and increased the effect of estuarine and meteorological conditions on soil temperature this study highlights the importance of surface water groundwater interaction on temperature variations and helps to understand thermodynamics dependent biogeochemical processes in salt marshes keywords wetland tide surface water groundwater interaction dynamics heat conduction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction salt marshes have numerous ecological functions such as maintaining estuarine coastal biodiversity teixeira et al 2014 improving water quality verhoeven et al 2006 and sequestering blue carbon chmura et al 2003 due to human activities and climate change many salt marshes worldwide suffer from degradation and loss xin et al 2022 therefore preserving and restoring salt marsh ecosystems have gained increasing global attention marsh ecological functions depend on surface water groundwater interaction caused primarily by periodic tidal fluctuations guimond and tamborski 2021 xin et al 2022 for example surface water and groundwater with different and variable temperatures jointly affect soil temperature in salt marshes moffett et al 2008 which is a controlling factor for physical and biogeochemical processes warmer soils may increase plant productivity kirwan et al 2009 and the rate of belowground carbon accumulation kirwan and mudd 2012 smith et al 2022 temperature also regulates microbial activities in salt marshes e g soil respiration and decomposition spivak et al 2019 wang et al 2021 tidal fluctuations cause marsh soils to be periodically inundated and exposed the frequency and duration of tidal inundation depend on the relative difference between the local surface water level and marsh surface elevation harvey et al 1987 hemond et al 1984 for near creek zones with marked elevation changes hydrodynamic exchange i e rapid and transient water exchange is pronounced due to dynamic tidal fluctuations gardner and wilson 2006 xin et al 2012 during rising tides surface water can vertically infiltrate into submerged marsh platforms and near creek zones porewater seeps from creek banks and bottoms when tides ebb off marsh surface wilson and gardner 2006 wilson and morris 2012 this process leads to near creek water circulations in addition tides determine variations of groundwater heads and soil water saturations in salt marshes xiao et al 2017 affecting evapotranspiration including evaporation and plant transpiration and rainfall induced infiltration xin et al 2022 xin et al 2017 examined porewater flow in a two dimensional creek marsh system subjected to spring neap tides evaporation and rainfall the results suggested that evaporation and rainfall dominate porewater flow and soil conditions i e soil water saturation and porewater salinity in the interior zone whereas tidal fluctuations significantly regulate porewater flow and soil conditions in the near creek zone xin et al 2017 therefore it is expected that the combination of tides evapotranspiration and rainfall may also affect the thermal regime of salt marshes the energy balance in exposed salt marshes can be described as follows moffett et al 2010 1 r n g h l e where rn is the net radiation flux le and h are the turbulent fluxes of latent heat required heat flux for soil evaporation and plant transpiration and sensible heat transferred heat flux due to temperature contrast between sediment and air respectively g is the soil heat flux across soil surface clearly this model is vertically zero dimensional and overlooks heat exchange at a spatial scale in salt marshes tidal inundation events regulate sediment atmosphere heat exchange surface water groundwater interaction could change heat transport in salt marshes huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 this induces variations in temperature distributions of salt marshes moffett et al 2010 redfield 1965 vitale et al 2014 piccolo et al 1993 pointed out that temperature variations in intertidal zones are typically driven by tidal and radiation fluctuations moffett et al 2008 conducted continuous temperature measurements in tidal creek beds in salt marshes and found that tide induced water exchange increases sediment temperature under warmer tidal temperature alber and o connell 2019 recently investigated soil surface temperature in a coastal marsh using field observations and remote sensing image interpretation the results demonstrated that soil surface temperature is negatively correlated with marsh elevation under both flooded and exposed conditions the inundation depth and duration hold the key to influencing the extent of sediment atmosphere heat exchange moffett et al 2010 temperature of shallow intertidal sediment is closer to air temperature during neap tides relative to spring tides cho et al 2005 guarini et al 1997 serôdio and catarino 1999 these studies focused on soil surface temperature it remains unclear how porewater hydrodynamic processes change heat transport and further soil temperature in salt marshes under estuarine and meteorological forcing conditions we conducted field investigation and numerical simulations to examine the temperature distributions and variations in an estuarine creek marsh section perpendicular to the yangtze river china investigation on hydraulic heads and soil temperatures at different sediment depths was carried out for 30 days based on the results the following research questions are addressed 1 how does periodic tidal inundation affect soil temperatures at different locations of salt marshes 2 are there any characteristic soil temperature zones along the creek marsh system 3 how do hydraulic conductivity and soil thermal conductivity modify temperature distributions and variations 2 methods 2 1 field investigation the field site is located in the jiuduansha wetland formed in the yangtze estuary china 31 12 n and 121 53 e fig 1a the jiuduansha wetland is vegetated by scirpus mariqueter spartina alterniflora and phragmites australis this wetland is significantly affected by the runoff of the yangtze river and the oceanic forcing of the east china sea it was reported that the maximum tidal range reaches 4 62 m for the yangtze estuary huang and zhang 2007 the mean annual temperature is around 17 3ºc and the average temperature in winter is around 5 6ºc zhang et al 2015 the borehole drilling tests showed that the sediment composition in the jiuduansha wetland is silt loam overlying sandy loam this stratigraphy is similar to many salt marshes worldwide xin et al 2022 a 200 m creek marsh section perpendicular to the yangtze river was selected to conduct the field investigation fig 1 the creek width and depth were respectively around 11 and 2 m the near creek and high elevation platform zones were vegetated with scirpus mariqueter and phragmites australis the gps rtk real time kinematic method was used to measure the marsh surface elevation from 1 78 to 2 49 m fig 1d six sets of distributed monitoring probes for hydraulic head and soil temperatures fig 1c were installed close to the tidal creek from x 32 to 19 m fig 1b for each monitoring probe six soil temperatures at different depths using pt1000 manlun hardware and a pressure head using hm21r nanjing hong mu technology could be measured a total of 33 soil temperatures and six groundwater heads were observed as presented in fig 1d an integrated automatic weather station includes multi parameter weather sensor wxt536 4 component net radiometer nr01 and heat flux plate hfp01 was installed close to the monitoring probe at x 32 m the tidal level and tidal water temperature tt were observed at a station near the field site 31 14 n and 122 00 e the measured data of 30 days from december 7 2021 to january 6 2022 were used in this study the recording interval was 600 s fig 2 during this period the highest and lowest tidal levels were respectively 2 59 and 1 62 m fig 2a a significant diurnal variation of air temperature ta was observed in contrast the tidal water temperature was stable and showed a slight downward trend fig 2b the mean values of ta and tt were 8 48 and 12 27 c respectively the average net radiation was 34 27 w m2 and the overall relative humidity was high around 72 the average wind speed and atmospheric pressure were 2 63 m s and 102 6 kpa respectively fig 2d and 2e we didn t observe any rainfall during this period on september 8 2021 slug tests were conducted at three locations parallel to the creek marsh section this method is commonly used to estimate in situ soil hydraulic conductivity kuang et al 2020 using the kgs kansas geological survey model hyder et al 1994 the estimated lateral hydraulic conductivities at x 13 13 and 24 m were respectively 3 1 10 6 2 67 10 6 and 1 16 10 6 m s the measured vertical hydraulic conductivity was 2 03 10 6 m s using the double ring infiltration method gregory et al 2005 soil samples were obtained using a ring knife and afterwards dried at 105 c the measured soil porosity was 0 39 the saturated soil thermal conductivity was 1 4 j m c s using the tempos thermal properties analyzer marsh porewater was sampled using a peristaltic pump via a push point sampler for salinity along the field transect at soil depths of 1 and 2 m the results showed a relatively low porewater salinity average of 3 6 ppt parts per thousand similar to the previous investigation on the same wetland hu et al 2016 2 2 numerical simulations to complement the field investigation we also conducted numerical simulations with consideration of the observed creek marsh section and boundary conditions fig 1d a layered soil configuration an upper silt loam soil layer and a lower sandy loam soil layer was considered in the model and a 1 m thickness was set for the lower layer the surface elevation of the domain was interpolated based on our in situ point elevation measurements sutra ms hughes and sanford 2005 a variably saturated and density dependent porewater flow model coupled with heat transport was used in this study in sutra ms porewater flow is described by the richards equation richards 1931 the relative hydraulic conductivity and soil water saturation in the vadose zone are calculated using the formulas from van genuchten 1980 heat transport in sutra ms is based on the advection dispersion equation according to hughes and sanford 2005 fluid density and viscosity depend on fluid temperature the details of governing equations for the model are given in supporting information during our observation period the measured salinities of porewater and tidal water changed between 0 6 and 7 34 ppt we conducted a numerical test with this salinity difference considered likely induce density driven flow the results showed that the effect of salinity difference on porewater flow and temperature distributions was negligible therefore we didn t consider salt transport in the model so as to focus on heat transport and soil temperatures the bottom left and right sides of the model domain were treated as no flow boundaries similar to many previous studies e g shen et al 2018 wilson and gardner 2006 xin et al 2017 xu et al 2021 dynamic sediment water and or sediment atmosphere interfaces were considered for the marsh surface the switch of the two interfaces depended on the time variable tidal level for submerged boundary nodes the nodal hydrostatic pressure was specified according to the local thickness of overlying water heat fluxes were transferred across sediment water interfaces by heat convection and conduction pivato et al 2018 the radiative heat flux was assumed to be zero when the nodes were submerged by tides for exposed boundary nodes if the nodes were saturated at the previous time step a seepage face with the atmospheric pressure was assigned otherwise the exposed nodes were specified as a flux boundary according to soil evaporation the evaporative flux based on a bulk aerodynamic approach as adopted in previous studies e g bittelli et al 2008 geng and boufadel 2015 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 was coupled into the model as fluid sinks the instantaneous meteorological data and the soil saturation of sediment surface were considered to calculate the evaporative flux this evaporative flux was then converted to the latent heat flux le using the volumetric latent heat of vaporization the energy balance eq 1 was adopted to integrate le h and rn and coupled into the groundwater model as heat sources sinks the details of equations used in soil evaporation and energy calculations are given in supporting information the measured soil porosity ϕ 0 39 and saturated thermal conductivity λ s 1 4 j m c s were used in the simulations in the base case the averaged lateral hydraulic conductivity kup 2 31 10 6 m s estimated from the slug tests was adopted as the hydraulic conductivity of the upper soil layer the hydraulic conductivity of the lower soil layer klow was set to 2 31 10 5 m s one order of magnitude larger than that for the upper layer the residual water saturation was set to 0 1 for both the upper and lower soil layers carsel and parrish 1988 the suggested values of water retention parameters in carsel and parrish 1988 were used for the two soil layers αup 2 0 m 1 and nup 1 41 αlow 7 5 m 1 and nlow 1 89 furthermore we conducted sensitivity analyses on soil hydraulic conductivity kup 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s and soil thermal conductivity λ s 0 4 and 2 4 j m c s the hydraulic conductivity ratio of the upper to lower layer remained unchanged set to 1 10 the specific heats of fluid and solid matrix were set to 4 182 j kg c and 840 j kg c respectively engineering toolbox 2003 the fluid thermal conductivity was 0 6 j m c s anderson 2005 a mesh with a uniform discretization in the x direction δx 0 5 m and a various discretization in the z direction δz 0 04 to 0 20 m with the upper subdomain refined was used the total number of mesh nodes was 12 431 the measured estuarine and meteorological data were adopted as boundary conditions for the marsh surface fig 2 using the distributions generated according to the observed pressure heads and soil temperatures as initial conditions the model considering water and heat fluxes across sediment water atmosphere interfaces was run for three days firstly from december 4 2021 to december 6 2021 this 3 day simulation was used to spin up the porewater flow and heat transport model then the simulation continued from december 7 2021 to january 6 2022 with a time step of 300 s 3 results 3 1 hydraulic heads and soil temperatures from field investigation we first examined the 30 day hydraulic head variations at the different locations from the six pressure transducers in response to tidal fluctuations the marsh surface elevations on the left side of the tidal creek were relatively low and the three locations were frequently inundated x 19 and z 0 93 m x 13 and z 1 19 m x 5 and z 1 40 m respectively the averaged hydraulic heads over 30 days at the three locations displayed a declining trend toward the yangtze river 0 85 0 89 0 94 m respectively for x 19 13 and 5 m overall the variations of the three hydraulic heads were similar fig 3a during the rising tides tidal water overtopped the marsh surface and recharged the low elevation zone the hydraulic heads at the three locations increased following the rising tides without delay a slight delay of hydraulic heads in response to tides was detected during the ebb tides and inundating period when the locations were exposed the hydraulic heads gradually differed from the tidal levels the results suggest that the variations of groundwater heads on the left side x 0 were predominantly controlled by tides the high elevation marsh surface on the right side x 0 was less inundated by tides and the observation results at the three locations marsh surface locations of x 13 and z 1 91 m x 24 and z 2 46 m x 32 and z 2 38 m respectively differed the averaged hydraulic heads for x 13 24 and 32 m were 1 20 1 11 and 1 05 m respectively it displayed a declining trend towards the marsh interior zone this was due to the pronounced difference in tidal inundation frequency at x 13 m the marsh surface was flooded 12 times the total inundation duration was shorter than that on the left side fig 3b the response of the hydraulic head at x 13 m to tidal fluctuations was delayed with a decreased peak this was because tidal signals usually propagated to the location through marsh soil for x 24 and 32 m the marsh surface elevations were around the spring high tidal level and the locations were inundated twice the local tidal inundation could elevate the hydraulic heads fig 3b for example hydraulic heads were elevated by 0 93 and 1 02 m during the spring high tide on january 5 2022 respectively for x 24 and 32 m from x 13 to 24 and 32 m tide induced porewater flow became smaller and the impact of tides on hydraulic heads was weakened therefore delayed watertable fluctuations and decreased fluctuation ranges were found as the lateral distance to the tidal creek increased we obtained the 30 day results for the soil temperatures at different depths and locations as the observation was conducted in winter the temperatures for the six locations increased with soil depths x 19 13 5 13 24 and 32 m for example at x 32 m the 30 day averaged soil temperatures were 12 03 13 63 14 35 15 44 16 41 and 16 76 c respectively for z 2 22 1 87 1 52 1 17 0 82 and 0 47 m furthermore as the shallow soil layer was readily affected by estuarine and meteorological fluctuations the shallow soil temperatures fluctuated distinctly whereas the deeper soil temperatures were relatively stable this depth dependent dampening response to meteorological and or estuarine conditions was consistent with previous field investigation cho et al 2005 piccolo et al 1993 three representative marsh locations x 32 5 and 19 m were further selected to show difference in temperature variations fig 4 overall the soil temperatures gradually decreased in early winter for x 32 m with the high elevation the soil temperature was less affected by estuarine tides the impact of meteorological conditions could be easily observed the results from the highest transducer 0 16 m depth to the marsh surface clearly showed the diurnal variation of soil temperature similar to the ta fluctuation fig 4a the maximum and minimum soil temperatures at the depth generally appeared in the morning and evening respectively it differed from the ta variation maximum and minimum temperatures appeared in the afternoon and at night a cold event occurred during december 24 26 2021 and ta continuously dropped from 14 4 to 1 2 c this decreased the soil temperatures at the different depths 0 16 to 1 91 m of x 32 m fig 4a the response of 0 16 m soil depth was most pronounced with a temperature drop of 3 71 c interestingly we observed that the temperatures in the six depths dropped abruptly on january 5 2022 fig 4a on this day cold tidal water about 10 2 c inundated the high elevation marsh platform the tide induced infiltration distinctly lowered the soil temperature furthermore the decreased soil temperature was also related to the abrupt drop of ta from 10 7 to 9 3 c in one hour for x 5 m soil temperatures at five different depths were obtained on the whole the measured soil temperatures at x 5 m were lower than those at x 32 m the fluctuation ranges of temperatures at x 5 m were also smaller fig 4a and 4b it is noteworthy that the diurnal temperature variation of the 0 16 m soil depth for x 5 m was not as obvious as the high elevation marsh platform e g x 32 m we attributed this to the periodic tidal inundation for example during the night of december 7 2021 from 0 00 to 2 20 tidal water inundated the marsh surface at x 5 m hotter tidal water regulated heat dissipation of the sediment tides heated the colder sediment leading to a temperature rise for the 0 16 m depth soil layer during the inundation period the temperature change at x 5 m was different from that at x 32 m fig 4a and 4b in addition tt was usually lower than soil surface temperature in winter afternoons for the afternoon inundation on december 10 2021 tidal water regulated heat absorption of sediment from atmosphere and decreased the range of temperature rise compared to the exposed marsh platform the results suggest that tides could induce bi directional heat exchange for the marsh soil in winter for the cold event on december 24 26 2021 we found that the temperature drop of the 0 16 m soil depth at x 5 m was less than that at x 32 m 2 88 c in comparison with 3 71 c as shown by the relatively frequent fluctuation curves throughout the cold event fig 4a in comparison with 4b the impact of periodic tidal inundation on the soil temperature at the location x 5 m and z 1 24 m was significant we also found an abruptly dropped temperature on january 5 2022 for x 5 m different from x 32 m the soil temperatures at x 5 m rapidly rose with less delay these variations could be attributed to the tide induced porewater circulation and sediment water heat exchange i e heat conduction due to the temperature contrast between sediment and water for x 19 m both the inundation frequency and duration were larger than that for the other locations of monitoring probes the observation results showed that the mean temperature in the shallow soil layer at x 19 m was lower than that at x 32 m in contrast the mean temperature in the deeper soil layer at x 19 m was higher the diurnal temperature variation of the 0 12 m soil depth at x 19 m was also less evident than that at x 32 m fig 4c this suggests that periodic tidal inundation modified the impact of meteorological fluctuations on soil temperatures with long duration inundation the amount of sediment water heat exchange was expected to be larger during inundation periods this would reduce the temperature contrasts between tidal water and near surface soil layers when the temperature contrast was small the inundation thermally insulated the marsh soil and weakened the impact of meteorological fluctuations as tides ebbed off the marsh surface the shallow soil temperatures e g x 19 m and z 0 79 m significantly dropped this temperature drop would be intensified by the large evaporation induced heat uptake given a high soil water content during december 24 26 2021 a significant temperature drop caused by the cold event and a temperature rise caused by tides were found for the location x 19 m and z 0 79 m similar to x 5 m 3 2 temperature distributions and heat transport in salt marshes firstly we validated the numerical model against the 30 day field observation hydraulic heads soil heat flux and soil temperatures the comparisons between simulated and observed hydraulic heads are shown in fig s1 of supporting information we used root mean square error rmse to measure the difference between simulated and observed values the results demonstrated that the simulated heads on the right side x 0 were in close agreement with the observed heads the rmse values were 0 13 0 15 and 0 17 m respectively for x 19 13 and 5 m for the left side of the tidal creek the simulated head at x 13 m also well captured the observed variation whereas the heads at x 24 and 32 m could only follow the long term trends the differences between simulated and observed heads might be related to crab burrows distributed in the field site crab burrows may induce preferential flow increasing variations of hydraulic heads in response to tides xin et al 2009 xu et al 2021 further we validated the simulated soil heat flux and multiple soil temperatures against the observation overall the simulation results well captured the variations of soil heat flux and temperatures figs s2 and s3 the rmse for the soil heat flux was 52 15 w m2 the observation from the upper two temperature transducers was used to validate the model the results showed that the validation for the deeper soil layer was better than that for the shallow one fig s3 overall the model reasonably reproduced the observed hydrodynamic and thermodynamic processes we compared the instantaneous temperature distributions between the investigation and simulation fig 5 initially midnight of december 7 2021 the tide 1 46 m water level and 14 c could heat the marsh soil on the left side the temperatures in the shallow soil layers were lower than those in the deeper soil layers this led to vertical heat transport in the salt marsh at 13 00 on december 10 2021 the radiation was relatively intense and ta was higher than the soil surface temperature the exposed marsh surface was heated and thus formed a downward thermal front fig 5c and 5d the vertical temperature gradient was relatively large for the shallow soil layer for example the simulation results showed a 6 c temperature contrast within the top 20 cm thickness at x 13 m fig 5d for the submerged marsh from x 160 to 60 m the temperatures were monotonously increased with soil depth during the rising tide porewater and associated heat flowed towards the deeper soil layer however the downward temperature gradients could induce conductive heat transport from the deeper soil layers to surface water for the submerged marsh from x 60 to 20 m we also found a prominent downward thermal front near the marsh surface fig 5d at 1 00 on december 14 2021 ta was 6 9 c and hotter tidal water 13 91 c ebbed off the marsh surface the heat was transported from the deeper soil layers to the tidal creek following porewater flow it sustained a relatively high temperature for the tidal creek under low ta fig 5f simultaneously heat could be transported vertically from the deeper soil layers to overlying water for the marsh from x 160 to 95 m for the exposed high elevation marsh the surface temperatures were low and large vertical temperature gradients were produced fig 5f this suggests that significant heat exchange occurred across the sediment atmosphere interface whereas for the locations from x 95 to 20 m exposed low elevation marsh the vertical temperature gradients near the marsh surface were less significant than those of the exposed high elevation marsh it was attributed to thermal insulation over the inundation period we also recorded soil temperature distributions and variations for the cold event during december 24 26 2021 the similar tidal levels during the rising tide were selected fig 5g 5j before the cold event the tidal water overlaid the low elevation marsh and maintained the shallow soil temperature for the exposed high elevation marsh vertical temperature gradients in the shallow soil layers were not evident fig 5g and 5h however after the cold event both the observation and simulation results displayed remarkable vertical temperature gradients in the shallow soil layers fig 5i and 5j furthermore the low elevation marshes with short duration inundations were also affected the cold event could significantly lower the shallow soil temperatures even with the insulating effect of overlying water for the creek bottom and bank the soil temperatures were less influenced by the cold event due to relatively hot porewater discharge the temperature distribution under a spring high tide submerging the whole creek marsh section was also shown fig 5k and 5l the tt was relatively low 9 81 c but the surface temperature of high elevation marsh platform was higher due to meteorological forcing conditions it can be found that the shallow soil temperatures for the near creek zone were similar to tt however the shallow soil temperatures were still higher than tt for the low elevation marshes with long duration inundations fig 5l the results demonstrated different heat transport dynamics for the high elevation marsh platform the near creek zone including the tidal creek and the low elevation and sloping zone to further explore differences among the three zones we calculated the 30 day averaged temperature distributions and associated standard deviations fig 6 the temperature distributions changed significantly with the marsh topography as expected the vertical temperature gradients and associated standard deviations in the shallow soil layers were larger than those in the deeper soil layers the high elevation marsh platform x 20 to 40 m was relatively flat and was only inundated twice diurnal meteorological fluctuations led to significant temperature standard deviations in the shallow soil layers reached 5 36 c for the marsh surface due to the short duration inundation the water and heat exchange across the sediment water interface were close to zero figs 7 and 8 therefore soil evaporation dominated water flow in the marsh platform and heat was vertically transported evaporation induced water uptake affected the soil water saturation of the marsh surface the le induced by evaporation would decrease the soil temperatures near marsh surface this caused upward capillary flow providing water and heat for the marsh surface however the weak capillary flow could not support continuous soil evaporation limiting the evaporative flux and le across the sediment atmosphere interface a slightly decreased marsh elevation increased the soil water content due to capillarity thus the evaporative flux and le increased from x 20 to 40 m figs 7 and 8 heat loss due to evaporation would decrease the soil surface temperatures which affected the h variations the positive h indicated a heat influx to the marsh surface the absolute values of h were less than that of le for the marsh platform fig 8 the net heat flux within the marsh platform was negative suggesting that the heat was transferred from the deeper soil layers to atmosphere by soil evaporation the temperature variations of near creek zones from x 20 to 20 m were affected by sediment water atmosphere heat conduction and porewater flow the lowest marsh temperature 6 33 c within the whole marsh appeared at the surface of the near creek zone x 10 m fig 6b the temperature standard deviations in the shallow soil layers were also remarkable for the near creek zone fig 6c and 6d it was attributed to meteorological fluctuations the soil water content of the near creek zone was relatively high and the evaporative flux reached the maximum 3 42 10 3 m3 m2 d within the creek marsh section fig 7 thus le and h were important for the near creek zone reached 100 and 65 w m2 respectively however a long duration inundation in the creek inhibited the sediment atmosphere heat flux i e le h and rn periodic tidal inundation conductively transferred heat to the marsh resulting in a bimodal distribution of the conductive heat flux curve for the tidal creek zone fig 8 the sediment water heat exchange 7 24 w m2 of the creek bottom x 0 m was inhibited due to the decreased temperature difference in addition obvious porewater circulations from the near creek zone to the tidal creek were found on the one hand tidal water rapidly infiltrated the soil via the marsh surface of the near creek zone and the creek banks importing heat into the soil on the other hand porewater from deeper soil layers discharged into the creek exporting heat the lower sandy loam layer could prolong porewater flow paths and increase heat exchange with the hotter soil layer with the hotter tidal water and hotter deep soil porewater circulations weakened the temperature gradients and associated standard deviations in the shallow soil layer of the near creek zone fig 6b and 6d the process produced considerable hydrodynamic exchange and associated heat fluxes across the sediment water interface figs 7 and 8 the maximum hydrodynamic exchange rate appeared at the creek bottom efflux of 0 06 m3 m2 d x 0 m the associated heat efflux of the creek bottom was 27 50 w m2 reaching 380 of the conductive heat influx the results suggest that tide induced porewater circulations could facilitate heat loss from salt marshes in winter for the low elevation and sloping zone x 160 to 20 m the vertical temperature gradients and associated standard deviations in the shallow soil layers were smaller than those in the other zones fig 6b and 6d the porewater flow and hydrodynamic exchange were also not significant in the low elevation and sloping zone the temperature distributions and variations were strongly related to the inundation duration the lowest location was constantly inundated and tt determined the marsh surface temperature heat was vertically transported from the deeper soil layers to surface water fig 8 inundation duration was shortened with the higher marsh surface elevation as the marsh surface elevated the hydrodynamic exchange rates and evaporation fluxes were gradually enhanced contributing to the variations of vertical temperature gradients and associated standard deviations for example le changed from 0 to 94 w m2 as x changed from 160 to 20 m fig 8 subsequently we averaged the simulated temperature within the upper 30 cm soil layer tup and tested the pearson correlation with the estuarine and meteorological factors note that the pearson correlation coefficient r can only evaluate linear relationship the calculation is in supporting information significant linear correlations between tup and ta tt were demonstrated and the trends were different for the three zones fig 9a for the high elevation marsh platform zone tup was highly correlated with ta r 0 90 and the correlations between tup and tt were weak due to the small inundation frequency the correlations between tup and tt t up and t a were significantly changed with the marsh topography for the near creek zone a higher correlation r 0 87 between tup and tt was found for the creek bottom for the low elevation and sloping zone the r between tup and tt could reach 0 99 the relationship between tup and ta decreased as the surface elevation declined fig 9a the linear correlations between tup and the other factors e g relative humidity were much weaker fig 9b these correlations well supported the results of the three characteristic soil temperature zones the high elevation marsh platform zone the near creek zone and the low elevation and sloping zone 3 3 sensitivity analysis in this section we tested the effect of soil hydraulic conductivity and soil thermal conductivity on temperature distributions and variations compared with the base case the hydraulic conductivity was increased to 3 and 9 times kup 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s kup klow 0 1 respectively for the soil thermal conductivity λ s 0 4 and 2 4 j m c s were selected while the other parameters and boundary conditions remained unchanged the simulation results were averaged over 30 days with the different hydraulic conductivities similar temperature distributions were found in the high elevation marsh platform zones fig 10 this suggests that the effect of porewater flow on the marsh platform zone was not significant similarly no apparent temperature difference was found in the low elevation and sloping zone for the two cases kup 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s for the low elevation and sloping zone the net heat fluxes slightly changed fig 11b as kup increased from 2 31 10 6 to 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s the total heat effluxes from x 160 to 20 m decreased by 2 and 6 respectively for the high elevation marsh platform zone the evaporation induced water uptake was less influenced by the change in hydraulic conductivity in contrast the infiltration rate changed obviously over the inundation period increasing the variation of net heat flux compared with the base case kup 2 31 10 6 m s the kup of 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s respectively led to the relative decrease of 3 and 14 for the total heat efflux from x 20 to 40 m with a large hydraulic conductivity the tide induced porewater flow was significantly enhanced as kup increased from 2 31 10 6 to 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s the maximum water efflux at x 0 m enhanced by 93 and 549 respectively fig 11a similarly the water influx across the near creek zone increased with the increase in porewater velocity more heat was imported from the surface of the near creek zone and exported to the creek overall the larger hydraulic conductivity increased hydrodynamic exchange inducing more heat loss from the salt marsh in winter this heat transport dynamics caused a pronounced temperature variation for the near creek zone fig 10 as the hydraulic conductivity increased the enhanced heat transport and mixing resulted in lower temperature gradients and larger standard deviations in addition the temperature change of the marsh surface affected the sediment water atmosphere heat exchange e g the sensible heat flux and the net heat flux the maximum heat efflux increased by 71 and 456 respectively for kup 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s in comparison with kup 2 31 10 6 m s fig 11b with the increase of λ s from 0 4 to 2 4 j m c s the temperature distributions in the high elevation marsh platform zones and the low elevation and sloping zones were significantly altered fig 12 the vertical temperature gradients were reduced for the two zones due to relatively rapid heat conduction for example compared with λ s 0 4 j m c s the vertical temperature gradients within the upper 30 cm soil layers of x 130 and 30 m decreased by 38 and 33 for λ s 2 4 j m c s respectively the associated temperature standard deviation was enhanced with the larger λ s the net water fluxes in the two zones overlapped for different λ s fig 13a for the high elevation marsh platform zone the heat efflux was increased with larger λ s fig 13b the total heat efflux from x 20 to 40 m of λ s 1 4 and 2 4 j m c s respectively increased by 68 and 122 in comparison with λ s 0 4 j m c s for the low elevation and sloping zone the effect of λ s on sediment water heat exchange was gradually strengthened as the marsh elevation declined as λ s increased from 0 4 to 1 4 and 2 4 j m c s the total heat efflux from x 160 to 20 m enhanced by 65 and 112 respectively this suggests that larger λ s could significantly strengthen thermal impact of estuarine and or meteorological conditions on the high elevation marsh zone and the low elevation and sloping zone similar to the other zones the vertical temperature gradient for the near creek zone was reduced the associated temperature standard deviation was increased fig 12 the λ s could affect the net heat flux of the near creek zone fig 13b as λ s increased from 0 4 to 1 4 and 2 4 j m c s the total heat effluxes from x 20 to 20 m increased by 46 and 82 respectively for the tidal creek the heat flux caused by hydrodynamic exchange was more pronounced than that caused by the other heat exchange processes the maximum heat efflux was slightly changed with different λ s compared with that with λ s of 0 4 j m c s those with λ s 1 4 and 2 4 j m c s increased by 2 and 4 respectively these results suggest that hydrodynamic exchange weakened the effect of λ s on the near creek zone 4 discussion recently alber and o connell 2019 pointed out that a high surface elevation could lead to a low soil temperature in salt marshes this study considered a field transect with mildly changed topography for salt marshes with distributed tidal creeks tide induced porewater circulations and evaporation induced heat uptake play important roles in determining the soil temperature of near creek zone from our investigation the daily average soil temperature for the high elevation marsh platform x 32 m was higher than that for the near creek zone x 5 m we attribute this to evaporation relying on soil moisture the near creek zone with high soil moisture could support a high evaporation rate thus removing more heat and decreasing the soil temperature of marsh surface this demonstrates importance of tidal creeks on soil temperature distributions moreover the commonly distributed macropores e g crab burrows in salt marshes could regulate tide induced water exchange and contribute to heat exchange xiao et al 2017 xin et al 2009 it is well known that temperature affects surface hydrological processes e g evapotranspiration in salt marshes huang et al 2019 moffett et al 2010 soil temperature also modifies fluid viscosity and density anderson 2005 affecting porewater flow our results showed significant temperature gradients for different soil depths variations of soil temperature in salt marshes are determined by periodic tidal inundation and sediment atmosphere heat exchange spatial and temporal temperature contrasts would affect porewater flow and salt transport thus altering soil conditions e g soil aeration condition and porewater salinity if air and soil temperature rises due to climate change soil evaporation and porewater velocity in salt marshes may be enhanced this may modify associated salinity distributions temperature distributions and variations along creek marsh sections likely regulate plant growth and distributions in salt marshes for high elevation marsh platform zones day and night temperature contrasts in shallow soil layers are relatively larger this likely affects net photosynthesis and plant biomass we observed that the density and height of phragmites australis were higher in the high elevation marsh platform than those in the near creek zone at our field site consistent with the field investigation from wu et al 2020 this phenomenon could be related to day and night temperature contrasts in shallow soil layers of salt marshes we suggest that sea level rise would increase the frequency of marsh inundation around spring high tidal levels decreasing diurnal temperature contrasts this would affect plant growth in salt marshes marsh temperature variations also impact coastal biogeochemistry hicks et al 2018 for low elevation and sloping zones tidal inundation weakened diurnal temperature variations in shallow soil layers caused by meteorological fluctuations this may create a moderate habitat and refuge for biological communities ayvazian et al 1992 karisallen et al 2022 for near creek zones tide induced porewater circulations are remarkable in winter it could transport warm porewater into creeks the hydrodynamically supported thermal buffering provides moderate creek conditions for temperature sensitive fauna temperature changes in salt marshes due to extreme weather events may induce migration of biological communities soil temperature in salt marshes controls microbial activities and biogeochemical reaction rates hicks et al 2018 kirwan et al 2014 previous studies revealed that surface water groundwater interaction increases the reaction of oxic tidal water and organic rich sediments in salt marshes and discharges significant nutrients and carbon to the coastal environment wilson and morris 2012 xin et al 2022 a higher soil temperature may increase the mineralization potential of organic carbon and change carbon outwelling influencing coastal and atmospheric carbon budgets lewis et al 2014 our investigation showed that the temperature distributions and variations in the three zones were different in winter the relatively high sediment temperature in the near creek zone would increase biogeochemical reaction rates therefore understanding coastal biogeochemistry in salt marshes should consider coupled thermodynamic and hydrodynamic processes 5 conclusions we have examined the temperature distributions and variations in an estuarine creek marsh section subjected to surface water groundwater interaction radiation input latent heat and sensible heat exchange based on our results the following conclusions could be drawn 1 periodic tidal fluctuations induce water and heat exchange modifying diurnal temperature variations in salt marshes caused by meteorological fluctuations particularly for shallow soil layers the vertical temperature gradients and associated standard deviations in low elevation salt marshes decrease as tidal inundation frequency increases 2 three characteristic soil temperature zones are identified along the creek marsh section a high elevation marsh platform zone with diurnal temperature variation influenced by meteorological fluctuations a near creek zone where tide induced porewater circulations significantly contribute to soil temperature and heat flux and a low elevation and sloping zone where sediment atmosphere heat exchange decreases with the reduced marsh elevation 3 sediment property could impact heat exchange and soil temperature a larger soil hydraulic conductivity enhances the porewater circulation and heat transport for the near creek zone thus reducing the temperature gradients and increasing the temperature standard deviations an increased soil thermal conductivity intensifies the vertical heat exchange across sediment water atmosphere interface enhancing impact of estuarine and meteorological conditions it should be pointed out that our field investigation was carried out in winter the meteorological conditions soil evaporation and plant transpiration are different from those in summer these affect the latent and sensible heat fluxes how soil temperature behaves in summer and at an annual scale needs further investigation nevertheless this study reveals thermodynamics and temperature variations in creek marsh systems which will help to improve our understanding of

57,soil temperature is an important environmental factor affecting biogeochemical processes in salt marshes and further wetland ecological functions this study conducted field investigation and numerical simulations to examine temperature distributions and variations in a creek marsh section subjected to estuarine and meteorological forcing conditions the results showed that periodic tidal inundation induced water and heat exchange across sediment water interfaces and thus modified diurnal temperature variations in shallow soil layers caused by meteorological fluctuations the combination of periodic tidal inundation and sediment atmosphere heat exchange led to the formation of three characteristic soil temperature zones along the creek marsh section a high elevation marsh zone with diurnal temperature variations influenced by meteorological fluctuations a near creek zone where tide induced porewater circulations regulated soil temperatures and a low elevation and sloping zone where sediment atmosphere heat exchange decreased with the reduced marsh elevation sensitivity analyses demonstrated that a larger hydraulic conductivity facilitated the porewater circulation and heat transport in the near creek zone enhancing temperature fluctuations an increased soil thermal conductivity intensified vertical heat exchange across sediment water atmosphere interfaces and increased the effect of estuarine and meteorological conditions on soil temperature this study highlights the importance of surface water groundwater interaction on temperature variations and helps to understand thermodynamics dependent biogeochemical processes in salt marshes keywords wetland tide surface water groundwater interaction dynamics heat conduction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction salt marshes have numerous ecological functions such as maintaining estuarine coastal biodiversity teixeira et al 2014 improving water quality verhoeven et al 2006 and sequestering blue carbon chmura et al 2003 due to human activities and climate change many salt marshes worldwide suffer from degradation and loss xin et al 2022 therefore preserving and restoring salt marsh ecosystems have gained increasing global attention marsh ecological functions depend on surface water groundwater interaction caused primarily by periodic tidal fluctuations guimond and tamborski 2021 xin et al 2022 for example surface water and groundwater with different and variable temperatures jointly affect soil temperature in salt marshes moffett et al 2008 which is a controlling factor for physical and biogeochemical processes warmer soils may increase plant productivity kirwan et al 2009 and the rate of belowground carbon accumulation kirwan and mudd 2012 smith et al 2022 temperature also regulates microbial activities in salt marshes e g soil respiration and decomposition spivak et al 2019 wang et al 2021 tidal fluctuations cause marsh soils to be periodically inundated and exposed the frequency and duration of tidal inundation depend on the relative difference between the local surface water level and marsh surface elevation harvey et al 1987 hemond et al 1984 for near creek zones with marked elevation changes hydrodynamic exchange i e rapid and transient water exchange is pronounced due to dynamic tidal fluctuations gardner and wilson 2006 xin et al 2012 during rising tides surface water can vertically infiltrate into submerged marsh platforms and near creek zones porewater seeps from creek banks and bottoms when tides ebb off marsh surface wilson and gardner 2006 wilson and morris 2012 this process leads to near creek water circulations in addition tides determine variations of groundwater heads and soil water saturations in salt marshes xiao et al 2017 affecting evapotranspiration including evaporation and plant transpiration and rainfall induced infiltration xin et al 2022 xin et al 2017 examined porewater flow in a two dimensional creek marsh system subjected to spring neap tides evaporation and rainfall the results suggested that evaporation and rainfall dominate porewater flow and soil conditions i e soil water saturation and porewater salinity in the interior zone whereas tidal fluctuations significantly regulate porewater flow and soil conditions in the near creek zone xin et al 2017 therefore it is expected that the combination of tides evapotranspiration and rainfall may also affect the thermal regime of salt marshes the energy balance in exposed salt marshes can be described as follows moffett et al 2010 1 r n g h l e where rn is the net radiation flux le and h are the turbulent fluxes of latent heat required heat flux for soil evaporation and plant transpiration and sensible heat transferred heat flux due to temperature contrast between sediment and air respectively g is the soil heat flux across soil surface clearly this model is vertically zero dimensional and overlooks heat exchange at a spatial scale in salt marshes tidal inundation events regulate sediment atmosphere heat exchange surface water groundwater interaction could change heat transport in salt marshes huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 this induces variations in temperature distributions of salt marshes moffett et al 2010 redfield 1965 vitale et al 2014 piccolo et al 1993 pointed out that temperature variations in intertidal zones are typically driven by tidal and radiation fluctuations moffett et al 2008 conducted continuous temperature measurements in tidal creek beds in salt marshes and found that tide induced water exchange increases sediment temperature under warmer tidal temperature alber and o connell 2019 recently investigated soil surface temperature in a coastal marsh using field observations and remote sensing image interpretation the results demonstrated that soil surface temperature is negatively correlated with marsh elevation under both flooded and exposed conditions the inundation depth and duration hold the key to influencing the extent of sediment atmosphere heat exchange moffett et al 2010 temperature of shallow intertidal sediment is closer to air temperature during neap tides relative to spring tides cho et al 2005 guarini et al 1997 serôdio and catarino 1999 these studies focused on soil surface temperature it remains unclear how porewater hydrodynamic processes change heat transport and further soil temperature in salt marshes under estuarine and meteorological forcing conditions we conducted field investigation and numerical simulations to examine the temperature distributions and variations in an estuarine creek marsh section perpendicular to the yangtze river china investigation on hydraulic heads and soil temperatures at different sediment depths was carried out for 30 days based on the results the following research questions are addressed 1 how does periodic tidal inundation affect soil temperatures at different locations of salt marshes 2 are there any characteristic soil temperature zones along the creek marsh system 3 how do hydraulic conductivity and soil thermal conductivity modify temperature distributions and variations 2 methods 2 1 field investigation the field site is located in the jiuduansha wetland formed in the yangtze estuary china 31 12 n and 121 53 e fig 1a the jiuduansha wetland is vegetated by scirpus mariqueter spartina alterniflora and phragmites australis this wetland is significantly affected by the runoff of the yangtze river and the oceanic forcing of the east china sea it was reported that the maximum tidal range reaches 4 62 m for the yangtze estuary huang and zhang 2007 the mean annual temperature is around 17 3ºc and the average temperature in winter is around 5 6ºc zhang et al 2015 the borehole drilling tests showed that the sediment composition in the jiuduansha wetland is silt loam overlying sandy loam this stratigraphy is similar to many salt marshes worldwide xin et al 2022 a 200 m creek marsh section perpendicular to the yangtze river was selected to conduct the field investigation fig 1 the creek width and depth were respectively around 11 and 2 m the near creek and high elevation platform zones were vegetated with scirpus mariqueter and phragmites australis the gps rtk real time kinematic method was used to measure the marsh surface elevation from 1 78 to 2 49 m fig 1d six sets of distributed monitoring probes for hydraulic head and soil temperatures fig 1c were installed close to the tidal creek from x 32 to 19 m fig 1b for each monitoring probe six soil temperatures at different depths using pt1000 manlun hardware and a pressure head using hm21r nanjing hong mu technology could be measured a total of 33 soil temperatures and six groundwater heads were observed as presented in fig 1d an integrated automatic weather station includes multi parameter weather sensor wxt536 4 component net radiometer nr01 and heat flux plate hfp01 was installed close to the monitoring probe at x 32 m the tidal level and tidal water temperature tt were observed at a station near the field site 31 14 n and 122 00 e the measured data of 30 days from december 7 2021 to january 6 2022 were used in this study the recording interval was 600 s fig 2 during this period the highest and lowest tidal levels were respectively 2 59 and 1 62 m fig 2a a significant diurnal variation of air temperature ta was observed in contrast the tidal water temperature was stable and showed a slight downward trend fig 2b the mean values of ta and tt were 8 48 and 12 27 c respectively the average net radiation was 34 27 w m2 and the overall relative humidity was high around 72 the average wind speed and atmospheric pressure were 2 63 m s and 102 6 kpa respectively fig 2d and 2e we didn t observe any rainfall during this period on september 8 2021 slug tests were conducted at three locations parallel to the creek marsh section this method is commonly used to estimate in situ soil hydraulic conductivity kuang et al 2020 using the kgs kansas geological survey model hyder et al 1994 the estimated lateral hydraulic conductivities at x 13 13 and 24 m were respectively 3 1 10 6 2 67 10 6 and 1 16 10 6 m s the measured vertical hydraulic conductivity was 2 03 10 6 m s using the double ring infiltration method gregory et al 2005 soil samples were obtained using a ring knife and afterwards dried at 105 c the measured soil porosity was 0 39 the saturated soil thermal conductivity was 1 4 j m c s using the tempos thermal properties analyzer marsh porewater was sampled using a peristaltic pump via a push point sampler for salinity along the field transect at soil depths of 1 and 2 m the results showed a relatively low porewater salinity average of 3 6 ppt parts per thousand similar to the previous investigation on the same wetland hu et al 2016 2 2 numerical simulations to complement the field investigation we also conducted numerical simulations with consideration of the observed creek marsh section and boundary conditions fig 1d a layered soil configuration an upper silt loam soil layer and a lower sandy loam soil layer was considered in the model and a 1 m thickness was set for the lower layer the surface elevation of the domain was interpolated based on our in situ point elevation measurements sutra ms hughes and sanford 2005 a variably saturated and density dependent porewater flow model coupled with heat transport was used in this study in sutra ms porewater flow is described by the richards equation richards 1931 the relative hydraulic conductivity and soil water saturation in the vadose zone are calculated using the formulas from van genuchten 1980 heat transport in sutra ms is based on the advection dispersion equation according to hughes and sanford 2005 fluid density and viscosity depend on fluid temperature the details of governing equations for the model are given in supporting information during our observation period the measured salinities of porewater and tidal water changed between 0 6 and 7 34 ppt we conducted a numerical test with this salinity difference considered likely induce density driven flow the results showed that the effect of salinity difference on porewater flow and temperature distributions was negligible therefore we didn t consider salt transport in the model so as to focus on heat transport and soil temperatures the bottom left and right sides of the model domain were treated as no flow boundaries similar to many previous studies e g shen et al 2018 wilson and gardner 2006 xin et al 2017 xu et al 2021 dynamic sediment water and or sediment atmosphere interfaces were considered for the marsh surface the switch of the two interfaces depended on the time variable tidal level for submerged boundary nodes the nodal hydrostatic pressure was specified according to the local thickness of overlying water heat fluxes were transferred across sediment water interfaces by heat convection and conduction pivato et al 2018 the radiative heat flux was assumed to be zero when the nodes were submerged by tides for exposed boundary nodes if the nodes were saturated at the previous time step a seepage face with the atmospheric pressure was assigned otherwise the exposed nodes were specified as a flux boundary according to soil evaporation the evaporative flux based on a bulk aerodynamic approach as adopted in previous studies e g bittelli et al 2008 geng and boufadel 2015 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 was coupled into the model as fluid sinks the instantaneous meteorological data and the soil saturation of sediment surface were considered to calculate the evaporative flux this evaporative flux was then converted to the latent heat flux le using the volumetric latent heat of vaporization the energy balance eq 1 was adopted to integrate le h and rn and coupled into the groundwater model as heat sources sinks the details of equations used in soil evaporation and energy calculations are given in supporting information the measured soil porosity ϕ 0 39 and saturated thermal conductivity λ s 1 4 j m c s were used in the simulations in the base case the averaged lateral hydraulic conductivity kup 2 31 10 6 m s estimated from the slug tests was adopted as the hydraulic conductivity of the upper soil layer the hydraulic conductivity of the lower soil layer klow was set to 2 31 10 5 m s one order of magnitude larger than that for the upper layer the residual water saturation was set to 0 1 for both the upper and lower soil layers carsel and parrish 1988 the suggested values of water retention parameters in carsel and parrish 1988 were used for the two soil layers αup 2 0 m 1 and nup 1 41 αlow 7 5 m 1 and nlow 1 89 furthermore we conducted sensitivity analyses on soil hydraulic conductivity kup 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s and soil thermal conductivity λ s 0 4 and 2 4 j m c s the hydraulic conductivity ratio of the upper to lower layer remained unchanged set to 1 10 the specific heats of fluid and solid matrix were set to 4 182 j kg c and 840 j kg c respectively engineering toolbox 2003 the fluid thermal conductivity was 0 6 j m c s anderson 2005 a mesh with a uniform discretization in the x direction δx 0 5 m and a various discretization in the z direction δz 0 04 to 0 20 m with the upper subdomain refined was used the total number of mesh nodes was 12 431 the measured estuarine and meteorological data were adopted as boundary conditions for the marsh surface fig 2 using the distributions generated according to the observed pressure heads and soil temperatures as initial conditions the model considering water and heat fluxes across sediment water atmosphere interfaces was run for three days firstly from december 4 2021 to december 6 2021 this 3 day simulation was used to spin up the porewater flow and heat transport model then the simulation continued from december 7 2021 to january 6 2022 with a time step of 300 s 3 results 3 1 hydraulic heads and soil temperatures from field investigation we first examined the 30 day hydraulic head variations at the different locations from the six pressure transducers in response to tidal fluctuations the marsh surface elevations on the left side of the tidal creek were relatively low and the three locations were frequently inundated x 19 and z 0 93 m x 13 and z 1 19 m x 5 and z 1 40 m respectively the averaged hydraulic heads over 30 days at the three locations displayed a declining trend toward the yangtze river 0 85 0 89 0 94 m respectively for x 19 13 and 5 m overall the variations of the three hydraulic heads were similar fig 3a during the rising tides tidal water overtopped the marsh surface and recharged the low elevation zone the hydraulic heads at the three locations increased following the rising tides without delay a slight delay of hydraulic heads in response to tides was detected during the ebb tides and inundating period when the locations were exposed the hydraulic heads gradually differed from the tidal levels the results suggest that the variations of groundwater heads on the left side x 0 were predominantly controlled by tides the high elevation marsh surface on the right side x 0 was less inundated by tides and the observation results at the three locations marsh surface locations of x 13 and z 1 91 m x 24 and z 2 46 m x 32 and z 2 38 m respectively differed the averaged hydraulic heads for x 13 24 and 32 m were 1 20 1 11 and 1 05 m respectively it displayed a declining trend towards the marsh interior zone this was due to the pronounced difference in tidal inundation frequency at x 13 m the marsh surface was flooded 12 times the total inundation duration was shorter than that on the left side fig 3b the response of the hydraulic head at x 13 m to tidal fluctuations was delayed with a decreased peak this was because tidal signals usually propagated to the location through marsh soil for x 24 and 32 m the marsh surface elevations were around the spring high tidal level and the locations were inundated twice the local tidal inundation could elevate the hydraulic heads fig 3b for example hydraulic heads were elevated by 0 93 and 1 02 m during the spring high tide on january 5 2022 respectively for x 24 and 32 m from x 13 to 24 and 32 m tide induced porewater flow became smaller and the impact of tides on hydraulic heads was weakened therefore delayed watertable fluctuations and decreased fluctuation ranges were found as the lateral distance to the tidal creek increased we obtained the 30 day results for the soil temperatures at different depths and locations as the observation was conducted in winter the temperatures for the six locations increased with soil depths x 19 13 5 13 24 and 32 m for example at x 32 m the 30 day averaged soil temperatures were 12 03 13 63 14 35 15 44 16 41 and 16 76 c respectively for z 2 22 1 87 1 52 1 17 0 82 and 0 47 m furthermore as the shallow soil layer was readily affected by estuarine and meteorological fluctuations the shallow soil temperatures fluctuated distinctly whereas the deeper soil temperatures were relatively stable this depth dependent dampening response to meteorological and or estuarine conditions was consistent with previous field investigation cho et al 2005 piccolo et al 1993 three representative marsh locations x 32 5 and 19 m were further selected to show difference in temperature variations fig 4 overall the soil temperatures gradually decreased in early winter for x 32 m with the high elevation the soil temperature was less affected by estuarine tides the impact of meteorological conditions could be easily observed the results from the highest transducer 0 16 m depth to the marsh surface clearly showed the diurnal variation of soil temperature similar to the ta fluctuation fig 4a the maximum and minimum soil temperatures at the depth generally appeared in the morning and evening respectively it differed from the ta variation maximum and minimum temperatures appeared in the afternoon and at night a cold event occurred during december 24 26 2021 and ta continuously dropped from 14 4 to 1 2 c this decreased the soil temperatures at the different depths 0 16 to 1 91 m of x 32 m fig 4a the response of 0 16 m soil depth was most pronounced with a temperature drop of 3 71 c interestingly we observed that the temperatures in the six depths dropped abruptly on january 5 2022 fig 4a on this day cold tidal water about 10 2 c inundated the high elevation marsh platform the tide induced infiltration distinctly lowered the soil temperature furthermore the decreased soil temperature was also related to the abrupt drop of ta from 10 7 to 9 3 c in one hour for x 5 m soil temperatures at five different depths were obtained on the whole the measured soil temperatures at x 5 m were lower than those at x 32 m the fluctuation ranges of temperatures at x 5 m were also smaller fig 4a and 4b it is noteworthy that the diurnal temperature variation of the 0 16 m soil depth for x 5 m was not as obvious as the high elevation marsh platform e g x 32 m we attributed this to the periodic tidal inundation for example during the night of december 7 2021 from 0 00 to 2 20 tidal water inundated the marsh surface at x 5 m hotter tidal water regulated heat dissipation of the sediment tides heated the colder sediment leading to a temperature rise for the 0 16 m depth soil layer during the inundation period the temperature change at x 5 m was different from that at x 32 m fig 4a and 4b in addition tt was usually lower than soil surface temperature in winter afternoons for the afternoon inundation on december 10 2021 tidal water regulated heat absorption of sediment from atmosphere and decreased the range of temperature rise compared to the exposed marsh platform the results suggest that tides could induce bi directional heat exchange for the marsh soil in winter for the cold event on december 24 26 2021 we found that the temperature drop of the 0 16 m soil depth at x 5 m was less than that at x 32 m 2 88 c in comparison with 3 71 c as shown by the relatively frequent fluctuation curves throughout the cold event fig 4a in comparison with 4b the impact of periodic tidal inundation on the soil temperature at the location x 5 m and z 1 24 m was significant we also found an abruptly dropped temperature on january 5 2022 for x 5 m different from x 32 m the soil temperatures at x 5 m rapidly rose with less delay these variations could be attributed to the tide induced porewater circulation and sediment water heat exchange i e heat conduction due to the temperature contrast between sediment and water for x 19 m both the inundation frequency and duration were larger than that for the other locations of monitoring probes the observation results showed that the mean temperature in the shallow soil layer at x 19 m was lower than that at x 32 m in contrast the mean temperature in the deeper soil layer at x 19 m was higher the diurnal temperature variation of the 0 12 m soil depth at x 19 m was also less evident than that at x 32 m fig 4c this suggests that periodic tidal inundation modified the impact of meteorological fluctuations on soil temperatures with long duration inundation the amount of sediment water heat exchange was expected to be larger during inundation periods this would reduce the temperature contrasts between tidal water and near surface soil layers when the temperature contrast was small the inundation thermally insulated the marsh soil and weakened the impact of meteorological fluctuations as tides ebbed off the marsh surface the shallow soil temperatures e g x 19 m and z 0 79 m significantly dropped this temperature drop would be intensified by the large evaporation induced heat uptake given a high soil water content during december 24 26 2021 a significant temperature drop caused by the cold event and a temperature rise caused by tides were found for the location x 19 m and z 0 79 m similar to x 5 m 3 2 temperature distributions and heat transport in salt marshes firstly we validated the numerical model against the 30 day field observation hydraulic heads soil heat flux and soil temperatures the comparisons between simulated and observed hydraulic heads are shown in fig s1 of supporting information we used root mean square error rmse to measure the difference between simulated and observed values the results demonstrated that the simulated heads on the right side x 0 were in close agreement with the observed heads the rmse values were 0 13 0 15 and 0 17 m respectively for x 19 13 and 5 m for the left side of the tidal creek the simulated head at x 13 m also well captured the observed variation whereas the heads at x 24 and 32 m could only follow the long term trends the differences between simulated and observed heads might be related to crab burrows distributed in the field site crab burrows may induce preferential flow increasing variations of hydraulic heads in response to tides xin et al 2009 xu et al 2021 further we validated the simulated soil heat flux and multiple soil temperatures against the observation overall the simulation results well captured the variations of soil heat flux and temperatures figs s2 and s3 the rmse for the soil heat flux was 52 15 w m2 the observation from the upper two temperature transducers was used to validate the model the results showed that the validation for the deeper soil layer was better than that for the shallow one fig s3 overall the model reasonably reproduced the observed hydrodynamic and thermodynamic processes we compared the instantaneous temperature distributions between the investigation and simulation fig 5 initially midnight of december 7 2021 the tide 1 46 m water level and 14 c could heat the marsh soil on the left side the temperatures in the shallow soil layers were lower than those in the deeper soil layers this led to vertical heat transport in the salt marsh at 13 00 on december 10 2021 the radiation was relatively intense and ta was higher than the soil surface temperature the exposed marsh surface was heated and thus formed a downward thermal front fig 5c and 5d the vertical temperature gradient was relatively large for the shallow soil layer for example the simulation results showed a 6 c temperature contrast within the top 20 cm thickness at x 13 m fig 5d for the submerged marsh from x 160 to 60 m the temperatures were monotonously increased with soil depth during the rising tide porewater and associated heat flowed towards the deeper soil layer however the downward temperature gradients could induce conductive heat transport from the deeper soil layers to surface water for the submerged marsh from x 60 to 20 m we also found a prominent downward thermal front near the marsh surface fig 5d at 1 00 on december 14 2021 ta was 6 9 c and hotter tidal water 13 91 c ebbed off the marsh surface the heat was transported from the deeper soil layers to the tidal creek following porewater flow it sustained a relatively high temperature for the tidal creek under low ta fig 5f simultaneously heat could be transported vertically from the deeper soil layers to overlying water for the marsh from x 160 to 95 m for the exposed high elevation marsh the surface temperatures were low and large vertical temperature gradients were produced fig 5f this suggests that significant heat exchange occurred across the sediment atmosphere interface whereas for the locations from x 95 to 20 m exposed low elevation marsh the vertical temperature gradients near the marsh surface were less significant than those of the exposed high elevation marsh it was attributed to thermal insulation over the inundation period we also recorded soil temperature distributions and variations for the cold event during december 24 26 2021 the similar tidal levels during the rising tide were selected fig 5g 5j before the cold event the tidal water overlaid the low elevation marsh and maintained the shallow soil temperature for the exposed high elevation marsh vertical temperature gradients in the shallow soil layers were not evident fig 5g and 5h however after the cold event both the observation and simulation results displayed remarkable vertical temperature gradients in the shallow soil layers fig 5i and 5j furthermore the low elevation marshes with short duration inundations were also affected the cold event could significantly lower the shallow soil temperatures even with the insulating effect of overlying water for the creek bottom and bank the soil temperatures were less influenced by the cold event due to relatively hot porewater discharge the temperature distribution under a spring high tide submerging the whole creek marsh section was also shown fig 5k and 5l the tt was relatively low 9 81 c but the surface temperature of high elevation marsh platform was higher due to meteorological forcing conditions it can be found that the shallow soil temperatures for the near creek zone were similar to tt however the shallow soil temperatures were still higher than tt for the low elevation marshes with long duration inundations fig 5l the results demonstrated different heat transport dynamics for the high elevation marsh platform the near creek zone including the tidal creek and the low elevation and sloping zone to further explore differences among the three zones we calculated the 30 day averaged temperature distributions and associated standard deviations fig 6 the temperature distributions changed significantly with the marsh topography as expected the vertical temperature gradients and associated standard deviations in the shallow soil layers were larger than those in the deeper soil layers the high elevation marsh platform x 20 to 40 m was relatively flat and was only inundated twice diurnal meteorological fluctuations led to significant temperature standard deviations in the shallow soil layers reached 5 36 c for the marsh surface due to the short duration inundation the water and heat exchange across the sediment water interface were close to zero figs 7 and 8 therefore soil evaporation dominated water flow in the marsh platform and heat was vertically transported evaporation induced water uptake affected the soil water saturation of the marsh surface the le induced by evaporation would decrease the soil temperatures near marsh surface this caused upward capillary flow providing water and heat for the marsh surface however the weak capillary flow could not support continuous soil evaporation limiting the evaporative flux and le across the sediment atmosphere interface a slightly decreased marsh elevation increased the soil water content due to capillarity thus the evaporative flux and le increased from x 20 to 40 m figs 7 and 8 heat loss due to evaporation would decrease the soil surface temperatures which affected the h variations the positive h indicated a heat influx to the marsh surface the absolute values of h were less than that of le for the marsh platform fig 8 the net heat flux within the marsh platform was negative suggesting that the heat was transferred from the deeper soil layers to atmosphere by soil evaporation the temperature variations of near creek zones from x 20 to 20 m were affected by sediment water atmosphere heat conduction and porewater flow the lowest marsh temperature 6 33 c within the whole marsh appeared at the surface of the near creek zone x 10 m fig 6b the temperature standard deviations in the shallow soil layers were also remarkable for the near creek zone fig 6c and 6d it was attributed to meteorological fluctuations the soil water content of the near creek zone was relatively high and the evaporative flux reached the maximum 3 42 10 3 m3 m2 d within the creek marsh section fig 7 thus le and h were important for the near creek zone reached 100 and 65 w m2 respectively however a long duration inundation in the creek inhibited the sediment atmosphere heat flux i e le h and rn periodic tidal inundation conductively transferred heat to the marsh resulting in a bimodal distribution of the conductive heat flux curve for the tidal creek zone fig 8 the sediment water heat exchange 7 24 w m2 of the creek bottom x 0 m was inhibited due to the decreased temperature difference in addition obvious porewater circulations from the near creek zone to the tidal creek were found on the one hand tidal water rapidly infiltrated the soil via the marsh surface of the near creek zone and the creek banks importing heat into the soil on the other hand porewater from deeper soil layers discharged into the creek exporting heat the lower sandy loam layer could prolong porewater flow paths and increase heat exchange with the hotter soil layer with the hotter tidal water and hotter deep soil porewater circulations weakened the temperature gradients and associated standard deviations in the shallow soil layer of the near creek zone fig 6b and 6d the process produced considerable hydrodynamic exchange and associated heat fluxes across the sediment water interface figs 7 and 8 the maximum hydrodynamic exchange rate appeared at the creek bottom efflux of 0 06 m3 m2 d x 0 m the associated heat efflux of the creek bottom was 27 50 w m2 reaching 380 of the conductive heat influx the results suggest that tide induced porewater circulations could facilitate heat loss from salt marshes in winter for the low elevation and sloping zone x 160 to 20 m the vertical temperature gradients and associated standard deviations in the shallow soil layers were smaller than those in the other zones fig 6b and 6d the porewater flow and hydrodynamic exchange were also not significant in the low elevation and sloping zone the temperature distributions and variations were strongly related to the inundation duration the lowest location was constantly inundated and tt determined the marsh surface temperature heat was vertically transported from the deeper soil layers to surface water fig 8 inundation duration was shortened with the higher marsh surface elevation as the marsh surface elevated the hydrodynamic exchange rates and evaporation fluxes were gradually enhanced contributing to the variations of vertical temperature gradients and associated standard deviations for example le changed from 0 to 94 w m2 as x changed from 160 to 20 m fig 8 subsequently we averaged the simulated temperature within the upper 30 cm soil layer tup and tested the pearson correlation with the estuarine and meteorological factors note that the pearson correlation coefficient r can only evaluate linear relationship the calculation is in supporting information significant linear correlations between tup and ta tt were demonstrated and the trends were different for the three zones fig 9a for the high elevation marsh platform zone tup was highly correlated with ta r 0 90 and the correlations between tup and tt were weak due to the small inundation frequency the correlations between tup and tt t up and t a were significantly changed with the marsh topography for the near creek zone a higher correlation r 0 87 between tup and tt was found for the creek bottom for the low elevation and sloping zone the r between tup and tt could reach 0 99 the relationship between tup and ta decreased as the surface elevation declined fig 9a the linear correlations between tup and the other factors e g relative humidity were much weaker fig 9b these correlations well supported the results of the three characteristic soil temperature zones the high elevation marsh platform zone the near creek zone and the low elevation and sloping zone 3 3 sensitivity analysis in this section we tested the effect of soil hydraulic conductivity and soil thermal conductivity on temperature distributions and variations compared with the base case the hydraulic conductivity was increased to 3 and 9 times kup 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s kup klow 0 1 respectively for the soil thermal conductivity λ s 0 4 and 2 4 j m c s were selected while the other parameters and boundary conditions remained unchanged the simulation results were averaged over 30 days with the different hydraulic conductivities similar temperature distributions were found in the high elevation marsh platform zones fig 10 this suggests that the effect of porewater flow on the marsh platform zone was not significant similarly no apparent temperature difference was found in the low elevation and sloping zone for the two cases kup 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s for the low elevation and sloping zone the net heat fluxes slightly changed fig 11b as kup increased from 2 31 10 6 to 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s the total heat effluxes from x 160 to 20 m decreased by 2 and 6 respectively for the high elevation marsh platform zone the evaporation induced water uptake was less influenced by the change in hydraulic conductivity in contrast the infiltration rate changed obviously over the inundation period increasing the variation of net heat flux compared with the base case kup 2 31 10 6 m s the kup of 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s respectively led to the relative decrease of 3 and 14 for the total heat efflux from x 20 to 40 m with a large hydraulic conductivity the tide induced porewater flow was significantly enhanced as kup increased from 2 31 10 6 to 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s the maximum water efflux at x 0 m enhanced by 93 and 549 respectively fig 11a similarly the water influx across the near creek zone increased with the increase in porewater velocity more heat was imported from the surface of the near creek zone and exported to the creek overall the larger hydraulic conductivity increased hydrodynamic exchange inducing more heat loss from the salt marsh in winter this heat transport dynamics caused a pronounced temperature variation for the near creek zone fig 10 as the hydraulic conductivity increased the enhanced heat transport and mixing resulted in lower temperature gradients and larger standard deviations in addition the temperature change of the marsh surface affected the sediment water atmosphere heat exchange e g the sensible heat flux and the net heat flux the maximum heat efflux increased by 71 and 456 respectively for kup 6 93 10 6 and 2 08 10 5 m s in comparison with kup 2 31 10 6 m s fig 11b with the increase of λ s from 0 4 to 2 4 j m c s the temperature distributions in the high elevation marsh platform zones and the low elevation and sloping zones were significantly altered fig 12 the vertical temperature gradients were reduced for the two zones due to relatively rapid heat conduction for example compared with λ s 0 4 j m c s the vertical temperature gradients within the upper 30 cm soil layers of x 130 and 30 m decreased by 38 and 33 for λ s 2 4 j m c s respectively the associated temperature standard deviation was enhanced with the larger λ s the net water fluxes in the two zones overlapped for different λ s fig 13a for the high elevation marsh platform zone the heat efflux was increased with larger λ s fig 13b the total heat efflux from x 20 to 40 m of λ s 1 4 and 2 4 j m c s respectively increased by 68 and 122 in comparison with λ s 0 4 j m c s for the low elevation and sloping zone the effect of λ s on sediment water heat exchange was gradually strengthened as the marsh elevation declined as λ s increased from 0 4 to 1 4 and 2 4 j m c s the total heat efflux from x 160 to 20 m enhanced by 65 and 112 respectively this suggests that larger λ s could significantly strengthen thermal impact of estuarine and or meteorological conditions on the high elevation marsh zone and the low elevation and sloping zone similar to the other zones the vertical temperature gradient for the near creek zone was reduced the associated temperature standard deviation was increased fig 12 the λ s could affect the net heat flux of the near creek zone fig 13b as λ s increased from 0 4 to 1 4 and 2 4 j m c s the total heat effluxes from x 20 to 20 m increased by 46 and 82 respectively for the tidal creek the heat flux caused by hydrodynamic exchange was more pronounced than that caused by the other heat exchange processes the maximum heat efflux was slightly changed with different λ s compared with that with λ s of 0 4 j m c s those with λ s 1 4 and 2 4 j m c s increased by 2 and 4 respectively these results suggest that hydrodynamic exchange weakened the effect of λ s on the near creek zone 4 discussion recently alber and o connell 2019 pointed out that a high surface elevation could lead to a low soil temperature in salt marshes this study considered a field transect with mildly changed topography for salt marshes with distributed tidal creeks tide induced porewater circulations and evaporation induced heat uptake play important roles in determining the soil temperature of near creek zone from our investigation the daily average soil temperature for the high elevation marsh platform x 32 m was higher than that for the near creek zone x 5 m we attribute this to evaporation relying on soil moisture the near creek zone with high soil moisture could support a high evaporation rate thus removing more heat and decreasing the soil temperature of marsh surface this demonstrates importance of tidal creeks on soil temperature distributions moreover the commonly distributed macropores e g crab burrows in salt marshes could regulate tide induced water exchange and contribute to heat exchange xiao et al 2017 xin et al 2009 it is well known that temperature affects surface hydrological processes e g evapotranspiration in salt marshes huang et al 2019 moffett et al 2010 soil temperature also modifies fluid viscosity and density anderson 2005 affecting porewater flow our results showed significant temperature gradients for different soil depths variations of soil temperature in salt marshes are determined by periodic tidal inundation and sediment atmosphere heat exchange spatial and temporal temperature contrasts would affect porewater flow and salt transport thus altering soil conditions e g soil aeration condition and porewater salinity if air and soil temperature rises due to climate change soil evaporation and porewater velocity in salt marshes may be enhanced this may modify associated salinity distributions temperature distributions and variations along creek marsh sections likely regulate plant growth and distributions in salt marshes for high elevation marsh platform zones day and night temperature contrasts in shallow soil layers are relatively larger this likely affects net photosynthesis and plant biomass we observed that the density and height of phragmites australis were higher in the high elevation marsh platform than those in the near creek zone at our field site consistent with the field investigation from wu et al 2020 this phenomenon could be related to day and night temperature contrasts in shallow soil layers of salt marshes we suggest that sea level rise would increase the frequency of marsh inundation around spring high tidal levels decreasing diurnal temperature contrasts this would affect plant growth in salt marshes marsh temperature variations also impact coastal biogeochemistry hicks et al 2018 for low elevation and sloping zones tidal inundation weakened diurnal temperature variations in shallow soil layers caused by meteorological fluctuations this may create a moderate habitat and refuge for biological communities ayvazian et al 1992 karisallen et al 2022 for near creek zones tide induced porewater circulations are remarkable in winter it could transport warm porewater into creeks the hydrodynamically supported thermal buffering provides moderate creek conditions for temperature sensitive fauna temperature changes in salt marshes due to extreme weather events may induce migration of biological communities soil temperature in salt marshes controls microbial activities and biogeochemical reaction rates hicks et al 2018 kirwan et al 2014 previous studies revealed that surface water groundwater interaction increases the reaction of oxic tidal water and organic rich sediments in salt marshes and discharges significant nutrients and carbon to the coastal environment wilson and morris 2012 xin et al 2022 a higher soil temperature may increase the mineralization potential of organic carbon and change carbon outwelling influencing coastal and atmospheric carbon budgets lewis et al 2014 our investigation showed that the temperature distributions and variations in the three zones were different in winter the relatively high sediment temperature in the near creek zone would increase biogeochemical reaction rates therefore understanding coastal biogeochemistry in salt marshes should consider coupled thermodynamic and hydrodynamic processes 5 conclusions we have examined the temperature distributions and variations in an estuarine creek marsh section subjected to surface water groundwater interaction radiation input latent heat and sensible heat exchange based on our results the following conclusions could be drawn 1 periodic tidal fluctuations induce water and heat exchange modifying diurnal temperature variations in salt marshes caused by meteorological fluctuations particularly for shallow soil layers the vertical temperature gradients and associated standard deviations in low elevation salt marshes decrease as tidal inundation frequency increases 2 three characteristic soil temperature zones are identified along the creek marsh section a high elevation marsh platform zone with diurnal temperature variation influenced by meteorological fluctuations a near creek zone where tide induced porewater circulations significantly contribute to soil temperature and heat flux and a low elevation and sloping zone where sediment atmosphere heat exchange decreases with the reduced marsh elevation 3 sediment property could impact heat exchange and soil temperature a larger soil hydraulic conductivity enhances the porewater circulation and heat transport for the near creek zone thus reducing the temperature gradients and increasing the temperature standard deviations an increased soil thermal conductivity intensifies the vertical heat exchange across sediment water atmosphere interface enhancing impact of estuarine and meteorological conditions it should be pointed out that our field investigation was carried out in winter the meteorological conditions soil evaporation and plant transpiration are different from those in summer these affect the latent and sensible heat fluxes how soil temperature behaves in summer and at an annual scale needs further investigation nevertheless this study reveals thermodynamics and temperature variations in creek marsh systems which will help to improve our understanding of

58,density driven convective mixing i e convective fingering has been identified to enhance co2 dissolution trapping in deep saline aquifers in this study a series of experiments in hele shaw cells were conducted and the effects of common impurities n2 o2 and or ar on the occurrence and development of the convective mixing process were compared and analyzed it is demonstrated that the existence of these impurities whether single or their mixture delayed the onset of convection however the subsequent fingering development including the mixing length and fingering footprint exhibited different patterns and trends depending on the species and compositions of the impurities the development and growth of the convective fingers displayed non monotonic characteristics as a function of the concentration of single impurity ar furthermore the multiple impurities containing ar had the potential to enhance the fingering development especially during the advanced stage other than these cases involving ar the inclusion of other impurities n2 and or o2 was found to weaken the fingering development compared with the pure co2 case nevertheless the results of dissolved co2 inventory suggested that the effects of different impurities at the same content both single and multiple might be similar to each other in the long term except for the three impurity case involving ar the laboratory experiments in the present study can help establishing a better understanding of the effects of multiple impurities in the application of impure co2 geological sequestration keywords carbon

injects it into geological reservoirs for sequestration bachu 2008 ccgs is believed as one of the important technologies that mitigate the emission load of the dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas co2 thus addressing the issue of global warming and other environmental hazards while allowing for the continued use of fossil fuels ipcc 2014 li et al 2021 among the various potential geological reservoirs deep saline aquifers have attracted vast attention because of their tremendous storage capacity and ubiquitous distribution around the world the trapping mechanisms in the deep saline aquifers mainly include static trapping capillary trapping dissolution trapping and mineral trapping jiang 2011 raza et al 2015 among them the dissolution trapping mechanism plays a significant role in storage security in the medium to long term and it also provides necessary conditions for the permanent mineral trapping mechanism alcalde et al 2018 the injected co2 streams tend to accumulate under the caprock because of buoyancy forces gradually the layer of free phase co2 would slowly diffuse and dissolve into the underlying formation brine the dissolution of co2 increases the density of brine at the gas liquid boundary by 0 1 1 depending on temperature pressure and salinity efika et al 2016 the density contrast between the co2 rich brine at the two phase boundary and the underlying co2 free brine is gravitationally unstable which is likely to induce the convective mixing process emami meybodi et al 2015 seyyedi et al 2016 in this case a pattern of dissolved co2 concentration resembling fingers will form and develop and thus the phenomenon is also called convective fingering the convective mixing process can significantly increase co2 dissolution rate into the formation brine consequently it is important to investigate the convective mixing of co2 dissolution so as to improve our understanding of the dissolution trapping mechanism in ccgs the majority of available investigations about the convective mixing process in ccgs have been focused on pure co2 e g emami meybodi et al 2015 hewitt 2020 however considering economic and environmental benefits the co2 streams injected into the reservoirs generally contain impurities e g n2 o2 ar ch4 h2s so2 ieaghg 2011 compared with co2 these non co2 species are implied to have different effects on the aqueous phase density when dissolved thus affecting the occurrence and development of the density driven fingering blair and quinn 1968 ennis king and paterson 2005 yu et al 2021 for example it is demonstrated that n2 dissolution would decrease the density increase caused by co2 dissolution leading to delayed convection and decreased co2 dissolution rate and the impact was enhanced with increasing n2 mole fraction however the impact of so2 was opposite to that of n2 li and jiang 2014 2015 li et al 2015 in general it is suggested that at low and moderate formation temperature 250 ºc the co injection of either n2 or h2s with co2 would lead to smaller density differences of brine and thus adverse effects on the convective mixing process yu et al 2021 furthermore the effects of o2 and ar on the convective mixing process were indicated to be similar to that of n2 also weakening the convective mixing process li and jiang 2020 li et al 2015 however it should be noted that the aforementioned numerical investigations li and jiang 2014 2015 li and jiang 2020 li et al 2015 yu et al 2021 generally neglected the difference of diffusion coefficient between co2 and impurities while the inclusion of impurities would actually affect the density profile and stability of the diffusive boundary layer jafari raad et al 2016 jafari raad and hassanzadeh 2015 jafari raad et al 2019 mahmoodpour et al 2018 2020 estimated the effective co2 diffusion coefficient considering the effects of n2 dissolution and suggested that the inclusion of 10 vol n2 in the co2 streams would reduce the onset time of convection and enhance the convective flux in the initial stage while the 20 vol n2 case would result in a similar onset time to the pure co2 case but a lower dissolution flux however the numerical investigation by li and jiang 2020 suggested that the diffusivity of n2 impurity was not likely to significantly affect the onset of the convective mixing process furthermore the diffusion contrasts between co2 and impurities may give to a non monotonic density profile which can either accelerate or delay the onset of convective mixing jafari raad et al 2016 jafari raad and hassanzadeh 2015 jafari raad et al 2019 for example the h2s impurity may have the potential to either impede or accelerate the convective mixing process depending on the impurity concentration in the co2 streams jafari raad and hassanzadeh 2017 2018 kim and song 2017 2019 the aforementioned studies play an important role in establishing a fundamental understanding of the convective dissolution of co2 in impure ccgs however the few available studies related to impurities mainly focus on the effects of single impurity and there are conflicting conclusions which call for further studies more importantly there are usually multiple two and more impurities involved in practical co2 sequestration for example the co2 streams obtained from the oxy fuel combustion plants are likely to contain approximately 15 vol non condensable impurities i e 5 8 vol n2 4 7 vol o2 4 47 vol ar and other minor impurities ieaghg 2011 kather 2009 however to the best of our knowledge the effects of multiple impurities on the convective mixing process are rarely studied in this work we designed a series of experiments in hele shaw cells to investigate the effects of single and multiple impurities n2 o2 and or ar on the density driven convective mixing process a hele shaw cell is made up of two pieces of parallel transparent glass or plexiglas plates with a narrow gap b usually less than 10 mm in between to represent a two dimensional homogeneous porous medium with a porosity of φ 1 0 and an absolute permeability of k b2 12 helmig 1997 nield and bejan 2017 it is an intuitive and convenient way to visualize the convective dissolution of co2 in laboratory experiments emami meybodi et al 2015 teng et al 2021 in this study many characterizing properties including the onset time of convection the mixing length dissolved co2 area dissolved co2 inventory number of fingers and the corresponding wavelength were obtained to evaluate the effects of these common impurities on the occurrence and evolution of the convective mixing process in addition theoretical calculations were presented to compare and validate the experimental results above all this experimental study was intended as an effort on establishing a comprehensive understanding of the effects of multiple impurities on co2 sequestration in impure ccgs 2 experimental methodology as shown in fig 1 the experimental set up mainly consists of a hele shaw cell a gas cylinder containing gas mixture precision 99 9 guangqi gas co ltd guangzhou china a flow controller with a control gate kongxin yj 700c a digital camera sony hdr pj410 and a data acquisition system the size of the hele shaw cell is 20 cm 30 cm 0 1 cm l h b deionized water which was mixed with bromocresol green at the proportion of 25 1 was adopted as the solution the bromocresol green has a transition range between ph 5 4 and 3 8 blue to yellow which was used as a color indicator to facilitate the observation of the density driven fingering phenomenon to avoid the negative effects of the potential bubbles on the fingering images the solution was put into an ultrasonic oscillator supmile kq 400de for 15 min to remove excess bubbles after the oscillation the blue solution with a ph of 4 3 was transferred into the hele shaw cell using a long syringe the height of the solution h in the hele shaw cell was kept at 16 cm for each experiment during the experiment the dissolution of co2 gradually decreases the ph of the solution consequently the blue color of the solution gradually turns into yellow showing the pattern of dissolved co2 concentration as listed in table 1 eleven compositions of gas mixtures were selected to investigate the effects of impurities on the convective mixing process based on the impure co2 compositions from the oxy fuel process ieaghg 2011 kather 2009 the content of single impurity was set at both 10 vol and 15 vol while the total content of multiple two and three impurities was set at 15 vol the gas mixtures were injected 2 5 cm below the top boundary of the hele shaw cell by a narrow needle fig 1 the following two aspects should be noted for the gas injection in the hele shaw cell firstly the injection of the gas mixture should be kept steady and rather low 30 ml min controlled by the flow controller to avoid any potential vibration on the gas liquid boundary which might affect the onset and distribution of fingering e g the fingering might occur preferentially in the middle section right below the injection point if the flow rate is too high secondly before each experiment the gas cylinder and the flow controller should be opened for a while 2 min to make sure that the air in the system especially in the hele shaw cell has been emptied when the figure on the digital display of the flow controller was stable the corresponding time was deemed as the beginning of the experiment with the aid of an led plate behind the hele shaw cell the convective mixing process was recorded by a digital camera with a resolution of 1920 1080 pixels in order to eliminate the side boundary effects on the results the area in the black rectangle with the size of 10 1 cm 16 cm l h in fig 1 was chosen as the representative region the images for the representative region were intercepted from the video color adjusted to black figures with white background and size adjusted to 120 dpi in our analysis at the end of the experiments 60 min the solution in the hele shaw cell was transferred into a container and the total dissolved co2 inventory was measured by a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l cph 3 results and discussion 3 1 repeatability verification the convective mixing process is chaotic in nature and difficult to accurately quantify in order to ensure the repeatability of the experiments repeated experiments 3 were carried out for each case listed in table 1 taking the case of 15 ar case 6 as an example fig 2 shows the snapshots from its three repeated experiments at 3000 s although the details of the fingering pattern are different from each other the mixing length l max 6 in all the three repeated experiments is similar to each other which not only shows good consistency and reliability of the experiments but also implies that l max i could be used as a characteristic parameter to illustrate the development of the convective mixing process 3 2 convective mixing in pure co2 case fig 3 shows the fingering distribution and evolution in the representative region for the pure co2 case including the snapshots of the fingering distribution at different times and the temporal evolution of the number of fingers n 0 as well as the corresponding wavelength of convective fingers it should be noted here that the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer δ 0 measured at the critical onset time t c 0 is 0 17 cm which remains constant during the whole convective mixing process fig 3a h after the occurrence of convection fingers emerge at the two phase boundary and grow independently fig 3a b and thus the number of fingers n 0 increases rapidly during this stage fig 3i growing away from the two phase boundary the fingers develop both vertically and horizontally inevitably there would be interactions between the enlarged fingers i e some adjacent fingers would coalesce and merge with each other into a larger finger fig 3c d resulting in decreasing n 0 apart from the coalescence of the fingers some large fingers might be cut off at the leading edge by the up moving co2 free fluid fig 3e f the cut off part is likely to merge with the adjacent large finger fig 3g h more importantly new fingers would also emerge at the two phase boundary between the existing fingers fig 3c h as a result of both the coalescence of adjacent fingers and the emergence of these new fingers the variation of n 0 is non monotonic during this stage fig 3i to be more specific n 0 can be deemed as a constant 7 6 with a modest random fluctuation of approximately 19 6 during 960 3330 s as for the wavelength of fingers we adopt two definitions the calculated wavelength λcal 0 is obtained through dividing the width of the representative region by the number of fingers i e λcal 0 l n 0 while the experimentally measured wavelength λexp 0 is defined as the mean horizontal width of fingers measured at different times since there is always space between two adjacent fingers during the convective mixing process fig 3a h the calculated wavelength is inevitably larger than the measured one fig 3i however it can be seen that the general trend of the calculated wavelength is consistent with the measured one since the identification of the number of fingers is much easier and more effective than the measurement of wavelength in every finger the calculated wavelength could be used as a simplified alternative to predict the variation trend of the fingering wavelength fig 4 shows the variation of the mixing length l max 0 and the corresponding maximum vertical velocity of fingers v max 0 for the pure co2 case it should be noted that the experimental value of v max 0 at different time t red solid square symbol is defined as the average increment rate of l max 0 between the time range of t to t 60 s after the occurrence of the convective mixing the convective fingers gradually migrate downwards fig 3 resulting in increasing l max 0 the slope of the linear fitting curve of l max 0 i e the average growth rate of l max 0 during the whole time range 0 3600 s for the pure co2 case is approximately 2 9 10 5 m s as illustrated by the grey dashed line in fig 4 it can be seen that except for a few data points at the early stage of convection the experimental values of v max 0 generally fluctuated around 2 9 10 5 m s suggesting that dl max 0 could be used as the mean value of v max 0 during the whole time range in the following sections dl max i is used as the representative of the maximum vertical velocity of fingers v max i during a certain time range 3 3 effects of impurities table 2 shows the dimensionless characteristic parameters of fingering occurrence and development obtained from repeated experiments for each case at 1200 s including the dimensionless onset time τ c i the dimensionless mixing length l max i the dimensionless dissolved co2 area si the dimensionless growth rate of mixing length dli and the dimensionless growth rate of dissolved co2 area dsi the corresponding dimensional data are listed in table s1 in the supporting information si the latter two parameters are obtained based on the linear fitting of all the experimental data from all the repeated experiments in each case while the former three parameters are averaged from the results in each repeated experiment for each case as an intuitive example fig 5 shows the snapshots of fingering distribution in a representative experiment for each case at 1200 s the corresponding dimensionless characteristic parameters for the representative experiment as shown in fig 5 are listed in table 3 while table s2 in si lists the corresponding dimensional data although the general patterns and trends of the dimensionless characteristic parameters in tables 2 and 3 are consistent e g τ c i for all the impurity cases is larger than 1 00 indicating a delayed onset of the convective mixing l max i and si as well as their corresponding growth rates dli and dsi are reduced in all the impurity cases except for the 10 ar case case 3 and 7 o2 8 ar case case 9 which implies that all the impurities except for 10 ar or 7 o2 8 ar have a negative impact on the downward migration of the leading fingers as well as the fingering footprint during the first 1200 s two aspects should be noted for the rather large standard deviations as listed in tables 2 and s1 on the one hand there is inevitable natural variability in the experiments which is the reason why repeated experiments should be carried out for each case thomas et al 2018 on the other hand with 1920 1080 pixels and 120 dpi the resolution of the images resolves the finger positions to approximately 0 02 cm taking the onset time t c i as an example considering the average growth rate of mixing length dl max i before 1200 s table s1 the time uncertainty for t c i resulted from image resolution is estimated to be in the range of 5 3 10 1 s while the final standard deviation resulted from three repeated experiments is in the range of 0 0 57 7 s table s1 it is indicated that the natural variability in the experiments might have more significant effects on the experimental deviation than the image resolution in order to lessen the potential deviation resulted from the chaotic nature of the convective process as well as the image resolution the results from all the repeated experiments tables 2 and s1 rather than the representative experiment tables 3 and s2 are used in the subsequent analysis the existence of impurities affects the occurrence and development of fingers while the degree of influence depends on the species and compositions of the impurities the critical onset time t c i of convection is an important parameter to characterize the convective mixing process in the present study t c i is defined as the time when the initial small fingers can be identified from the experimental images specifically the fingering length f max i of 0 15 cm is used as the uniform standard in all cases that defines the onset time this definition of critical onset time is somewhat subjective but it provides a relatively comparable and convenient measure of the order of magnitude of t c i generally it can be seen that the existence of impurities delays the onset of convective mixing tables 2 and s1 particularly the delay is likely to be enhanced with increasing content of a specific single impurity to be more specific the inclusion of 10 vol impurity n2 o2 or ar leads to a delayed convection compared with the pure co2 case and the increase of the impurity content to 15 vol further strengthens the delay of convection to different degrees depending on the species of the impurity in fact the onset time of all the cases containing 15 single impurity cases 4 6 is later than that of all the cases with 10 impurity cases 1 3 among them 15 ar in case 6 leads to the most delayed convection while the corresponding dimensionless deviation 0 41 is the largest among all the single impurity cases except for the 5 8 n2 9 2 ar case the onset time of all the 15 multiple impurity cases is generally comparable with the 15 single impurity case as for the effects of impurities on the fingering development before 1200 s the co injection of either n2 or o2 results in a negative effect on the maximum vertical migration length and fingering footprint as well as their respective growth rates i e l max i si dli and dsi table 2 the overall effects of the binary impurities of n2 and o2 case 7 on the downward migration and footprint of fingers are also negative compared with the pure co2 case on the other hand the inclusion of 10 ar enhances the downward migration of fingers and the fingering footprint as well as their corresponding growth rates while the effects of 15 ar are negative table 2 considering the unique behavior of ar more cases containing different ar contents are further investigated and their snapshots at different times are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the effects of ar on the downward migration of fingers are non monotonic with its content for example the inclusion of either 5 or 15 ar weakens the migration of the leading fingers and decreases the fingering footprint while the effects of 10 ar are opposite to them table 2 and fig 6 particularly the negative effects of 8 ar on the downward migration of fingers during the early convection stage 1200 s might turn into positive during the late convection 2400 s implying that the ar impurity may have opposite effects during different stages of the convective mixing process considering the non monotonic effects of ar on fingering migration with different contents and its potential positive effects during the advanced stages it is not surprising that the fingering migration l max i and the corresponding growth rate dli of the multiple impurity cases containing ar cases 8 10 are generally enhanced compared with the corresponding single impurity case cases 4 6 furthermore the negative impact of multiple impurities containing ar e g 7 o2 8 ar or 5 8 n2 4 7 o2 4 5 ar on the fingering migration and footprint might also turn into positive especially during the advanced stage of the convective mixing process fig 7 specifically considering the much delayed onset of convection τ c 9 in case 9 and the slightly enhanced vertical migration length l max 9 at 1200 s it is reasonable that the dimensionless growth rate of mixing length in case 9 dl 9 is considerably larger than 1 00 indicating that its average growth rate of the leading fingers from its onset time to 1200 s is much faster than the pure co2 case table 2 fig 8 illustrates the dimensionless characteristic parameters at the end of the convective mixing experiment for each case including the dimensionless dissolved co2 inventory mi the dimensionless mixing length l max i the dimensionless dissolved co2 area si the dimensionless growth rate of mixing length dli and the dimensionless growth rate of dissolved co2 area dsi while the values of these parameters are listed in table 4 in addition table s3 lists the corresponding dimensional data in all the impurity cases i 0 only 10 ar in case 3 results in a slightly higher dissolved co2 inventory than co2 while mi in all the other impurity cases is smaller than 1 00 meaning that the inclusion of these impurities is generally negative to the dissolved co2 inventory except for the 10 ar case it should be noted that mi depends on both the onset time of convection τ c i and the subsequent fingering development l max i si dli and dsi as indicated hereinbefore the negative effects of impurities containing ar on the onset of convection may not hold throughout the whole convective mixing process for example the inclusion of 10 ar results in a delayed onset time compared with the pure co2 case tables 2 and s1 whereas it significantly enhances the growth rate of fingering migration and footprint in the convection regime i e l max 3 s 3 dl 3 and ds 3 fig 8 and table 4 particularly the enhancement of the ar impurity on fingering development is generally more significant during the advanced stage e g table 4 vs table 2 however combining the delayed onset and enhanced development afterwards the total dissolved co2 inventory in case 3 m 3 is only slightly higher than that in the pure co2 case m 0 the compromise of the relatively delayed onset time and the intensified effects of the fingering development is more obvious in case 9 resulting in an overall negative effect on the dissolved co2 inventory generally the reduction of dissolved co2 inventory increases with increasing impurity content i e mi in all the 15 impurity cases is basically smaller than that in the 10 impurity cases particularly except for the three impurity cases the reduction of the impurities for the dissolved co2 inventory at the end of the experiments is approximately 30 when the total impurity content is 15 cases 4 9 i e although the onset time τc i and details of fingering development l max i si dli and dsi are different from each other table 2 and fig 8 the total dissolution inventory of co2 at the end of the experiments is comparable with each other the above phenomena imply that the difference of impurity species at the same content in the dissolution trapping mechanism may not be significant in the long term 3 4 comparison with theoretical estimation rayleigh number ra is an important dimensionless parameter to characterize the density driven convection which could be obtained by the following equation emami meybodi et al 2015 1 r a k δ ρ g h φ μ d where the dynamic viscosity of water 9 326 10 4 pa s at 23 ºc and 1 bar and the diffusion coefficient of pure co2 2 10 9 m2 s are used for each case as listed in table 1 neglecting the effects of impurities class et al 2020 while the density difference δρ caused by the dissolution of co2 and or impurities can be calculated by the following equations battistelli and marcolini 2009 2 δ ρ ρ a q ρ w 3 m a q ρ a q x w m w ρ w i 1 ncg x i v i where the partial molar volume of dissolve co2 is obtained by the formulation proposed by garcia 2001 and the partial molar volume of n2 is calculated based on temperature and pressure mao and duan 2006 the supcrt92 johnson et al 1992 package is adopted for the calculation of the partial molar volume of o2 and ar the mole fraction of each dissolved gas component i in the aqueous phase xi is obtained based on the flash calculations by assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium li and jiang 2020 the resulting δρ and ra for each case investigated in the present study are listed in table 5 it can be seen that the inclusion of non condensable impurities n2 o2 and or ar reduces the density increase of the aqueous phase caused by co2 dissolution and the reduction is larger with higher impurity content however different gas species or compositions of impurity mixtures are unlikely to result in noticeable density change the theoretical critical onset time t th i emami meybodi et al 2015 hassanzadeh et al 2007 xu et al 2006 and the theoretical maximum vertical velocity of the leading fingers u max i teng et al 2020 can be scaled as follows 4 t t h i c 0 φ μ 2 d k δ ρ i g 2 5 u max i c 1 k δ ρ i g μ where c 0 is a case sensitive constant that varies over one to two orders of magnitude erfani et al 2022 while the value of c 1 depends on the fluid properties teng et al 2020 based on eq 4 and the dimensional values of experimental onset time as listed in table s1 c 0 for different cases are calculated and listed in table s4 based on eq 5 c 1 is calculated corresponding to dl max i at 1200 s table s1 and 3600 s table s3 respectively it can be seen that c 0 falls in the range of 845 6155 as summarized by erfani et al erfani et al 2022 and is comparable to that estimated by pau et al pau et al 2010 nevertheless the values of c 0 predicted in our study are quite large which may be because that the experimental onset time is defined as the time when the initial small fingers can be identified from the experimental images i e f max i 0 15 cm it is suggested that the visual technique and definition is likely to lead to delayed onset time neglecting the effects of dissolved species on the dynamic viscosity of the aqueous phase μ and assuming that the diffusion coefficient of co2 d does not change in the presence of impurities the dimensionless theoretical critical onset time τ th i and the dimensionless theoretical vertical velocity of leading fingers u th i are obtained and listed in table 5 it can be seen that τ th i for all the impurity cases is larger than 1 00 confirming that the existence of the investigated impurities would lead to delayed onset of convection still there are differences between the experimental values and the theoretical values i e τ c i in table 2 vs τ th i in table 5 which might be attributed to the experimental uncertainty and the neglect of the impurity effects on both μ and d in eq 4 it has been suggested that the strength of convective mixing e g u th i increases with increasing ra according to ra in table 5 the impurity cases are supposed to result in weakened convection compared with the pure co2 case however as indicated in section 3 3 the cases containing ar have the potential to result in enhanced fingering especially during the advanced stage e g dli 1 00 in table 4 the inconsistency may be attributed to the fact that the calculation of ra as listed in table 5 neglects the effects of impurities on both μ and d based on the aqueous viscosity measured in the experiments the effects of dissolved gases on the aqueous viscosity are negligible under ambient conditions however the viscosity change of the formation brine caused by the dissolution of co2 and impurities might be too significant to be neglected under reservoir conditions mcbride wright et al 2015 yu et al 2021 on the other hand the diffusion coefficients of co2 and non co2 species are different especially under reservoir conditions according to linear nonlinear analyses or numerical simulations jafari raad and hassanzadeh 2017 2018 kim and song 2017 2019 and experimental pressure decay data mahmoodpour et al 2018 2020 the presence of impurities might change the density profile of diffusive boundary layers or the effective diffusivity of co2 thus affecting the occurrence and development of the convective mixing process however our previous numerical results suggested that the non condensable impurities in question were not likely to have significant effects on the occurrence and development on the convective mixing process li and jiang 2020 consequently it is necessary to further clarify the effects of multiple impurities on the viscosity of formation brine and the effective diffusivity of co2 especially by experimental methods under reservoir conditions so as to determine the effective rayleigh number in impure cases 3 5 discussion a typical density driven convective mixing process can be characterized by several regimes including an early diffusion dominated regime a flux growth regime a fingering merging regime a quasi steady convective regime and a shut down regime emami meybodi et al 2015 erfani et al 2021 wen et al 2021 according to the fingering development in the pure co2 case fig 3 it can be seen that the variation of number of fingers n 0 can also be divided into a diffusion dominated regime 0 t c 0 a finger growth regime t c 0 250 s a fingering merging regime 250 1000 s and a quasi steady convective regime 1000 3600 s the leading fingers did not reach the bottom boundary at the end of the experiments and thus the convection shut down was not observed in our experiments however it can be deduced that n 0 would decrease in response to the boundary effects therefore it is suggested that the variation of ni might be employed to illustrate the characteristic regimes of the convective mixing process especially when the convective flux cannot be obtained such as that in the hele shaw experiments the convective mixing behavior is strongly dependent on the rayleigh number corresponding to different permeabilities riaz et al 2006 for high rayleigh numbers e g ra 6000 there would be intensive nonlinear interaction between fingers and a constant flux regime quasi steady convective regime would occur as confirmed by the complex fingering structures figs 5 and 7 and the variation trend of number of fingers fig 3 in our study with high rayleigh numbers furthermore the constant flux regime would be more significant in higher rayleigh number cases erfani et al 2021 2022 in this case the long term fate of fingering behavior cannot be predicted based on the density profiles at earlier times or the onset time which is partially confirmed as in case 3 10 ar or case 9 7 o2 8 ar that has a delayed onset time of convection but leads to intensified convection especially during the advanced stage however for small rayleigh number cases e g ra 1500 the neighboring fingers tend to be pretty large and flow independently showing a pattern of strong diffusive smearing and a constant flux regime is not likely to be observed riaz et al 2006 erfani et al 2021 2022 the density contribution of impurities n2 o2 ar or their binary and ternary mixtures is smaller than that of co2 at ambient conditions ennis king and paterson 2005 as a result the density increase δρ of the aqueous phase caused by the dissolution of co2 mixtures containing these impurities is likely to be lessened compared with the pure co2 case furthermore the reduction of density increase is likely to increase with increasing impurity content since the onset time is inversely proportional to δρ 2 emami meybodi et al 2015 the inclusion of these impurities is predicted to lead to delayed occurrence of convection table 5 as confirmed by our experiments table 2 on the other hand it has been suggested that the negative effects of impurities on the onset may not always hold during the subsequent convective mixing process jafari raad and hassanzadeh 2017 as confirmed by the cases containing 10 ar 7 o2 8 ar or 5 8 n2 4 7 o2 4 5 ar figs 7 and 8 the combination of the negative effects of impurities on the onset and the positive effects on the fingering development might lead to either positive case 3 or negative case 9 effects on total dissolved co2 inventory nevertheless most impurities cases without ar would lead to weakened fingering development furthermore even though the details of the occurrence and development during the convective mixing process are different the negative effects of different non condensable impurity species on co2 dissolution are proved to be similar to each other in the long term it is thus suggested that the overall effects of multiple impurities on co2 dissolution inventory could be represented by a single impurity while the impurities containing ar should be dealt with more caution although the aforementioned observations are obtained mainly based on the properties of impurities at ambient conditions it has been suggested that the inclusion of n2 o2 and ar at the same content would result in comparable effects on the density increase of the aqueous phase under reservoir conditions and that n2 impurity could be used as the representative of the multiple impurities to investigate the convective mixing process in deep saline aquifers li and jiang 2020 nevertheless further experimental investigations under reservoir high temperature and high pressure conditions should be carried out to validate the prediction in addition apart from the non condensable impurities studied in the present study other common impurities such as hazardous h2s so2 are non negligible in co2 sequestration and require special attention because of their reactivity and preferential dissolution in the aqueous phase 4 conclusions the present study investigated the effects of single and multiple two and three impurities n2 o2 ar on the onset and development of the convective mixing process which was visualized in the hele shaw cell the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the existence of impurities n2 o2 and or ar both single and multiple delayed the onset of the convective mixing process and the negative impact on the onset time generally increased with increasing impurity content 2 the inclusion of n2 and or o2 negatively affected the development of convective fingers while the negative effects of ar or ar mixtures on the onset of convection may not always hold throughout the whole convective mixing process there was also a non monotonic correlation between the effect of ar on the fingering development and its concentration 3 except for the 10 ar case the overall effects of different impurities on dissolved co2 inventory were negative furthermore it is suggested that the difference in the dissolved co2 inventory resulted from different non co2 species was negligible in the long term the present investigation is an experimental study on the effects of multiple impurities on the convective mixing process focusing on the effects of non co2 species on the occurrence of the convective mixing process and its subsequent impact on the fingering development dissolved co2 inventory and the possibility of single impurity representing multiple impurities the study provides direct evidence on convective fingering under the impact of impurities in a laboratory controlled environment which can be used to validate relevant modeling simulation studies in the future the effects of multiple impurities on the viscosity of formation brine and the effective diffusivity of co2 should be combined with the effects of density increase so as to evaluate the effects of multiple impurities on

58,density driven convective mixing i e convective fingering has been identified to enhance co2 dissolution trapping in deep saline aquifers in this study a series of experiments in hele shaw cells were conducted and the effects of common impurities n2 o2 and or ar on the occurrence and development of the convective mixing process were compared and analyzed it is demonstrated that the existence of these impurities whether single or their mixture delayed the onset of convection however the subsequent fingering development including the mixing length and fingering footprint exhibited different patterns and trends depending on the species and compositions of the impurities the development and growth of the convective fingers displayed non monotonic characteristics as a function of the concentration of single impurity ar furthermore the multiple impurities containing ar had the potential to enhance the fingering development especially during the advanced stage other than these cases involving ar the inclusion of other impurities n2 and or o2 was found to weaken the fingering development compared with the pure co2 case nevertheless the results of dissolved co2 inventory suggested that the effects of different impurities at the same content both single and multiple might be similar to each other in the long term except for the three impurity case involving ar the laboratory

injects it into geological reservoirs for sequestration bachu 2008 ccgs is believed as one of the important technologies that mitigate the emission load of the dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas co2 thus addressing the issue of global warming and other environmental hazards while allowing for the continued use of fossil fuels ipcc 2014 li et al 2021 among the various potential geological reservoirs deep saline aquifers have attracted vast attention because of their tremendous storage capacity and ubiquitous distribution around the world the trapping mechanisms in the deep saline aquifers mainly include static trapping capillary trapping dissolution trapping and mineral trapping jiang 2011 raza et al 2015 among them the dissolution trapping mechanism plays a significant role in storage security in the medium to long term and it also provides necessary conditions for the permanent mineral trapping mechanism alcalde et al 2018 the injected co2 streams tend to accumulate under the caprock because of buoyancy forces gradually the layer of free phase co2 would slowly diffuse and dissolve into the underlying formation brine the dissolution of co2 increases the density of brine at the gas liquid boundary by 0 1 1 depending on temperature pressure and salinity efika et al 2016 the density contrast between the co2 rich brine at the two phase boundary and the underlying co2 free brine is gravitationally unstable which is likely to induce the convective mixing process emami meybodi et al 2015 seyyedi et al 2016 in this case a pattern of dissolved co2 concentration resembling fingers will form and develop and thus the phenomenon is also called convective fingering the convective mixing process can significantly increase co2 dissolution rate into the formation brine consequently it is important to investigate the convective mixing of co2 dissolution so as to improve our understanding of the dissolution trapping mechanism in ccgs the majority of available investigations about the convective mixing process in ccgs have been focused on pure co2 e g emami meybodi et al 2015 hewitt 2020 however considering economic and environmental benefits the co2 streams injected into the reservoirs generally contain impurities e g n2 o2 ar ch4 h2s so2 ieaghg 2011 compared with co2 these non co2 species are implied to have different effects on the aqueous phase density when dissolved thus affecting the occurrence and development of the density driven fingering blair and quinn 1968 ennis king and paterson 2005 yu et al 2021 for example it is demonstrated that n2 dissolution would decrease the density increase caused by co2 dissolution leading to delayed convection and decreased co2 dissolution rate and the impact was enhanced with increasing n2 mole fraction however the impact of so2 was opposite to that of n2 li and jiang 2014 2015 li et al 2015 in general it is suggested that at low and moderate formation temperature 250 ºc the co injection of either n2 or h2s with co2 would lead to smaller density differences of brine and thus adverse effects on the convective mixing process yu et al 2021 furthermore the effects of o2 and ar on the convective mixing process were indicated to be similar to that of n2 also weakening the convective mixing process li and jiang 2020 li et al 2015 however it should be noted that the aforementioned numerical investigations li and jiang 2014 2015 li and jiang 2020 li et al 2015 yu et al 2021 generally neglected the difference of diffusion coefficient between co2 and impurities while the inclusion of impurities would actually affect the density profile and stability of the diffusive boundary layer jafari raad et al 2016 jafari raad and hassanzadeh 2015 jafari raad et al 2019 mahmoodpour et al 2018 2020 estimated the effective co2 diffusion coefficient considering the effects of n2 dissolution and suggested that the inclusion of 10 vol n2 in the co2 streams would reduce the onset time of convection and enhance the convective flux in the initial stage while the 20 vol n2 case would result in a similar onset time to the pure co2 case but a lower dissolution flux however the numerical investigation by li and jiang 2020 suggested that the diffusivity of n2 impurity was not likely to significantly affect the onset of the convective mixing process furthermore the diffusion contrasts between co2 and impurities may give to a non monotonic density profile which can either accelerate or delay the onset of convective mixing jafari raad et al 2016 jafari raad and hassanzadeh 2015 jafari raad et al 2019 for example the h2s impurity may have the potential to either impede or accelerate the convective mixing process depending on the impurity concentration in the co2 streams jafari raad and hassanzadeh 2017 2018 kim and song 2017 2019 the aforementioned studies play an important role in establishing a fundamental understanding of the convective dissolution of co2 in impure ccgs however the few available studies related to impurities mainly focus on the effects of single impurity and there are conflicting conclusions which call for further studies more importantly there are usually multiple two and more impurities involved in practical co2 sequestration for example the co2 streams obtained from the oxy fuel combustion plants are likely to contain approximately 15 vol non condensable impurities i e 5 8 vol n2 4 7 vol o2 4 47 vol ar and other minor impurities ieaghg 2011 kather 2009 however to the best of our knowledge the effects of multiple impurities on the convective mixing process are rarely studied in this work we designed a series of experiments in hele shaw cells to investigate the effects of single and multiple impurities n2 o2 and or ar on the density driven convective mixing process a hele shaw cell is made up of two pieces of parallel transparent glass or plexiglas plates with a narrow gap b usually less than 10 mm in between to represent a two dimensional homogeneous porous medium with a porosity of φ 1 0 and an absolute permeability of k b2 12 helmig 1997 nield and bejan 2017 it is an intuitive and convenient way to visualize the convective dissolution of co2 in laboratory experiments emami meybodi et al 2015 teng et al 2021 in this study many characterizing properties including the onset time of convection the mixing length dissolved co2 area dissolved co2 inventory number of fingers and the corresponding wavelength were obtained to evaluate the effects of these common impurities on the occurrence and evolution of the convective mixing process in addition theoretical calculations were presented to compare and validate the experimental results above all this experimental study was intended as an effort on establishing a comprehensive understanding of the effects of multiple impurities on co2 sequestration in impure ccgs 2 experimental methodology as shown in fig 1 the experimental set up mainly consists of a hele shaw cell a gas cylinder containing gas mixture precision 99 9 guangqi gas co ltd guangzhou china a flow controller with a control gate kongxin yj 700c a digital camera sony hdr pj410 and a data acquisition system the size of the hele shaw cell is 20 cm 30 cm 0 1 cm l h b deionized water which was mixed with bromocresol green at the proportion of 25 1 was adopted as the solution the bromocresol green has a transition range between ph 5 4 and 3 8 blue to yellow which was used as a color indicator to facilitate the observation of the density driven fingering phenomenon to avoid the negative effects of the potential bubbles on the fingering images the solution was put into an ultrasonic oscillator supmile kq 400de for 15 min to remove excess bubbles after the oscillation the blue solution with a ph of 4 3 was transferred into the hele shaw cell using a long syringe the height of the solution h in the hele shaw cell was kept at 16 cm for each experiment during the experiment the dissolution of co2 gradually decreases the ph of the solution consequently the blue color of the solution gradually turns into yellow showing the pattern of dissolved co2 concentration as listed in table 1 eleven compositions of gas mixtures were selected to investigate the effects of impurities on the convective mixing process based on the impure co2 compositions from the oxy fuel process ieaghg 2011 kather 2009 the content of single impurity was set at both 10 vol and 15 vol while the total content of multiple two and three impurities was set at 15 vol the gas mixtures were injected 2 5 cm below the top boundary of the hele shaw cell by a narrow needle fig 1 the following two aspects should be noted for the gas injection in the hele shaw cell firstly the injection of the gas mixture should be kept steady and rather low 30 ml min controlled by the flow controller to avoid any potential vibration on the gas liquid boundary which might affect the onset and distribution of fingering e g the fingering might occur preferentially in the middle section right below the injection point if the flow rate is too high secondly before each experiment the gas cylinder and the flow controller should be opened for a while 2 min to make sure that the air in the system especially in the hele shaw cell has been emptied when the figure on the digital display of the flow controller was stable the corresponding time was deemed as the beginning of the experiment with the aid of an led plate behind the hele shaw cell the convective mixing process was recorded by a digital camera with a resolution of 1920 1080 pixels in order to eliminate the side boundary effects on the results the area in the black rectangle with the size of 10 1 cm 16 cm l h in fig 1 was chosen as the representative region the images for the representative region were intercepted from the video color adjusted to black figures with white background and size adjusted to 120 dpi in our analysis at the end of the experiments 60 min the solution in the hele shaw cell was transferred into a container and the total dissolved co2 inventory was measured by a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l cph 3 results and discussion 3 1 repeatability verification the convective mixing process is chaotic in nature and difficult to accurately quantify in order to ensure the repeatability of the experiments repeated experiments 3 were carried out for each case listed in table 1 taking the case of 15 ar case 6 as an example fig 2 shows the snapshots from its three repeated experiments at 3000 s although the details of the fingering pattern are different from each other the mixing length l max 6 in all the three repeated experiments is similar to each other which not only shows good consistency and reliability of the experiments but also implies that l max i could be used as a characteristic parameter to illustrate the development of the convective mixing process 3 2 convective mixing in pure co2 case fig 3 shows the fingering distribution and evolution in the representative region for the pure co2 case including the snapshots of the fingering distribution at different times and the temporal evolution of the number of fingers n 0 as well as the corresponding wavelength of convective fingers it should be noted here that the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer δ 0 measured at the critical onset time t c 0 is 0 17 cm which remains constant during the whole convective mixing process fig 3a h after the occurrence of convection fingers emerge at the two phase boundary and grow independently fig 3a b and thus the number of fingers n 0 increases rapidly during this stage fig 3i growing away from the two phase boundary the fingers develop both vertically and horizontally inevitably there would be interactions between the enlarged fingers i e some adjacent fingers would coalesce and merge with each other into a larger finger fig 3c d resulting in decreasing n 0 apart from the coalescence of the fingers some large fingers might be cut off at the leading edge by the up moving co2 free fluid fig 3e f the cut off part is likely to merge with the adjacent large finger fig 3g h more importantly new fingers would also emerge at the two phase boundary between the existing fingers fig 3c h as a result of both the coalescence of adjacent fingers and the emergence of these new fingers the variation of n 0 is non monotonic during this stage fig 3i to be more specific n 0 can be deemed as a constant 7 6 with a modest random fluctuation of approximately 19 6 during 960 3330 s as for the wavelength of fingers we adopt two definitions the calculated wavelength λcal 0 is obtained through dividing the width of the representative region by the number of fingers i e λcal 0 l n 0 while the experimentally measured wavelength λexp 0 is defined as the mean horizontal width of fingers measured at different times since there is always space between two adjacent fingers during the convective mixing process fig 3a h the calculated wavelength is inevitably larger than the measured one fig 3i however it can be seen that the general trend of the calculated wavelength is consistent with the measured one since the identification of the number of fingers is much easier and more effective than the measurement of wavelength in every finger the calculated wavelength could be used as a simplified alternative to predict the variation trend of the fingering wavelength fig 4 shows the variation of the mixing length l max 0 and the corresponding maximum vertical velocity of fingers v max 0 for the pure co2 case it should be noted that the experimental value of v max 0 at different time t red solid square symbol is defined as the average increment rate of l max 0 between the time range of t to t 60 s after the occurrence of the convective mixing the convective fingers gradually migrate downwards fig 3 resulting in increasing l max 0 the slope of the linear fitting curve of l max 0 i e the average growth rate of l max 0 during the whole time range 0 3600 s for the pure co2 case is approximately 2 9 10 5 m s as illustrated by the grey dashed line in fig 4 it can be seen that except for a few data points at the early stage of convection the experimental values of v max 0 generally fluctuated around 2 9 10 5 m s suggesting that dl max 0 could be used as the mean value of v max 0 during the whole time range in the following sections dl max i is used as the representative of the maximum vertical velocity of fingers v max i during a certain time range 3 3 effects of impurities table 2 shows the dimensionless characteristic parameters of fingering occurrence and development obtained from repeated experiments for each case at 1200 s including the dimensionless onset time τ c i the dimensionless mixing length l max i the dimensionless dissolved co2 area si the dimensionless growth rate of mixing length dli and the dimensionless growth rate of dissolved co2 area dsi the corresponding dimensional data are listed in table s1 in the supporting information si the latter two parameters are obtained based on the linear fitting of all the experimental data from all the repeated experiments in each case while the former three parameters are averaged from the results in each repeated experiment for each case as an intuitive example fig 5 shows the snapshots of fingering distribution in a representative experiment for each case at 1200 s the corresponding dimensionless characteristic parameters for the representative experiment as shown in fig 5 are listed in table 3 while table s2 in si lists the corresponding dimensional data although the general patterns and trends of the dimensionless characteristic parameters in tables 2 and 3 are consistent e g τ c i for all the impurity cases is larger than 1 00 indicating a delayed onset of the convective mixing l max i and si as well as their corresponding growth rates dli and dsi are reduced in all the impurity cases except for the 10 ar case case 3 and 7 o2 8 ar case case 9 which implies that all the impurities except for 10 ar or 7 o2 8 ar have a negative impact on the downward migration of the leading fingers as well as the fingering footprint during the first 1200 s two aspects should be noted for the rather large standard deviations as listed in tables 2 and s1 on the one hand there is inevitable natural variability in the experiments which is the reason why repeated experiments should be carried out for each case thomas et al 2018 on the other hand with 1920 1080 pixels and 120 dpi the resolution of the images resolves the finger positions to approximately 0 02 cm taking the onset time t c i as an example considering the average growth rate of mixing length dl max i before 1200 s table s1 the time uncertainty for t c i resulted from image resolution is estimated to be in the range of 5 3 10 1 s while the final standard deviation resulted from three repeated experiments is in the range of 0 0 57 7 s table s1 it is indicated that the natural variability in the experiments might have more significant effects on the experimental deviation than the image resolution in order to lessen the potential deviation resulted from the chaotic nature of the convective process as well as the image resolution the results from all the repeated experiments tables 2 and s1 rather than the representative experiment tables 3 and s2 are used in the subsequent analysis the existence of impurities affects the occurrence and development of fingers while the degree of influence depends on the species and compositions of the impurities the critical onset time t c i of convection is an important parameter to characterize the convective mixing process in the present study t c i is defined as the time when the initial small fingers can be identified from the experimental images specifically the fingering length f max i of 0 15 cm is used as the uniform standard in all cases that defines the onset time this definition of critical onset time is somewhat subjective but it provides a relatively comparable and convenient measure of the order of magnitude of t c i generally it can be seen that the existence of impurities delays the onset of convective mixing tables 2 and s1 particularly the delay is likely to be enhanced with increasing content of a specific single impurity to be more specific the inclusion of 10 vol impurity n2 o2 or ar leads to a delayed convection compared with the pure co2 case and the increase of the impurity content to 15 vol further strengthens the delay of convection to different degrees depending on the species of the impurity in fact the onset time of all the cases containing 15 single impurity cases 4 6 is later than that of all the cases with 10 impurity cases 1 3 among them 15 ar in case 6 leads to the most delayed convection while the corresponding dimensionless deviation 0 41 is the largest among all the single impurity cases except for the 5 8 n2 9 2 ar case the onset time of all the 15 multiple impurity cases is generally comparable with the 15 single impurity case as for the effects of impurities on the fingering development before 1200 s the co injection of either n2 or o2 results in a negative effect on the maximum vertical migration length and fingering footprint as well as their respective growth rates i e l max i si dli and dsi table 2 the overall effects of the binary impurities of n2 and o2 case 7 on the downward migration and footprint of fingers are also negative compared with the pure co2 case on the other hand the inclusion of 10 ar enhances the downward migration of fingers and the fingering footprint as well as their corresponding growth rates while the effects of 15 ar are negative table 2 considering the unique behavior of ar more cases containing different ar contents are further investigated and their snapshots at different times are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the effects of ar on the downward migration of fingers are non monotonic with its content for example the inclusion of either 5 or 15 ar weakens the migration of the leading fingers and decreases the fingering footprint while the effects of 10 ar are opposite to them table 2 and fig 6 particularly the negative effects of 8 ar on the downward migration of fingers during the early convection stage 1200 s might turn into positive during the late convection 2400 s implying that the ar impurity may have opposite effects during different stages of the convective mixing process considering the non monotonic effects of ar on fingering migration with different contents and its potential positive effects during the advanced stages it is not surprising that the fingering migration l max i and the corresponding growth rate dli of the multiple impurity cases containing ar cases 8 10 are generally enhanced compared with the corresponding single impurity case cases 4 6 furthermore the negative impact of multiple impurities containing ar e g 7 o2 8 ar or 5 8 n2 4 7 o2 4 5 ar on the fingering migration and footprint might also turn into positive especially during the advanced stage of the convective mixing process fig 7 specifically considering the much delayed onset of convection τ c 9 in case 9 and the slightly enhanced vertical migration length l max 9 at 1200 s it is reasonable that the dimensionless growth rate of mixing length in case 9 dl 9 is considerably larger than 1 00 indicating that its average growth rate of the leading fingers from its onset time to 1200 s is much faster than the pure co2 case table 2 fig 8 illustrates the dimensionless characteristic parameters at the end of the convective mixing experiment for each case including the dimensionless dissolved co2 inventory mi the dimensionless mixing length l max i the dimensionless dissolved co2 area si the dimensionless growth rate of mixing length dli and the dimensionless growth rate of dissolved co2 area dsi while the values of these parameters are listed in table 4 in addition table s3 lists the corresponding dimensional data in all the impurity cases i 0 only 10 ar in case 3 results in a slightly higher dissolved co2 inventory than co2 while mi in all the other impurity cases is smaller than 1 00 meaning that the inclusion of these impurities is generally negative to the dissolved co2 inventory except for the 10 ar case it should be noted that mi depends on both the onset time of convection τ c i and the subsequent fingering development l max i si dli and dsi as indicated hereinbefore the negative effects of impurities containing ar on the onset of convection may not hold throughout the whole convective mixing process for example the inclusion of 10 ar results in a delayed onset time compared with the pure co2 case tables 2 and s1 whereas it significantly enhances the growth rate of fingering migration and footprint in the convection regime i e l max 3 s 3 dl 3 and ds 3 fig 8 and table 4 particularly the enhancement of the ar impurity on fingering development is generally more significant during the advanced stage e g table 4 vs table 2 however combining the delayed onset and enhanced development afterwards the total dissolved co2 inventory in case 3 m 3 is only slightly higher than that in the pure co2 case m 0 the compromise of the relatively delayed onset time and the intensified effects of the fingering development is more obvious in case 9 resulting in an overall negative effect on the dissolved co2 inventory generally the reduction of dissolved co2 inventory increases with increasing impurity content i e mi in all the 15 impurity cases is basically smaller than that in the 10 impurity cases particularly except for the three impurity cases the reduction of the impurities for the dissolved co2 inventory at the end of the experiments is approximately 30 when the total impurity content is 15 cases 4 9 i e although the onset time τc i and details of fingering development l max i si dli and dsi are different from each other table 2 and fig 8 the total dissolution inventory of co2 at the end of the experiments is comparable with each other the above phenomena imply that the difference of impurity species at the same content in the dissolution trapping mechanism may not be significant in the long term 3 4 comparison with theoretical estimation rayleigh number ra is an important dimensionless parameter to characterize the density driven convection which could be obtained by the following equation emami meybodi et al 2015 1 r a k δ ρ g h φ μ d where the dynamic viscosity of water 9 326 10 4 pa s at 23 ºc and 1 bar and the diffusion coefficient of pure co2 2 10 9 m2 s are used for each case as listed in table 1 neglecting the effects of impurities class et al 2020 while the density difference δρ caused by the dissolution of co2 and or impurities can be calculated by the following equations battistelli and marcolini 2009 2 δ ρ ρ a q ρ w 3 m a q ρ a q x w m w ρ w i 1 ncg x i v i where the partial molar volume of dissolve co2 is obtained by the formulation proposed by garcia 2001 and the partial molar volume of n2 is calculated based on temperature and pressure mao and duan 2006 the supcrt92 johnson et al 1992 package is adopted for the calculation of the partial molar volume of o2 and ar the mole fraction of each dissolved gas component i in the aqueous phase xi is obtained based on the flash calculations by assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium li and jiang 2020 the resulting δρ and ra for each case investigated in the present study are listed in table 5 it can be seen that the inclusion of non condensable impurities n2 o2 and or ar reduces the density increase of the aqueous phase caused by co2 dissolution and the reduction is larger with higher impurity content however different gas species or compositions of impurity mixtures are unlikely to result in noticeable density change the theoretical critical onset time t th i emami meybodi et al 2015 hassanzadeh et al 2007 xu et al 2006 and the theoretical maximum vertical velocity of the leading fingers u max i teng et al 2020 can be scaled as follows 4 t t h i c 0 φ μ 2 d k δ ρ i g 2 5 u max i c 1 k δ ρ i g μ where c 0 is a case sensitive constant that varies over one to two orders of magnitude erfani et al 2022 while the value of c 1 depends on the fluid properties teng et al 2020 based on eq 4 and the dimensional values of experimental onset time as listed in table s1 c 0 for different cases are calculated and listed in table s4 based on eq 5 c 1 is calculated corresponding to dl max i at 1200 s table s1 and 3600 s table s3 respectively it can be seen that c 0 falls in the range of 845 6155 as summarized by erfani et al erfani et al 2022 and is comparable to that estimated by pau et al pau et al 2010 nevertheless the values of c 0 predicted in our study are quite large which may be because that the experimental onset time is defined as the time when the initial small fingers can be identified from the experimental images i e f max i 0 15 cm it is suggested that the visual technique and definition is likely to lead to delayed onset time neglecting the effects of dissolved species on the dynamic viscosity of the aqueous phase μ and assuming that the diffusion coefficient of co2 d does not change in the presence of impurities the dimensionless theoretical critical onset time τ th i and the dimensionless theoretical vertical velocity of leading fingers u th i are obtained and listed in table 5 it can be seen that τ th i for all the impurity cases is larger than 1 00 confirming that the existence of the investigated impurities would lead to delayed onset of convection still there are differences between the experimental values and the theoretical values i e τ c i in table 2 vs τ th i in table 5 which might be attributed to the experimental uncertainty and the neglect of the impurity effects on both μ and d in eq 4 it has been suggested that the strength of convective mixing e g u th i increases with increasing ra according to ra in table 5 the impurity cases are supposed to result in weakened convection compared with the pure co2 case however as indicated in section 3 3 the cases containing ar have the potential to result in enhanced fingering especially during the advanced stage e g dli 1 00 in table 4 the inconsistency may be attributed to the fact that the calculation of ra as listed in table 5 neglects the effects of impurities on both μ and d based on the aqueous viscosity measured in the experiments the effects of dissolved gases on the aqueous viscosity are negligible under ambient conditions however the viscosity change of the formation brine caused by the dissolution of co2 and impurities might be too significant to be neglected under reservoir conditions mcbride wright et al 2015 yu et al 2021 on the other hand the diffusion coefficients of co2 and non co2 species are different especially under reservoir conditions according to linear nonlinear analyses or numerical simulations jafari raad and hassanzadeh 2017 2018 kim and song 2017 2019 and experimental pressure decay data mahmoodpour et al 2018 2020 the presence of impurities might change the density profile of diffusive boundary layers or the effective diffusivity of co2 thus affecting the occurrence and development of the convective mixing process however our previous numerical results suggested that the non condensable impurities in question were not likely to have significant effects on the occurrence and development on the convective mixing process li and jiang 2020 consequently it is necessary to further clarify the effects of multiple impurities on the viscosity of formation brine and the effective diffusivity of co2 especially by experimental methods under reservoir conditions so as to determine the effective rayleigh number in impure cases 3 5 discussion a typical density driven convective mixing process can be characterized by several regimes including an early diffusion dominated regime a flux growth regime a fingering merging regime a quasi steady convective regime and a shut down regime emami meybodi et al 2015 erfani et al 2021 wen et al 2021 according to the fingering development in the pure co2 case fig 3 it can be seen that the variation of number of fingers n 0 can also be divided into a diffusion dominated regime 0 t c 0 a finger growth regime t c 0 250 s a fingering merging regime 250 1000 s and a quasi steady convective regime 1000 3600 s the leading fingers did not reach the bottom boundary at the end of the experiments and thus the convection shut down was not observed in our experiments however it can be deduced that n 0 would decrease in response to the boundary effects therefore it is suggested that the variation of ni might be employed to illustrate the characteristic regimes of the convective mixing process especially when the convective flux cannot be obtained such as that in the hele shaw experiments the convective mixing behavior is strongly dependent on the rayleigh number corresponding to different permeabilities riaz et al 2006 for high rayleigh numbers e g ra 6000 there would be intensive nonlinear interaction between fingers and a constant flux regime quasi steady convective regime would occur as confirmed by the complex fingering structures figs 5 and 7 and the variation trend of number of fingers fig 3 in our study with high rayleigh numbers furthermore the constant flux regime would be more significant in higher rayleigh number cases erfani et al 2021 2022 in this case the long term fate of fingering behavior cannot be predicted based on the density profiles at earlier times or the onset time which is partially confirmed as in case 3 10 ar or case 9 7 o2 8 ar that has a delayed onset time of convection but leads to intensified convection especially during the advanced stage however for small rayleigh number cases e g ra 1500 the neighboring fingers tend to be pretty large and flow independently showing a pattern of strong diffusive smearing and a constant flux regime is not likely to be observed riaz et al 2006 erfani et al 2021 2022 the density contribution of impurities n2 o2 ar or their binary and ternary mixtures is smaller than that of co2 at ambient conditions ennis king and paterson 2005 as a result the density increase δρ of the aqueous phase caused by the dissolution of co2 mixtures containing these impurities is likely to be lessened compared with the pure co2 case furthermore the reduction of density increase is likely to increase with increasing impurity content since the onset time is inversely proportional to δρ 2 emami meybodi et al 2015 the inclusion of these impurities is predicted to lead to delayed occurrence of convection table 5 as confirmed by our experiments table 2 on the other hand it has been suggested that the negative effects of impurities on the onset may not always hold during the subsequent convective mixing process jafari raad and hassanzadeh 2017 as confirmed by the cases containing 10 ar 7 o2 8 ar or 5 8 n2 4 7 o2 4 5 ar figs 7 and 8 the combination of the negative effects of impurities on the onset and the positive effects on the fingering development might lead to either positive case 3 or negative case 9 effects on total dissolved co2 inventory nevertheless most impurities cases without ar would lead to weakened fingering development furthermore even though the details of the occurrence and development during the convective mixing process are different the negative effects of different non condensable impurity species on co2 dissolution are proved to be similar to each other in the long term it is thus suggested that the overall effects of multiple impurities on co2 dissolution inventory could be represented by a single impurity while the impurities containing ar should be dealt with more caution although the aforementioned observations are obtained mainly based on the properties of impurities at ambient conditions it has been suggested that the inclusion of n2 o2 and ar at the same content would result in comparable effects on the density increase of the aqueous phase under reservoir conditions and that n2 impurity could be used as the representative of the multiple impurities to investigate the convective mixing process in deep saline aquifers li and jiang 2020 nevertheless further experimental investigations under reservoir high temperature and high pressure conditions should be carried out to validate the prediction in addition apart from the non condensable impurities studied in the present study other common impurities such as hazardous h2s so2 are non negligible in co2 sequestration and require special attention because of their reactivity and preferential dissolution in the aqueous phase 4 conclusions the present study investigated the effects of single and multiple two and three impurities n2 o2 ar on the onset and development of the convective mixing process which was visualized in the hele shaw cell the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the existence of impurities n2 o2 and or ar both single and multiple delayed the onset of the convective mixing process and the negative impact on the onset time generally increased with increasing impurity content 2 the inclusion of n2 and or o2 negatively affected the development of convective fingers while the negative effects of ar or ar mixtures on the onset of convection may not always hold throughout the whole convective mixing process there was also a non monotonic correlation between the effect of ar on the fingering development and its concentration 3 except for the 10 ar case the overall effects of different impurities on dissolved co2 inventory were negative furthermore it is suggested that the difference in the dissolved co2 inventory resulted from different non co2 species was negligible in the long term the present investigation is an experimental study on the effects of multiple impurities on the convective mixing process focusing on the effects of non co2 species on the occurrence of the convective mixing process and its subsequent impact on the fingering development dissolved co2 inventory and the possibility of single impurity representing multiple impurities the study provides direct evidence on convective fingering under the impact of impurities in a laboratory controlled environment which can be used to validate relevant modeling simulation studies in the future the effects of multiple impurities on the viscosity of formation brine and the effective diffusivity of co2 should be combined with the effects of density increase so as to evaluate the effects of multiple impurities on rayleigh number and to establish a comprehensive understanding of the convective mixing process in impure co2 geological sequestration furthermore the correlation between laboratory experimental data and full scale field data needs to be investigated credit authorship contribution statement didi li conceptualization methodology writing original draft project administration funding acquisition

59,we use three dimensional x ray imaging to investigate steady state three phase flow in a mixed wet reservoir rock while measuring both relative permeability and capillary pressure oil occupied the smallest pores gas the biggest while water occupied medium sized pores we report a distinct flow pattern where gas flows in the form of disconnected ganglia by periodically opening critical flow pathways despite having capillary controlled displacements a significant fraction of the pore space was intermittently occupied by gas oil and oil water phases both types of intermittency occurred in intermediate sized pores gas mainly displaces oil and oil displaces water as the gas flow rate is increased while oil displaces gas and water displaces oil as gas flow is decreased at the resolution of the images no detectable gas was trapped in the rock due to its mixed wettability which prevents either oil or water completely surrounding gas suppressing snap off and capillary trapping which has significant implications for the design of gas storage in three phase systems keywords three phase flow relative permeability x ray imaging carbon dioxide storage mixed wettability steady state flow data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction while global consumption of fossil fuels has fallen over the last couple of years they still remain the largest primary energy source and therefore continue to play a dominant role in atmospheric co2 emissions bp statistical review of world energy 2021 allen et al 2019 a solution where the produced co2 emissions are captured and stored eliminating their impact on climate change is therefore a practical and feasible component of efforts to prevent dangerous climate change bui et al 2018 bickle 2009 alcalde et al 2018 geological carbon capture and storage ccs offers advantages in hydrocarbon reservoirs where the injection infrastructure exists and the field is a known secure geological trap moreover co2 injection can recover additional amounts of oil from depleted oilfields providing the financial incentive needed to implement ccs brownsort et al 2015 blunt et al 1993 lake 1989 when co2 is injected in oilfields there is a simultaneous flow of three fluid phases oil water and gas in the pore space of the reservoir therefore in order to maximize the amount of co2 stored and oil recovered in the reservoir we need to improve our understanding of the pore scale physics governing three phase flow blunt 2017 the recent deployment of x ray microtomography has accelerated our understanding of multiphase flow in porous media blunt 2017 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 blunt et al 2013 cnudde and boone 2013 brown et al 2014 bultreys et al 2016 the use of three dimensional x ray imaging has made it possible to visualize the flow of fluids inside micron sized pore spaces to quantify pore scale flow properties examples of these properties include in situ contact angles interfacial areas and curvatures saturation in micro porosity layer flow connectivity and trapping events andrew et al 2013 2014 2015 singh et al 2016 2017 lin et al 2016 2018 armstrong et al 2012 rücker et al 2015

2021 2019 iglauer et al 2019 herring et al 2019 2017 2015 armstrong and berg 2013 the coupling of x ray imaging with steady state two phase flow techniques enables a complete quantification of two phase flow properties through the simultaneous determination of relative permeability and capillary pressure in systems with various wettabilities lin et al 2018 2021 alhammadi et al 2020 gao et al 2020 furthermore it has helped delineate the boundary between linear darcy flow and the non linear intermittent flow regime gao et al 2020 2017 zhang et al 2021 spurin et al 2019a 2019b gao et al 2021 a linear relationship exists between pressure gradient and flow rate in the darcy regime as opposed to the intermittent one for which a power law scaling is found zhang et al 2021 in two phase flow fluids flow through fixed pathways in the darcy regime where capillary forces are dominant while a more dynamic periodically disconnected pathway exists in the intermittent flow regime gao et al 2020 2021 spurin et al 2019 in three phase flow x ray imaging has been mostly performed during unsteady state experiments scanziani et al 2018 2020 alhosani et al 2019 2020 2021a 2021b qin et al 2019 iglauer et al 2019 scanziani et al 2018 it was not until recently that alhosani et al 2021 successfully combined imaging with steady state three phase flow in a water wet bentheimer sandstone acquiring measurements of three phase relative permeabilities and capillary pressures the authors discovered a unique flow pattern that is gas the most non wetting phase progressed through the pore space in the form of disconnected clusters by periodically opening critical flow pathways alhosani et al 2021 despite flowing under capillary dominated conditions intermittent gas oil and oil water phases were observed in the pore scale images this a distinct characteristic of three phase flow made possible by double and multiple displacement events where one displaced fluid phase can progress to displace another phase or multiple phases in the pore space however further work is needed to investigate the impact of wettability on steady state three phase flow in this work we use x ray imaging to investigate three phase steady state flow in a mixed wet reservoir rock extracted from a large producing field in the middle east we study a saturation history where the gas fractional flow is first increased and then decreased our experiment is performed under capillary dominated immiscible gas oil conditions similar to previous work alhosani et al 2021 a mixed wettability state where the oil water contact angle θow is distributed both above and below 90o is more representative of oil reservoirs where the existence of crude oil in parts of the pore space at conditions of high temperature and pressure over long periods of time renders some of the rock surfaces oil wet blunt 2017 in our experiment we measure three phase relative permeabilities by recording the pressure drop across the sample at steady state conditions for each set of gas oil and water fractional flows we determine the saturations directly from the raw pore scale images without performing image segmentation by extending the saturation analysis introduced by lin et al 2021 from two to three phases we present a new image analysis technique to quantify the displacement of each phase when moving from one steady state condition to another in addition we determine capillary pressures pore occupancies layer formation interfacial areas contact angles and fluid connectivity we end with a discussion of the implications of this work on the design of carbon dioxide storage in oil reservoirs the averaged pore occupancy results indicate that the wettability order in our mixed wet reservoir rock is oil water gas from most to least wetting we observe disconnected gas flow across the system at steady state conditions similar to the observations of alhosani et al 2021 for a water wet rock although displacements were capillary controlled we identified intermittent gas oil and oil water regions where the phases alternatively filled the same pores unlike the water wet system oil water intermittency is more significant here as the gas fractional flow was increased gas only filled the pores that were previously occupied by oil and gas was mostly displaced by oil as the fractional flow was decreased this work further supports previous work alhosani et al 2021 that pore scale steady state conditions may never be attained in three phase flow despite macroscopically having a constant averaged saturation hence when we talk about steady state conditions we do not refer to a fixed configuration of fluids at the pore scale but more a dynamic situation where while there are local fluctuations on the pore scale arrangement of the phases associated with rapid fluctuations in pressure drop across the system when averaged over the period of a few hours there is no trend or change in the average pressure drop or the average saturation more significantly at the image resolution we observed no gas trapping in this mixed wet reservoir rock after gas injection has stopped when only water and oil were injected fg 0 and fw o 0 5 this is different to the water wet system where a significant amount of gas was trapped in the pore centres surrounded by oil and water layers alhosani et al 2021 this behaviour was ascribed to the mixed wet nature of the surface which prevented either oil or water from completely surrounding the gas phase in the pore centres this work suggests that a water alternating gas wag injection strategy may not be favourable for carbon dioxide storage in oilfields since it can mobilize the gas possibly leading to its escape instead an injection strategy of continuous gas injection is more effective since gas naturally gets disconnected once injection stops there is no need to inject water to trap the gas 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock and fluid properties the rock sample selected was a reservoir carbonate extracted from a large producing oilfield in the middle east with a total porosity of 24 4 characterised using differential imaging lin et al 2016 and an absolute permeability k of 668 30 md 6 6 10 13 0 3 10 13 m2 measured at the experimental conditions these properties are typical for the reservoir as a whole the mineralogically calcite dominated sample was 42 9 mm in length and 12 3 mm in diameter the pore and throat size distributions of the sample are plotted in fig s1 in the supplementary material the experimental fluids used to replicate gas oil and water phases were nitrogen n2 n decane c10h22 and deionized water h2o respectively the oil and water phases were mixed with 20 wt iododecane c10h21i and 30 wt sodium iodide nai respectively in a process known as doping to increase the contrast between the four phases rock gas oil and water in the x ray images at the experimental conditions 1 mpa pore pressure and 30 c temperature the dynamic viscosities of gas oil and water were 0 017 4 27 and 1 40 mpa s respectively alhosani et al 2021 nist 2019 gas and oil were immiscible with an interfacial tension of 11 2 mn m 1 alhosani et al 2021 the interfacial tensions between gas and water and oil and water were 63 7 and 52 1 mn m 1 respectively nist 2019 these conditions are lower pressure and temperature than typical field conditions the aim of this study though is to examine displacement processes rather than replicate a specific reservoir situation in our three phase system oil has a positive initial spreading coefficient alhosani et al 2021 cso 0 4 mn m 1 calculated using csi σjk σij σik where i j and k denote the three fluid phases which indicates oil will spread in layers sandwiched between gas and water in the rock pore space as we will show later gas and water both have a negative spreading coefficient 2 2 wettability alteration process prior to performing the steady state experiment the rock wettability was rendered mixed wet this process restores the initially water wet state of the cleaned rock sample to conditions likely to be representative of subsurface conditions mixed wettability means that certain parts of the pore space are water wet θow 90o while the rest is oil wet θow 90o blunt 2017 the wettability of a rock surface can be changed by placing it in contact with crude oil at high temperatures and pressures during which asphaltene precipitation takes place alhammadi et al 2017 alhosani et al 2020 salathiel 1973 kovscek et al 1993 asphaltenes deposition renders some of the solid surfaces oil wet the wettability alteration process is also known as ageing to alter the wettability of the reservoir rock we first saturated the rock sample with formation brine a brine solution prepared with the same salt composition as the reservoir brine from which the rock was extracted then 100 pore volumes pv of crude oil from the same reservoir were injected at ambient conditions into the pore space with a flowrate of 0 1 ml min the injection of crude oil at a low flowrate is necessary to ensure that not all the formation brine is swept out and that some pores remain brine occupied i e remain water wet to achieve mixed wettability the sample was then taken out and placed in a crude oil bath at 80 c for two months the middle eastern crude oil has a density and viscosity of 812 kg m 3 and 1 94 mpa s respectively measured at 60 c and 8 mpa and is composed of 55 23 saturates 38 07 aromatics 6 22 resins and 0 46 asphaltenes alhammadi et al 2017 3 experimental procedure after establishing the mixed wet wettability state the sample was prepared for the steady state three phase imaging experiment a schematic of the three phase flow and x ray imaging apparatus is shown in fig 1 the sample was first wrapped with aluminium foil and inserted into a viton rubber tubing the viton tubing was then connected to the injection and production ends of the coreholder see fig 1 a full description of the x ray transparent three phase steady state peek coreholder design can be found elsewhere alhosani et al 2021 a keller pd 33x pressure transducer with an accuracy of 0 03 kpa was connected to the inlet and outlet of the sample to record the pressure drop during the experiment the flow cell was then placed in a zeiss xradia 510 x ray scanner for pore scale image acquisition throughout the flow experiment five teledyne isco pumps were used in the experiment to inject the three fluid phases and apply confining and back pressures the three fluid phases were injected from the bottom of the sample a net confining pressure of 2 mpa was applied while the back pressure was set to 1 mpa the experiment was conducted at a temperature of 30 c in the three phase flow experiment steady state conditions were reached at various gas oil and water fractional flows fg fo and fw by keeping the fluid flow rates constant with a total flow rate of qt 0 8 ml min 1 the sets of fractional flows are listed in table 1 the selection of fractional flows was done prudently to investigate the impact of a saturation history where the gas saturation is first increased and then decreased on three phase relative permeability this saturation history is typically encountered in oil reservoirs lake 1989 furthermore to avoid any switch from drainage to imbibition displacements between oil and water we keep the oil and water saturation changes in the same direction by keeping oil and water flow rates the same and change the gas saturation in the opposite direction oak 1990 alizadeh and piri 2014 oak et al 1990 saraf et al 1982 alizadeh and piri 2014 the minimum waiting time for each set of fractional flows to reach steady state conditions was at least 12 hr after which we waited for the differential pressure signal to stabilize over a period of 3 hr to record the pressure drop and start the x ray imaging process in flow step 1 see table 1 oil 80 wt n decane and 20 wt iododecane was injected into the sample to replace the crude oil introduced during the wettability alteration process water was then injected in step 2 to reach the residual or remaining oil saturation in step 3 both oil and water were injected simultaneously fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 to initialize the sample for the three phase steady state experiment gas was first injected into the sample in step 4 five three phase steady state conditions were reached as fg was increased steps 4 5 6 7 and 8 while only three steady state conditions were reached when fg was decreased steps 9 10 and 11 at fg 1 step 8 after reaching steady state conditions at qg 0 8 ml min 1 the gas flow rate was then increased to 2 ml min 1 to reach the maximum gas saturation and minimize the capillary end effect in the sample the absolute permeability k 668 30 md 6 6 10 13 0 3 10 13 m2 of the sample was measured using deionized water h2o prior to altering the wettability of the rock at the experimental conditions a dry scan and a high contrast water saturated scan were also acquired at this point to characterize the porosity distribution including sub resolution porosity of the sample using the differential imaging method lin et al 2016 the fluids were injected at low flow rates to ensure that displacements occur under capillary dominated conditions representative of field scale flows capillary controlled displacements are typically characterized by low capillary numbers ca blunt 2017 for any fluid pair caij μi q i σij where σij is the interfacial tension between the two phases μi is the viscosity of the displacing fluid and q i is its darcy velocity table 2 lists the capillary numbers between the gas oil and oil water fluid pairs at each set of fractional flows since oil has an initial positive spreading coefficient cso 0 4 mn m 1 see section 2 1 we expect it to spread in layers between gas and water preventing their direct displacement three dimensional images of the whole sample were acquired with a voxel size of 5 36 µm using the zeiss versa 510 scanner after reaching steady state conditions at each set of fractional flows to capture the whole length images of size 12 45 mm 12 45 mm 10 23 mm were taken at four different locations of the sample with an overlap of 25 the x ray source energy and power were set to 80 kev and 7 w respectively and a large flat panel was employed at the detector side the exposure time was set to 1 60 s with a total of 3 201 projections taken at all sets of fractional flows all the pore scale images were then reconstructed normalized registered and stitched as shown in figs 2 and 3 3 1 image processing and analysis as mentioned in the introduction we observe that a large fraction of the pore space is occupied by gas oil and oil water phases intermittently at three phase steady state conditions intermittency can take any grey scale value in between the grey scale values of the two intermittent phases this makes image segmentation almost impossible and even if segmented there would be eight different phases in the image including rock water oil gas gas from gas oil intermittency oil from gas oil intermittency oil from oil water intermittency and water from oil water intermittency therefore we decided not to segment the three phase steady state images with significant intermittency and instead perform image analysis directly on the raw images the analysis performed on the raw three phase images includes saturation pore occupancy and displacement nonetheless there was no little intermittency in the pore scale images acquired in flow steps 2 3 8 and 12 see table 1 hence these images were segmented using the seeded watershed algorithm and used for the analysis of contact angles capillary pressures interfacial areas and connectivity we also characterize the saturations in the segmented images and compare them to the saturations obtained directly from the raw images see the next section the segmentation procedure is detailed in fig s2 in the supplementary material 3 1 1 saturation from grey scale images since it was not possible to segment the three phase steady state images we used an approach developed by lin et al 2021 to find the fluid saturations directly from the raw unsegmented pore scale images we extend this approach from two to three fluid phases here fluid saturations are determined using their grey scale values in the pore scale images in this approach the saturation of the intermittent region is added to the saturation of their respective phases e g the contributions to the saturations of oil from gas oil and oil water intermittent regions are added to the oil saturation we only considered the fluid saturations in the macro porosity porosity that was explicitly resolved in the images please refer to lin et al 2021 for the calculation of two phase saturations directly from the pore scale images the saturations in the macro porosity at each set of three phase fractional flows were obtained as follows 1 c t f w f o f g s w c t w s o c t o s g c t g where c t f w f o f g is the average grey scale value in the macro porosity of the three phase steady state image at each set of fractional flows ctw is the average grey scale value in the macro porosity of the water saturated image cto is the average grey scale value in the macro porosity of the fully oil saturated image acquired after flow step 1 see table 1 and ctg is the average grey scale value in the macro porosity of a fully gas saturated image dry scan sw so and sg refer to the water oil and gas saturations respectively now if we substitute so 1 sw sg eq 1 can be re written as 2 s w c t o c t f w f o f g s g c t g s g c t o c t o c t w while ctw cto and ctg are constant c t f w f o f g changes depending on the fluid saturations in the macro porosity of each three phase steady state image eq 2 can be solved linearly giving a range of sw and sg values we limit this range by the minimum and maximum water and gas saturations that are obtained from the segmented images in flow steps 3 8 and 12 finally the water and gas saturations are obtained by taking the mid point of their narrowed ranges at each set of fractional flows oil saturation is then found from so 1 sw sg 3 1 2 relative permeability the gas oil and water relative permeabilities were calculated using the multiphase darcy law assuming a linear relationship between flow rate and pressure gradient blunt 2017 3 k r w q w μ w l δ p k 4 k r o q o μ o l δ p k 5 k r g q g μ g l δ p k where kr is the relative permeability dimensionless k is the permeability m2 µ is the viscosity pa s q is the darcy velocity flow rate per unit area m s 1 δp is the pressure drop pa and l is the sample length m subscripts g o and w refer to the gas oil and water phases respectively given that the pressure fluctuations were large at three phase steady state conditions the average pressure drop was used to calculate the relative permeabilities 3 1 3 displacement analysis to quantitatively assess the displacement processes in the three phase mixed wet system when moving from one steady state condition to another we developed an in house algorithm that identifies the pores and throats occupied by a certain phase at each set of fractional flows fg i fo i and fw i and then records the phases that occupy the same pores and throats at the next set of fractional flows fg i 1 fo i 1 and fw i 1 displacement is said to have taken place if the occupancy in the pore changes from one steady state condition to another we use the network model code developed by dong and blunt 2009 and raeini et al 2017 to extract the pores and throats from the dry scan of the sample pores are defined as wide regions of the pore space that are connected by narrower regions the throats the pore diameter is the diameter of the largest sphere that can fit entirely in the pore while the throat diameter is the diameter of the largest sphere that sits on the throat centre we assume that the macro pore space can be occupied by five phases i gas ii oil iii water iv gas oil intermittency and v oil water intermittency at all three phase steady state conditions for simplicity we consider the intermittent regions as a single phase to determine the occupancy in the pores we first set a range of grey scale values for each phase as shown in fig s3 in the supplementary material then we find the average grey scale value in the sphere we have extracted from the pores depending on what range the average grey scale value falls in the occupancy is assigned 4 results and discussion in this section we first measure the geometric fluid fluid contact angles to confirm the mixed wettability state of the reservoir rock section 3 1 then in section 3 2 we show evidence of intermittent gas oil and oil water flow at three phase steady state conditions we quantify pore occupancy in section 3 3 to determine the wettability order in the system in sections 3 4 and 3 5 the connectivity of the fluids and interfacial areas are examined respectively saturations are then quantified in section 3 6 and plotted against the measurements of three phase relative permeabilities in section 3 7 capillary pressures are characterized in section 3 8 in section 3 9 fluid fluid displacements in the three phase mixed wet system are analyzed finally in section 3 10 we examine gas trapping and discuss the implications of pore scale properties on the design of field scale co2 storage and oil recovery 4 1 wettability the oil water θow gas oil θgo and gas water θgw geometric contact angles were measured on subvolumes of size 2 68 mm 2 68 mm 2 68 mm on the segmented images see section 2 4 and table 1 for the fractional flows of the segmented images the geometric angles were measured using the automated method developed by alratrout et al 2017 see fig 4 fig 4a shows measurements of the oil water contact angle at two phase flow conditions fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 measured before and after gas injection at the end of the experiment denoted by subscripts b and a respectively we observe that θow has a wide distribution with angles both lower and higher than 90o indicating the local existence of both water wet and oil wet regions which is the defining characteristic of mixed wet media blunt 2017 the mean oil water contact angles before and after gas injection are 82o 42o and 84o 39o respectively this confirms that the wettability alteration protocol successfully achieved mixed wet conditions in contrast a dynamic ageing protocol previously performed on the same reservoir rock in multiple studies resulted in more oil wet conditions with mean oil water contact angles of 112o 21o 118o 25o and 110o 20o alhosani et al 2020b 2020c 2021 at fg 1 the measured mean oil water contact angle is 80o 41o see fig 4b the consistency of the values indicates that the contact angle does not change within the uncertainty of the measurements during and after gas injection the gas oil and gas water contact angles are 66o 41o and 78o 40o respectively suggesting that both oil and water are more wetting to the surface than gas however it is not possible to determine a clear wettability order in the system using the geometric contact angle measurements only 4 2 three phase intermittency as mentioned previously a large fraction of the pore space becomes occupied by gas oil and oil water phases intermittently at three phase steady state conditions during which the two intermittent phases alternatively occupy the same pores intermittency is manifested in an intermediate grey scale value in between the grey scale values of the two intermittent phases as shown in fig 5 this pore scale phenomenon has been previously observed in two phase flow albeit in the non linear flow regime gao et al 2020 2017 spurin et al 2019 2019 reynolds et al 2017 gao et al 2019 nonetheless it was also seen in a three phase water wet system under capillary controlled conditions alhosani et al 2021 fig 5 shows the existence of two intermittent regions in the mixed wet pore space i a gas oil region and ii an oil water region we do not observe intermittent gas water regions since the two phases do not come in direct contact due to the presence of oil layers in contrast to the water wet system where gas oil intermittency was clearly more dominant alhosani et al 2021 the oil water and gas oil intermittencies both occupy significant fractions of the pore space in the mixed wet system this is supported by the pore occupancy analysis in the next section 4 3 pore occupancy we characterized the pore occupancy the size of the pores occupied by each fluid phase directly from the raw two and three phase steady state images of the whole sample see fig 6 in two phase flow we divided the pore space into three phases i oil ii water and iii oil water intermittency while we assigned five phases under three phase steady state conditions i gas ii oil iii water iv gas oil intermittency and v oil water intermittency we extract the pores using the pore network model extraction dong and blunt 2009 raeini et al 2017 and then assign a unique occupancy dependent on the average grey scale value in the pore each phase is given a grey scale value range and if the average value in the pore falls within this range then the pore is considered to be occupied by that phase see section 2 4 3 fig 6a shows that at fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 before gas injection on average oil flows in pores smaller than those occupied by water which suggests that oil is more wetting to the rock than water it is favorable for the most wetting phase to reside close to the surface nonetheless oil also flows in a large fraction of the big pores as well away from the solid surfaces this is ascribed to the mixed wet nature of the surface furthermore we notice that oil water intermittency takes place mostly in the intermediate sized pores as seen previously in two phase flow experiments reynolds et al 2017 gao et al 2019 at three phase steady state conditions as fg is increased and fo and fw are decreased figs 6b to 6f gas flows in the largest pores oil the smallest while water flows in the medium sized pores this suggests that the wettability order in the mixed wet system is oil water gas from most to least wetting this wettability order has been previously observed in weakly oil wet rocks at immiscible gas oil conditions scanziani et al 2018 while one would expect more competition between oil and water to occupy the smallest pores due to the mixed wettability we believe that this is dictated by the filling order since oil saturated the pore space first before water we see that gas oil and oil water intermittency occurs in pores of similar intermediate size during the increasing fg and decreasing fo and fw flow path gas tends to favour filling the larger pores and oil the smaller ones so they compete to occupy pores of intermediate size furthermore as seen in two phase flow oil and water both occupy larger and smaller pores since this is a mixed wet system and intermittency is seen in a range of pore sizes and most commonly around the mode with intermediate radius the same wettability order persists during the decreasing fg and increasing fo and fw flow path see figs 6f to 6h during this flow path gas occupied increasingly smaller pores and oil and water larger pores this is expected since the gas saturation decreases while the oil and water saturations increase as we will show in section 3 6 this pore occupancy behaviour is different to that observed in the water wet system alhosani et al 2021 where limited displacement was observed during the decreasing fg and increasing fo and fw flow path due to double capillary trapping of gas by oil and water hence this suggests that there is less gas trapping in the mixed wet system at three phase steady state conditions therefore it implies that the saturation history has little impact on the pore occupancy in a mixed wet rock finally we observe that at fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 after gas injection fig 6i only oil and water exist in the pore space there is no gas this will be discussed in more detail in section 3 6 nonetheless we notice that a large fraction of oil has now moved into larger pores compared to before gas injection fig 6a we attribute this to the preferential displacement of gas by oil as we will show in section 4 9 4 4 connectivity here we qualitatively and quantitatively assess the fluid connectivity on the segmented pore scale images in flow steps 3 8 and 12 see table 1 for their respective fractional flows it was impossible to examine the fluid connectivity in the three phase steady state images as they could not be segmented due to the occurrence of intermittent gas oil and oil water flow as explained in section 2 4 fig 7 shows the in situ three dimensional connectivity of water oil and gas a wide range of colours represents a poorly connected phase while a narrow colour distribution indicates that the phase is well connected furthermore the volume normalized euler characteristic of each phase is quoted to quantitatively evaluate its connectivity herring et al 2015 2013 mecke and wagner 1991 vogel and kretzschmar 1996 vogel 2002 a large positive euler characteristic means that the phase is trapped into many discrete ganglia while a large negative euler characteristic implies a phase that is interconnected with many loops we observe that at fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 before gas injection oil is more connected than water see fig 7a supported by the negative euler characterstic 328 mm 3 this implies that oil exists in thin wetting layers in the corners and therefore confirms that it is more wetting to the surface than water however the euler characteristic of oil is still not in the range of euler numbers measured on weakly and strongly oil wet rocks from the same reservoir where the oil number was much smaller than 1000 mm 3 alhosani et al 2021 2021 this suggests that the rock surfaces are indeed mixed wet at fg 1 see fig 7b both water and gas appear disconnected with positive euler number while the oil connectivity is significantly improved the enhanced oil connectivity under three phase conditions is attributed to the spreading of oil in connected layers in the presence of gas as seen previously in water wet experiments scanziani et al 2019 2018 alhosani et al 2021 in contrast gas exists in disconnected clusters even when injected alone in the mixed wet system unlike the water wet case alhosani et al 2021 this behaviour has significant implications for gas storage applications it means that the re injection of water to trap gas is unnecessary this gas behaviour has been previously observed in oil wet rocks extracted from the same reservoir under unsteady state conditions alhosani et al 2020 2021 furthermore at three phase steady state conditions we suspect that all three phases have a poor connectivity due to their intermittent behaviour this can lead to each phase having a dynamic connectivity where it is momentarily connected and then disconnected at steady state conditions 4 5 specific interfacial areas the fluid fluid and fluid solid specific interfacial areas area per unit total volume pore and grain were measured only on the segmented images of the sample see fig 8 the oil water interfacial area remains almost constant under two and three phase conditions with values around 1 mm 1 see fig 8a the same behaviour was observed for the area between oil and water in the water wet system alhosani et al 2021 this is because oil and water are respectively the most and intermediate wetting phases in both systems the oil water area is dominated by their contact in the smaller sized pores next to the solid surface the water solid and oil solid interfacial areas are the largest see fig 8b and c with the oil solid area being slightly higher this indicates that there are more oil wet regions compared to water wet regions in the mixed wet pore space in contrast the gas solid area is much lower this is ascribed to oil spreading around gas reducing its contact with the solid surface furthermore oil spreading prevents any direct contact between gas and water the gas oil interfacial area is higher than that of the oil water under three phase conditions fg 1 with values around 2 mm 1 see fig 8a and e this is a consequence of the spreading of oil in layers around gas in the large pores it was not possible to determine the dependence of fluid fluid and fluid solid interfacial areas on the saturation history since the three phase steady state images could not be segmented 4 6 saturation the gas oil and water saturations in the macro pores were quantified directly from the raw two and three phase steady state images using the approach described in section 2 4 1 see fig 9 this calculation gives a range of gas and water saturations for each three phase steady state image represented by the line connecting the black circles in fig 9 therefore to obtain the average saturation across the whole sample we assume it is the mid point of that range shown in red circles fig 9 is divided into two parts part a shows the saturations for the increasing fg and decreasing fo and fw flow path while part b shows the saturations for the decreasing fg and increasing fo and fw path the saturations from the segmented images in flow steps 2 3 8 and 12 see table 1 for their fractional flows are also plotted shown in black squares on average fig 9 displays that there is a good agreement between the saturations obtained from the raw and segmented images with an uncertainty of 5 however for consistency we will only quote the saturations obtained from the raw images in the text the first step of the experiment involved the injection of water into the oil saturated sample at fw 1 to reach the remaining oil saturation in the mixed wet system while a value of 0 34 may seem high it is still much lower than the values reached in the same reservoir rock but under oil wet conditions where the irreducible oil saturations were 0 54 and 0 61 alhosani et al 2020 2021 again this behaviour confirms that our system is mixed wet after that oil and water were injected at fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 and the initial saturations of oil and water before gas injection were 0 58 and 0 42 respectively at the first three phase steady state condition the gas saturation was 0 12 with oil and water saturations of 0 53 and 0 35 respectively see fig 9a as the gas fractional flow was increased finally reaching fg 1 the maximum gas saturation only reached 0 32 with 0 49 and 0 19 oil and water saturations respectively the first observation here is that the gas saturation never exceeds 0 32 despite increasing the gas flow rate this has been previously seen in other unsteady state and steady state three phase flow imaging studies scanziani et al 2019 2020 alhosani et al 2020 2021b alhosani et al 2021c scanziani et al 2018 hence we suggest that under three phase capillary dominated conditions with immiscible gas and oil phases the maximum gas saturation that can be reached in this reservoir rock is approximately 32 40 regardless of the rock wettability the second observation at fg 1 is the high remaining oil saturation see fig 9a we note that gas mainly replaces water in this mixed wet rock which will be discussed in more detail in section 3 9 as the flow path is reversed decreasing fg and increasing fo and fw the gas saturation decreases and the oil and water saturations increase see fig 9b this suggests that unlike the water wet system alhosani et al 2021 gas does not get trapped in the pore centres by oil and water instead it is produced as more oil and water are injected while there is a hysteresis in the saturation path of the two flow paths in the mixed wet experiment we conclude that fluid saturations are less impacted by the saturation history compared to the water wet system alhosani et al 2021 more significantly we observe that the gas saturation in the resolvable macro pores reaches zero when the gas injection is stopped at fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 see fig 9b i e no gas is trapped in the mixed wet system this implies that the stored gas can escape in the case of a water re injection in mixed wet reservoir we will discuss this in more detail in section 3 10 fig 10 shows the saturation profiles across the sample obtained from the segmented images in flow steps 2 3 8 and 12 see table 1 for their respective fractional flows while a saturation gradient is seen in 3 of the 4 cases there is no evidence for a significant capillary end effect retention of the wetting phase at the outlet x l 1 4 7 three phase relative permeability we recorded the pressure drop across the sample at two and three phase steady state conditions to calculate the relative permeabilities in our mixed wet reservoir rock see section 2 4 2 the measured pressures were stable in two phase flow but continuously fluctuated between two pressure values in three phase steady state conditions we believe that these fluctuations are caused by the intermittent behaviour of fluids which continuously altered the pressure needed for displacement at steady state conditions the pressure fluctuations are significantly larger in the mixed wet system compared to the water wet one alhosani et al 2021 we attribute this behaviour to the larger fraction of oil water intermittency in the mixed wet system furthermore these observations imply that true steady state conditions are never attained at the pore scale in three phase flow and that the fluid arrangement is constantly fluctuating between locations of local capillary equilibrium nonetheless the average of the two pressure values between which the pressure drop fluctuated was used to calculate the three phase relative permeabilities at all the fractional flows fig 11 shows measurements of gas oil and water three phase relative permeabilities in the mixed wet system for the increasing fg decreasing fo and fw and decreasing fg increasing fo and fw flow paths the relative permeability of each phase is plotted as a function of its own saturation the fluid saturations in the macro pores were obtained directly from the raw pore scale images as described in section 3 6 the water relative permeability is lower than that of oil but higher than gas see fig 11 the low water relative permeability is attributed to the poor water connectivity as shown in section 3 4 water flow is limited to medium sized pores as shown in the pore occupancy section 3 3 in contrast the oil relative permeability is highest due to its improved connectivity in wetting and spreading layers see fig 11c fig 11b shows that the gas relative permeability is very low this is ascribed to two reasons i gas progresses in the form of disconnected clusters in the pore centres and ii gas invasion is mostly limited to pores occupied by oil as we will show in section 3 9 fig 11c shows that the saturation history has a little impact on the oil relative permeability this is expected since oil is considered the most wetting phase in our system oil flows in smaller pores and spreading layers regardless of the flow path on the other hand water and gas relative permeabilities show a clear dependency on the saturation history since their flow is impacted by the relative presence of another phase in the medium and large pores 4 8 capillary pressures the capillary pressures pc were calculated from the interfacial curvature κij between the fluid pairs using the young laplace law blunt 2017 armstrong et al 2012 akai et al 2019 pc ij σijκij the interfaces between the fluids were constructed and smoothed kernel size 5 from the segmented images in flow steps 3 8 and 12 see table 1 before measuring their curvatures fig 12 shows the measured oil water and gas oil capillary pressures in the mixed wet rock it was not possible to measure the gas water capillary pressure since spreading oil layers prevented direct gas water contact the two and three phase oil water capillary pressures are negative with values around 0 5 kpa demonstrating the dominance of oil wet regions over water wet regions in the mixed wet reservoir sample see fig 12a the two phase oil water capillary pressure is slightly higher after gas injection denoted by subscript a in fig 12a compared to that from before denoted by subscript b we attribute this behaviour to the shift in oil pore occupancy to larger pores after gas injection as we have shown in section 3 3 as expected the gas oil capillary pressure is positive with values around 0 25 kpa indicating that oil is wetting to gas see fig 12b 4 9 three phase displacements we quantify the fluid fluid displacement when moving from one steady state condition to another on the raw pore scale images as described in section 2 4 3 similar to pore occupancy we consider the existence of five phases in the pores of the rock gas oil water gas oil intermittency and oil water intermittency figs 13 14 and 15 show the displacement in the pores filled with gas gas oil intermittency and oil at different fractional flows respectively fig 13a and b show that during the increasing fg and decreasing fo and fw flow path the gas filled pores represented by the dotted black line remain mostly occupied by gas there is very little displacement of gas as fg increases in contrast when fg is decreased and fo and fw are increased fig 13c we notice that gas is mostly displaced by oil especially when gas injection stops fig 13d gas is produced since it does not get trapped in the pore centres the displacement of gas by oil is piston like while one would expect a percolation like displacement with snap off we suspect that it is suppressed by the mixed wet nature of the surface which prevents continuous oil flow and snap off of gas by oil the preferential displacement of gas by oil shifts the oil occupancy towards larger pores as seen in section 4 3 fig 14 shows the displacement in the gas oil intermittency filled pores at different fractional flows we observe that as fg is increased and fo and fw are decreased most of the gas oil intermittency occupied pores are filled with gas see fig 14a and b in contrast when fg is decreased and fo and fw are increased the gas oil intermittency occupied pores become filled with oil this suggests that intermittent regions of the pore space are transitional occupancies waiting for displacement to occur in the direction of the phase with the increasing fractional flow in the case of oil water intermittency the intermittent pores were equally displaced by oil and water at different fractional flows regardless of the flow path this is because the oil and water flow rates were kept in the same direction and had the same value throughout the experiment see table 1 for the flow rates the change in the oil water intermittency filled pores is shown in fig s4 in the supplementary material the displacement in oil filled pores during the increasing fg and decreasing fo and fw flow path is shown in fig 15a and b oil is mostly displaced by gas however this contradicts the saturation results in section 3 6 where mostly the water saturation decreased as the gas saturation increased this phenomenon will be explained later in this section furthermore we note that most of the oil displacement occurs in the bigger pores there is a little displacement of oil in the smallest pores this is due to the strongly oil wet nature of the smaller pores that are filled with oil in our mixed wet system where a very high capillary pressure is needed to displace the oil out as fg is decreased and fo and fw are increased oil is mostly displaced now by water or oil water intermittency see fig 15c and d on the other hand water is mostly displaced by oil or oil water intermittency regardless of the flow path direction as shown in fig s5 in the supplementary material to summarize this section when fg is increased and fo and fw are decreased oil is mostly displaced by gas and water is displaced by oil whereas when fg is decreased and fo and fw are increased gas is mostly displaced oil oil is displaced by water and water is displaced by oil from this we can explain why as fg is increased and fo and fw are decreased the water saturation decreases considerably as the gas saturation is increased although gas mostly displaces oil as gas invades the pore space it mainly displaces oil in the largest pores the displaced oil then moves to mobilize water in smaller pores the mobilized water then gets produced at the next fractional flow gas invades the newly invaded pores by oil displacing oil out and forcing it to mobilize water in even smaller pores until the irreducible water saturation is reached at a gas fractional flow of one this process is reversed when fg is decreased and fo and fw are increased now oil displaces gas from the smaller pores first this is accompanied by displacement of oil by water either in intermediate sized pores or large pores where oil displaced gas the displaced gas gets produced flowing through the largest pores this continues until there is no more gas in the pore space while gas can directly displace oil and vice versa water and gas can only displace each other in a double displacement process mediated by oil i e gas oil water and water oil gas double displacement processes 4 10 trapping and implications for co2 storage fig 16 shows the fluid arrangements in a single pore before during and after gas injection in the mixed wet rock before gas injection oil existed in thin wetting layers in the corners of the pores as expected for mixed wet media see fig 16a once gas was injected fig 16b the oil connectivity significantly improved as seen in section 3 4 the thickness of oil layers increased as it spread between gas and water once gas injection was stopped at fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 oil and water completely displaced gas from the pore centre there is no gas trapping except possibly in smaller pores below the resolution of the images we attribute this behaviour to the mixed wet nature of the surface where neither oil nor water can completely surround the gas phase preventing snap off and capillary trapping this work illustrates the impact that pore scale displacement can have on field scale carbon dioxide storage while this observation needs to be confirmed for other samples the absence of gas trapping in macro pores does have significant implications on the design of co2 storage in depleted oil reservoirs with a mixed wettability state it shows that the widely implemented water alternating gas wag injection strategy in oil reservoirs may not be ideal for secure co2 storage while the strategy is well known for increasing the oil recovery this work shows that it can lead to recycling of the injected co2 as it continuously gets produced we suggest that an injection strategy of continuous co2 injection is in fact better for secure storage in mixed wet reservoirs this is for two reasons i co2 naturally gets disconnected when injected as we have shown in section 3 4 this restricts its flow conductance in the reservoir and ii the injection of large amounts of water after co2 injection mobilizes co2 in the reservoir producing significant quantities of the stored co2 5 conclusions we have presented steady state measurements of three phase relative permeability combined with high resolution pore scale x ray imaging 5 36 µm per voxel for a carbonate reservoir rock with a mixed wettability state the experiment was performed under capillary dominated immiscible gas oil conditions we investigated the impact of a saturation history where the gas fractional flow is first increased and then decreased on flow properties oil and water fractional flows were kept the same and changed in the opposite direction to gas the use of pore scale imaging allowed us to characterize simultaneously with relative permeability the in situ contact angles pore occupancy connectivity interfacial areas capillary pressures saturations displacement processes and trapping the mixed wet nature of the rock surfaces achieved through contact with crude oil at conditions of high temperature and pressure was confirmed by calculating the two phase geometric oil water contact angle which had a value of 82o 42o post gas injection the gas oil oil water and gas water contact angles were 66o 41o 80o 41o and 78o 40o respectively while it was not possible to determine a clear wettability order from the contact angle measurements the averaged pore occupancy results demonstrated that at different fractional flows oil occupied the smallest pores water intermediate pores and gas the largest pores suggesting an oil water gas wettability order from most to least wetting this wettability order was further supported by the negative oil water and positive gas oil local capillary pressures a negative oil water pressure illustrates that there are more oil wet regions compared to water wet regions in the pore space no gas water capillary was calculated since oil spread in layers between gas and water preventing their direct contact we observed intermittent flow regions between gas and oil and oil and water at three phase steady state flow despite having capillary dominated conditions the pores that were intermittently occupied were filled with the phase with the increasing fractional flow at the next steady state condition while intermittent flow at capillary conditions was previously observed in a three phase water wet system alhosani et al 2021 here it is more frequent and occupies a larger fraction of the pore space in particular the oil water intermittency is significant both oil water and gas oil intermittently occupied pores of similar size i e intermediate sized pores we identify a distinct gas flow pattern where gas advances in the form of disconnected ganglia mediated by double and multiple displacement processes oil was the only connected phase since it forms connected wetting and spreading layers water existed in disconnected clusters the oil relative permeability was the highest in the pore space followed by water then gas the high oil relative permeability is associated with its improved connectivity in contrast gas has a low relative permeability given that it is disconnected and its flow in the larger pores is blocked by water the impact of saturation history on gas and water relative permeabilities was larger than its impact on the oil relative permeability as the gas fractional flow was increased oil and water flows decreased gas mainly displaced oil and oil displaced water when the flow path was reversed oil replaced gas in the larger pores and water displaced oil in the medium sized pores oil was shifted to larger pores after gas injection while gas can directly displace oil and vice versa water and gas can only displace each other in a double displacement process mediated by oil i e gas oil water and water oil gas double displacement processes surprisingly to within the resolution of the images there appeared to be no gas trapped when gas injection was stopped we attributed this behaviour to the mixed wet nature of the surface which prevents both oil and water from completely surrounding gas and capillary trapping it in the pore centres these outcomes suggest that the subsequent water injection after gas is not ideal for gas storage applications instead a continuous injection of gas only can ensure safe trapping as gas is naturally disconnected upon injection in the reservoir future work should focus on quantifying the steady state three phase relative permeability combined with imaging in a wider range of samples and for strongly oil wet rocks to examine the impact of an oil gas water from most to least wetting wettability order on relative permeability this will also provide insights into intermittency showing whether intermittent flow is as frequent as it is in a mixed wet system future experiments should consider investigating the impact of different flow paths to have a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between saturation history and relative permeability the impact of reaching near miscible gas oil conditions could be investigated furthermore the outcomes of this study indicate that an intermittent flow behaviour must be incorporated when modeling steady state three phase flow experiments moreover the limited gas relative permeability is a feature that needs to be incorporated in current three phase relative permeability models author statement a a led the experimental work alongside a s under the supervision of m j b and b b s f

59,we use three dimensional x ray imaging to investigate steady state three phase flow in a mixed wet reservoir rock while measuring both relative permeability and capillary pressure oil occupied the smallest pores gas the biggest while water occupied medium sized pores we report a distinct flow pattern where gas flows in the form of disconnected ganglia by periodically opening critical flow pathways despite having capillary controlled displacements a significant fraction of the pore space was intermittently occupied by gas oil and oil water phases both types of intermittency occurred in intermediate sized pores gas mainly displaces oil and oil displaces water as the gas flow rate is increased while oil displaces gas and water displaces oil as gas flow is decreased at the resolution of the images no detectable gas was trapped in the rock due to its mixed wettability which prevents either oil or water completely surrounding gas suppressing snap off and capillary trapping which has

energy source and therefore continue to play a dominant role in atmospheric co2 emissions bp statistical review of world energy 2021 allen et al 2019 a solution where the produced co2 emissions are captured and stored eliminating their impact on climate change is therefore a practical and feasible component of efforts to prevent dangerous climate change bui et al 2018 bickle 2009 alcalde et al

injection can recover additional amounts of oil from depleted oilfields providing the financial incentive needed to implement ccs brownsort et al 2015 blunt et al 1993 lake 1989 when co2 is injected in oilfields there is a simultaneous flow of three fluid phases oil water and gas in the pore space of the reservoir therefore in order to maximize the amount of co2 stored and oil recovered in the reservoir we need to improve our understanding of the pore scale physics governing three phase flow blunt 2017 the recent deployment of x ray microtomography has accelerated our understanding of multiphase flow in porous media blunt 2017 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 blunt et al 2013 cnudde and boone 2013 brown et al 2014 bultreys et al 2016 the use of three dimensional x ray imaging has made it possible to visualize the flow of fluids inside micron sized pore spaces to quantify pore scale flow properties examples of these properties include in situ contact angles interfacial areas

phase flow properties through the simultaneous determination of relative permeability and capillary pressure in systems with various wettabilities lin et al 2018 2021 alhammadi et al 2020 gao et al 2020 furthermore it has helped delineate the boundary between linear darcy flow and the non linear intermittent flow regime gao et al 2020 2017 zhang et al 2021 spurin et al 2019a 2019b gao et al 2021 a linear relationship exists between pressure gradient and flow rate in the darcy regime as opposed to the intermittent one for which a power law scaling is found zhang et al 2021 in two phase flow fluids flow through fixed pathways in the darcy regime where capillary forces are dominant while a more dynamic periodically disconnected pathway exists in the intermittent flow regime gao et al 2020 2021 spurin et al 2019 in three phase flow x ray imaging has been mostly performed during unsteady state experiments scanziani et al 2018 2020 alhosani et al 2019 2020 2021a 2021b qin et al 2019 iglauer et al 2019 scanziani et al 2018 it was not until recently that alhosani et al 2021 successfully combined imaging with steady state three phase flow in a water wet bentheimer sandstone acquiring measurements of three phase relative permeabilities and capillary pressures the authors discovered a unique flow pattern that is gas the most non wetting phase progressed through the pore space in the form of disconnected clusters by periodically opening critical flow pathways alhosani et al 2021 despite flowing under capillary dominated conditions intermittent gas oil and oil water phases were observed in the pore scale images this a distinct characteristic of three phase flow made possible by double and multiple displacement events where one displaced fluid phase can progress to displace another phase or multiple phases in the pore space however further work is needed to investigate the impact of wettability on steady state three phase flow in this work we use x ray imaging to investigate three phase steady state flow in a mixed wet reservoir rock extracted from a large producing field in the middle east we study a saturation history where the gas fractional flow is first increased and then decreased our experiment is performed under capillary dominated immiscible gas oil conditions similar to previous work alhosani et al 2021 a mixed wettability state where the oil water contact angle θow is distributed both above and below 90o is more representative of oil reservoirs where the existence of crude oil in parts of the pore space at conditions of high temperature and pressure over long periods of time renders some of the rock surfaces oil wet blunt 2017 in our experiment we measure three phase relative permeabilities by recording the pressure drop across the sample at steady state conditions for each set of gas oil and water fractional flows we determine the saturations directly from the raw pore scale images without performing image segmentation by extending the saturation analysis introduced by lin et al 2021 from two to three phases we present a new image analysis technique to quantify the displacement of each phase when moving from one steady state condition to another in addition we determine capillary pressures pore occupancies layer formation interfacial areas contact angles and fluid connectivity we end with a discussion of the implications of this work on the design of carbon dioxide storage in oil reservoirs the averaged pore occupancy results indicate that the wettability order in our mixed wet reservoir rock is oil water gas from most to least wetting we observe disconnected gas flow across the system at steady state conditions similar to the observations of alhosani et al 2021 for a water wet rock although displacements were capillary controlled we identified intermittent gas oil and oil water regions where the phases alternatively filled the same pores unlike the water wet system oil water intermittency is more significant here as the gas fractional flow was increased gas only filled the pores that were previously occupied by oil and gas was mostly displaced by oil as the fractional flow was decreased this work further supports previous work alhosani et al 2021 that pore scale steady state conditions may never be attained in three phase flow despite macroscopically having a constant averaged saturation hence when we talk about steady state conditions we do not refer to a fixed configuration of fluids at the pore scale but more a dynamic situation where while there are local fluctuations on the pore scale arrangement of the phases associated with rapid fluctuations in pressure drop across the system when averaged over the period of a few hours there is no trend or change in the average pressure drop or the average saturation more significantly at the image resolution we observed no gas trapping in this mixed wet reservoir rock after gas injection has stopped when only water and oil were injected fg 0 and fw o 0 5 this is different to the water wet system where a significant amount of gas was trapped in the pore centres surrounded by oil and water layers alhosani et al 2021 this behaviour was ascribed to the mixed wet nature of the surface which prevented either oil or water from completely surrounding the gas phase in the pore centres this work suggests that a water alternating gas wag injection strategy may not be favourable for carbon dioxide storage in oilfields since it can mobilize the gas possibly leading to its escape instead an injection strategy of continuous gas injection is more effective since gas naturally gets disconnected once injection stops there is no need to inject water to trap the gas 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock and fluid properties the rock sample selected was a reservoir carbonate extracted from a large producing oilfield in the middle east with a total porosity of 24 4 characterised using differential imaging lin et al 2016 and an absolute permeability k of 668 30 md 6 6 10 13 0 3 10 13 m2 measured at the experimental conditions these properties are typical for the reservoir as a whole the mineralogically calcite dominated sample was 42 9 mm in length and 12 3 mm in diameter the pore and throat size distributions of the sample are plotted in fig s1 in the supplementary material the experimental fluids used to replicate gas oil and water phases were nitrogen n2 n decane c10h22 and deionized water h2o respectively the oil and water phases were mixed with 20 wt iododecane c10h21i and 30 wt sodium iodide nai respectively in a process known as doping to increase the contrast between the four phases rock gas oil and water in the x ray images at the experimental conditions 1 mpa pore pressure and 30 c temperature the dynamic viscosities of gas oil and water were 0 017 4 27 and 1 40 mpa s respectively alhosani et al 2021 nist 2019 gas and oil were immiscible with an interfacial tension of 11 2 mn m 1 alhosani et al 2021 the interfacial tensions between gas and water and oil and water were 63 7 and 52 1 mn m 1 respectively nist 2019 these conditions are lower pressure and temperature than typical field conditions the aim of this study though is to examine displacement processes rather than replicate a specific reservoir situation in our three phase system oil has a positive initial spreading coefficient alhosani et al 2021 cso 0 4 mn m 1 calculated using csi σjk σij σik where i j and k denote the three fluid phases which indicates oil will spread in layers sandwiched between gas and water in the rock pore space as we will show later gas and water both have a negative spreading coefficient 2 2 wettability alteration process prior to performing the steady state experiment the rock wettability was rendered mixed wet this process restores the initially water wet state of the cleaned rock sample to conditions likely to be representative of subsurface conditions mixed wettability means that certain parts of the pore space are water wet θow 90o while the rest is oil wet θow 90o blunt 2017 the wettability of a rock surface can be changed by placing it in contact with crude oil at high temperatures and pressures during which asphaltene precipitation takes place alhammadi et al 2017 alhosani et al 2020 salathiel 1973 kovscek et al 1993 asphaltenes deposition renders some of the solid surfaces oil wet the wettability alteration process is also known as ageing to alter the wettability of the reservoir rock we first saturated the rock sample with formation brine a brine solution prepared with the same salt composition as the reservoir brine from which the rock was extracted then 100 pore volumes pv of crude oil from the same reservoir were injected at ambient conditions into the pore space with a flowrate of 0 1 ml min the injection of crude oil at a low flowrate is necessary to ensure that not all the formation brine is swept out and that some pores remain brine occupied i e remain water wet to achieve mixed wettability the sample was then taken out and placed in a crude oil bath at 80 c for two months the middle eastern crude oil has a density and viscosity of 812 kg m 3 and 1 94 mpa s respectively measured at 60 c and 8 mpa and is composed of 55 23 saturates 38 07 aromatics 6 22 resins and 0 46 asphaltenes alhammadi et al 2017 3 experimental procedure after establishing the mixed wet wettability state the sample was prepared for the steady state three phase imaging experiment a schematic of the three phase flow and x ray imaging apparatus is shown in fig 1 the sample was first wrapped with aluminium foil and inserted into a viton rubber tubing the viton tubing was then connected to the injection and production ends of the coreholder see fig 1 a full description of the x ray transparent three phase steady state peek coreholder design can be found elsewhere alhosani et al 2021 a keller pd 33x pressure transducer with an accuracy of 0 03 kpa was connected to the inlet and outlet of the sample to record the pressure drop during the experiment the flow cell was then placed in a zeiss xradia 510 x ray scanner for pore scale image acquisition throughout the flow experiment five teledyne isco pumps were used in the experiment to inject the three fluid phases and apply confining and back pressures the three fluid phases were injected from the bottom of the sample a net confining pressure of 2 mpa was applied while the back pressure was set to 1 mpa the experiment was conducted at a temperature of 30 c in the three phase flow experiment steady state conditions were reached at various gas oil and water fractional flows fg fo and fw by keeping the fluid flow rates constant with a total flow rate of qt 0 8 ml min 1 the sets of fractional flows are listed in table 1 the selection of fractional flows was done prudently to investigate the impact of a saturation history where the gas saturation is first increased and then decreased on three phase relative permeability this saturation history is typically encountered in oil reservoirs lake 1989 furthermore to avoid any switch from drainage to imbibition displacements between oil and water we keep the oil and water saturation changes in the same direction by keeping oil and water flow rates the same and change the gas saturation in the opposite direction oak 1990 alizadeh and piri 2014 oak et al 1990 saraf et al 1982 alizadeh and piri 2014 the minimum waiting time for each set of fractional flows to reach steady state conditions was at least 12 hr after which we waited for the differential pressure signal to stabilize over a period of 3 hr to record the pressure drop and start the x ray imaging process in flow step 1 see table 1 oil 80 wt n decane and 20 wt iododecane was injected into the sample to replace the crude oil introduced during the wettability alteration process water was then injected in step 2 to reach the residual or remaining oil saturation in step 3 both oil and water were injected simultaneously fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 to initialize the sample for the three phase steady state experiment gas was first injected into the sample in step 4 five three phase steady state conditions were reached as fg was increased steps 4 5 6 7 and 8 while only three steady state conditions were reached when fg was decreased steps 9 10 and 11 at fg 1 step 8 after reaching steady state conditions at qg 0 8 ml min 1 the gas flow rate was then increased to 2 ml min 1 to reach the maximum gas saturation and minimize the capillary end effect in the sample the absolute permeability k 668 30 md 6 6 10 13 0 3 10 13 m2 of the sample was measured using deionized water h2o prior to altering the wettability of the rock at the experimental conditions a dry scan and a high contrast water saturated scan were also acquired at this point to characterize the porosity distribution including sub resolution porosity of the sample using the differential imaging method lin et al 2016 the fluids were injected at low flow rates to ensure that displacements occur under capillary dominated conditions representative of field scale flows capillary controlled displacements are typically characterized by low capillary numbers ca blunt 2017 for any fluid pair caij μi q i σij where σij is the interfacial tension between the two phases μi is the viscosity of the displacing fluid and q i is its darcy velocity table 2 lists the capillary numbers between the gas oil and oil water fluid pairs at each set of fractional flows since oil has an initial positive spreading coefficient cso 0 4 mn m 1 see section 2 1 we expect it to spread in layers between gas and water preventing their direct displacement three dimensional images of the whole sample were acquired with a voxel size of 5 36 µm using the zeiss versa 510 scanner after reaching steady state conditions at each set of fractional flows to capture the whole length images of size 12 45 mm 12 45 mm 10 23 mm were taken at four different locations of the sample with an overlap of 25 the x ray source energy and power were set to 80 kev and 7 w respectively and a large flat panel was employed at the detector side the exposure time was set to 1 60 s with a total of 3 201 projections taken at all sets of fractional flows all the pore scale images were then reconstructed normalized registered and stitched as shown in figs 2 and 3 3 1 image processing and analysis as mentioned in the introduction we observe that a large fraction of the pore space is occupied by gas oil and oil water phases intermittently at three phase steady state conditions intermittency can take any grey scale value in between the grey scale values of the two intermittent phases this makes image segmentation almost impossible and even if segmented there would be eight different phases in the image including rock water oil gas gas from gas oil intermittency oil from gas oil intermittency oil from oil water intermittency and water from oil water intermittency therefore we decided not to segment the three phase steady state images with significant intermittency and instead perform image analysis directly on the raw images the analysis performed on the raw three phase images includes saturation pore occupancy and displacement nonetheless there was no little intermittency in the pore scale images acquired in flow steps 2 3 8 and 12 see table 1 hence these images were segmented using the seeded watershed algorithm and used for the analysis of contact angles capillary pressures interfacial areas and connectivity we also characterize the saturations in the segmented images and compare them to the saturations obtained directly from the raw images see the next section the segmentation procedure is detailed in fig s2 in the supplementary material 3 1 1 saturation from grey scale images since it was not possible to segment the three phase steady state images we used an approach developed by lin et al 2021 to find the fluid saturations directly from the raw unsegmented pore scale images we extend this approach from two to three fluid phases here fluid saturations are determined using their grey scale values in the pore scale images in this approach the saturation of the intermittent region is added to the saturation of their respective phases e g the contributions to the saturations of oil from gas oil and oil water intermittent regions are added to the oil saturation we only considered the fluid saturations in the macro porosity porosity that was explicitly resolved in the images please refer to lin et al 2021 for the calculation of two phase saturations directly from the pore scale images the saturations in the macro porosity at each set of three phase fractional flows were obtained as follows 1 c t f w f o f g s w c t w s o c t o s g c t g where c t f w f o f g is the average grey scale value in the macro porosity of the three phase steady state image at each set of fractional flows ctw is the average grey scale value in the macro porosity of the water saturated image cto is the average grey scale value in the macro porosity of the fully oil saturated image acquired after flow step 1 see table 1 and ctg is the average grey scale value in the macro porosity of a fully gas saturated image dry scan sw so and sg refer to the water oil and gas saturations respectively now if we substitute so 1 sw sg eq 1 can be re written as 2 s w c t o c t f w f o f g s g c t g s g c t o c t o c t w while ctw cto and ctg are constant c t f w f o f g changes depending on the fluid saturations in the macro porosity of each three phase steady state image eq 2 can be solved linearly giving a range of sw and sg values we limit this range by the minimum and maximum water and gas saturations that are obtained from the segmented images in flow steps 3 8 and 12 finally the water and gas saturations are obtained by taking the mid point of their narrowed ranges at each set of fractional flows oil saturation is then found from so 1 sw sg 3 1 2 relative permeability the gas oil and water relative permeabilities were calculated using the multiphase darcy law assuming a linear relationship between flow rate and pressure gradient blunt 2017 3 k r w q w μ w l δ p k 4 k r o q o μ o l δ p k 5 k r g q g μ g l δ p k where kr is the relative permeability dimensionless k is the permeability m2 µ is the viscosity pa s q is the darcy velocity flow rate per unit area m s 1 δp is the pressure drop pa and l is the sample length m subscripts g o and w refer to the gas oil and water phases respectively given that the pressure fluctuations were large at three phase steady state conditions the average pressure drop was used to calculate the relative permeabilities 3 1 3 displacement analysis to quantitatively assess the displacement processes in the three phase mixed wet system when moving from one steady state condition to another we developed an in house algorithm that identifies the pores and throats occupied by a certain phase at each set of fractional flows fg i fo i and fw i and then records the phases that occupy the same pores and throats at the next set of fractional flows fg i 1 fo i 1 and fw i 1 displacement is said to have taken place if the occupancy in the pore changes from one steady state condition to another we use the network model code developed by dong and blunt 2009 and raeini et al 2017 to extract the pores and throats from the dry scan of the sample pores are defined as wide regions of the pore space that are connected by narrower regions the throats the pore diameter is the diameter of the largest sphere that can fit entirely in the pore while the throat diameter is the diameter of the largest sphere that sits on the throat centre we assume that the macro pore space can be occupied by five phases i gas ii oil iii water iv gas oil intermittency and v oil water intermittency at all three phase steady state conditions for simplicity we consider the intermittent regions as a single phase to determine the occupancy in the pores we first set a range of grey scale values for each phase as shown in fig s3 in the supplementary material then we find the average grey scale value in the sphere we have extracted from the pores depending on what range the average grey scale value falls in the occupancy is assigned 4 results and discussion in this section we first measure the geometric fluid fluid contact angles to confirm the mixed wettability state of the reservoir rock section 3 1 then in section 3 2 we show evidence of intermittent gas oil and oil water flow at three phase steady state conditions we quantify pore occupancy in section 3 3 to determine the wettability order in the system in sections 3 4 and 3 5 the connectivity of the fluids and interfacial areas are examined respectively saturations are then quantified in section 3 6 and plotted against the measurements of three phase relative permeabilities in section 3 7 capillary pressures are characterized in section 3 8 in section 3 9 fluid fluid displacements in the three phase mixed wet system are analyzed finally in section 3 10 we examine gas trapping and discuss the implications of pore scale properties on the design of field scale co2 storage and oil recovery 4 1 wettability the oil water θow gas oil θgo and gas water θgw geometric contact angles were measured on subvolumes of size 2 68 mm 2 68 mm 2 68 mm on the segmented images see section 2 4 and table 1 for the fractional flows of the segmented images the geometric angles were measured using the automated method developed by alratrout et al 2017 see fig 4 fig 4a shows measurements of the oil water contact angle at two phase flow conditions fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 measured before and after gas injection at the end of the experiment denoted by subscripts b and a respectively we observe that θow has a wide distribution with angles both lower and higher than 90o indicating the local existence of both water wet and oil wet regions which is the defining characteristic of mixed wet media blunt 2017 the mean oil water contact angles before and after gas injection are 82o 42o and 84o 39o respectively this confirms that the wettability alteration protocol successfully achieved mixed wet conditions in contrast a dynamic ageing protocol previously performed on the same reservoir rock in multiple studies resulted in more oil wet conditions with mean oil water contact angles of 112o 21o 118o 25o and 110o 20o alhosani et al 2020b 2020c 2021 at fg 1 the measured mean oil water contact angle is 80o 41o see fig 4b the consistency of the values indicates that the contact angle does not change within the uncertainty of the measurements during and after gas injection the gas oil and gas water contact angles are 66o 41o and 78o 40o respectively suggesting that both oil and water are more wetting to the surface than gas however it is not possible to determine a clear wettability order in the system using the geometric contact angle measurements only 4 2 three phase intermittency as mentioned previously a large fraction of the pore space becomes occupied by gas oil and oil water phases intermittently at three phase steady state conditions during which the two intermittent phases alternatively occupy the same pores intermittency is manifested in an intermediate grey scale value in between the grey scale values of the two intermittent phases as shown in fig 5 this pore scale phenomenon has been previously observed in two phase flow albeit in the non linear flow regime gao et al 2020 2017 spurin et al 2019 2019 reynolds et al 2017 gao et al 2019 nonetheless it was also seen in a three phase water wet system under capillary controlled conditions alhosani et al 2021 fig 5 shows the existence of two intermittent regions in the mixed wet pore space i a gas oil region and ii an oil water region we do not observe intermittent gas water regions since the two phases do not come in direct contact due to the presence of oil layers in contrast to the water wet system where gas oil intermittency was clearly more dominant alhosani et al 2021 the oil water and gas oil intermittencies both occupy significant fractions of the pore space in the mixed wet system this is supported by the pore occupancy analysis in the next section 4 3 pore occupancy we characterized the pore occupancy the size of the pores occupied by each fluid phase directly from the raw two and three phase steady state images of the whole sample see fig 6 in two phase flow we divided the pore space into three phases i oil ii water and iii oil water intermittency while we assigned five phases under three phase steady state conditions i gas ii oil iii water iv gas oil intermittency and v oil water intermittency we extract the pores using the pore network model extraction dong and blunt 2009 raeini et al 2017 and then assign a unique occupancy dependent on the average grey scale value in the pore each phase is given a grey scale value range and if the average value in the pore falls within this range then the pore is considered to be occupied by that phase see section 2 4 3 fig 6a shows that at fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 before gas injection on average oil flows in pores smaller than those occupied by water which suggests that oil is more wetting to the rock than water it is favorable for the most wetting phase to reside close to the surface nonetheless oil also flows in a large fraction of the big pores as well away from the solid surfaces this is ascribed to the mixed wet nature of the surface furthermore we notice that oil water intermittency takes place mostly in the intermediate sized pores as seen previously in two phase flow experiments reynolds et al 2017 gao et al 2019 at three phase steady state conditions as fg is increased and fo and fw are decreased figs 6b to 6f gas flows in the largest pores oil the smallest while water flows in the medium sized pores this suggests that the wettability order in the mixed wet system is oil water gas from most to least wetting this wettability order has been previously observed in weakly oil wet rocks at immiscible gas oil conditions scanziani et al 2018 while one would expect more competition between oil and water to occupy the smallest pores due to the mixed wettability we believe that this is dictated by the filling order since oil saturated the pore space first before water we see that gas oil and oil water intermittency occurs in pores of similar intermediate size during the increasing fg and decreasing fo and fw flow path gas tends to favour filling the larger pores and oil the smaller ones so they compete to occupy pores of intermediate size furthermore as seen in two phase flow oil and water both occupy larger and smaller pores since this is a mixed wet system and intermittency is seen in a range of pore sizes and most commonly around the mode with intermediate radius the same wettability order persists during the decreasing fg and increasing fo and fw flow path see figs 6f to 6h during this flow path gas occupied increasingly smaller pores and oil and water larger pores this is expected since the gas saturation decreases while the oil and water saturations increase as we will show in section 3 6 this pore occupancy behaviour is different to that observed in the water wet system alhosani et al 2021 where limited displacement was observed during the decreasing fg and increasing fo and fw flow path due to double capillary trapping of gas by oil and water hence this suggests that there is less gas trapping in the mixed wet system at three phase steady state conditions therefore it implies that the saturation history has little impact on the pore occupancy in a mixed wet rock finally we observe that at fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 after gas injection fig 6i only oil and water exist in the pore space there is no gas this will be discussed in more detail in section 3 6 nonetheless we notice that a large fraction of oil has now moved into larger pores compared to before gas injection fig 6a we attribute this to the preferential displacement of gas by oil as we will show in section 4 9 4 4 connectivity here we qualitatively and quantitatively assess the fluid connectivity on the segmented pore scale images in flow steps 3 8 and 12 see table 1 for their respective fractional flows it was impossible to examine the fluid connectivity in the three phase steady state images as they could not be segmented due to the occurrence of intermittent gas oil and oil water flow as explained in section 2 4 fig 7 shows the in situ three dimensional connectivity of water oil and gas a wide range of colours represents a poorly connected phase while a narrow colour distribution indicates that the phase is well connected furthermore the volume normalized euler characteristic of each phase is quoted to quantitatively evaluate its connectivity herring et al 2015 2013 mecke and wagner 1991 vogel and kretzschmar 1996 vogel 2002 a large positive euler characteristic means that the phase is trapped into many discrete ganglia while a large negative euler characteristic implies a phase that is interconnected with many loops we observe that at fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 before gas injection oil is more connected than water see fig 7a supported by the negative euler characterstic 328 mm 3 this implies that oil exists in thin wetting layers in the corners and therefore confirms that it is more wetting to the surface than water however the euler characteristic of oil is still not in the range of euler numbers measured on weakly and strongly oil wet rocks from the same reservoir where the oil number was much smaller than 1000 mm 3 alhosani et al 2021 2021 this suggests that the rock surfaces are indeed mixed wet at fg 1 see fig 7b both water and gas appear disconnected with positive euler number while the oil connectivity is significantly improved the enhanced oil connectivity under three phase conditions is attributed to the spreading of oil in connected layers in the presence of gas as seen previously in water wet experiments scanziani et al 2019 2018 alhosani et al 2021 in contrast gas exists in disconnected clusters even when injected alone in the mixed wet system unlike the water wet case alhosani et al 2021 this behaviour has significant implications for gas storage applications it means that the re injection of water to trap gas is unnecessary this gas behaviour has been previously observed in oil wet rocks extracted from the same reservoir under unsteady state conditions alhosani et al 2020 2021 furthermore at three phase steady state conditions we suspect that all three phases have a poor connectivity due to their intermittent behaviour this can lead to each phase having a dynamic connectivity where it is momentarily connected and then disconnected at steady state conditions 4 5 specific interfacial areas the fluid fluid and fluid solid specific interfacial areas area per unit total volume pore and grain were measured only on the segmented images of the sample see fig 8 the oil water interfacial area remains almost constant under two and three phase conditions with values around 1 mm 1 see fig 8a the same behaviour was observed for the area between oil and water in the water wet system alhosani et al 2021 this is because oil and water are respectively the most and intermediate wetting phases in both systems the oil water area is dominated by their contact in the smaller sized pores next to the solid surface the water solid and oil solid interfacial areas are the largest see fig 8b and c with the oil solid area being slightly higher this indicates that there are more oil wet regions compared to water wet regions in the mixed wet pore space in contrast the gas solid area is much lower this is ascribed to oil spreading around gas reducing its contact with the solid surface furthermore oil spreading prevents any direct contact between gas and water the gas oil interfacial area is higher than that of the oil water under three phase conditions fg 1 with values around 2 mm 1 see fig 8a and e this is a consequence of the spreading of oil in layers around gas in the large pores it was not possible to determine the dependence of fluid fluid and fluid solid interfacial areas on the saturation history since the three phase steady state images could not be segmented 4 6 saturation the gas oil and water saturations in the macro pores were quantified directly from the raw two and three phase steady state images using the approach described in section 2 4 1 see fig 9 this calculation gives a range of gas and water saturations for each three phase steady state image represented by the line connecting the black circles in fig 9 therefore to obtain the average saturation across the whole sample we assume it is the mid point of that range shown in red circles fig 9 is divided into two parts part a shows the saturations for the increasing fg and decreasing fo and fw flow path while part b shows the saturations for the decreasing fg and increasing fo and fw path the saturations from the segmented images in flow steps 2 3 8 and 12 see table 1 for their fractional flows are also plotted shown in black squares on average fig 9 displays that there is a good agreement between the saturations obtained from the raw and segmented images with an uncertainty of 5 however for consistency we will only quote the saturations obtained from the raw images in the text the first step of the experiment involved the injection of water into the oil saturated sample at fw 1 to reach the remaining oil saturation in the mixed wet system while a value of 0 34 may seem high it is still much lower than the values reached in the same reservoir rock but under oil wet conditions where the irreducible oil saturations were 0 54 and 0 61 alhosani et al 2020 2021 again this behaviour confirms that our system is mixed wet after that oil and water were injected at fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 and the initial saturations of oil and water before gas injection were 0 58 and 0 42 respectively at the first three phase steady state condition the gas saturation was 0 12 with oil and water saturations of 0 53 and 0 35 respectively see fig 9a as the gas fractional flow was increased finally reaching fg 1 the maximum gas saturation only reached 0 32 with 0 49 and 0 19 oil and water saturations respectively the first observation here is that the gas saturation never exceeds 0 32 despite increasing the gas flow rate this has been previously seen in other unsteady state and steady state three phase flow imaging studies scanziani et al 2019 2020 alhosani et al 2020 2021b alhosani et al 2021c scanziani et al 2018 hence we suggest that under three phase capillary dominated conditions with immiscible gas and oil phases the maximum gas saturation that can be reached in this reservoir rock is approximately 32 40 regardless of the rock wettability the second observation at fg 1 is the high remaining oil saturation see fig 9a we note that gas mainly replaces water in this mixed wet rock which will be discussed in more detail in section 3 9 as the flow path is reversed decreasing fg and increasing fo and fw the gas saturation decreases and the oil and water saturations increase see fig 9b this suggests that unlike the water wet system alhosani et al 2021 gas does not get trapped in the pore centres by oil and water instead it is produced as more oil and water are injected while there is a hysteresis in the saturation path of the two flow paths in the mixed wet experiment we conclude that fluid saturations are less impacted by the saturation history compared to the water wet system alhosani et al 2021 more significantly we observe that the gas saturation in the resolvable macro pores reaches zero when the gas injection is stopped at fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 see fig 9b i e no gas is trapped in the mixed wet system this implies that the stored gas can escape in the case of a water re injection in mixed wet reservoir we will discuss this in more detail in section 3 10 fig 10 shows the saturation profiles across the sample obtained from the segmented images in flow steps 2 3 8 and 12 see table 1 for their respective fractional flows while a saturation gradient is seen in 3 of the 4 cases there is no evidence for a significant capillary end effect retention of the wetting phase at the outlet x l 1 4 7 three phase relative permeability we recorded the pressure drop across the sample at two and three phase steady state conditions to calculate the relative permeabilities in our mixed wet reservoir rock see section 2 4 2 the measured pressures were stable in two phase flow but continuously fluctuated between two pressure values in three phase steady state conditions we believe that these fluctuations are caused by the intermittent behaviour of fluids which continuously altered the pressure needed for displacement at steady state conditions the pressure fluctuations are significantly larger in the mixed wet system compared to the water wet one alhosani et al 2021 we attribute this behaviour to the larger fraction of oil water intermittency in the mixed wet system furthermore these observations imply that true steady state conditions are never attained at the pore scale in three phase flow and that the fluid arrangement is constantly fluctuating between locations of local capillary equilibrium nonetheless the average of the two pressure values between which the pressure drop fluctuated was used to calculate the three phase relative permeabilities at all the fractional flows fig 11 shows measurements of gas oil and water three phase relative permeabilities in the mixed wet system for the increasing fg decreasing fo and fw and decreasing fg increasing fo and fw flow paths the relative permeability of each phase is plotted as a function of its own saturation the fluid saturations in the macro pores were obtained directly from the raw pore scale images as described in section 3 6 the water relative permeability is lower than that of oil but higher than gas see fig 11 the low water relative permeability is attributed to the poor water connectivity as shown in section 3 4 water flow is limited to medium sized pores as shown in the pore occupancy section 3 3 in contrast the oil relative permeability is highest due to its improved connectivity in wetting and spreading layers see fig 11c fig 11b shows that the gas relative permeability is very low this is ascribed to two reasons i gas progresses in the form of disconnected clusters in the pore centres and ii gas invasion is mostly limited to pores occupied by oil as we will show in section 3 9 fig 11c shows that the saturation history has a little impact on the oil relative permeability this is expected since oil is considered the most wetting phase in our system oil flows in smaller pores and spreading layers regardless of the flow path on the other hand water and gas relative permeabilities show a clear dependency on the saturation history since their flow is impacted by the relative presence of another phase in the medium and large pores 4 8 capillary pressures the capillary pressures pc were calculated from the interfacial curvature κij between the fluid pairs using the young laplace law blunt 2017 armstrong et al 2012 akai et al 2019 pc ij σijκij the interfaces between the fluids were constructed and smoothed kernel size 5 from the segmented images in flow steps 3 8 and 12 see table 1 before measuring their curvatures fig 12 shows the measured oil water and gas oil capillary pressures in the mixed wet rock it was not possible to measure the gas water capillary pressure since spreading oil layers prevented direct gas water contact the two and three phase oil water capillary pressures are negative with values around 0 5 kpa demonstrating the dominance of oil wet regions over water wet regions in the mixed wet reservoir sample see fig 12a the two phase oil water capillary pressure is slightly higher after gas injection denoted by subscript a in fig 12a compared to that from before denoted by subscript b we attribute this behaviour to the shift in oil pore occupancy to larger pores after gas injection as we have shown in section 3 3 as expected the gas oil capillary pressure is positive with values around 0 25 kpa indicating that oil is wetting to gas see fig 12b 4 9 three phase displacements we quantify the fluid fluid displacement when moving from one steady state condition to another on the raw pore scale images as described in section 2 4 3 similar to pore occupancy we consider the existence of five phases in the pores of the rock gas oil water gas oil intermittency and oil water intermittency figs 13 14 and 15 show the displacement in the pores filled with gas gas oil intermittency and oil at different fractional flows respectively fig 13a and b show that during the increasing fg and decreasing fo and fw flow path the gas filled pores represented by the dotted black line remain mostly occupied by gas there is very little displacement of gas as fg increases in contrast when fg is decreased and fo and fw are increased fig 13c we notice that gas is mostly displaced by oil especially when gas injection stops fig 13d gas is produced since it does not get trapped in the pore centres the displacement of gas by oil is piston like while one would expect a percolation like displacement with snap off we suspect that it is suppressed by the mixed wet nature of the surface which prevents continuous oil flow and snap off of gas by oil the preferential displacement of gas by oil shifts the oil occupancy towards larger pores as seen in section 4 3 fig 14 shows the displacement in the gas oil intermittency filled pores at different fractional flows we observe that as fg is increased and fo and fw are decreased most of the gas oil intermittency occupied pores are filled with gas see fig 14a and b in contrast when fg is decreased and fo and fw are increased the gas oil intermittency occupied pores become filled with oil this suggests that intermittent regions of the pore space are transitional occupancies waiting for displacement to occur in the direction of the phase with the increasing fractional flow in the case of oil water intermittency the intermittent pores were equally displaced by oil and water at different fractional flows regardless of the flow path this is because the oil and water flow rates were kept in the same direction and had the same value throughout the experiment see table 1 for the flow rates the change in the oil water intermittency filled pores is shown in fig s4 in the supplementary material the displacement in oil filled pores during the increasing fg and decreasing fo and fw flow path is shown in fig 15a and b oil is mostly displaced by gas however this contradicts the saturation results in section 3 6 where mostly the water saturation decreased as the gas saturation increased this phenomenon will be explained later in this section furthermore we note that most of the oil displacement occurs in the bigger pores there is a little displacement of oil in the smallest pores this is due to the strongly oil wet nature of the smaller pores that are filled with oil in our mixed wet system where a very high capillary pressure is needed to displace the oil out as fg is decreased and fo and fw are increased oil is mostly displaced now by water or oil water intermittency see fig 15c and d on the other hand water is mostly displaced by oil or oil water intermittency regardless of the flow path direction as shown in fig s5 in the supplementary material to summarize this section when fg is increased and fo and fw are decreased oil is mostly displaced by gas and water is displaced by oil whereas when fg is decreased and fo and fw are increased gas is mostly displaced oil oil is displaced by water and water is displaced by oil from this we can explain why as fg is increased and fo and fw are decreased the water saturation decreases considerably as the gas saturation is increased although gas mostly displaces oil as gas invades the pore space it mainly displaces oil in the largest pores the displaced oil then moves to mobilize water in smaller pores the mobilized water then gets produced at the next fractional flow gas invades the newly invaded pores by oil displacing oil out and forcing it to mobilize water in even smaller pores until the irreducible water saturation is reached at a gas fractional flow of one this process is reversed when fg is decreased and fo and fw are increased now oil displaces gas from the smaller pores first this is accompanied by displacement of oil by water either in intermediate sized pores or large pores where oil displaced gas the displaced gas gets produced flowing through the largest pores this continues until there is no more gas in the pore space while gas can directly displace oil and vice versa water and gas can only displace each other in a double displacement process mediated by oil i e gas oil water and water oil gas double displacement processes 4 10 trapping and implications for co2 storage fig 16 shows the fluid arrangements in a single pore before during and after gas injection in the mixed wet rock before gas injection oil existed in thin wetting layers in the corners of the pores as expected for mixed wet media see fig 16a once gas was injected fig 16b the oil connectivity significantly improved as seen in section 3 4 the thickness of oil layers increased as it spread between gas and water once gas injection was stopped at fw 0 5 and fo 0 5 oil and water completely displaced gas from the pore centre there is no gas trapping except possibly in smaller pores below the resolution of the images we attribute this behaviour to the mixed wet nature of the surface where neither oil nor water can completely surround the gas phase preventing snap off and capillary trapping this work illustrates the impact that pore scale displacement can have on field scale carbon dioxide storage while this observation needs to be confirmed for other samples the absence of gas trapping in macro pores does have significant implications on the design of co2 storage in depleted oil reservoirs with a mixed wettability state it shows that the widely implemented water alternating gas wag injection strategy in oil reservoirs may not be ideal for secure co2 storage while the strategy is well known for increasing the oil recovery this work shows that it can lead to recycling of the injected co2 as it continuously gets produced we suggest that an injection strategy of continuous co2 injection is in fact better for secure storage in mixed wet reservoirs this is for two reasons i co2 naturally gets disconnected when injected as we have shown in section 3 4 this restricts its flow conductance in the reservoir and ii the injection of large amounts of water after co2 injection mobilizes co2 in the reservoir producing significant quantities of the stored co2 5 conclusions we have presented steady state measurements of three phase relative permeability combined with high resolution pore scale x ray imaging 5 36 µm per voxel for a carbonate reservoir rock with a mixed wettability state the experiment was performed under capillary dominated immiscible gas oil conditions we investigated the impact of a saturation history where the gas fractional flow is first increased and then decreased on flow properties oil and water fractional flows were kept the same and changed in the opposite direction to gas the use of pore scale imaging allowed us to characterize simultaneously with relative permeability the in situ contact angles pore occupancy connectivity interfacial areas capillary pressures saturations displacement processes and trapping the mixed wet nature of the rock surfaces achieved through contact with crude oil at conditions of high temperature and pressure was confirmed by calculating the two phase geometric oil water contact angle which had a value of 82o 42o post gas injection the gas oil oil water and gas water contact angles were 66o 41o 80o 41o and 78o 40o respectively while it was not possible to determine a clear wettability order from the contact angle measurements the averaged pore occupancy results demonstrated that at different fractional flows oil occupied the smallest pores water intermediate pores and gas the largest pores suggesting an oil water gas wettability order from most to least wetting this wettability order was further supported by the negative oil water and positive gas oil local capillary pressures a negative oil water pressure illustrates that there are more oil wet regions compared to water wet regions in the pore space no gas water capillary was calculated since oil spread in layers between gas and water preventing their direct contact we observed intermittent flow regions between gas and oil and oil and water at three phase steady state flow despite having capillary dominated conditions the pores that were intermittently occupied were filled with the phase with the increasing fractional flow at the next steady state condition while intermittent flow at capillary conditions was previously observed in a three phase water wet system alhosani et al 2021 here it is more frequent and occupies a larger fraction of the pore space in particular the oil water intermittency is significant both oil water and gas oil intermittently occupied pores of similar size i e intermediate sized pores we identify a distinct gas flow pattern where gas advances in the form of disconnected ganglia mediated by double and multiple displacement processes oil was the only connected phase since it forms connected wetting and spreading layers water existed in disconnected clusters the oil relative permeability was the highest in the pore space followed by water then gas the high oil relative permeability is associated with its improved connectivity in contrast gas has a low relative permeability given that it is disconnected and its flow in the larger pores is blocked by water the impact of saturation history on gas and water relative permeabilities was larger than its impact on the oil relative permeability as the gas fractional flow was increased oil and water flows decreased gas mainly displaced oil and oil displaced water when the flow path was reversed oil replaced gas in the larger pores and water displaced oil in the medium sized pores oil was shifted to larger pores after gas injection while gas can directly displace oil and vice versa water and gas can only displace each other in a double displacement process mediated by oil i e gas oil water and water oil gas double displacement processes surprisingly to within the resolution of the images there appeared to be no gas trapped when gas injection was stopped we attributed this behaviour to the mixed wet nature of the surface which prevents both oil and water from completely surrounding gas and capillary trapping it in the pore centres these outcomes suggest that the subsequent water injection after gas is not ideal for gas storage applications instead a continuous injection of gas only can ensure safe trapping as gas is naturally disconnected upon injection in the reservoir future work should focus on quantifying the steady state three phase relative permeability combined with imaging in a wider range of samples and for strongly oil wet rocks to examine the impact of an oil gas water from most to least wetting wettability order on relative permeability this will also provide insights into intermittency showing whether intermittent flow is as frequent as it is in a mixed wet system future experiments should consider investigating the impact of different flow paths to have a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between saturation history and relative permeability the impact of reaching near miscible gas oil conditions could be investigated furthermore the outcomes of this study indicate that an intermittent flow behaviour must be incorporated when modeling steady state three phase flow experiments moreover the limited gas relative permeability is a feature that needs to be incorporated in current three phase relative permeability models author statement a a led the experimental work alongside a s under the supervision of m j b and b b s f
