latitudes 22 15 and 23 00 east longitudes 77 15 78 42 the study area is a part of tawa river catchment area hoshangabad madhya pradesh india this area is falling in survey of india toposheet no s 55 f 12 55 f 13 55j 2 between latitude 22 30 00 to 22 50 00 n and longitude 77 45 00 to 780 00 00 e the total geographical area is 599 61 km2 covering the parts of hoshangabad babi and itarsi blocks the area comprises of fertile alluvium soils with diversified crop pattern encouraging the farming activities and has extended the scope of groundwater contamination in the area figure1 shows the location map of the area geologically the entire tawa basin comprises of different rock formations which include vindhyan sandstones basalt recent alluvium deposits and some patches of banded gneisses complex bgc ranging in age from archean to quaternary the major part of the study area along the vicinity of banks of tawa river is covered by recent alluvium deposits intercalated with beds of sand gravel and pebbles malik and shukla 2015 district resource map drm of geological survey of india has shown that non calcareous silt sand and clay are exposed along the river channel these unconsolidated fluvial deposits are characterized by silty sand sand gravel and conglomerate sediments and form good groundwater formations from climatic point of view the area is characterized by hot summer and evenly distributed rainfall during southwest monsoon the annual mean maximum and minimum temperature is 33 c and 19 4 c respectively the area receives about 1170 mm rainfall on an average per year as estimated from last five years 2011 2015 rainfall data imd new delhi the monsoon rainfall accounts for 80 of the annual rainfall fig 2 2 materials and methods mapping of aquifer vulnerability to contamination was carried out employed the gis based drastic model approach drastic methodology is based on weightage and rating method of seven parameters viz depth to water net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity yin et al 2013 ratings and weights were designed for each parameter as per their relative significance in groundwater contamination the typical ratings assigned are ranging from 1 low contamination chances to 10 higher contamination chances these rating values were scaled by weightage factor which vary from 1 least significant to 5 most significant aller et al 1987 the data required for building of the thematic layer of each parameter of the model was collected from various primary and secondary sources depth to water level has been collected manually during post monsoon season field survey 2015 from 28 observation wells net recharge was calculated from land use land cover supported by topography and rainfall data followed the method of rahman 2008 aquifer media has been obtained from the prevailing geology and hydrogeology of the area soil media derived from national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nagpur nbss lup 1996 soil map srtm dem data has been processed for slope analysis the various litho units exposed in the area were extracted from district resource map of gsi 2002 vadose zone materials have been derived from the existing lithology of the area hydraulic conductivity k m day has been taken from the defined values for different soil and rock materials given by ritzema 2006 the flow chart fig 3 is represents the data source and methodology process followed during the study 3 drastic model drastic method which is a standardized system for evaluation of aquifers pollution potential has been employed in the present study drastic model has worldwide application because of the input data parameters required for its functioning can be available easily or readily derived from various primary and secondary sources the model was first established in usa for the safeguard of groundwater from pollution and their methodology is called drastic rahman 2008 in the model numerical ranking system was designed to assess groundwater pollution potential in different hydrologic settings using drastic factors the system contains three significant factors i e weights ranges and ratings drastic is an short form of seven hydrogeological variables in which d stands for depth to water r for net recharge a for aquifer media s for soil media t for topography i for impact of vadose zone and c for hydraulic conductivity all these variables were used for determining the vulnerability index of groundwater contamination in the area these input model parameters were designed by multiplying their given rating values with the weights for building of each thematic layer sener et al 2009 the vulnerability index of each variable was computed by using inverse distance weightage idw tool of arcgis the extent of vulnerability to groundwater pollution in the area is based on the numerical index value the equation used for calculating the drastic index di is as follows 1 di d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where d r a s t i and c are the seven parameters r is the rating value and w the weight assigned to each parameter the working mechanism of the model is based on four principles 1 the collection of hydrogeologic and geologic data infiltration soil aquifer slope and hydraulic conductivity 2 the construction of gis thematic maps for each parameter of the model 3 the calculation of drastic index 4 rating as to vulnerability of contamination 4 results and discussion the seven input data parameters of the model were evaluated from the various sources based on the prevailing hydrogeological settings of the area however on the basis of each parameter characteristics significance in groundwater contamination rating and weights were given and calculated the index for building of each thematic layer all these thematic layers were later integrated by running the model in arcgis for calculation of the vulnerability index using eq 1 the seven data layers derived from various data sources required for the modeling are as follows 4 1 depth to water level depth to water is an important parameter of the model it represents the vertical distance from the ground surface to the water table and determines the width of materials via water infiltrates to reach to groundwater rahman 2008 in drastic model the maximum weightage of 5 is given to this parameter aller et al 1987 in the study depth to water from 28 observation wells was taken during post monsoon season oct 2015 during the season maximum recharge of groundwater happens to move in the area that may increase contamination chances of aquifer and water level as well the minimum and maximum depth to water level measured in the area is 2 m and 12 9 m bgl respectively this point data was contoured by the kriging interpolation method in arcgis and has been divided into three categories i e 5 m 5 10 m and 10 m fig 4 maximum rating of 10 is given to shallow water level depth i e 5 m and minimum rating of 7 was given to maximum water level depth i e 10 m shallow groundwater level areas are more prone to contamination because pollutants have to travel through shortest path to reach to groundwater however deep water level areas have less chances of contamination because pollutants have to travel via longer path to reach to groundwater and during their journey they may come to halt in the way and could not reach to the groundwater thus low rating has been given in that condition the rating weightage and index given to this parameter are given in table 1 4 2 net recharge net recharge is the quantity of water per unit area which infiltrates down to the groundwater on annual basis recharge water is a single transporting agent of pollutants carrying through vadose zone to groundwater zone the major part of the area has gentle to moderate slope the part of the area along the tawa river bank is principally recharged by seepage from rivers canals net recharge has been calculated from the land use land cover supported by topography followed the method of rahman 2008 net recharge in the area varies from 3 to 4 inches the assigned ratings to net recharge are given in table 2 the maximum rating of 8 has been given to the water body tawa river present in the area which is encouraging the groundwater recharge along river banks and adjacent areas built up areas have been given low rating because it impedes infiltration net recharge map with rating range and index is presented in fig 5 4 3 aquifer media aquifer is the underlying rock and soil media composed of an aquifer like sand gravel and conglomerate ghosh et al 2015 the major part of the area contains thick alluvium aquifer media and forms a good groundwater potential zone aquifer media has been extracted from the lithology and hydrogeology map of the area which is composed of fine silt and silty sand gravel and conglomerate shale and granite table 3 high rating of 9 was given to gravel and conglomerate which is very coarse porous media and has good water yielding and transmitting properties whereas low rating of 3 has been assigned to granite impervious rock the aquifer media map with rating range and index is shown in fig 6 4 4 soil media soil media has a significant impact on the amount of recharge and in purifying process of pollutants lee 2003 soil represents the top upper weathered layer supporting to biological processes it has an important role to determine the quantity of water that infiltrate via soil and control the rate of contaminant movement vertically into the vadose zone umar et al 2009 soil media map of the area has been prepared from the district soil map of national bureau of soil survey land use planning nagpur nbss lup 1996 about 15 of the area is covered by sandy loam soils on the high banks of tawa river a part of the area is covered by clay loam with pockets of sandy clay loam sandy loam and lateritic soils thus soils of the area are characterized by loam clay loam and sandy clay loam ratings and weightage has been given as per the hydrological properties porosity and permeability of the soils rating weights and index prepared for soil media is given in table 4 well drained sandy loamy soils covers more than 50 of the area bare appreciable flow of water and pollutant transport has been given high rating clayey soils interrupt the flow of water and has least chances of groundwater pollution thus were given low ratings soil media map with range rating and index is presented in fig 7 4 5 topography topography is expressed in the form of slope in drastic model topography has an important role in hydrological modeling and water management studies plain or gentle slope areas tend to retain water for longer time which encourages the infiltration rate of water thus have more chances of groundwater contamination in the study srtm data has been processed in arcgis for extraction of slope finally the slope was determined using the slope function of arcgis which was further categorized into five classes figure 8 reveals that slope varies between 0 2 covers the most part of the area and areas with slope ranging from 2 to 5 are located towards southern side along the foot hills of satpura range slope is nearly steep in the south margin at satpura range at steep slopes there is less groundwater pollution chances because of much surface runoff generated that discourages groundwater recharge the rating weight and index assigned to slope parameter is given in table 5 4 6 impact of vadose zone vadose zone is the part of earth lying between the ground surface and groundwater zone vadose zone media and thickness have great significance in drastic model vadose zone media has great impact on the movement of water so on pollutant migration the flow of water within this zone is governed by hydrological properties of the materials like porosity permeability and transmissivity vadose zone media composed of porous material supports appreciable flow of water and enhances groundwater recharge rahman 2008 the movement of water through this zone is studied in hydrogeology which has key importance in contaminant transportation impact of vadose zone media has been studied from the lithological cross section and hydrogeology of the area the vodose zone media comprises of gravel and conglomerate shale silt and silty sand fig 9 the rating to this parameter was given which ranges from 4 to 9 rating of 9 was given to porous media i e gravel and conglomerate and low rating of 4 has been given to shale table 6 4 7 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity is the ability of soil or rock media to transmit water saha and alam 2014 this property of the materials is controlled by the percentage of pore spaces and interconnection of openings voids grain size sorting etc in the study hydraulic conductivity for different soil and rock media given by ritzema 2006 has been taken into account table 7 aquifer media has been derived from the existing lithology and soil media rating to this parameter has been assigned from the defined values of hydraulic conductivity for various soil and rock materials by ritzema 2006 aquifer media with good hydraulic conductivity is more prone to groundwater pollution aquifer media works as conduits and appreciates flow of water to groundwater zone fritch et al 2000 it has been seen that most part of the area is composed of materials with hydraulic conductivity ranges from 1 to 3 m day the rating assigned to this parameter ranges from 2 to 6 table 8 the higher is the hydraulic conductivity of media the higher ratings were given hydraulic conductivity map of area with range rating and index prepared is presented in fig 10 5 drastic index drastic index of the area has been computed by integrating the all seven layers in arc gis environment by running the model the computed drastic index determines the prevailing groundwater contamination vulnerability in the area drastic index calculated varies from 11 to 162 quantile classification method was used to classify the drastic index this method distributes a set of values into groups that contains an equal number of values sener et al 2009 states that this is the most suitable method for this kind of classification the drastic index obtained was further classified into three zones viz low moderate and high vulnerable zone fig 11 the results show that about 61 99 km2 10 32 of area is exposed to low risk 328 94 km2 54 84 to moderate risk and 208 68 km2 34 84 to high risk table 9 this means that about one third part of the area is at high risk with respect to pollution potential the southern part of the area where physical factors such as steep slope deep water table hard rock and impermeable vadose zone material is present falls under low groundwater vulnerability zone the central portion of the area along the banks of tawa river is falling in high groundwater vulnerability zone because of shallow water table depth and favorable recharge conditions along river valleys the eastern and western part of tawa river is falling in moderate groundwater vulnerability zone 6 validation of model validation of model is important because it is an empirical model thus validation of model was done by nitrate concentrations in the delineated groundwater vulnerable zones the contributing source of nitrate in the area is result of human interferences i e excessive use of fertilizers and farm waste nitrogen in fertilizers is frequently applied to agricultural areas to increase the crop production and there are no known geological sources of nitrate in the area therefore nitrate can be used as a good water quality parameter to assess the drastic index which has been widely used baalousha 2006 jamrah et al 2008 the connection between the drastic index and the nitrate concentrations in groundwater was investigated to check the efficiency of this model to assess groundwater contamination vulnerability therefore 30 groundwater samples were collected from the distributed wells located in the identified groundwater vulnerable zones and were analyzed for evaluation of nitrate concentration the highest desirable and maximum permissible limit of nitrate is 45 mg l is 10500 drinking water standards concentration of nitrate in excess of 45 ppm in groundwater is harmful for human consumption the locations of wells where concentration of nitrate were found are shown in fig 12 it has been seen that most of the observation wells in which nitrate contamination has been reported are falling in agricultural area which indicates the source of nitrate from agricultural activities the concentration of nitrate in low groundwater vulnerable zone was found 5 ppm where as it varies from 5 20 ppm in moderate groundwater vulnerable zone and 20 76 ppm in high groundwater vulnerable zone the model has been validated and found applicable for the prevailing hydrogeology of the area thus the model can be used as an effective tool for sustainable groundwater resources management and development 7 conclusion maps of groundwater vulnerability to contamination are more in demand because groundwater represents the chief source of drinking water especially in rural areas in the study gis based model approach was used to assess the aquifer contamination vulnerability potential the model uses seven data layers as input parameters i e 1 depth to water level 2 net recharge 3 aquifer media 4 soil media 5 topography 6 impact of vadose zone and 7 hydraulic conductivity the data of each parameter has been taken from various sources and were incorporated in arcgis for obtaining the groundwater contamination vulnerability index the derived groundwater contamination vulnerability index of the area varies from 11 162 which were further classified into three zones viz high moderate and low the study reveals that 34 84 of the area falling in high groundwater vulnerable zone is located along both the banks of tawa river and at north east periphery the southern part of the area is at low pollution risk whereas at some places nitrate concentrations were found higher along river valleys in some farmlands this anomaly is mainly caused due to intensive agricultural activities and favorable recharge conditions along river and adjacent areas a large part 54 84 of area falls under moderate vulnerable zone and 10 32 in low vulnerable zone further validation of model was done by chemical analysis of groundwater samples collected and analyzed for evaluation of nitrate concentration the chemical analysis results show relatively high concentration of nitrate 20 76 ppm in samples collected from wells located in high groundwater vulnerable zone where as in moderate groundwater vulnerable zone nitrate varies from 5 20 ppm and in low groundwater vulnerable zone nitrate was present 5 ppm the drastic model approach used has been found applicable for the prevailing hydrogeology of the area and thus can be used for assessment and management of groundwater resources the model also provides a valuable tool for policy makers as it gives a comprehensive indication of vulnerability to groundwater contamination acknowledgements authors are thankful to director csir ampri

media soil media topography impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity yin et al 2013 ratings and weights were designed for each parameter as per their relative significance in groundwater contamination the typical ratings assigned are ranging from 1 low contamination chances to 10 higher contamination chances these rating values were scaled by weightage factor which vary from 1 least significant to 5 most significant aller et al 1987 the data required for building of the thematic layer of each parameter of the model was collected from various primary and secondary sources depth to water level has been collected manually during post monsoon season field survey 2015 from 28 observation wells net recharge was calculated from land use land cover supported by topography and rainfall data followed the method of rahman 2008 aquifer media has been obtained from the prevailing geology and hydrogeology of the area soil media derived from national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nagpur nbss lup 1996 soil map srtm dem data has been processed for slope analysis the various litho units exposed in the area were extracted from district resource map of gsi 2002 vadose zone materials have been derived from the existing lithology of the area hydraulic conductivity k m day has been taken from the defined values for different soil and rock materials given by ritzema 2006 the flow chart fig 3 is represents the data source and methodology process followed during the study 3 drastic model drastic method which is a standardized system for evaluation of aquifers pollution potential has been employed in the present study drastic model has worldwide application because of the input data parameters required for its functioning can be available easily or readily derived from various primary and secondary sources the model was first established in usa for the safeguard of groundwater from pollution and their methodology is called drastic rahman 2008 in the model numerical ranking system was designed to assess groundwater pollution potential in different hydrologic settings using drastic factors the system contains three significant factors i e weights ranges and ratings drastic is an short form of seven hydrogeological variables in which d stands for depth to water r for net recharge a for aquifer media s for soil media t for topography i for impact of vadose zone and c for hydraulic conductivity all these variables were used for determining the vulnerability index of groundwater contamination in the area these input model parameters were designed by multiplying their given rating values with the weights for building of each thematic layer sener et al 2009 the vulnerability index of each variable was computed by using inverse distance weightage idw tool of arcgis the extent of vulnerability to groundwater pollution in the area is based on the numerical index value the equation used for calculating the drastic index di is as follows 1 di d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where d r a s t i and c are the seven parameters r is the rating value and w the weight assigned to each parameter the working mechanism of the model is based on four principles 1 the collection of hydrogeologic and geologic data infiltration soil aquifer slope and hydraulic conductivity 2 the construction of gis thematic maps for each parameter of the model 3 the calculation of drastic index 4 rating as to vulnerability of contamination 4 results and discussion the seven input data parameters of the model were evaluated from the various sources based on the prevailing hydrogeological settings of the area however on the basis of each parameter characteristics significance in groundwater contamination rating and weights were given and calculated the index for building of each thematic layer all these thematic layers were later integrated by running the model in arcgis for calculation of the vulnerability index using eq 1 the seven data layers derived from various data sources required for the modeling are as follows 4 1 depth to water level depth to water is an important parameter of the model it represents the vertical distance from the ground surface to the water table and determines the width of materials via water infiltrates to reach to groundwater rahman 2008 in drastic model the maximum weightage of 5 is given to this parameter aller et al 1987 in the study depth to water from 28 observation wells was taken during post monsoon season oct 2015 during the season maximum recharge of groundwater happens to move in the area that may increase contamination chances of aquifer and water level as well the minimum and maximum depth to water level measured in the area is 2 m and 12 9 m bgl respectively this point data was contoured by the kriging interpolation method in arcgis and has been divided into three categories i e 5 m 5 10 m and 10 m fig 4 maximum rating of 10 is given to shallow water level depth i e 5 m and minimum rating of 7 was given to maximum water level depth i e 10 m shallow groundwater level areas are more prone to contamination because pollutants have to travel through shortest path to reach to groundwater however deep water level areas have less chances of contamination because pollutants have to travel via longer path to reach to groundwater and during their journey they may come to halt in the way and could not reach to the groundwater thus low rating has been given in that condition the rating weightage and index given to this parameter are given in table 1 4 2 net recharge net recharge is the quantity of water per unit area which infiltrates down to the groundwater on annual basis recharge water is a single transporting agent of pollutants carrying through vadose zone to groundwater zone the major part of the area has gentle to moderate slope the part of the area along the tawa river bank is principally recharged by seepage from rivers canals net recharge has been calculated from the land use land cover supported by topography followed the method of rahman 2008 net recharge in the area varies from 3 to 4 inches the assigned ratings to net recharge are given in table 2 the maximum rating of 8 has been given to the water body tawa river present in the area which is encouraging the groundwater recharge along river banks and adjacent areas built up areas have been given low rating because it impedes infiltration net recharge map with rating range and index is presented in fig 5 4 3 aquifer media aquifer is the underlying rock and soil media composed of an aquifer like sand gravel and conglomerate ghosh et al 2015 the major part of the area contains thick alluvium aquifer media and forms a good groundwater potential zone aquifer media has been extracted from the lithology and hydrogeology map of the area which is composed of fine silt and silty sand gravel and conglomerate shale and granite table 3 high rating of 9 was given to gravel and conglomerate which is very coarse porous media and has good water yielding and transmitting properties whereas low rating of 3 has been assigned to granite impervious rock the aquifer media map with rating range and index is shown in fig 6 4 4 soil media soil media has a significant impact on the amount of recharge and in purifying process of pollutants lee 2003 soil represents the top upper weathered layer supporting to biological processes it has an important role to determine the quantity of water that infiltrate via soil and control the rate of contaminant movement vertically into the vadose zone umar et al 2009 soil media map of the area has been prepared from the district soil map of national bureau of soil survey land use planning nagpur nbss lup 1996 about 15 of the area is covered by sandy loam soils on the high banks of tawa river a part of the area is covered by clay loam with pockets of sandy clay loam sandy loam and lateritic soils thus soils of the area are characterized by loam clay loam and sandy clay loam ratings and weightage has been given as per the hydrological properties porosity and permeability of the soils rating weights and index prepared for soil media is given in table 4 well drained sandy loamy soils covers more than 50 of the area bare appreciable flow of water and pollutant transport has been given high rating clayey soils interrupt the flow of water and has least chances of groundwater pollution thus were given low ratings soil media map with range rating and index is presented in fig 7 4 5 topography topography is expressed in the form of slope in drastic model topography has an important role in hydrological modeling and water management studies plain or gentle slope areas tend to retain water for longer time which encourages the infiltration rate of water thus have more chances of groundwater contamination in the study srtm data has been processed in arcgis for extraction of slope finally the slope was determined using the slope function of arcgis which was further categorized into five classes figure 8 reveals that slope varies between 0 2 covers the most part of the area and areas with slope ranging from 2 to 5 are located towards southern side along the foot hills of satpura range slope is nearly steep in the south margin at satpura range at steep slopes there is less groundwater pollution chances because of much surface runoff generated that discourages groundwater recharge the rating weight and index assigned to slope parameter is given in table 5 4 6 impact of vadose zone vadose zone is the part of earth lying between the ground surface and groundwater zone vadose zone media and thickness have great significance in drastic model vadose zone media has great impact on the movement of water so on pollutant migration the flow of water within this zone is governed by hydrological properties of the materials like porosity permeability and transmissivity vadose zone media composed of porous material supports appreciable flow of water and enhances groundwater recharge rahman 2008 the movement of water through this zone is studied in hydrogeology which has key importance in contaminant transportation impact of vadose zone media has been studied from the lithological cross section and hydrogeology of the area the vodose zone media comprises of gravel and conglomerate shale silt and silty sand fig 9 the rating to this parameter was given which ranges from 4 to 9 rating of 9 was given to porous media i e gravel and conglomerate and low rating of 4 has been given to shale table 6 4 7 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity is the ability of soil or rock media to transmit water saha and alam 2014 this property of the materials is controlled by the percentage of pore spaces and interconnection of openings voids grain size sorting etc in the study hydraulic conductivity for different soil and rock media given by ritzema 2006 has been taken into account table 7 aquifer media has been derived from the existing lithology and soil media rating to this parameter has been assigned from the defined values of hydraulic conductivity for various soil and rock materials by ritzema 2006 aquifer media with good hydraulic conductivity is more prone to groundwater pollution aquifer media works as conduits and appreciates flow of water to groundwater zone fritch et al 2000 it has been seen that most part of the area is composed of materials with hydraulic conductivity ranges from 1 to 3 m day the rating assigned to this parameter ranges from 2 to 6 table 8 the higher is the hydraulic conductivity of media the higher ratings were given hydraulic conductivity map of area with range rating and index prepared is presented in fig 10 5 drastic index drastic index of the area has been computed by integrating the all seven layers in arc gis environment by running the model the computed drastic index determines the prevailing groundwater contamination vulnerability in the area drastic index calculated varies from 11 to 162 quantile classification method was used to classify the drastic index this method distributes a set of values into groups that contains an equal number of values sener et al 2009 states that this is the most suitable method for this kind of classification the drastic index obtained was further classified into three zones viz low moderate and high vulnerable zone fig 11 the results show that about 61 99 km2 10 32 of area is exposed to low risk 328 94 km2 54 84 to moderate risk and 208 68 km2 34 84 to high risk table 9 this means that about one third part of the area is at high risk with respect to pollution potential the southern part of the area where physical factors such as steep slope deep water table hard rock and impermeable vadose zone material is present falls under low groundwater vulnerability zone the central portion of the area along the banks of tawa river is falling in high groundwater vulnerability zone because of shallow water table depth and favorable recharge conditions along river valleys the eastern and western part of tawa river is falling in moderate groundwater vulnerability zone 6 validation of model validation of model is important because it is an empirical model thus validation of model was done by nitrate concentrations in the delineated groundwater vulnerable zones the contributing source of nitrate in the area is result of human interferences i e excessive use of fertilizers and farm waste nitrogen in fertilizers is frequently applied to agricultural areas to increase the crop production and there are no known geological sources of nitrate in the area therefore nitrate can be used as a good water quality parameter to assess the drastic index which has been widely used baalousha 2006 jamrah et al 2008 the connection between the drastic index and the nitrate concentrations in groundwater was investigated to check the efficiency of this model to assess groundwater contamination vulnerability therefore 30 groundwater samples were collected from the distributed wells located in the identified groundwater vulnerable zones and were analyzed for evaluation of nitrate concentration the highest desirable and maximum permissible limit of nitrate is 45 mg l is 10500 drinking water standards concentration of nitrate in excess of 45 ppm in groundwater is harmful for human consumption the locations of wells where concentration of nitrate were found are shown in fig 12 it has been seen that most of the observation wells in which nitrate contamination has been reported are falling in agricultural area which indicates the source of nitrate from agricultural activities the concentration of nitrate in low groundwater vulnerable zone was found 5 ppm where as it varies from 5 20 ppm in moderate groundwater vulnerable zone and 20 76 ppm in high groundwater vulnerable zone the model has been validated and found applicable for the prevailing hydrogeology of the area thus the model can be used as an effective tool for sustainable groundwater resources management and development 7 conclusion maps of groundwater vulnerability to contamination are more in demand because groundwater represents the chief source of drinking water especially in rural areas in the study gis based model approach was used to assess the aquifer contamination vulnerability potential the model uses seven data layers as input parameters i e 1 depth to water level 2 net recharge 3 aquifer media 4 soil media 5 topography 6 impact of vadose zone and 7 hydraulic conductivity the data of each parameter has been taken from various sources and were incorporated in arcgis for obtaining the groundwater contamination vulnerability index the derived groundwater contamination vulnerability index of the area varies from 11 162 which were further classified into three zones viz high moderate and low the study reveals that 34 84 of the area falling in high groundwater vulnerable zone is located along both the banks of tawa river and at north east periphery the southern part of the area is at low pollution risk whereas at some places nitrate concentrations were found higher along river valleys in some farmlands this anomaly is mainly caused due to intensive agricultural activities and favorable recharge conditions along river and adjacent areas a large part 54 84 of area falls under moderate vulnerable zone and 10 32 in low vulnerable zone further validation of model was done by chemical analysis of groundwater samples collected and analyzed for evaluation of nitrate concentration the chemical analysis results show relatively high concentration of nitrate 20 76 ppm in samples collected from wells located in high groundwater vulnerable zone where as in moderate groundwater vulnerable zone nitrate varies from 5 20 ppm and in low groundwater vulnerable zone nitrate was present 5 ppm the drastic model approach used has been found applicable for the prevailing hydrogeology of the area and thus can be used for assessment and management of groundwater resources the model also provides a valuable tool for policy makers as it gives a comprehensive indication of vulnerability to groundwater contamination acknowledgements authors are thankful to director csir ampri

12241,in the 21st century global warming erratic rainfall and the pressure on groundwater resources are becoming severe and leading to water scarcity which contributes to the poverty of around one third of the world s people hence it became necessary to use new geospatial technologies for mapping and monitoring of groundwater resources spatial analysis of hydro geological lineament network and hydrological modeling may allow accurate identification of areas that favor infiltration and recharge of overexploited groundwater in morocco the middle atlas region suffers from a lack of reliable hydro geological maps for local water resource managers consequently this research aims to assess the relative contribution of the topo hydrological factor known as height above nearest drainage hand for efficient exploration and management of groundwater resources in central middle atlas the methodology was based on the landsat 8 operational land imager oli data for retrieving the lineaments and the elevation data from shuttle radar topography mission srtm for the calculation of the hand model four landscape classes namely waterlogged land wetlands sloped hillslope and plateaus corresponding to the main hydrological systems were delineated using the hand model in addition fissured carbonate plateaus faults karsts water sources lakes and groundwater levels have been used to develop a decision support system based on geospatial criteria analysis the fracture analysis indicated that the study area has many long and short hydro geological lineaments with the highest densities oriented ne sw their synergy with the hand model and the other factors has allowed the detection of potential areas for the recharge of the groundwater table the results have been confirmed and validated using lakes water sources and piezometric levels the application of the hand factor as an independent variable in the delineation of groundwater potential areas gpas is demonstrated to be useful for improving the accuracy of the existing multi criteria gis models graphical abstract image 1 keywords lineaments karst groundwater remote sensing gis hand landscape classification multi criteria analysis 1 introduction the recent years have seen the emergence of water stressed conditions in the arid and semi arid regions resulting from a confluence of several factors davis et al 2017 the increasing demand by residential industrial and agricultural uses mismanaged water resources and extreme climate changes such as erratic rainfall and global warming have caused groundwater depletion and decreased quality in many regions prasad and rao 2018 kalhor et al 2019 accordingly water resource management is a major socio economic issue and an essential component of the progress in semi arid regions corgne et al 2010 ouzemou et al 2018 africa is at the fore front of the regions concerned by the impact of climate fluctuations on groundwater resources kanohin et al 2009 hamed et al 2018 zima 2019 several studies in africa have shown a decrease in groundwater flow as a result of reduced rainfall vissin et al 2007 bates et al 2008 kanohin et al 2009 ait kadi and ziyad 2018 in the last sixty years morocco was suffered from a decrease in total rainfall and a positive trend in the maximum number of consecutive dry days ait kadi and ziyad 2018 the moroccan middle atlas region suffers from a chronic lack of reliable hydro geological maps for local water resource managers as a result it has become necessary to have an efficient tool to facilitate suitable decision making for exploration and management of the groundwater resources in this region considering that groundwater is a vital natural resource for the reliable and economic provision of agricultural and potable water supplies in both urban and rural environment magesh et al 2012 boujghad et al 2019 el baghdadi et al 2019 in addition its occurrence and distribution depend on the climate and regional setting of the area surface and subsurface characteristics konkul et al 2014 al saud 2010 senthil kumar and shankar 2014 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 conventional exploration methods such as field based hydrogeological techniques hydraulic conductivity surveys and exploratory drilling remain laborious time consuming and very expensive through synoptic coverage and fast spatial analysis delineating the groundwater potential areas gpas using satellite remote sensing and gis is an indirect less expensive and effective tool for the sustainable development of the groundwater resources and to fulfill the water needs ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 jasrotia et al 2018 ferozur et al 2019 kalhor et al 2019 in recent years extensive use of satellite data along with conventional maps and rectified ground truth data has made it easier to establish the base line information for gpas chowdhury et al 2010 magesh et al 2011 2012 al shabeeb et al 2018 regarding the literature several studies have used different data including surface temperature green vegetation during summer and orientation to identify hydro geological lineaments on the other side some of them have chosen geomorphology slope lineaments and precipitation for the mapping of potential areas for groundwater recharge corgne et al 2010 alonso contes 2011 nanda et al 2017 al shabeeb et al 2018 in addition some authors have used an approach for lineaments extraction using shaded relief from the digital elevation model dem to highlight the linkage between lineaments vegetation and groundwater sahoo et al 2018 the height above the nearest drainage hand is a digital elevation model normalized using the nearest drainage it normalizes topography according to the local relative heights found along the drainage network and in this way presents the topology of the relative soil gravitational potential or local draining potentials hand allows for the calculation of the elevation of each point in the catchment above the nearest stream it drains to following the flow direction rennó et al 2008 nobre et al 2011 many applications of hand have already been published such as landscape classification and the topographic wetness in a mesoscale catchment in temperate climates gharari et al 2011 flood mapping is an incredibly vital practice which provides communities with valuable and useable knowledge that can be used to understand the potential risks associated with such natural disasters as such efforts were placed on analyzing terrain using the hand model as an approach for mapping the potential extent of inundations and flash flood prone area mapping nobre et al 2016 donchyts et al 2016 mcgrath et al 2018 another approach for developing a synthetic rating curve to relate flow to water level in a stream reach based on reach averaged channel geometry properties has been developed using the hand model zheng et al 2018 huang et al 2017 have tested the hand model performance on assisting surface water mapping using sentinel 1 sar data cuartas et al 2012 demonstrated that the hand model is a useful tool for representing the spatial distributions of key hydrological parameters in the same context the hand model was applied to landslide susceptibility modeling by using novel statistical models kornejady et al 2018 however using the hand model in the development of the hydro geological concept and determination of his link with hydro geological lineaments and karstic shapes for groundwater exploration has never been evaluated in the literature the present study suggests a new approach for mapping potential areas for infiltration and recharge of the groundwater table using remote sensing gis and the hand hydrological model in the moroccan central middle atlas accordingly the specific objectives of this study are thus 1 identification of hydro geological lineament 2 assessment of the hand model contributions in delineating groundwater recharge potential areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 geological and hydro geological settings the middle atlas with a surface area of 9500 km2 is located between by parallels 32 45 and 34 18 n and meridians 3 42 and 5 42 w it is bounded to the north by the south rifain corridor to the south by the high atlas and the plateaus of high moulouya to the east by the valley of the middle moulouya and to the west by the moroccan meseta michard 1976 the middle atlas is composed by the juxtaposition of two structural units the middle atlasic causse and the pleated middle atlas fig 1 these are separated by a major structural line called the north middle atlasic fault oriented ne sw colo 1961 the middle atlas causse is composed essentially of neritic carbonates of the lower and middle lias its structure in inclined blocks is expressed in the topography by large karst plateaus variously staged it is affected by the tizi n tretten fault also oriented ne sw the pleated middle atlas is the southern part of the intracontinental chain oriented ne sw elongated over more than 400 km it is organized into acute anticlinal wrinkles and large synclinal depressions the groundwater of the middle atlas is a groundwater table of complex karstic origin formed into dolomites of the lower lias and dolomites and limestones of the middle lias which are well fissured and tectonized and sometimes crushed the climate of the middle atlas can be defined as a mediterranean mountain climate it is characterized by the succession of cold and warm seasons 2 2 data and methodology used fig 2 shows an overall view of the data and approach applied in this study on the one hand we used two landsat 8 images from operational land imager oli sensor acquired over the study area during the summer of 2016 the first one was taken in june path 201 row 37 and the second in july path 200 row 37 oli sensor acquires images in nine spectral bands from shorter wavelengths of visible to short wave infrared swir the spatial resolution of this sensor varies from 15 panchromatic band to 30 m multispectral bands on the other hand the srtm elevation data spatial resolution of 30 m has been used to calculate the hydrological hand model first the faults and carbonate plateaus were digitized from the geological and geomorphological map of the central middle atlas secondly the two multispectral oli images have been used to extract the lineaments using automatic extraction from the line algorithm oli images have been radiometrically calibrated and corrected from atmospheric effects accordingly the raw data in digital number were converted into radiance values then they were corrected from both additive and multiplicative atmospheric effects using the flaash model fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes finally the study area has been clipped from a mosaic of both preprocessed images 2 3 related groundwater recharge factors 2 3 1 geomorphology and lithology the middle atlasic causse is characterized by a flat structure more faulty than pleated with a monotonous lithology of weakly pleated liasic limestones it is composed of vast limestone plateaus between 1000 and 2200 m also known as causses after a long tectonic stability during the eocene period tectonic activity reactivated during the oligocene period and dislocated the different limestone plateaus of the middle atlasic causse during the pliocene erosion processes built up the present landforms and landscapes during the quaternary this landscape was disrupted by volcanic activity that gave rise to several edifices and lava flows the present landscape is disseminated with more or less active karst landforms which the limestone and dolomitic facies constitute a suitable environment for the chemical dissolution of the rocks karstification phenomena the dolomites and limestones of the middle lias have been more corroded than the dolomites of the lower lias karstic shapes are essentially superficial therefore we can distinguish minor sinkholes such as lapiez ruiniform reliefs of dolomites and small depressions resulting from the dissolution of snow meltwater martin 1981 the most spectacular karstic shapes are the large closed basins 2 or 3 km long with clay and silt bottoms which are filled in winter by lakes the faults have played an essential role in creating the framework for the karstic extension and flattening of these tectonic poljes of the causses of el hammam ajdir and sefrou the limestone plateaus of the middle atlasic causse have been delineated with precision following the main features of the structure illustrated by martin 1981 the major large karstic shapes considered as dolines poljes ouvalas which are filled temporary in winter by water have a tectono karstic origin however the karstic shapes in the depth are less described in the literature but their presence is certain in the form of a corridor following the faults the tectono karstic replay has formed the watersheds intra mountainous that receive runoff water and sediments the karsts have different shapes and sizes and their conjunction with the faults and fractures constitute the zones of lateral and or vertical water circulation baali 1990 1998 2 3 2 hand model the hand nobre et al 2011 a digital elevation model normalized using the nearest drainage is used for hydrological and more general purpose applications such as hazard mapping and landform classification donchyts et al 2016 in this case a combination of slope and the hand model has been used to classify landforms representing the major hydrological systems in the study area concerning its computation from srtm the steps followed are reported in fig 3 and can be summarized as follows remove small imperfection by filling sinks define the flow direction from each cell to its steepest downslope neighbor establish the accumulated flow direction and the nearest drainage map at last normalize the terrain by subtracting the altitude of the nearest drainage cell from the altitude of each cell to produce the hand which will finally be classified 2 3 3 slope slope is an important factor that influences the groundwater availability a higher degree of slope results in a higher run off potential and low infiltration and a lower degree of slope favor the retention of water and the drainage in the depth the slope map was done using the srtm data the slope classes retrieved from the study area will be combined with the classes of the hand model to establish the landscape classification 2 3 4 lineament from multispectral satellite data remote sensing technique provides a means for regional understanding of groundwater systems meijerink et al 2007 maina and tudunwada 2017 the interpretation of remotely sensed data for linear features mapping is an integral part of groundwater exploration programs in hard rock terrain waikar and aditya 2014 principal component analysis pca is an effective technique for enhancing a multispectral image for geological studies pour and hashim 2012 amer et al 2012 adiri et al 2016 it allows for the reduction of the information contained in several bands sometimes highly correlated in a new bands called principal components pcs with redundant data elimination noise isolation and enhanced targeted information gabr et al 2010 amer et al 2012 several studies have used pca in the detection of lineaments paganelli et al 2003 li 2010 adiri et al 2017 the application of directional filters dfs on particular bands or rgb combinations has been explored by various authors argialas et al 2003 kavak 2005 abdullah et al 2013 the lineament mapping is an essential component in hydro geological prospecting their density is an indicator of the fracturation degree of the rock accordingly the fracture network resulting from lineament mapping contributes to the recharge of the groundwater table the automatic lineament extraction was performed by line module using pc1 and dfs as inputs the process is handled by adjusting several values of the six parameters of the line module for each input accordingly several extraction maps were generated using different threshold values the best inputs and most appropriate threshold values having given reliable results are selected table 1 by considering the ground truth the spatial distribution and orientation of the faults and the elongations and alignments of karstic shapes these values are in agreement with those found in the literature e g adiri et al 2017 2 3 5 spatial analysis of potential groundwater recharge factors the hand model and slope were classified together using the reclassify tool in order to extract the landscape classes corresponding to the main hydrological systems in the study area table 2 the classes extracted from the hand model the slope and the lineament density were superposed and affiliated to the carbonate plateaus in order to highlight their intense fracturation and obviously their hydro geological potential fig 4 in this study we focused on two classes extracted from the hand model waterlogged plateaus and the classes containing a high density of lineaments which are located inside the carbonate plateaus 3 results and discussions 3 1 fracture network and karstification analysis tectonic is among the factors controlling karstification häuselmann et al 1999 accordingly the dissolution of the carbonates of the middle atlas causse is favored by their intense fracturation most of the karstic shapes were formed in the liasic limestones this karstification phenomena allows the storage and infiltration of a high proportion of meteoric waters in the carbonate rocks of the lower and middle lias this water appears on the surface in some depressions as lakes and at the periphery of the causses as water sources baali 1998 the lineament orientation is useful for the analysis of local tectonics certain specific orientations resulting from geological deformation are highly correlated with groundwater productivity ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 the extracted lineaments indicated many long and short fractures in the study area with the highest densities are oriented ne sw n s and nw se with a predominance of the ne sw direction fig 5 the frequency of karstic shapes alignments represented by the directional rose diagram fig 6 indicates that the shapes are aligned predominantly in the directions ne sw and n s the elongations of karstic shapes are shown in fig 6 the rose diagram of the elongations indicates that practically all shapes are elongated in the n s direction the dominance of the two directions suggests that karstification took place during a geological era when n s direction faults took a part in middle atlas tectonics controlled by the replay of major ne sw faults baali 1998 the result of digitized faults in the central middle atlas is shown in fig 6 the main faults are aligned in the directions ne sw which corresponds to the direction of karstic shapes alignments in addition there are faults oriented n s which is in agreement with karst elongation these faults qualified as distension during major fault replay ne sw constitute high hydrological potential areas from the above the satellite based extracted lineaments corroborate with the orientation of karstic shapes and the major faults in the study area 3 2 characterization of the carbonate plateaus using the lineaments and the hand model the lineament density is a useful tool for spatial analysis since it allows us to highlight hot spots it is often considered the most important parameter for identifying gpas sener et al 2005 shankar and mohan 2006 corgne et al 2010 the density of the lineaments resulting from the combination of the first principal component analysis pc1 and directional filters df shows a low to medium density in the middle and northern plateaus and a medium to high density in the southern plateaus of the central middle atlas fig 7 this method correlates well with the major faults of the study area by showing high densities around faults following the predominant fault direction ne sw as a result a very high density of lineament is considered as a very high capacity for groundwater potentialities the carbonate plateaus cover a large part of the middle atlas they hold the dolomitic limestone groundwater table of the lias with an area of about 4600 km2 in addition they are characterized by breakable tectonics that play a fundamental morphological role for this reason we have focused on these carbonate plateaus since they constitute the most suitable path for the groundwater recharge we combined the latter with the values obtained from the hand model and lakes fig 8 as a result the values of the hand model are distributed irregularly at the level of the central middle atlas these are low moderate and high values following the analysis of this map it was found that hand takes low 0 5 m and 5 15 m to moderate 16 30 m and 31 100 m values in the limestone plateaus of el hajeb ifrane guigou azrou imouzzer and amekla while the hand takes moderate to high values in the other limestone plateaus 31 100 m and 100 m it was also noted that at the level of the lakes of the central middle atlas the hand takes minimum values 0 2 m the resulting spatial variability of the hand image was analyzed to assess the distribution of the drainage process regarding to the distribution of lineament density fig 9 presents the averaged values of the hand model and the density of the lineaments according to the carbonate plateaus of the central middle atlas from the analysis and interpretation of all the data in this diagram it can be concluded that the carbonate plateaus with a low hand value and a relatively high lineament density have a high potential to drain water at a depth such as the causses of el hajeb azrou guigou ifrane amekla sefrou and ain leuh this result is confirmed by the presence of several lakes and karstic shapes in these carbonate plateaus despite the fact that other plateaus have a low lineament density values and high hand values it is possible that they contain areas with karstic characteristics or small areas suitable for groundwater recharge namely the causses of ajdir imouzzer and el hamam this method has allowed highlighting the most fissured carbonate plateaus that have the capacity to drain surface water at depth for watershed managers it is possible to use the hand model and lineaments density for characterizing the hydrological and hydrogeological behavior of the sub watersheds in addition the hand model may allow for the identification and delimitation of endorheic watersheds 3 3 gpas mapping the resulting spatial variability of the hand model was analyzed to assess the distribution of the main landform types waterlogged wetlands plateaus and hill slopes which allowed generally characterizing the hydrological regimes of the study area the identification of theses landforms was validated by several authors in the literature nobre et al 2011 gharari et al 2011 cuartas et al 2012 as shown in fig 10 a combination between the hand model and the slope was made in order to classify the landforms using thresholds as mentioned in the literature as a result four classes were identified waterlogged with high drainage defined by hand values between 0 and 5 m wetland relatively sloped defined by hand values between 5 and 15 m plateaus with a hand value higher than 15 m and a slope fewer than 7 6 4 hillslope with a hand value higher than 15 m and a slope higher than 7 6 the study area is mainly composed of hillslopes and plateaus the plateaus are located in the western center of the study area which corresponds significantly with the middle atlas causse in addition other plateaus are located in the south west in the pleated middle atlas in the north west there are some plateaus which coincide with the saiss plain the waterlogged classe occupies a large area and is enclosed in the plateaus the waterlogged class could be depressions water bodies and large plateaus which favor the retention of water in the presence of fissured limestone this leads to water infiltration and groundwater recharge moreover the plateaus class represents large high lands with very low slope for this reason these classes will be used afterward for gpas by contrast the wetland and hillslope classes which have a relatively high slope favor runoff and they will not contribute in the recharge zone mapping consequently the waterlogged and the plateau classes have been integrated in a gis spatial overlay with lineaments density and carbonate plateaus this spatial analysis allowed us to obtain the most important group of pixels representing at the same time the waterlogged classes plateaus classes and moderate to high lineaments densities these pixels represent potential infiltration and groundwater recharge areas as reported in fig 11 in order to validate the results we have used the sources lakes and piezometric levels a simple comparison has shown that the majority of the delineated gpas enclose several sources and karstic lakes fig 11 these show that these areas have a significant capacity in the exchanges between the surface and the groundwater table therefore these potential areas have a direct connection with the karstic groundwater table the interpolated map of piezometric level fig 12 shows that the groundwater table level is very close to the subsurface at several delineated areas for example the piezometric level reaches about 5 m in the south of immouzzer causse the delineated zones in the other causses have a piezometric level that ranges from 19 to 30 m on the other hand there are few areas with a high piezometric level that exceeds 40 m for small scale areas a local assessment can be carried out using the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer system which will provide accurate information on the gpa s efficiency the areas of high density of lineaments and low values of hand as demonstrated by the present study represent potential areas for infiltration and recharge of the groundwater table the delineated potential areas are mostly wet regions characterized by the presence of lakes and the land use is mainly agriculture arboriculture rangeland and shrubs e g region of aoua lake ifrah lake in fig 12 in recent years groundwater levels in the study area have declined this is due to unfavourable climatic conditions and the various anthropogenic pressures associated with the expansion of agricultural land leading to an increasing demand for irrigation water the decrease in groundwater level causes a decrease in source and stream flows and therefore contributes to the process of decreasing the water level of the lakes in the study area which has been observed in the last decade detailed structural analysis and better understanding of the hydrological system defined by the hand landforms classification could provide useful tools for hydrologists for reliable groundwater management development planning and sustainable exploitation the hand factor was very important for gpas mapping since it reflects the hydraulic gradient and soil water conditions more precisely the delineation of the gpas helps to control the agricultural or agroforestry practices and other anthropogenic activities in these sensitive areas given that such human activities could lead to groundwater depletion and deterioration of its quality due to deep percolation of agrochemical residuals knowing that the groundwater table is a complex karstic type and is easily exposed to all kinds of pollution and or depletion for future work it is recommended to extend the present study by taking into consideration the dynamics of land use that can be extracted by multi temporal satellite remote sensing monitoring the spatial dynamics of land use will make it possible to identify and predict land use changes namely the expansion of agriculture and other trends that influence groundwater even if it demonstrated the importance of hand model in the mapping of gpas the gis analysis used in this paper is a simple overlay and allows for the identification of gpas and none potential areas without quantification of the degree of potentiality to deal with this limitation an advanced

12241,in the 21st century global warming erratic rainfall and the pressure on groundwater resources are becoming severe and leading to water scarcity which contributes to the poverty of around one third of the world s people hence it became necessary to use new geospatial technologies for mapping and monitoring of groundwater resources spatial analysis of hydro geological lineament network and hydrological modeling may allow accurate identification of areas that favor infiltration and recharge of overexploited groundwater in morocco the middle atlas region suffers from a lack of reliable hydro geological maps for local water resource managers consequently this research aims to assess the relative contribution of the topo hydrological factor known as height above nearest drainage hand for efficient exploration and management of groundwater resources in central middle atlas the methodology was based on the landsat 8 operational land imager oli data for retrieving the lineaments and the elevation data from shuttle radar topography mission srtm for the calculation of the hand model four landscape classes namely waterlogged land wetlands sloped hillslope and plateaus corresponding to the main hydrological systems were delineated using the hand model in addition fissured carbonate plateaus faults karsts water sources lakes and groundwater levels have been used to develop a decision support system based on geospatial criteria analysis the fracture analysis indicated that the study area has many long and short hydro geological lineaments with the highest densities oriented ne sw their synergy with the hand model and the other factors has allowed the detection of potential areas for the recharge of the groundwater table the results have been confirmed and validated using lakes water sources and piezometric levels the application of the hand factor as an independent variable in the delineation of groundwater potential areas gpas is demonstrated to be useful for improving the accuracy of the existing multi criteria gis models graphical abstract image 1 keywords lineaments karst groundwater remote sensing gis hand landscape classification multi criteria analysis 1 introduction the recent years have seen the emergence of water stressed conditions in the arid and semi arid regions resulting from a confluence of several factors davis et al 2017 the increasing demand by residential industrial and agricultural uses mismanaged water resources and extreme climate changes such as erratic rainfall and global warming have caused groundwater depletion and decreased quality in many regions prasad and rao 2018 kalhor et al 2019 accordingly water resource management is a major socio economic issue and an essential component of the progress in semi arid regions corgne et al 2010 ouzemou et al 2018 africa is at the fore front of the regions concerned by the impact of climate fluctuations on groundwater resources kanohin et al 2009 hamed et al 2018 zima 2019 several studies in africa have shown a decrease in groundwater flow as a result of reduced rainfall vissin et al 2007 bates et al 2008 kanohin et al 2009 ait kadi and ziyad 2018 in the last sixty years morocco was suffered from a decrease in total rainfall and a positive trend in the maximum number of consecutive dry days ait kadi and ziyad 2018 the moroccan middle atlas region suffers from a chronic lack of reliable hydro geological maps for local water resource managers as a result it has become necessary to have an efficient tool to facilitate suitable decision making for exploration and management of the groundwater resources in this region considering that groundwater is a vital natural resource for the reliable and economic provision of agricultural and potable water supplies in both urban and rural environment magesh et al 2012 boujghad et al 2019 el baghdadi et al 2019 in addition its occurrence and distribution depend on the climate and regional setting of the area surface and subsurface characteristics konkul et al 2014 al saud 2010 senthil kumar and shankar 2014 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 conventional exploration methods such as field based hydrogeological techniques hydraulic conductivity surveys and exploratory drilling remain laborious time consuming and very expensive through synoptic coverage and fast spatial analysis delineating the groundwater potential areas gpas using satellite remote sensing and gis is an indirect less expensive and effective tool for the sustainable development of the groundwater resources and to fulfill the water needs ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 jasrotia et al 2018 ferozur et al 2019 kalhor et al 2019 in recent years extensive use of satellite data along with conventional maps and rectified ground truth data has made it easier to establish the base line information for gpas chowdhury et al 2010 magesh et al 2011 2012 al shabeeb et al 2018 regarding the literature several studies have used different data including surface temperature green vegetation during summer and orientation to identify hydro geological lineaments on the other side some of them have chosen geomorphology slope lineaments and precipitation for the mapping of potential areas for groundwater recharge corgne et al 2010 alonso contes 2011 nanda et al 2017 al shabeeb et al 2018 in addition some authors have used an approach for lineaments extraction using shaded relief from the digital elevation model dem to highlight the linkage between lineaments vegetation and groundwater sahoo et al 2018 the height above the nearest drainage hand is a digital elevation model normalized using the nearest drainage it normalizes topography according to the local relative heights found along the drainage network and in this way presents the topology of the relative soil gravitational potential or local draining potentials hand allows for the calculation of the elevation of each point in the catchment above the nearest stream it drains to following the flow direction rennó et al 2008 nobre et al 2011 many applications of hand have already been published such as landscape classification and the topographic wetness in a mesoscale catchment in temperate climates gharari et al 2011 flood mapping is an incredibly vital practice which provides communities with valuable and useable knowledge that can be used to understand the potential risks associated with such natural disasters as such efforts were placed on analyzing terrain using the hand model as an approach for mapping the potential extent of inundations and flash flood prone area mapping nobre et al 2016 donchyts et al 2016 mcgrath et al 2018 another approach for developing a synthetic rating curve to relate flow to water level in a stream reach based on reach averaged channel geometry properties has been developed using the hand model zheng et al 2018 huang et al 2017 have tested the hand model performance on assisting surface water mapping using sentinel 1 sar data cuartas et al 2012 demonstrated that the hand model is a useful tool for representing the spatial distributions of key hydrological parameters in the same context the hand model was applied to landslide susceptibility modeling by using novel statistical models kornejady et al 2018 however using the hand model in the development of the hydro geological concept and determination of his link with hydro geological lineaments and karstic shapes for groundwater exploration has never been evaluated in the literature the present study suggests a new approach for mapping potential areas for infiltration and recharge of the groundwater table using remote sensing gis and the hand hydrological model in the moroccan central middle atlas accordingly the specific objectives of this study are thus 1 identification of hydro geological lineament 2 assessment of the hand model contributions in delineating groundwater recharge potential areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 geological and hydro geological settings the middle atlas with a surface area of 9500 km2 is located between by parallels 32 45 and 34 18 n and meridians 3 42 and 5 42 w it is bounded to the north by the south rifain corridor to the south by the high atlas and the plateaus of high moulouya to the east by the valley of the middle moulouya and to the west by the moroccan meseta michard 1976 the middle atlas is composed by the juxtaposition of two structural units the middle atlasic causse and the pleated middle atlas fig 1 these are separated by a major structural line called the north middle atlasic fault oriented ne sw colo 1961 the middle atlas causse is composed essentially of neritic carbonates of the lower and middle lias its structure in inclined blocks is expressed in the topography by large karst plateaus variously staged it is affected by the tizi n tretten fault also oriented ne sw the pleated middle atlas is the southern part of the intracontinental chain oriented ne sw elongated over more than 400 km it is organized into acute anticlinal wrinkles and large synclinal depressions the groundwater of the middle atlas is a groundwater table of complex karstic origin formed into dolomites of the lower lias and dolomites and limestones of the middle lias which are well fissured and tectonized and sometimes crushed the climate of the middle atlas can be defined as a mediterranean mountain climate it is characterized by the succession of cold and warm seasons 2 2 data and methodology used fig 2 shows an overall view of the data and approach applied in this study on the one hand we used two landsat 8 images from operational land imager oli sensor acquired over the study area during the summer of 2016 the first one was taken in june path 201 row 37 and the second in july path 200 row 37 oli sensor acquires images in nine spectral bands from shorter wavelengths of visible to short wave infrared swir the spatial resolution of this sensor varies from 15 panchromatic band to 30 m multispectral bands on the other hand the srtm elevation data spatial resolution of 30 m has been used to calculate the hydrological hand model first the faults and carbonate plateaus were digitized from the geological and geomorphological map of the central middle atlas secondly the two multispectral oli images have been used to extract the lineaments using automatic extraction from the line algorithm oli images have been radiometrically calibrated and corrected from atmospheric effects accordingly the raw data in digital number were converted into radiance values then they were corrected from both additive and multiplicative atmospheric effects using the flaash model fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes finally the study area has been clipped from a mosaic of both preprocessed images 2 3 related groundwater recharge factors 2 3 1 geomorphology and lithology the middle atlasic causse is characterized by a flat structure more faulty than pleated with a monotonous lithology of weakly pleated liasic limestones it is composed of vast limestone plateaus between 1000 and 2200 m also known as causses after a long tectonic stability during the eocene period tectonic activity reactivated during the oligocene period and dislocated the different limestone plateaus of the middle atlasic causse during the pliocene erosion processes built up the present landforms and landscapes during the quaternary this landscape was disrupted by volcanic activity that gave rise to several edifices and lava flows the present landscape is disseminated with more or less active karst landforms which the limestone and dolomitic facies constitute a suitable environment for the chemical dissolution of the rocks karstification phenomena the dolomites and limestones of the middle lias have been more corroded than the dolomites of the lower lias karstic shapes are essentially superficial therefore we can distinguish minor sinkholes such as lapiez ruiniform reliefs of dolomites and small depressions resulting from the dissolution of snow meltwater martin 1981 the most spectacular karstic shapes are the large closed basins 2 or 3 km long with clay and silt bottoms which are filled in winter by lakes the faults have played an essential role in creating the framework for the karstic extension and flattening of these tectonic poljes of the causses of el hammam ajdir and sefrou the limestone plateaus of the middle atlasic causse have been delineated with precision following the main features of the structure illustrated by martin 1981 the major large karstic shapes considered as dolines poljes ouvalas which are filled temporary in winter by water have a tectono karstic origin however the karstic shapes in the depth are less described in the literature but their presence is certain in the form of a corridor following the faults the tectono karstic replay has formed the watersheds intra mountainous that receive runoff water and sediments the karsts have different shapes and sizes and their conjunction with the faults and fractures constitute the zones of lateral and or vertical water circulation baali 1990 1998 2 3 2 hand model the hand nobre et al 2011 a digital elevation model normalized using the nearest drainage is used for hydrological and more general purpose applications such as hazard mapping and landform classification donchyts et al 2016 in this case a combination of slope and the hand model has been used to classify landforms representing the major hydrological systems in the study area concerning its computation from srtm the steps followed are reported in fig 3 and can be summarized as follows remove small imperfection by filling sinks define the flow direction from each cell to its steepest downslope neighbor establish the accumulated flow direction and the nearest drainage map at last normalize the terrain by subtracting the altitude of the nearest drainage cell from the altitude of each cell to produce the hand which will finally be classified 2 3 3 slope slope is an important factor that influences the groundwater availability a higher degree of slope results in a higher run off potential and low infiltration and a lower degree of slope favor the retention of water and the drainage in the depth the slope map was done using the srtm data the slope classes retrieved from the study area will be combined with the classes of the hand model to establish the landscape classification 2 3 4 lineament from multispectral satellite data remote sensing technique provides a means for regional understanding of groundwater systems meijerink et al 2007 maina and tudunwada 2017 the interpretation of remotely sensed data for linear features mapping is an integral part of groundwater exploration programs in hard rock terrain waikar and aditya 2014 principal component analysis pca is an effective technique for enhancing a multispectral image for geological studies pour and hashim 2012 amer et al 2012 adiri et al 2016 it allows for the reduction of the information contained in several bands sometimes highly correlated in a new bands called principal components pcs with redundant data elimination noise isolation and enhanced targeted information gabr et al 2010 amer et al 2012 several studies have used pca in the detection of lineaments paganelli et al 2003 li 2010 adiri et al 2017 the application of directional filters dfs on particular bands or rgb combinations has been explored by various authors argialas et al 2003 kavak 2005 abdullah et al 2013 the lineament mapping is an essential component in hydro geological prospecting their density is an indicator of the fracturation degree of the rock accordingly the fracture network resulting from lineament mapping contributes to the recharge of the groundwater table the automatic lineament extraction was performed by line module using pc1 and dfs as inputs the process is handled by adjusting several values of the six parameters of the line module for each input accordingly several extraction maps were generated using different threshold values the best inputs and most appropriate threshold values having given reliable results are selected table 1 by considering the ground truth the spatial distribution and orientation of the faults and the elongations and alignments of karstic shapes these values are in agreement with those found in the literature e g adiri et al 2017 2 3 5 spatial analysis of potential groundwater recharge factors the hand model and slope were classified together using the reclassify tool in order to extract the landscape classes corresponding to the main hydrological systems in the study area table 2 the classes extracted from the hand model the slope and the lineament density were superposed and affiliated to the carbonate plateaus in order to highlight their intense fracturation and obviously their hydro geological potential fig 4 in this study we focused on two classes extracted from the hand model waterlogged plateaus and the classes containing a high density of lineaments which are located inside the carbonate plateaus 3 results and discussions 3 1 fracture network and karstification analysis tectonic is among the factors controlling karstification häuselmann et al 1999 accordingly the dissolution of the carbonates of the middle atlas causse is favored by their intense fracturation most of the karstic shapes were formed in the liasic limestones this karstification phenomena allows the storage and infiltration of a high proportion of meteoric waters in the carbonate rocks of the lower and middle lias this water appears on the surface in some depressions as lakes and at the periphery of the causses as water sources baali 1998 the lineament orientation is useful for the analysis of local tectonics certain specific orientations resulting from geological deformation are highly correlated with groundwater productivity ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 the extracted lineaments indicated many long and short fractures in the study area with the highest densities are oriented ne sw n s and nw se with a predominance of the ne sw direction fig 5 the frequency of karstic shapes alignments represented by the directional rose diagram fig 6 indicates that the shapes are aligned predominantly in the directions ne sw and n s the elongations of karstic shapes are shown in fig 6 the rose diagram of the elongations indicates that practically all shapes are elongated in the n s direction the dominance of the two directions suggests that karstification took place during a geological era when n s direction faults took a part in middle atlas tectonics controlled by the replay of major ne sw faults baali 1998 the result of digitized faults in the central middle atlas is shown in fig 6 the main faults are aligned in the directions ne sw which corresponds to the direction of karstic shapes alignments in addition there are faults oriented n s which is in agreement with karst elongation these faults qualified as distension during major fault replay ne sw constitute high hydrological potential areas from the above the satellite based extracted lineaments corroborate with the orientation of karstic shapes and the major faults in the study area 3 2 characterization of the carbonate plateaus using the lineaments and the hand model the lineament density is a useful tool for spatial analysis since it allows us to highlight hot spots it is often considered the most important parameter for identifying gpas sener et al 2005 shankar and mohan 2006 corgne et al 2010 the density of the lineaments resulting from the combination of the first principal component analysis pc1 and directional filters df shows a low to medium density in the middle and northern plateaus and a medium to high density in the southern plateaus of the central middle atlas fig 7 this method correlates well with the major faults of the study area by showing high densities around faults following the predominant fault direction ne sw as a result a very high density of lineament is considered as a very high capacity for groundwater potentialities the carbonate plateaus cover a large part of the middle atlas they hold the dolomitic limestone groundwater table of the lias with an area of about 4600 km2 in addition they are characterized by breakable tectonics that play a fundamental morphological role for this reason we have focused on these carbonate plateaus since they constitute the most suitable path for the groundwater recharge we combined the latter with the values obtained from the hand model and lakes fig 8 as a result the values of the hand model are distributed irregularly at the level of the central middle atlas these are low moderate and high values following the analysis of this map it was found that hand takes low 0 5 m and 5 15 m to moderate 16 30 m and 31 100 m values in the limestone plateaus of el hajeb ifrane guigou azrou imouzzer and amekla while the hand takes moderate to high values in the other limestone plateaus 31 100 m and 100 m it was also noted that at the level of the lakes of the central middle atlas the hand takes minimum values 0 2 m the resulting spatial variability of the hand image was analyzed to assess the distribution of the drainage process regarding to the distribution of lineament density fig 9 presents the averaged values of the hand model and the density of the lineaments according to the carbonate plateaus of the central middle atlas from the analysis and interpretation of all the data in this diagram it can be concluded that the carbonate plateaus with a low hand value and a relatively high lineament density have a high potential to drain water at a depth such as the causses of el hajeb azrou guigou ifrane amekla sefrou and ain leuh this result is confirmed by the presence of several lakes and karstic shapes in these carbonate plateaus despite the fact that other plateaus have a low lineament density values and high hand values it is possible that they contain areas with karstic characteristics or small areas suitable for groundwater recharge namely the causses of ajdir imouzzer and el hamam this method has allowed highlighting the most fissured carbonate plateaus that have the capacity to drain surface water at depth for watershed managers it is possible to use the hand model and lineaments density for characterizing the hydrological and hydrogeological behavior of the sub watersheds in addition the hand model may allow for the identification and delimitation of endorheic watersheds 3 3 gpas mapping the resulting spatial variability of the hand model was analyzed to assess the distribution of the main landform types waterlogged wetlands plateaus and hill slopes which allowed generally characterizing the hydrological regimes of the study area the identification of theses landforms was validated by several authors in the literature nobre et al 2011 gharari et al 2011 cuartas et al 2012 as shown in fig 10 a combination between the hand model and the slope was made in order to classify the landforms using thresholds as mentioned in the literature as a result four classes were identified waterlogged with high drainage defined by hand values between 0 and 5 m wetland relatively sloped defined by hand values between 5 and 15 m plateaus with a hand value higher than 15 m and a slope fewer than 7 6 4 hillslope with a hand value higher than 15 m and a slope higher than 7 6 the study area is mainly composed of hillslopes and plateaus the plateaus are located in the western center of the study area which corresponds significantly with the middle atlas causse in addition other plateaus are located in the south west in the pleated middle atlas in the north west there are some plateaus which coincide with the saiss

presence of fissured limestone this leads to water infiltration and groundwater recharge moreover the plateaus class represents large high lands with very low slope for this reason these classes will be used afterward for gpas by contrast the wetland and hillslope classes which have a relatively high slope favor runoff and they will not contribute in the recharge zone mapping consequently the waterlogged and the plateau classes have been integrated in a gis spatial overlay with lineaments density and carbonate plateaus this spatial analysis allowed us to obtain the most important group of pixels representing at the same time the waterlogged classes plateaus classes and moderate to high lineaments densities these pixels represent potential infiltration and groundwater recharge areas as reported in fig 11 in order to validate the results we have used the sources lakes and piezometric levels a simple comparison has shown that the majority of the delineated gpas enclose several sources

12242,18o has long been a useful tool to understand the physical processes operating in hydrosphere and used as geothermometer to estimate paleotemperature according to the literature review of this research there is no such reported experimental approach which records 18o fractionation pattern in liquid water system when there is no phase change involved but temperature gradient exist in this experimental approach an attempt has been made to fractionate 18o with response to known temperature gradient by simulating a gently dipping confined aquifer system in controlled laboratory condition the experimental apparatus was designed in such a way that it replicates an impermeable confined aquifer boundary initial condition of the model was homogeneous distribution of different isotopomers of water before imposing the temperature gradient as temperature gradient imposed on the experimental apparatus 18o and 16o will fractionate as per their preferred thermal regime depending on the vibrational frequency of 16o 18o and 16o 16o it is likely that 18o will concentrate at lower temperature regime where as 16o will concentrate at higher temperature regime leading to isotopic stratification milli q water was used for the experiment to fractionate 18o with known temperature gradient the experiment was to generate a good dataset which satisfies the physical fractionation of 18o in real life situation in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient when there is no phase change of water involved keeping the findings of this experiment in mind we can make an

regime of 100 c 250 c fournier and potter 1979 fouillac and michard 1981 fournier and potter 1982 arnorsson and gunnlaugsson 1985 giggenbach 1988 goff and gardner 2000 ganguly et al 2019 proposed an analytical deterministic model which can estimate groundwater temperature in absolute scale with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature that is if the temperature of groundwater was higher or lower than 25 c from its 18o isotopic signature 18o is considered as conservative tracer to determine groundwater flow paths as well as its origin significant work has been done in the field of hydrology and hydrogeology using 18o as a tool for deep understanding of different processes operating in different domains of the hydrosphere using temperature dependent 18o fractionation particularly for water ice vapor system however no effort was made to determine absolute groundwater temperature from 18o fractionation when there is no phase change of water involved but temperature gradient exist until ganguly et al 2019 proposed their 18o geothermometer prior to this experimental work 18o geothermometer proposed by ganguly et al 2019 was only testified by field δ18o data of sacramento valley california published by criss and davisson 1995 this experimental work is to demonstrate physical fractionation of 18o in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient in controlled laboratory condition where there is no phase change of water involved the temperature range selected for this experimental work was 10 c 50 c with 10 c equal incremental temperature interval so that it can accommodate temperature range of shallow crustal level aquifers the experiment was designed in such a way that it obeys all the initial and boundary conditions of the deterministic analytical model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature this experiment successfully demonstrates that 18o fractionates in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient in controlled laboratory condition therefore this experiment gives the physical justification of the theoretical deterministic analytical model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature with reference to benchmark temperature of 25 c from its 18o isotopic signature 2 the deterministic analytical model the deterministic analytical model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 can estimate groundwater temperature with reference to benchmark temperature of 25 c that is if the groundwater temperature was higher or lower than 25 c they derived their model from fick s law of diffusion considering it as thermal diffusion process and came out with an expression of 18o absolute abundance in ppm for any temperature as described by equation 1 of vpdb vienna pee dee belemnite standard standard at the time of defining vpdb which is international reference material of 18o 16o ratio in marine carbonate it was assumed that global ocean temperature was very close to 25 c considering 18o absolute abundance 2005 12 0 45 ppm coplen et al 1983 clark and fritz 1997 p 11 from this benchmark temperature the deterministic analytical model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 can estimate groundwater temperature if it was warmer or cooler than 25 c from its 18o isotopic signature i v p d b ln i i vpdb i vpdb t equation 1 mathematical expression of 18o absolute abundance for a particular temperature t after ganguly et al 2019 this deterministic model assumes an impermeable boundary condition for a gently dipping dip amount 15 confined aquifer system with increasing temperature down dip due to normal geothermal gradient farther assumptions are that aquifer skeleton material is highly permeable homogeneous and isotropic in terms of hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity the residence time of the water in the aquifer is long enough so that it is in thermal equilibrium with surrounding and effect of pumping is nil or negligible the long residence time will eventually lead to complete mixing of recharge water with aquifer water leading to homogeneous distribution of different isotopomers of water for a gently dipping confined aquifer temperature increases with increasing depth due to normal geothermal gradient therefore there will be a unicellular laminar thermal convection up dip when ra c that is critical rayleigh number to onset free unicellular laminar thermal convection less than but very close to 40 this thermal convection will lead to the formation of temperature dependent density gradient in macro scale along with this in micro scale or molecular level there will be thermal diffusion of different isotopomers of water molecule depending on their thermal stability regime which will eventually lead to isotopic stratification of 18o since vibrational frequency of 16o 16o is 1580 19 cm 1 and 16o 18o is 1535 57 cm 1 huber and herzberg 1979 therefore it is likely that 16o 18o will fractionate with response to normal geothermal gradient it is also likely that 18o will tend to concentrate at lower temperature regime where as 16o will tend to concentrate at higher temperature regime since 18o 16o bond strength is higher than 16o 16o bond strength considering infinitesimal compartments of the confined aquifer system it is obvious that as moving down dip temperature will increase for two successive compartments therefore as moving down dip 18o absolute abundance will decrease for each infinitesimal compartment standing on this analogy if 18o absolute abundance is known for a water sample then its temperature can be estimated with reference to absolute abundance of 18o in vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water at 25 c that is 2005 12 ppm in relative scale urey et al 1951 cuna et al 2001 werner and brand 2001 since changing the standard from vsmow to vpdb vienna standard pee dee belemnite will not change the absolute abundance of 18o therefore ganguly et al 2019 considered that 18o absolute abundance of water at 25 c which is 2005 12 ppm as standard for a given water sample if 18o absolute abundance is less than 2005 12 ppm then its temperature is higher than 25 c and vice versa that is how groundwater temperature can be estimated with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature while validating the model in field condition ganguly et al 2019 took the help of published δ18o data of groundwater reported by criss and davisson 1995 from sacramento valley california in the process of validation of their model ganguly et al 2019 assumed that δ18o data of groundwater is from a continuous aquifer system the assumption was quite consistent with the groundwater model map of the study area as published by criss and davisson 1995 standing on the analogy ganguly et al 2019 farther assumed that for the study area pleistocene groundwater was warmer than holocene groundwater due to incremental geothermal gradient since it is geologically older and deeper seated into the formation flood plain groundwater could be considered geologically youngest and coldest though for reported δ18o data of water of different geological age corresponding temperature data was not reported but the remarkable observation was experimentally derived and model derived 18o absolute abundance for any temperature was within the internationally accepted standard deviation of absolute abundance of 18o for vpdb which is 2 1 ppm from the reported δ18o data of the study area a distinct warmer trend was observed from its isotopic signature with increasing geological age of the water with respect to reference water having absolute abundance of 18o is 2005 12 ppm at 25 c with successful demonstration of the model in field condition of sacramento valley california to estimate groundwater temperature with respect to 25 c benchmark temperature this research is to fractionate 18o in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient in controlled laboratory condition thus this experimental work is to give physical justification of the most fundamental assumption of theoretical deterministic analytical model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature from 18o fractionation that 18o does fractionate in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient 3 experimental approach as discussed earlier that the only way to physically justify the assumptions of 18o geothermometer proposed by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature from its isotopic signature is to fractionate 18o in the laboratory condition with imposed temperature gradient when there is no phase change of water involved it has also been discussed that the analytical deterministic model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 works fine in the field condition and 18o absolute abundance is consistent for experimentally derived and model derived values and within the internationally accepted standard deviation of absolute abundance of 18o of vpdb that is 2 1 ppm therefore we can assume that the model proposed by equation 1 replicates the physical process of oxygen isotope 18o 16o fractionation in liquid water system at any temperature when there is no phase change but only temperature gradient exist the experimental approach adopted in this research is just to fractionate 18o in controlled laboratory condition in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient when there is no phase change of water involved 3 1 experimental set up the experimental set up is designed in such a way that it can best replicate a confined aquifer system obeying the boundary conditions and initial conditions adopted to develop 18o geothermometer proposed by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature from its isotopic signature with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature in the experimental approach utmost most care has been taken to make it thermally isolated closed system from the ambient as well as minimize radiation heat lost within the experimental apparatus the experimental apparatus used for the experiment is absolutely designed by this research team and custom made for the purpose photographic documentation of different components of the experimental apparatus are displayed by figs 1 3 and explanation of illustrations to read the figures are documented at the end of the manuscript to replicate a confined aquifer system with impermeable boundary condition a six inch long brass tube of approximate composition of cu 70 and zn 30 has been used with diameter of approximately one inch having thermal conductivity of nearly 111 0 w m k the brass tube was kept gently dipping with help of standing clamp and dip amount was less than but close to 15 to minimize the radiation heat loss from brass tube it was wrapped with alternate aluminum foil and glued transparent plastic tape as documented by fig 1 above mentioned was the best possible thermal isolation technique that could be adopted for the brass tube as per the scope and design of the experimental apparatus to make the temperature gradient at the two end of the brass tube free circulating water bath of desired temperature was used through conduit to make desired temperature gradient to replicate geothermal gradient the experimental apparatus was covered by 6 mm thick wall transparent plastic pvc polyvinyl chloride casing to make it thermally isolated closed system from ambient as documented by fig 2 to maintain ambient temperature adjacent to the brass tube another water bath of small open water tank within the pvc casing was used as documented by fig 1 the idea was there would be heat exchange with air and free circulating water in the small open tank within the casing which will eventually make the temperature within the casing as desired after running the apparatus for desired water bath temperature at two ends of the brass tube and the water bath controlling the casing air temperature it took approximately 6 h to get everything thermally equilibrated water reserved for all three water baths were approximately 5 l in separate tanks with solution of 1 1 ratio of ethaline glycol and water microprocessor based temperature indicator digitally displayed all the temperatures of different components of the experimental apparatus to sense temperature three wire resistance temperature detector rtd input of pt 100 sensor make multispan were used with 220 v operating voltage as documented by fig 2 once the desired temperature equilibrium is achieved after 6 h of equilibration time water sample of approximately 2 ml were collected by removing the pvc casing and perforating the septa as documented by fig 1 with clinical syringe from the two ends of the brass tube recording the corresponding temperature of individual water sample for 18o analysis at the time of water sample collection up dip septa was perforated first to avoid isotopic mixing of water within the apparatus fig 3 is the photographic documentation of the experimental apparatus in fully functional mode 3 2 experimental design throughout the experiment milli q water of resistivity 18 2 mω cm at 25 c and conductivity 0 055 μs cm was used since the only purpose of the experiment was to fractionate 18o with imposed temperature in liquid water system for different temperature gradient therefore initial 18o concentration of milli q water was not an imperative information for this experiment initially the experiment was conducted by filling the brass tube with highly porous and permeable sand of approximately ϕ scale of 1 0 saturated with milli q water to replicate a highly porous and permeable confined aquifer system justification of selecting the grainsize is to keep ra c that is the critical rayleigh number that will onset free unicellular thermal conduction very close to 40 in the experimental apparatus considering the experimental apparatus configuration to keep ra c very close to 40 following values were assumed for different parameters of equation 2 to calculate permeability k ra k g σ ρ c t h δ t γ λ equation 2 equation of rayleigh number when k permeability of medium g acceleration due to gravity 9 8 m sec2 σ volumetric thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid 2 0 10 4 k 1 ρc t volumetric heat capacity of fluid 4 106

effective thermal conductivity of the fluid filled medium 1 4 watt m2 k combarnous and bories 1975 putting all those parameters into equation 2 and ra c of 39 which is less than but very close to 40 permeability of the medium k was 8 10 10 m2 which is quite conformable for unconsolidated well sorted highly permeable medium to coarse sand of ϕ scale 1 25 to 1 this value of permeability is within the range of permeability reported by freeze and cherry 1979 p 29 for clean coarse sand with permeability range from 10 8 m2 to 10 12 m2 according to the theoretical convection model of unicellular laminar convection as proposed by wood and hewett 1982 dip of the strata should be less than but very close to 15 throughout the experiment the dip of the brass tube were kept constant at 14 considering value of cos 14 which is 0 97 the rac value boils down to 38 40 which is conformable to initiate free laminar convection according to the theoretical convection model of unicellular laminar convection experiment was conducted for the temperature range of 10 c 50 c with 10 c equal incremental interval that is 10 20 c 10 30 c and so on reason behind selecting this temperature range was water has its maximum density at 4 c and at higher temperature regime there is significant chance of water vapor phase change furthermore considering 25 c km geothermal gradient turner and verhoogen 2004 p 436 lowrie 2007 p 228 this temperature range can accommodate 18o fractionation up to the depth of 2 km which is maximum depth of availability of fresh groundwater in shallow subsurface the first temperature gradient was made for 10 c 20 c once the temperature gradient was achieved after 6 h of equilibration time water samples were collected from two ends of the experimental brass tube by perforating the up dip septa first to avoid isotopic mixing of water in the experimental apparatus approximately three milliliter of water sample were collected from each end of the experimental apparatus by clinical syringe documenting the corresponding temperature at two ends of the brass tube once the sample collection was done from both the ends of the experimental apparatus water within the apparatus was drained and the brass tube were dried so that there is no water inside the apparatus for next temperature gradient with fresh water and sand the temperature range selected was 10 c 30 c and same procedure was followed to collect water samples from two ends of the experimental apparatus the experiment continued up to 10 c 50 c gradient for each and individual temperature gradient ambient temperature were kept approximately 25 c within the plastic casing of the experimental apparatus by circulating water bath of 25 c for small open water tank within the casing room temperature was controlled around 25 c by air conditioning machine reason behind keeping the ambient temperature very close to 25 c is to make the ambient close to normal geothermal gradient also tweaking the ambient temperature was affecting the imposed temperature gradient at the two ends of the brass tube which were more desired for the experiment 3 3 apparatus used for 18o isotope analysis for isotopic analysis laser isotope analyzer picarro was used of model l1102 i this state of art laser water isotope analyzer takes 1 9 μml of water sample in a single suction and then evaporate it instantaneously to put it into the gas cell or cavity in the gas cell or cavity symmetrically tuned laser of each 1 hz cycle is pass to generate absorption spectra in near ir spectral range for different isotopomers e g h2o h2ho of water present in the sample the absorption line intensity or area under the pick is linearly dependent on concentration of different isotopomers of water present in the gas cell or cavity therefore 18o 16o ratio can be calculated accurately and very precisely the beauty of this machine is that in the process of evaporation it rejects any salt present in the water sample and reports 18o 16o ratio exclusive to water sample therefore salt effect on isotope fractionation need not to be considered at the time of reporting the data generated from this experiment as discussed by ganguly et al 2019 for water sample analysis laser isotope analyzer is more preferred than isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms therefore they did not accommodate any salt effect in their deterministic model 3 4 experimental outcome initial outcome of the experiment to fractionate 18o in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient in above mentioned experimental set up and design were very disappointing experimental apparatus filled with course sand ϕ scale of 1 0 and saturated with milli q water for any temperature gradient and thermal equilibration time of one day could not fractionate 18o due to very high heat capacity of the sand therefore trying to replicate a water saturated natural porous media i e experimental apparatus filled with coarse sand and saturated with milli q water this experimental set up and design failed to initiate unicellular lamellar convection of water with imposed temperature gradient which led to no thermal diffusion of isotopomers of water to fractionate 18o in the next attempt porous sand was removed and experimental apparatus was filled with only milli q water keeping all the thermal conditions same as discussed in section 3 2 remarkable finding was when experimental apparatus was only filled with milli q water and with no sand keeping all the thermal conditions same 18o fractionated for each and individual temperature gradient of thermal equilibration time of 6 h as per the sensitivity of the experimental apparatus significant fractionation of 18o was first noted at 10 c 20 c temperature interval 4 statistical analysis of the data individual water sample corresponding to a particular temperature was analyzed for five times by picarro for statistical analysis of the data spreadsheet software was used since we are dealing with water sample picarro will report δ18o in vsmow standard to put the 25 c benchmark temperature reported δ18o values were converted to vpdb standard supplementary a as per the deterministic model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 however this conversion of standard will not change the 18o absolute abundance in ppm in the water sample table 1 represents the experimentally derived δ18o values and absolute abundance of 18o with mean and standard deviation of each small sample population corresponding to a particular temperature maximum fractionation of 18o occurred for the temperature gradient of 10 c 30 c 0 7 ppm table 2 represents systematically model derived ganguly et al 2019 absolute abundance of 18o for the same temperature in table 2 values of column k were taken from seventh column of table 1 table 3 represents model derived 18o absolute abundance with mean and standard deviation of each small sample population corresponding to a particular temperature again the remarkable finding was experimentally derived and model derived 18o absolute abundance was within the internationally accepted standard deviation of absolute abundance 18o of vpdb that is 2 1 ppm urey et al 1951 cuna et al 2001 werner and brand 2001 for any temperature range adopted for this experimental work in the experimental approach the only changing parameter was temperature and its corresponding 18o fractionation response therefor the system under consideration for this experiment is bivariate system since fractionation of 18o is considered only temperature dependent therefore temperature is independent variable and needs to be plot along abscissa x axis while 18o absolute abundance is dependent variable and needs to be ploted along ordinate y axis in the scatter plot figs 4 7 are the graphical scatter plot representation of temperature dependent 18o fractionation pattern for different temperature intervals blue color dots in the graph represents individual 18o measurements in ppm whereas orange color dots represent arithmetic mean of each small sample population for each small sample population standard error of the mean was accommodated by standard error bar fig 8 represents cross correlation of arithmetic mean of experimentally derived and model derived small sample population of 18o absolute abundance corresponding to different temperature interval adopted in this experimental work the cross correlation shows a strong linear relationship 5 summary effort to fractionate heavy water from water isotope mixture considering it by thermal diffusion process is not new in the scientific literature murphy 1955 bebbington and thayer 1959 yeh and yang 1984 2009 however this experimental approach is just to fractionate 18o in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient thus justifying the assumptions of 18o geothermometer model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature experimental set up and design of this experimental approach to fractionate 18o in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient in controlled laboratory condition is exclusive to this research and has not been adopted from any earlier research modeling effort by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature from 18o fractionation with respect to 25 c benchmark temperature initiates from a theoretical model proposed by wood and hewett 1982 for unicellular laminar thermal convection of water in gently dipping dip amount nearly 15 confined aquifer due to imposed natural geothermal gradient to initiate unicellular laminar thermal convection in a natural gently dipping confined aquifer system ra c i e critical rayleigh number should be less than but very close to 40 the deterministic model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 is exclusive to confined aquifer system considering an impermeable boundary farther assumption was there is no phase change of the water but only temperature gradient exists due to normal geothermal gradient down dip the natural porous media is assumed to be homogenous and isotropic in terms of hydraulic conductivity structure and diffusive property initial condition for the modeling effort was all isotopomers of water are homogeneously distributed before imposing the thermal gradient as geothermal gradient imposed to the liquid water system for long subsurface residence time it will onset unicellular laminar convection in the macro scale whereas in micro scale or molecular level isotopomers of water will stratify as per their preferential thermal stability regime leading to isotopic stratification by the process of thermal diffusion since the vibrational frequency of 16o 16o is 1580 193 cm 1 whereas 16o 18o is 1535 57 cm 1 huber and herzberg 1979 therefore it is likely that 18o will tend to concentrate at lower temperature regime and as moving down dip 18o absolute abundance will decrease which will eventually lead to 18o stratification considering 18o absolute abundance is 2005 12 ppm at 25 c proposed geothermometer can estimate groundwater temperature lower than 25 c benchmark temperature if 18o absolute abundance is more than 2005 12 ppm and groundwater temperature higher than 25 c if 18o absolute abundance is less than 2005 12 ppm the experimental set up and design reported in this research keeps in mind that all the initial and boundary conditions remain valid and holds good in the experimental apparatus as per the model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 throughout the experiment experimental apparatus that is the brass tube was kept at a dip angle to 14 so that ra c should remain close to 40 the brass tube replicates a gently dipping confined aquifer system with impermeable boundary temperature gradient was imposed at the two ends of the brass tube by circulating water bath of desired temperature replicates imposed geothermal gradient in the confined aquifer system throughout the experiment for all the temperature gradients ambient temperature were kept at around 25 c which is kind of normal geothermal gradient 25 c km for continental crust all the isotopomers of water are uniformly distributed before imposing temperature gradient satisfies the initial condition of the model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 in the initial attempt to fractionate 18o in liquid water system brass tube were filled with porous sand of approximate grainsize of ϕ scale of 1 0 saturated with milli q water to keep ra c close to but less than 40 keeping the thermal equilibration condition as discussed earlier for equilibrium time of one day and for any temperature gradient this experimental apparatus failed to fractionate 18o in liquid water system due to very high heat capacity of sand grains this negative finding satisfies one of the fundamental assumptions of different thermal convection theoretical models proposed by wood and hewett 1982 that is in natural geological setting it may take long time to make this thermal convection happen in the next attempt the brass tube had been kept empty with any naturally occurring porous media and only filled with milli q water the idea was that this would make the heat capacity of the experimental apparatus low and ease the process of unicellular laminar thermal convection to happen within the brass tube with imposed temperature gradient leading to isotopic stratification as per the sensitivity of the experimental apparatus reported in this research first significant 18o fractionation occurred at 10 c 20 c temperature gradient after thermal equilibration time of approximately 6 h with this success the experiment was farther run for 10 c 30 c 10 c 40 c and 10 c 50 c temperature gradient keeping thermal equilibration time same to satisfy the reproducibility of the 18o fractionation to happen for each set of temperature gradient significant 18o fractionation happened maximum fractionation recorded at 10 c 30 c temperature gradient of 0 7 ppm since for 18o measurement laser isotope analyzer picarro was used therefore this experimental approach excludes salt effect on stable isotope fractionation which is also a matter of debate in scientific literature craig and gordon 1965 sofer and gat 1972 1975 mayo and loucks 1995 as per the sensitivity of the experimental apparatus and experimental design adopted in this research it is successfully demonstrated that 18o fractionates in the liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient when there is no phase change of water involved this finding physically justifies the fundamental proposition of the 18o geothermometer proposed by ganguly et al 2019 that 18o fractionation happens in natural confined aquifer system with imposed geothermal gradient that can be farther used to estimate groundwater temperature with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature in this experimental setting the thermal equilibration time for each set of temperature gradient was approximately 6 h in this very small span of time we can simply neglect the effect of gravity to govern the 18o fractionation and stratification in the experimental apparatus since temperature was the only variable in the experimental design and for each temperature gradient 18o fractionated therefore this experiment also complements the claim of ganguly et al 2019 that for isotopic stratification in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient it is not the gravity but heat is the fundamental cause 6 conclusions isotopic stratification of oxygen and hydrogen in aquifers are widely reported in scientific literature it is also reported that isotopic signature of groundwater replenished by recent meteoric water recharge is distinctly different from that of paleo water isotopic signature of the aquifer this research team identify the phenomena as an effect of geothermal heat with every storm event and its corresponding recharge gravity driven advection will replenish the aquifer storage initially mixing of recharge water with aquifer water will lead to homogenization of all isotopomers of water while percolating through porous media the water will expose to more geothermal heat as moving down this will lead to a temperature dependent density driven thermal convection resulting a mass transfer process opposite to advection considering long residence time of groundwater in the aquifer and thermal equilibration with surrounding it is likely that 18o will concentrate at low temperature regime and as moving down 18o absolute concentration will decrease since the vibrational frequency of 16o 16o is 1580 19 cm 1 that is more than that of vibrational frequency of 16o 18o which is 1535 57 cm 1 therefore this temperature driven natural fractionation of 18o can be used as a geothermometer to estimate groundwater temperature the experimental approach adopted in this research successfully demonstrates that 18o does fractionate in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient this finding justifies reported isotopic stratification in groundwater identifying geothermal heat as primary cause considering long residence time of groundwater in aquifer and thermal equilibration with surrounding geologically older water which is deep seated into the formation will have distinctly different isotopic signature than that of geologically younger water which is exposed to less depth and less geothermal heat therefore proposition of estimating groundwater temperature with respect to 25 c benchmark temperature supported by this experiment is not just a fiction but a fact acknowledgement this research team wants to pay gratitude to the director wadia

12242,18o has long been a useful tool to understand the physical processes operating in hydrosphere and used as geothermometer to estimate paleotemperature according to the literature review of this research there is no such reported experimental approach which records 18o fractionation pattern in liquid water system when there is no phase change involved but temperature gradient exist in this experimental approach an attempt has been made to fractionate 18o with response to known temperature gradient by simulating a gently dipping confined aquifer system in controlled laboratory condition the experimental apparatus was designed in such a way that it replicates an impermeable confined aquifer boundary initial condition of the model was homogeneous distribution of different isotopomers of water before imposing the temperature gradient as temperature gradient imposed on the experimental apparatus 18o and 16o will fractionate as per their preferred thermal regime depending on the vibrational frequency of 16o 18o and 16o 16o it is likely that 18o will concentrate at lower temperature regime where as 16o will concentrate at higher temperature regime leading to isotopic stratification milli q water was used for the experiment to fractionate 18o with known temperature gradient the experiment was to generate a good dataset which satisfies the physical fractionation of 18o in real life situation in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient when there is no phase change of water involved keeping the findings of this experiment in mind we can make an

regime of 100 c 250 c fournier and potter 1979 fouillac and michard 1981 fournier and potter 1982 arnorsson and gunnlaugsson 1985 giggenbach 1988 goff and gardner 2000 ganguly et al 2019 proposed an analytical deterministic model which can estimate groundwater temperature in absolute scale with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature that is if the temperature of groundwater was higher or lower than 25 c from its 18o isotopic signature 18o is considered as conservative tracer to determine groundwater flow paths as well as its origin significant work has been done in the field of hydrology and hydrogeology using 18o as a tool for deep understanding of different processes operating in different domains of the hydrosphere using temperature dependent 18o fractionation particularly for water ice vapor system however no effort was made to determine absolute groundwater temperature from 18o fractionation when there is no phase change of water involved but temperature gradient exist until ganguly et al 2019 proposed their 18o geothermometer prior to this experimental work 18o geothermometer proposed by ganguly et al 2019 was only testified by field δ18o data of sacramento valley california published by criss and davisson 1995 this experimental work is to demonstrate physical fractionation of 18o in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient in controlled laboratory condition where there is no phase change of water involved the temperature range selected for this experimental work was 10 c 50 c with 10 c equal incremental temperature interval so that it can accommodate temperature range of shallow crustal level aquifers the experiment was designed in such a way that it obeys all the initial and boundary conditions of the deterministic analytical model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature this experiment successfully demonstrates that 18o fractionates in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient in controlled laboratory condition therefore this experiment gives the physical justification of the theoretical deterministic analytical model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature with reference to benchmark temperature of 25 c from its 18o isotopic signature 2 the deterministic analytical model the deterministic analytical model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 can estimate groundwater temperature with reference to benchmark temperature of 25 c that is if the groundwater temperature was higher or lower than 25 c they derived their model from fick s law of diffusion considering it as thermal diffusion process and came out with an expression of 18o absolute abundance in ppm for any temperature as described by equation 1 of vpdb vienna pee dee belemnite standard standard at the time of defining vpdb which is international reference material of 18o 16o ratio in marine carbonate it was assumed that global ocean temperature was very close to 25 c considering 18o absolute abundance 2005 12 0 45 ppm coplen et al 1983 clark and fritz 1997 p 11 from this benchmark temperature the deterministic analytical model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 can estimate groundwater temperature if it was warmer or cooler than 25 c from its 18o isotopic signature i v p d b ln i i vpdb i vpdb t equation 1 mathematical expression of 18o absolute abundance for a particular temperature t after ganguly et al 2019 this deterministic model assumes an impermeable boundary condition for a gently dipping dip amount 15 confined aquifer system with increasing temperature down dip due to normal geothermal gradient farther assumptions are that aquifer skeleton material is highly permeable homogeneous and isotropic in terms of hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity the residence time of the water in the aquifer is long enough so that it is in thermal equilibrium with surrounding and effect of pumping is nil or negligible the long residence time will eventually lead to complete mixing of recharge water with aquifer water leading to homogeneous distribution of different isotopomers of water for a gently dipping confined aquifer temperature increases with increasing depth due to normal geothermal gradient therefore there will be a unicellular laminar thermal convection up dip when ra c that is critical rayleigh number to onset free unicellular laminar thermal convection less than but very close to 40 this thermal convection will lead to the formation of temperature dependent density gradient in macro scale along with this in micro scale or molecular level there will be thermal diffusion of different isotopomers of water molecule depending on their thermal stability regime which will eventually lead to isotopic stratification of 18o since vibrational frequency of 16o 16o is 1580 19 cm 1 and 16o 18o is 1535 57 cm 1 huber and herzberg 1979 therefore it is likely that 16o 18o will fractionate with response to normal geothermal gradient it is also likely that 18o will tend to concentrate at lower temperature regime where as 16o will tend to concentrate at higher temperature regime since 18o 16o bond strength is higher than 16o 16o bond strength considering infinitesimal compartments of the confined aquifer system it is obvious that as moving down dip temperature will increase for two successive compartments therefore as moving down dip 18o absolute abundance will decrease for each infinitesimal compartment standing on this analogy if 18o absolute abundance is known for a water sample then its temperature can be estimated with reference to absolute abundance of 18o in vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water at 25 c that is 2005 12 ppm in relative scale urey et al 1951 cuna et al 2001 werner and brand 2001 since changing the standard from vsmow to vpdb vienna standard pee dee belemnite will not change the absolute abundance of 18o therefore ganguly et al 2019 considered that 18o absolute abundance of water at 25 c which is 2005 12 ppm as standard for a given water sample if 18o absolute abundance is less than 2005 12 ppm then its temperature is higher than 25 c and vice versa that is how groundwater temperature can be estimated with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature while validating the model in field condition ganguly et al 2019 took the help of published δ18o data of groundwater reported by criss and davisson 1995 from sacramento valley california in the process of validation of their model ganguly et al 2019 assumed that δ18o data of groundwater is from a continuous aquifer system the assumption was quite consistent with the groundwater model map of the study area as published by criss and davisson 1995 standing on the analogy ganguly et al 2019 farther assumed that for the study area pleistocene groundwater was warmer than holocene groundwater due to incremental geothermal gradient since it is geologically older and deeper seated into the formation flood plain groundwater could be considered geologically youngest and coldest though for reported δ18o data of water of different geological age corresponding temperature data was not reported but the remarkable observation was experimentally derived and model derived 18o absolute abundance for any temperature was within the internationally accepted standard deviation of absolute abundance of 18o for vpdb which is 2 1 ppm from the reported δ18o data of the study area a distinct warmer trend was observed from its isotopic signature with increasing geological age of the water with respect to reference water having absolute abundance of 18o is 2005 12 ppm at 25 c with successful demonstration of the model in field condition of sacramento valley california to estimate groundwater temperature with respect to 25 c benchmark temperature this research is to fractionate 18o in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient in controlled laboratory condition thus this experimental work is to give physical justification of the most fundamental assumption of theoretical deterministic analytical model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature from 18o fractionation that 18o does fractionate in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient 3 experimental approach as discussed earlier that the only way to physically justify the assumptions of 18o geothermometer proposed by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature from its isotopic signature is to fractionate 18o in the laboratory condition with imposed temperature gradient when there is no phase change of water involved it has also been discussed that the analytical deterministic model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 works fine in the field condition and 18o absolute abundance is consistent for experimentally derived and model derived values and within the internationally accepted standard deviation of absolute abundance of 18o of vpdb that is 2 1 ppm therefore we can assume that the model proposed by equation 1 replicates the physical process of oxygen isotope 18o 16o fractionation in liquid water system at any temperature when there is no phase change but only temperature gradient exist the experimental approach adopted in this research is just to fractionate 18o in controlled laboratory condition in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient when there is no phase change of water involved 3 1 experimental set up the experimental set up is designed in such a way that it can best replicate a confined aquifer system obeying the boundary conditions and initial conditions adopted to develop 18o geothermometer proposed by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature from its isotopic signature with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature in the experimental approach utmost most care has been taken to make it thermally isolated closed system from the ambient as well as minimize radiation heat lost within the experimental apparatus the experimental apparatus used for the experiment is absolutely designed by this research team and custom made for the purpose photographic documentation of different components of the experimental apparatus are displayed by figs 1 3 and explanation of illustrations to read the figures are documented at the end of the manuscript to replicate a confined aquifer system with impermeable boundary condition a six inch long brass tube of approximate composition of cu 70 and zn 30 has been used with diameter of approximately one inch having thermal conductivity of nearly 111 0 w m k the brass tube was kept gently dipping with help of standing clamp and dip amount was less than but close to 15 to minimize the radiation heat loss from brass tube it was wrapped with alternate aluminum foil and glued transparent plastic tape as documented by fig 1 above mentioned was the best possible thermal isolation technique that could be adopted for the brass tube as per the scope and design of the experimental apparatus to make the temperature gradient at the two end of the brass tube free circulating water bath of desired temperature was used through conduit to make desired temperature gradient to replicate geothermal gradient the experimental apparatus was covered by 6 mm thick wall transparent plastic pvc polyvinyl chloride casing to make it thermally isolated closed system from ambient as documented by fig 2 to maintain ambient temperature adjacent to the brass tube another water bath of small open water tank within the pvc casing was used as documented by fig 1 the idea was there would be heat exchange with air and free circulating water in the small open tank within the casing which will eventually make the temperature within the casing as desired after running the apparatus for desired water bath temperature at two ends of the brass tube and the water bath controlling the casing air temperature it took approximately 6 h to get everything thermally equilibrated water reserved for all three water baths were approximately 5 l in separate tanks with solution of 1 1 ratio of ethaline glycol and water microprocessor based temperature indicator digitally displayed all the temperatures of different components of the experimental apparatus to sense temperature three wire resistance temperature detector rtd input of pt 100 sensor make multispan were used with 220 v operating voltage as documented by fig 2 once the desired temperature equilibrium is achieved after 6 h of equilibration time water sample of approximately 2 ml were collected by removing the pvc casing and perforating the septa as documented by fig 1 with clinical syringe from the two ends of the brass tube recording the corresponding temperature of individual water sample for 18o analysis at the time of water sample collection up dip septa was perforated first to avoid isotopic mixing of water within the apparatus fig 3 is the photographic documentation of the experimental apparatus in fully functional mode 3 2 experimental design throughout the experiment milli q water of resistivity 18 2 mω cm at 25 c and conductivity 0 055 μs cm was used since the only purpose of the experiment was to fractionate 18o with imposed temperature in liquid water system for different temperature gradient therefore initial 18o concentration of milli q water was not an imperative information for this experiment initially the experiment was conducted by filling the brass tube with highly porous and permeable sand of approximately ϕ scale of 1 0 saturated with milli q water to replicate a highly porous and permeable confined aquifer system justification of selecting the grainsize is to keep ra c that is the critical rayleigh number that will onset free unicellular thermal conduction very close to 40 in the experimental apparatus considering the experimental apparatus configuration to keep ra c very close to 40 following values were assumed for different parameters of equation 2 to calculate permeability k ra k g σ ρ c t h δ t γ λ equation 2 equation of rayleigh number when k permeability of medium g acceleration due to gravity 9 8 m sec2 σ volumetric thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid 2 0 10 4 k 1 ρc t volumetric heat capacity of fluid 4 106 watt sec m3 pryor 1971 h thickness of the porous layer 0 0254 m which is equivalent to one inch δt temperature difference across the layer 10 c γ kinematic viscosity of the fluid 4 10 7 m2 sec λ effective thermal conductivity of the fluid filled medium 1 4 watt m2 k combarnous and bories 1975 putting all those parameters into equation 2 and ra c of 39 which is less than but very close to 40 permeability of the medium k was 8 10 10 m2 which is quite conformable for unconsolidated well sorted highly permeable medium to coarse sand of ϕ scale 1 25 to 1 this value of permeability is within the range of permeability reported by freeze and cherry 1979 p 29 for clean coarse sand with permeability range from 10 8 m2 to 10 12 m2 according to the theoretical convection model of unicellular laminar convection as proposed by wood and hewett 1982 dip of the strata should be less than but very close to 15 throughout the experiment the dip of the brass tube were kept constant at 14 considering value of cos 14 which is 0 97 the rac value boils down to 38 40 which is conformable to initiate free laminar convection according to the theoretical convection model of unicellular laminar convection experiment was conducted for the temperature range of 10 c 50 c with 10 c equal incremental interval that is 10 20 c 10 30 c and so on reason behind selecting this temperature range was water has its maximum density at 4 c and at higher temperature regime there is significant chance of water vapor phase change furthermore considering 25 c km geothermal gradient turner and verhoogen 2004 p 436 lowrie 2007 p 228 this temperature range can accommodate 18o fractionation up to the depth of 2 km which is maximum depth of availability of fresh groundwater in shallow subsurface the first temperature gradient was made for 10 c 20 c once the temperature gradient was achieved after 6 h of equilibration time water samples were collected from two ends of the experimental brass tube by perforating the up dip septa first to avoid isotopic mixing of water in the experimental apparatus approximately three milliliter of water sample were collected from each end of the experimental apparatus by clinical syringe documenting the corresponding temperature at two ends of the brass tube once the sample collection was done from both the ends of the experimental apparatus water within the apparatus was drained and the brass tube were dried so that there is no water inside the apparatus for next temperature gradient with fresh water and sand the temperature range selected was 10 c 30 c and same procedure was followed to collect water samples from two ends of the experimental apparatus the experiment continued up to 10 c 50 c gradient for each and individual temperature gradient ambient temperature were kept approximately 25 c within the plastic casing of the experimental apparatus by circulating water bath of 25 c for small open water tank within the casing room temperature was controlled around 25 c by air conditioning machine reason behind keeping the ambient temperature very close to 25 c is to make the ambient close to normal geothermal gradient also tweaking the ambient temperature was affecting the imposed temperature gradient at the two ends of the brass tube which were more desired for the experiment 3 3 apparatus used for 18o isotope analysis for isotopic analysis laser isotope analyzer picarro was used of model l1102 i this state of art laser water isotope analyzer takes 1 9 μml of water sample in a single suction and then evaporate it instantaneously to put it into the gas cell or cavity in the gas cell or cavity symmetrically tuned laser of each 1 hz cycle is pass to generate absorption spectra in near ir spectral range for different isotopomers e g h2o h2ho of water present in the sample the absorption line intensity or area under the pick is linearly dependent on concentration of different isotopomers of water present in the gas cell or cavity therefore 18o 16o ratio can be calculated accurately and very precisely the beauty of this machine is that in the process of evaporation it rejects any salt present in the water sample and reports 18o 16o ratio exclusive to water sample therefore salt effect on isotope fractionation need not to be considered at the time of reporting the data generated from this experiment as discussed by ganguly et al 2019 for water sample analysis laser isotope analyzer is more preferred than isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms therefore they did not accommodate any salt effect in their deterministic model 3 4 experimental outcome initial outcome of the experiment to fractionate 18o in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient in above mentioned experimental set up and design were very disappointing experimental apparatus filled with course sand ϕ scale of 1 0 and saturated with milli q water for any temperature gradient and thermal equilibration time of one day could not fractionate 18o due to very high heat capacity of the sand therefore trying to replicate a water saturated natural porous media i e experimental apparatus filled with coarse sand and saturated with milli q water this experimental set up and design failed to initiate unicellular lamellar convection of water with imposed temperature gradient which led to no thermal diffusion of isotopomers of water to fractionate 18o in the next attempt porous sand was removed and experimental apparatus was filled with only milli q water keeping all the thermal conditions same as discussed in section 3 2 remarkable finding was when experimental apparatus was only filled with milli q water and with no sand keeping all the thermal conditions same 18o fractionated for each and individual temperature gradient of thermal equilibration time of 6 h as per the sensitivity of the experimental apparatus significant fractionation of 18o was first noted at 10 c 20 c temperature interval 4 statistical analysis of the data individual water sample corresponding to a particular temperature was analyzed for five times by picarro for statistical analysis of the data spreadsheet software was used since we are dealing with water sample picarro will report δ18o in vsmow standard to put the 25 c benchmark temperature reported δ18o values were converted to vpdb standard supplementary a as per the deterministic model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 however this conversion of standard will not change the 18o absolute abundance in ppm in the water sample table 1 represents the experimentally derived δ18o values and absolute abundance of 18o with mean and standard deviation of each small sample population corresponding to a particular temperature maximum fractionation of 18o occurred for the temperature gradient of 10 c 30 c 0 7 ppm table 2 represents systematically model derived ganguly et al 2019 absolute abundance of 18o for the same temperature in table 2 values of column k were taken from seventh column of table 1 table 3 represents model derived 18o absolute abundance with mean and standard deviation of each small sample population corresponding to a particular temperature again the remarkable finding was experimentally derived and model derived 18o absolute abundance was within the internationally accepted standard deviation of absolute abundance 18o of vpdb that is 2 1 ppm urey et al 1951 cuna et al 2001 werner and brand 2001 for any temperature range adopted for this experimental work in the experimental approach the only changing parameter was temperature and its corresponding 18o fractionation response therefor the system under consideration for this experiment is bivariate system since fractionation of 18o is considered only temperature dependent therefore temperature is independent variable and needs to be plot along abscissa x axis while 18o absolute abundance is dependent variable and needs to be ploted along ordinate y axis in the scatter plot figs 4 7 are the graphical scatter plot representation of temperature dependent 18o fractionation pattern for different temperature intervals blue color dots in the graph represents individual 18o measurements in ppm whereas orange color dots represent arithmetic mean of each small sample population for each small sample population standard error of the mean was accommodated by standard error bar fig 8 represents cross correlation of arithmetic mean of experimentally derived and model derived small sample population of 18o absolute abundance corresponding to different temperature interval adopted in this experimental work the cross correlation shows a strong linear relationship 5 summary effort to fractionate heavy water from water isotope mixture considering it by thermal diffusion process is not new in the scientific literature murphy 1955 bebbington and thayer 1959 yeh and yang 1984 2009 however this experimental approach is just to fractionate 18o in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient thus justifying the assumptions of 18o geothermometer model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature experimental set up and design of this experimental approach to fractionate 18o in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient in controlled laboratory condition is exclusive to this research and has not been adopted from any earlier research modeling effort by ganguly et al 2019 to estimate groundwater temperature from 18o fractionation with respect to 25 c benchmark temperature initiates from a theoretical model proposed by wood and hewett 1982 for unicellular laminar thermal convection of water in gently dipping dip amount nearly 15 confined aquifer due to imposed natural geothermal gradient to initiate unicellular laminar thermal convection in a natural gently dipping confined aquifer system ra c i e critical rayleigh number should be less than but very close to 40 the deterministic model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 is exclusive to confined aquifer system considering an impermeable boundary farther assumption was there is no phase change of the water but only temperature gradient exists due to normal geothermal gradient down dip the natural porous media is assumed to be homogenous and isotropic in terms of hydraulic conductivity structure and diffusive property initial condition for the modeling effort was all isotopomers of water are homogeneously distributed before imposing the thermal gradient as geothermal gradient imposed to the liquid water system for long subsurface residence time it will onset unicellular laminar convection in the macro scale whereas in micro scale or molecular level isotopomers of water will stratify as per their preferential thermal stability regime leading to isotopic stratification by the process of thermal diffusion since the vibrational frequency of 16o 16o is 1580 193 cm 1 whereas 16o 18o is 1535 57 cm 1 huber and herzberg 1979 therefore it is likely that 18o will tend to concentrate at lower temperature regime and as moving down dip 18o absolute abundance will decrease which will eventually lead to 18o stratification considering 18o absolute abundance is 2005 12 ppm at 25 c proposed geothermometer can estimate groundwater temperature lower than 25 c benchmark temperature if 18o absolute abundance is more than 2005 12 ppm and groundwater temperature higher than 25 c if 18o absolute abundance is less than 2005 12 ppm the experimental set up and design reported in this research keeps in mind that all the initial and boundary conditions remain valid and holds good in the experimental apparatus as per the model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 throughout the experiment experimental apparatus that is the brass tube was kept at a dip angle to 14 so that ra c should remain close to 40 the brass tube replicates a gently dipping confined aquifer system with impermeable boundary temperature gradient was imposed at the two ends of the brass tube by circulating water bath of desired temperature replicates imposed geothermal gradient in the confined aquifer system throughout the experiment for all the temperature gradients ambient temperature were kept at around 25 c which is kind of normal geothermal gradient 25 c km for continental crust all the isotopomers of water are uniformly distributed before imposing temperature gradient satisfies the initial condition of the model proposed by ganguly et al 2019 in the initial attempt to fractionate 18o in liquid water system brass tube were filled with porous sand of approximate grainsize of ϕ scale of 1 0 saturated with milli q water to keep ra c close to but less than 40 keeping the thermal equilibration condition as discussed earlier for equilibrium time of one day and for any temperature gradient this experimental apparatus failed to fractionate 18o in liquid water system due to very high heat capacity of sand grains this negative finding satisfies one of the fundamental assumptions of different thermal convection theoretical models proposed by wood and hewett 1982 that is in natural geological setting it may take long time to make this thermal convection happen in the next attempt the brass tube had been kept empty with any naturally occurring porous media and only filled with milli q water the idea was that this would make the heat capacity of the experimental apparatus low and ease the process of unicellular laminar thermal convection to happen within the brass tube with imposed temperature gradient leading to isotopic stratification as per the sensitivity of the experimental apparatus reported in this research first significant 18o fractionation occurred at 10 c 20 c temperature gradient after thermal equilibration time of approximately 6 h with this success the experiment was farther run for 10 c 30 c 10 c 40 c and 10 c 50 c temperature gradient keeping thermal equilibration time same to satisfy the reproducibility of the 18o fractionation to happen for each set of temperature gradient significant 18o fractionation happened maximum fractionation recorded at 10 c 30 c temperature gradient of 0 7 ppm since for 18o measurement laser isotope analyzer picarro was used therefore this experimental approach excludes salt effect on stable isotope fractionation which is also a matter of debate in scientific literature craig and gordon 1965 sofer and gat 1972 1975 mayo and loucks 1995 as per the sensitivity of the experimental apparatus and experimental design adopted in this research it is successfully demonstrated that 18o fractionates in the liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient when there is no phase change of water involved this finding physically justifies the fundamental proposition of the 18o geothermometer proposed by ganguly et al 2019 that 18o fractionation happens in natural confined aquifer system with imposed geothermal gradient that can be farther used to estimate groundwater temperature with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature in this experimental setting the thermal equilibration time for each set of temperature gradient was approximately 6 h in this very small span of time we can simply neglect the effect of gravity to govern the 18o fractionation and stratification in the experimental apparatus since temperature was the only variable in the experimental design and for each temperature gradient 18o fractionated therefore this experiment also complements the claim of ganguly et al 2019 that for isotopic stratification in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient it is not the gravity but heat is the fundamental cause 6 conclusions isotopic stratification of oxygen and hydrogen in aquifers are widely reported in scientific literature it is also reported that isotopic signature of groundwater replenished by recent meteoric water recharge is distinctly different from that of paleo water isotopic signature of the aquifer this research team identify the phenomena as an effect of geothermal heat with every storm event and its corresponding recharge gravity driven advection will replenish the aquifer storage initially mixing of recharge water with aquifer water will lead to homogenization of all isotopomers of water while percolating through porous media the water will expose to more geothermal heat as moving down this will lead to a temperature dependent density driven thermal convection resulting a mass transfer process opposite to advection considering long residence time of groundwater in the aquifer and thermal equilibration with surrounding it is likely that 18o will concentrate at low temperature regime and as moving down 18o absolute concentration will decrease since the vibrational frequency of 16o 16o is 1580 19 cm 1 that is more than that of vibrational frequency of 16o 18o which is 1535 57 cm 1 therefore this temperature driven natural fractionation of 18o can be used as a geothermometer to estimate groundwater temperature the experimental approach adopted in this research successfully demonstrates that 18o does fractionate in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient this finding justifies reported isotopic stratification in groundwater identifying geothermal heat as primary cause considering long residence time of groundwater in aquifer and thermal equilibration with surrounding geologically older water which is deep seated into the formation will have distinctly different isotopic signature than that of geologically younger water which is exposed to less depth and less geothermal heat therefore proposition of estimating groundwater temperature with respect to 25 c benchmark temperature supported by this experiment is not just a fiction but a fact acknowledgement this research team wants to pay gratitude to the director wadia

human health impact from groundwater usage the upper limit of nitrate concentration in drinking water is specified as 45 mg l who 1984 agriculture and livestock production accounts for nearly 80 of all the nitrogen added to the environment nitrate concentration of the groundwater samples in the study area is in the range of 32 88 mg l during the pre monsoon some samples of the north and northeastern part of the study area have high concentration of nitrate in a small packet of area around the study area less than 45 mg l nitrate concentration occurs it is observed from the study area that 86 of the groundwater samples has exceed limit of nitrate concentration as per who standards high nitrate concentration in groundwater of this area is due to leaching from indiscriminate dumping of animal waste b m reddy et al 2013 fluoride concentrations in the study area varied between 0 9 and 5 7 mg l 84 of the groundwater samples exceed the permissible limit of fluoride dental and skeletal fluorosis affected areas are shown in table 4 groundwater is the only source of drinking in these villages the rate and extent of fluorosis in southeastern part of anantapur district increases with increase of fluoride level in drinking of water human high concentration of fluoride in groundwater is common in the fractured hard rock zone with pegmatite veins ramesam and rajagopalan 1985 high fluoride level in drinking water causes dental decay and physiological deformations exposure to fluoride beyond the recommended level for longer duration causes fluorosis several physical and chemical defluoridation methods have been designed to treat high fluoride concentration in ground water there is need to develop such methods for defluoridation which would be cost effective and biodegradable adsorption studies for defluoridation on mentha longifolia mint showed that the adsorbent were highly influenced by temperature ph of the solution and initial fluoride concentration experiments at room temperature were performed to evaluate the adsorption capacity of mentha longifolia mint from aqueous solutions results show that mentha longifolia mint is as effective for removing fluoride in groundwater samples sunitha and muralidharareddy 2018 high sodium potassium bicarbonate and an alkaline ph increase the ion exchange of fluoride by hydroxyl ions oh the na acquired by groundwater from the chemical weathering of rock forming minerals is used as an index of the weathering of minerals alternate wet and dry conditions of the semiarid climate this is responsible for leaching fluoride from the minerals present in the soils and rocks subbarao 1993 higher electro negativity of fluoride always facilitates attraction of ca2 ions in teeth and bones and excess intake of fluoride causes skeletal fluorosis fluoride is negatively correlated with calcium which further indicates that there is no substantial contribution of fluoride in increasing its concentration by other anthropogenic sources hence fluoride concentration in groundwater is mainly due to availability and solubility of fluorine bearing minerals however in the study area fluoride is not showing significant correlation with ph whereas positive correlation of fluoride with na k hco3 indicating that the alkaline nature of groundwater with high hco3 and na can enhance the solubility of fluorite in the groundwater of studied region fig 4 a e correlation coefficient of chemical parameters is shown in table 9 further it can also be concluded that fˉ contamination of groundwater is a function of many factors such as temperature ph concentration of calcium and bicarbonate ions in water weathering and leaching of fluoride bearing minerals from the basement granitic rocks of this region under alkaline environment 14 estimation of water quality index the evaluation of general suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes for each sample were achieved by estimating their respective water quality index wqi wqi was calculated using the world health organization standards who 2011 and indian standards isi 2012 the wqi calculation was carried out using a weighted arithmetic index as shown below brown et al 1970 calculation for water quality rating q n 100 v n v i s n v i where qn water quality rating for the nth parameter vn observed value of the nth parameter

recommended standard value of sn w n k s n where wn unit weight for the nth parameter sn standard value of the nth parameter k constant for proportionality constant for proportionality constant by using the following equation was calculated k 1 1 s n the total water quality index was calculated linearly by adding the quality rating to the unit weight wqi q n w n w n water quality index was used to assess the status of groundwater quality for drinking purpose in this area water quality classification based on wqi value is shown in tables 6 8 water quality index spatial distribution map shown in fig 3 wqi values of groundwater samples ranges from 4 895 to 752 80 out of fifty samples only 10 of samples and 6 of samples are of excellent and good category respectively 16 of samples are of poor category 22 of samples belong to very poor class and 46 of samples are of unsuitable class based on this overall quality of groundwater is not suitable for drinking purpose 15 classification of groundwater for irrigation purposes irrigation water quality refers to its suitability for agricultural use according to the u s salinity laboratory of the department of agriculture 1954 electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratios are considered in determining the suitability of water quality for irrigation the suitability of water for irrigation can be estimated by means of many determinants like percent sodium na residual sodium carbonate rsc and sodium adsorption ratio sar 16 percent sodium na the sodium in irrigation waters is usually denoted as percent sodium and can be determined by the following formula given below wilcox 1955 the classification of groundwater samples of the study area are with respect to percent sodium and ec is shown in fig 5 for pre monsoon respectively it is observed that 100 samples during pre monsoon season fall in the excellent to good category 17 residual sodium carbonate rsc the sodium hazard to the crops can also increase significantly with the rise in bicarbonate concentration water containing high concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate ions tends to precipitate calcium and magnesium as their carbonates as a consequence the relative proportion of sodium increases and gets fixed in the soil thereby decreasing the soil permeability residual sodium carbonate is calculated by the following equation eaton 1950 rsc co 3 2 hco 3 ca 2 mg 2 where all the concentrations are expressed in meq l the groundwater of the study area is classified on the basis of the rsc is presented in table 2 it is clear from that the groundwater of the area does not have a tendency to cause sodium hazards the rsc values for all the sampling periods indicate that the groundwater has good quality for irrigation 18 sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium concentration is an important factor as sodium reacts with soil and reduces its permeability therefore sodium adsorption ratio is considered as a measure of sodium hazard to irrigation a soil with high exchangeable sodium is very much undesirable for agricultural purposes become deflocculated and tends to have a relatively impermeable layer this process of deflocculating is accelerated by water with a high sodium adsorption ratio and reserved by water containing a high proportion of calcium and magnesium hem 1970 the degree to which irrigation water enters into cation exchange reactions in soil can be indicated by sar todd 1980 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where ionic concentrations are expressed in milli equivalents the greater the value of sar the greater is the hazard to the crops due to excess sodium the groundwater of the mudigubba nallamada and kadiri mandals is classified on the basis of sar values as recommended by todd 1980 and presented in table 5 it is clear from the table that sar of the 100 of groundwater samples in study area belongs to excellent class the graphical method proposed by raghunath 1987 is used to examine the suitability of groundwater for irrigation it is essentially an adaptation of the semi logarithmic diagrammatic representation developed by the staff of u s salinity laboratory 1954 to suit indian conditions the diagram uses two parameters namely i electrical conductance ec of water expressed in μs cm which is proportional to tds content and hence the degree of salinity and ii sodium adsorption ratio sar irrigation water classification based on sar indicates that 100 of the samples are suitable for irrigation fig 6 19 piper tri linear diagram the piper trilinear diagram piper 1953 for the groundwater samples is presented in fig 7 which clearly explains the variations of cation and anion concentration in the study area the diamond shaped field of piper diagram is further divided into four classes namely ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 na k cl so4 2 na k hco3 and ca2 mg2 hco3 in the study area majority of samples belong to the na k cl so4 2 type water 20 conclusion the main objective of the study was to assess the groundwater quality for drinking irrigation purpose the groundwater in the study area is alkaline in nature groundwater is exceeding the permissible limit of ph total hardness nitrate and fluoride cases of dental and skeletal fluorosis are observed in this area due to continued intake of water enriched with fluoride possible source of fluoride in groundwater are weathering and leaching of fluoride bearing minerals from the basement granitic rocks of this region under alkaline environment more than 80 of the samples exceed the permissible limit 1 5 mg l of fluoride and proper defluoridation techniques are necessary to purify this water on the basis of wqi values of groundwater samples ranges from 4 895 to 752 80 out of fifty samples only 10 of samples and 6 of samples are of excellent and good category respectively 16 of samples are of poor category 22 of samples belong to very poor class and 46 of samples are of unsuitable class according to sawyer et al 2003 classification all the groundwater of the present study area is rated as very hard during pre monsoon season and requires processing before use the suitability of water for irrigation can be estimated by means of many determinants like percent sodium na residual sodium carbonate rsc and sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium adsorption ratio sar values are to be less than 10 and belong to excellent class during pre monsoon season and are suitable for irrigation residual sodium carbonate rsc values on the whole are less than 1 25 meq l most of the water samples of the study are good for irrigation according to the as per ussl diagram all water samples are falling under medium specific conductance and low sodium c2s1 and are suitable for irrigation the wilcox classification has shown 100 of groundwater under excellent to good zone thus the overall groundwater quality in the basin is not desirable for drinking and is suitable only for irrigation purpose acknowledgements the work

of fluorite in the groundwater of studied region fig 4 a e correlation coefficient of chemical parameters is shown in table 9 further it can also be concluded that fˉ contamination of groundwater is a function of many factors such as temperature ph concentration of calcium and bicarbonate ions in water weathering and leaching of fluoride bearing minerals from the basement granitic rocks of this region under alkaline environment 14 estimation of water quality index the evaluation of general suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes for each sample were achieved by estimating their respective water quality index wqi wqi was calculated using the world health organization standards who 2011 and indian standards isi 2012 the wqi calculation was carried out using a weighted arithmetic index as shown below brown et al 1970 calculation for water quality rating q n 100 v n v i s n v i where qn water quality rating for the nth parameter vn observed value of the nth parameter

using the following equation was calculated k 1 1 s n the total water quality index was calculated linearly by adding the quality rating to the unit weight wqi q n w n w n water quality index was used to assess the status of groundwater quality for drinking purpose in this area water quality classification based on wqi value is shown in tables 6 8 water quality index spatial distribution map shown in fig 3 wqi values of groundwater samples ranges from 4 895 to 752 80 out of fifty samples only 10 of samples and 6 of samples are of excellent and good category respectively 16 of samples are of poor category 22 of samples belong to very poor class and 46 of samples are of unsuitable class based on this overall quality of groundwater is not suitable for drinking purpose 15 classification of groundwater for irrigation purposes irrigation water quality refers to its suitability for agricultural use according to the u s salinity laboratory of the department of agriculture 1954 electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratios are considered in determining the suitability of water quality for irrigation the suitability of water for irrigation can be estimated by means of many determinants like percent sodium na residual sodium carbonate rsc and sodium adsorption ratio sar 16 percent sodium na the sodium in irrigation waters is usually denoted as percent sodium and can be determined by the following formula given below wilcox 1955 the classification of groundwater samples of the study area are with respect to percent sodium and ec is shown in fig 5 for pre monsoon respectively it is observed that 100 samples during pre monsoon season fall in the excellent to good category 17 residual sodium carbonate rsc the sodium hazard to the crops can also increase significantly with the rise in bicarbonate concentration water containing high concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate ions tends to precipitate calcium and magnesium as their carbonates as a consequence the relative proportion of sodium increases and gets fixed in the soil thereby decreasing the soil permeability residual sodium carbonate is calculated by the following equation eaton 1950 rsc co 3 2 hco 3 ca 2 mg 2 where all the concentrations are expressed in meq l the groundwater of the study area is classified on the basis of the rsc is presented in table 2 it is clear from that the groundwater of the area does not have a tendency to cause sodium hazards the rsc values for all the sampling periods indicate that the groundwater has good quality for irrigation 18 sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium concentration is an important factor as sodium reacts with soil and reduces its permeability therefore sodium adsorption ratio is considered as a measure of sodium hazard to irrigation a soil with high exchangeable sodium is very much undesirable for agricultural purposes become deflocculated and tends to have a relatively impermeable layer this process of deflocculating is accelerated by water with a high sodium adsorption ratio and reserved by water containing a high proportion of calcium and magnesium hem 1970 the degree to which irrigation water enters into cation exchange reactions in soil can be indicated by sar todd 1980 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where ionic concentrations are expressed in milli equivalents the greater the value of sar the greater is the hazard to the crops due to excess sodium the groundwater of the mudigubba nallamada and kadiri mandals is classified on the basis of sar values as recommended by todd 1980 and presented in table 5 it is clear from the table that sar of the 100 of groundwater samples in study area belongs to excellent class the graphical method proposed by raghunath 1987 is used to examine the suitability of groundwater for irrigation it is essentially an adaptation of the semi logarithmic diagrammatic representation developed by the staff of u s salinity laboratory 1954 to suit indian conditions the diagram uses two parameters namely i electrical conductance ec of water expressed in μs cm which is proportional to tds content and hence the degree of salinity and ii sodium adsorption ratio sar irrigation water classification based on sar indicates that 100 of the samples are suitable for irrigation fig 6 19 piper tri linear diagram the piper trilinear diagram piper 1953 for the groundwater samples is presented in fig 7 which clearly explains the variations of cation and anion concentration in the study area the diamond shaped field of piper diagram is further divided into four classes namely ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 na k cl so4 2 na k hco3 and ca2 mg2 hco3 in the study area majority of samples belong to the na k cl so4 2 type water 20 conclusion the main objective of the study was to assess the groundwater quality for drinking irrigation purpose the groundwater in the study area is alkaline in nature groundwater is exceeding the permissible limit of ph total hardness nitrate and fluoride cases of dental and skeletal fluorosis are observed in this area due to continued intake of water enriched with fluoride possible source of fluoride in groundwater are weathering and leaching of fluoride bearing minerals from the basement granitic rocks of this region under alkaline environment more than 80 of the samples exceed the permissible limit 1 5 mg l of fluoride and proper defluoridation techniques are necessary to purify this water on the basis of wqi values of groundwater samples ranges from 4 895 to 752 80 out of fifty samples only 10 of samples and 6 of samples are of excellent and good category respectively 16 of samples are of poor category 22 of samples belong to very poor class and 46 of samples are of unsuitable class according to sawyer et al 2003 classification all the groundwater of the present study area is rated as very hard during pre monsoon season and requires processing before use the suitability of water for irrigation can be estimated by means of many determinants like percent sodium na residual sodium carbonate rsc and sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium adsorption ratio sar values are to be less than 10 and belong to excellent class during pre monsoon season and are suitable for irrigation residual sodium carbonate rsc values on the whole are less than 1 25 meq l most of the water samples of the study are good for irrigation according to the as per ussl diagram all water samples are falling under medium specific conductance and low sodium c2s1 and are suitable for irrigation the wilcox classification has shown 100 of groundwater under excellent to good zone thus the overall groundwater quality in the basin is not desirable for drinking and is suitable only for irrigation purpose acknowledgements the work

12244,as an important stage in integrated water resources management integrated assessment adopts a set of indicators to address not only the physical water balance but also the role of water in social welfare economic production and employment the indicators should be located in an analytical framework capable of figuring out the inter relationships among different environmental social and economic disciplines adopting the system of environmental and economic accounts for water developed by the united nations this paper aims to provide an integrated assessment in the groundwater resource in the azarshahr aquifer area in the northwestern iran comparing local water security indicators in 2006 and 2016 the results show that the local water resource in the study area is highly stressed in terms of quantity and quality in addition the area suffers severely from unsustainability and dis equilibrium between water resource and consumption using a system dynamics model developed in vensim ple the paper analyzed five different policy options which could have been devised to improve the water security in the area the policy option 1 stepwise reduction in the irrigated agricultural area from 2006 to 2010 followed by a constant 2 decline from 2010 to 2016 was found more effective in controlling the water salinity since it is highly inelastic in terms of regional economic revenue it could be a cost effective policy to prevent salinization of water with low impacts on the regional revenue the methodology can be applied for building water accounting systems in similar areas for the purpose of integrated water resources assessment and planning graphical abstract image 1 keywords water accounting system dynamics modelling policy analysis lake urmia 1 introduction traditionally water resources assessment deals only with physical water balance in terms of water supply and consumption in iran several studies have been implemented to assess water resources both in national and local levels in terms of basin wide water master plans e g jamab consulting engineers 2005 1999 ministry of energy 2012 after the brundtland report brundtland 1987 the issue of integrity emerged in the concept of sustainability which has underpinned the new paradigm of water resources management since 1990s in the new paradigm known as integrated water resources management iwrm the concept of integrity is associated to both vertical and horizontal dimensions while vertical integrity consists of different management scales from local to national levels horizontal integrity embraces all stakeholders from different sectors and disciplines serving as an important stage in water resources planning in the process of iwrm integrated water resources assessment addresses not only the physical water balance but also the role that water plays in social and economic sub systems in terms of water contribution to social welfare economic production employment etc furthermore it is also concerned about the environmental aspects of water utilization in terms of the pollution discharged into the environment therefore addressing the environmental social and economic dimensions of sustainability integrated water resources assessment is both comprehensive and strategic hacking and guthrie 2008 integrated water resources assessment is carried out by applying a set of indicators the indicators should be located in an analytical framework to be able to provide integrated analysis of the system under study analytical frameworks are capable of making inter relationships among indicators from different disciplines to figure out the role of water in the environmental social and economic sectors and the effect of those sectors on the state of water resources and the associated processes among different analytical frameworks for the purpose of integrated assessment those associated to water accounting systems are more prevail there is a variety of water accounting frameworks with different premises and applications chalmers et al 2012 some of the most popular frameworks for water accounting are international water management institute iwmi water accounting molden 1997 water footprint accounting hoekstra and chapagain 2006 general purpose water accounting united nations 2009 system of environmental and economic accounts for water seea water united nations statistics division 2012 and water accounts plus wa karimi et al 2013 karimi et al 2012 while the other water accounting frameworks focus on physical water balance the seea water suggests a combination of quantitative and qualitative physical water data with social economic data through which one can show the contribution of water in economic production as well as the impacts of economic production on water bodies quantities and qualities it can be applied from a farm level to a basin scale or even to a national level the seea water is a part of the satellite accounting system which has been initiated by the un to standardize the system of data gathering and reporting worldwide the first generation of those accounts was the system of national accounts sna launched in 1953 in 2003 the new series of system of environmental and economic accounts seea was launched to combine economic data with environmental data the seea water is a specific sub category of seea series seea water consists of five categories of accounts unsd 2012 which are as below category 1 physical supply and use tables and emission accounts category 2 hybrid and economic accounts category 3 asset accounts category 4 quality accounts category 5 valuation of water resources a water accounting framework is a system of organizing data the water accounts will then play roles to produce indicators and indices to generate inter related water economic information the indicators would be analyzed according to their trends of variation in time and or comparing with norms the analytical results would provide useful feed for decision policy making the water accounts can also be linked to simulation models to analyze the consequences of potential scenarios and policy options as well seea water is a framework which should be customized for application in each country according to its attributes of concern and also availability of data there are several case studies in which the seea water has been used to generate water accounts for instance one can see project consultant egis bceom international 2010 for water allocation planning in malawi mauritius namibia and zambia as well as in maputo and orange rivers basins karimov et al 2012 in fergana valley a sub basin of sirdarya basin in central asia for developing strategies to store water vicente et al 2016 in duero river basin in spain edens and graveland 2014 in a country scale in the netherlands falaki ilkhchi 2012 in zarrinehrud basin in iran yousofzadeh chabok 2013 in a regional aquifer scale in mashad plain in iran and babaeian et al 2016 in the rafsanjan local aquifer in iran the major challenge in producing water accounts is to generate figures to fill in the tables and the methods to derive those figures from the recorded raw data according to the interested scales of water accounts that could be more controversial in areas with lack of data or data gaps the present paper aims to apply the seea water in the azarshahr aquifer area in the northwestern iran emphasizing the methodologies to customize the framework to underpin the water accounts and derivation of corresponding information from raw data the methodologies adopted in this paper could be inspiring for building water accounting systems in similar areas 2 method first of all the purpose of assessment should be determined clearly in the present paper azarshahr plain will be assessed regarding its vulnerability of water security therefore the paper will adopt the vulnerability assessment framework developed by fussel 2007 according to fussel s framework four components should be studied for assessment of a system vulnerability the four components of vulnerability are the system under study threat time reference and the attribute of concern in our case study the system under study is the aquifer system in azarshahr the threat is water scarcity the time reference is annual and finally the attribute of concern is the local water security thus the purpose of integrated assessment of the aquifer system in azarshahr is to assess its water security vulnerability to water scarcity water security as understood in this paper will be assessed using different indexes which are categorized in three dimensions of water resources economic and social the main function of water accounting system in this case study is to organize the huge number of data in terms of different water accounting tables which will underpin the indexes corresponding to water security assessment among the water accounts associated to seea water accounting framework in this paper only physical supply and use tables hybrid and economic accounts and asset accounts are produced for the study area in years 2006 and 2016 in addition a suggested social economic account babaeian et al 2016 will be also produced which can be corresponded to category 5 of water accounts for which there is not yet a universally agreed format the physical supply and use tables show the water flow between the environment and the economy as well as the water flow within the economic sector the hybrid and economic accounts elaborate the revenues and costs associated to different water uses the asset account shows the water storage in the beginning and the end of water accounting period as well as the variation in water storage during that period finally the social accounts indicate social costs and benefits associated to water uses based on the information organized within the water accounts indicators are produced to assess the regional water security embracing hydrological economic and social aspects different policy options could have been devised to affect the water security to investigate the effects of policy options a system dynamics model was built to simulate the behavior of the system under study affected by each option the feedback inter relationships among the system actors have been taken into account in terms of sub systems the steps which will be followed in this paper are shown in fig 1 3 the study area being as a sub basin in lake urmia the azarshahr study area is located in eastern azerbaijan province south of tabriz fig 2 the whole area is 468 km2 of which 110 km2 is covered by plain areas the main river flowing through the area is gambarchay table 1 shows the crop area for different crops cultivated in the study area for years 2006 and 2016 the industrial activities are located in an industrial town near the study area table 2 shows the categories and the number of industrial units in years 2006 and 2016 and the associated water supplied for those activities 4 results to analyze water security in the azarshahr study area the associated indicators according to babaeian et al 2016 were generated based on the data arranged in the water accounts the categories of water uses are agricultural detailed in the sub categories as indicated in table 1 industrial as aggregated of the sub categories in table 2 except services services and households known as isic 36 and isic 37 the water accounts are demonstrated in tables 3 14 to remove the effect of inflation all the prices are reported according to the fixed prices of base year 2011 water security is an important issue in most of the basins in iran in this paper water security is considered as the main attribute of concern in the azarshahr study area we use the definition of water security by grey and sadoff 2007 as the availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health livelihoods ecosystems and production coupled with an acceptable level of water related risks to people environments and economies the methods to assess water security apply indicators within an analytical framework dunn et al 2012 unsd 2012 introduced 38 indicators of which 21 indicators can be directly calculated from the water accounts in 2014 global water partnership gwp published indicators for assessing water security which were categorized into four dimensions 1 access to water 2 human vulnerability to water related risks 3 human needs focusing on food security and 4 sustainability gwp 2014 in this paper the indicators to evaluate water security in the azarshahr study area are categorized in three dimensions of water resources economic and social the indicators are associated to three pillars of sustainable development environment water resources economy and society moreover we took also into account availability of data social indicators include variables such as population employment labor per capita income and water economic indicators correspond to the components of water consumption and productivity in different economic sectors water resources indicators associate to the components of volume of internal and external renewable water resources the percentage of dependence on different sources of water surface groundwater and soil water and water quality the applied indicators which are shown in table 15 are calculated based on the data provided in the water accounts for years 2006 and 2016 the values of indicators are compared with their associated norms worldwide or nationwide the description of indicators are given in appendix 1 5 integrated assessment of water security the system conceptual model is depicted in fig 3 it shows the components of water balance in the system under study and how water flows between the components based on the conceptual model the values associated to the water balance are conceptually shown at a glance in fig 4 for years 2006 and 2016 as it is shown the water flows between the economic sectors and the environment within the study area in this paper the concept of water use has been applied as water depletion rather than water withdrawal the later refers to the volume of water abstracted from the resource while some part of the abstracted water will be returned back to the resource the depleted water instead refers to that part of abstracted water which has been consumed in the processes such as evapotranspiration and does in fact exit from the basin boundaries in this paper depleted water will be calculated corresponding to abstracted water minus returned water the water security within the study area is mapped in fig 5 using the indicators elaborated in table 15 for years 2006 and 2016 comparing the water security indicators between 2006 and 2016 and analyzing the variations of mean and marginal values one can figure out the major driver of change in the area is economic relative water stress index rwsi indicates the pressure on the water resources due to the ratio of water demand to the renewable water supply the corresponding values for that index in 2006 and 2016 in the study area were 1 54 and 1 37 respectively while it is advised to utilize the water resources in a way to keep the rwsi below 0 4 unsd 2012 the values of rwsi in the study area show that the local water resource is highly stressed looking at the water accounting tables one can see that the decrease in rwsi in 2016 was because of trans basin water import from zarrinehrud river as well as decreasing in water discharge into lake urmia not because of reduction in water consumption water use intensity index wuii indicates the local water resource sustainability in terms of the ratio of water use to the internal renewable water supply the value of wuii was higher in 2016 than that of in 2006 that means the local water resource is in a highly unsustainable condition contributing in 94 of the area water consumption agriculture is the most pressuring sector on the local water resource followed by services and industries respectively groundwater dependency index gwdi shows the share of local groundwater resource in supplying for the total water demands the gwdi in the study area is lower than its universal norm which is 50 unsd 2012 that is because of low water quality due to salt water intrusion from lake urmia being at the level of 1319 m the groundwater table in azarshahr plain used to be in equilibrium until 1994 95 since that year the groundwater table has been declining gradually it faced a drastic drawdown to the level of 1315 89 m in 2002 03 following a drought incident occurred in 1999 2000 because of groundwater table drawdown in the western part of the aquifer salt water intruded from lake urmia causing the salinity of the aquifer to increase despite groundwater table rise due to artificial recharge from gamabrchay river in the recent years the aquifer water quality has not improved to an acceptable level for agricultural use economic water productivity index ecwpi indicates the economic output in terms of monetary units due to water utilization the industrial sector with 1 43 and 1 shares of water utilization in 2006 and 2016 respectively has had the highest ecwpi standing the services with 3 97 and 5 shares of water utilization in 2006 and 2016 respectively in the next and the agriculture with 94 6 and 94 shares of water utilization in 2006 and 2016 respectively in the last places the value of per capita renewable water resources index pcrwi has increased from 366 m3 per capita in 2006 to 476 m3 per capita in 2016 the increase in the index is because of trans basin water import from zarrinehrud river as well as decreasing in water discharge into lake urmia nevertheless the index is much lower than the falkenmark index which is 1700 m3 yr per capita for water stress and 1000 m3 yr per capita for water scarcity falkenmark and widstrand 1992 while industries and services have the most contribution to the local employment respectively the employment water productivity index emwpi which means the number of employment per unit of water utilization associated to industries is higher than that of services table 16 compares the marginal variations of epi and ecwpi values in the study area versus the variations of averages for those indices from 2006 to 2016 according to table 16 it can be seen that while the changes in the average values of economic indices increased during the period of 10 years the changes in the marginal values were much higher that means the economic drivers were highly dominating the growth mechanism in the study area resulting in ignoring strategic water resources restrictions in favor of short term individual economic gains 6 discussion policy scenario simulation results several policies could have been devised to prevent the water security to worse off during the ten years period of study in this section we are going to examine the policy options that could affect the water security to analyze the consequences of different policy options on the system under study under different scenarios a system dynamics model was built according to the conceptual model depicted in fig 2 the model consists of social economic and environmental sub systems the social economic part includes population and the employment and revenues associated to services industries and agriculture the environmental sub system includes water resources quantity and quality fig 6 a and b 6 1 model verification for the purpose of model verification a number of tests have been proposed sterman 2000 in this paper structural assessment and dimensional consistency tests are checked in vensim more than ten extreme conditions tests have been carried out only four of which are presented in fig 7 finally behavior reproduction tests were checked for more than 10 variables fig 8 shows the behavior reproduction test for 4 variables 6 2 the model base line at the first step the model was run for the historic period with bau policy options the indicators of water security were calculated based on the outputs of bau run since there was no significant difference between the results of simulated data from those of observed table 17 the calculated indicators based on the simulated data will be referred to as the base line in this section at the next step different policy options are examined according to the overarching development programs associated to the study area table 18 the effectiveness of the suggested policy options on reducing the system vulnerability to water security are investigated by the model given that those options could have been devised in the area during the study period the results are depicted in fig 9 the elasticity of indicators are shown in table 19 a variable elasticity indicates the percentage of change in the variable according to one percent of change in each of the affecting policies for instance in policy option 1 corresponding to decrease in irrigated agricultural area the elasticity of economic water productivity index indicates the ratio of percentage change in ecwpi referenced to its initial value due to the percentage of decrease in the area of irrigated agriculture if the elasticity value is greater than one then the ecwpi is elastic i e one percent change in the crop area will affect the index more than one percent if the elasticity value is equal to one then the ecwpi has unit elasticity i e each one percent change in the crop area will result in one percent change in the index finally if the elasticity value is less than one then the ecwpi is inelastic i e each one percent change in the crop area will result in less than one percent change in the index the policy options are targeted to improve the water security indicators from 2006 to 2016 implementation of each policy option will correspond to costs that the local government should bear however those costs have not been directly taken into account when analysing the policies in this paper all the policy options except option4 are effective to reduce water salinity however option 1 seems to be more cost effective policy options 3 and 5 are more effective to improveemwpi ecwpi ecwpi a epi and pci due to noticeable reduction in water consumption nevertheless policy option 5 seems more costly than option 3 while the elasticity of policy option 5 is 10 corresponding to reducing the volume of saline water and it is more than 3 corresponding to the indicators of water consumption rwsi ariinwb ecwpi a ecwpi emwpi and emwpi a in terms of elasticity of indicators corresponding to volume of saline water water consumption rwsi ariinwb ecwpi a ecwpi emwpi and emwpi a policy option 3 is two times more efficient than the other policies table 19 overall the policy options 1 and 2 are the most prioritized respectively and the policy option 5 is the least prioritized policies regarding cost effectiveness 7 conclusions the local water resource in the azarshahr study area is highly stressed as it is illustrated by rwsi and pcrwi indicators in addition according to the value of wuii the area suffers severely from unsustainability and disequilibrium between water resource and consumption the local water security is highly vulnerable due to its 40 dependency on external water resources a huge amount of water is being consumed by agriculture the economic and employment productivities of which were 5 709 000 000 irr 150 000 and 158 persons per mcm in 2016 respectively those productivity indicators are too low probably because of water low prices in spite of its 15 share in the regional economic production the agricultural sector contributes in 24 of regional employment which is a sign of biased policies the annual improvement in the regional agricultural services and industrial economic water productivity rates during the study period have been 4 2 and 5 respectively which is still very low comparing with the international norms the policy option 1 stepwise reduction in the irrigated agricultural area from 2006 to 2010 and constant decline 2 from 2010 to 2016 is effective in controlling the water salinity since it is highly inelastic in terms of the regional economic revenue it could be a cost effective policy to prevent from salinization of more than 30 mcm of water with very low impacts on the regional revenue on the other hand the policy options 3 stepwise increase in both agricultural and horticultural irrigation efficiency from 2006 to 2016 and 5 combination of the all four policy options are elastic in terms of reducing water consumption and improvement in water productivity indicators however they seem more costly in practice according to the elasticity values less than one for all indicators in option 4 one can conclude that this option is totally inelastic overall the policy options 1 and 2 stepwise reduction in the irrigated horticultural area from 2006 to 2016 are the most prioritized respectively and the policy option 5 is the least prioritized policies regarding cost effectiveness appendix 1 description of water security indicators indicator description internal renewable water resources average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater

abstraction is recovered from groundwater in the area ratio of groundwater abstraction to total water abstraction in the study area if this indicator is greater than 0 5 it indicates a high dependency on the groundwater relative water stress index rwsi this indicator provides a measure of water demand pressures from the domestic industrial and agricultural sectors relative to the local and upstream water supplies and calculated as ratio of total water consumption twc to actual renewable water resources areas experiencing water stress and water scarcity can be identified by relative water demand ratios exceeding 0 2 and 0 4 respectively a threshold of 0 4 or 40 percent consumption relative to supply signifies severely water stressed conditions the combination of a water stress threshold and gridded population data enables identification of water stress hot spots areas where large number of people may be suffering from the effects of water stress and its consequent impacts water use

12244,as an important stage in integrated water resources management integrated assessment adopts a set of indicators to address not only the physical water balance but also the role of water in social welfare economic production and employment the indicators should be located in an analytical framework capable of figuring out the inter relationships among different environmental social and economic disciplines adopting the system of environmental and economic accounts for water developed by the united nations this paper aims to provide an integrated assessment in the groundwater resource in the azarshahr aquifer area in the northwestern iran comparing local water security indicators in 2006 and 2016 the results show that the local water resource in the study area is highly stressed in terms of quantity and quality in addition the area suffers severely from unsustainability and dis equilibrium between water resource and consumption using a system dynamics model developed in vensim ple the paper analyzed five different policy options which could have been devised to improve the water security in the area the policy option 1 stepwise reduction in the irrigated agricultural area from 2006 to 2010 followed by a constant 2 decline from 2010 to 2016 was found more effective in controlling the water salinity since it is highly inelastic in terms of regional economic revenue it could be a cost effective policy to prevent salinization of water with low impacts on the regional revenue the methodology can be applied for building water accounting systems in similar areas for the purpose of integrated water resources assessment and planning graphical abstract image 1 keywords water accounting system dynamics modelling policy analysis lake urmia 1 introduction traditionally water resources assessment deals only with physical water balance in terms of water supply and consumption in iran several studies have been implemented to assess water resources both in national and local levels in terms of basin wide water master plans e g jamab consulting engineers 2005 1999 ministry of energy 2012 after the brundtland report brundtland 1987 the issue of integrity emerged in the concept of sustainability which has underpinned the new paradigm of water resources management since 1990s in the new paradigm known as integrated water resources management iwrm the concept of integrity is associated to both vertical and horizontal dimensions while vertical integrity consists of different management scales from local to national levels horizontal integrity embraces all stakeholders from different sectors and disciplines serving as an important stage in water resources planning in the process of iwrm integrated water resources assessment addresses not only the physical water balance but also the role that water plays in social and economic sub systems in terms of water contribution to social welfare economic production employment etc furthermore it is also concerned about the environmental aspects of water utilization in terms of the pollution discharged into the environment therefore addressing the environmental social and economic dimensions of sustainability integrated water resources assessment is both comprehensive and strategic hacking and guthrie 2008 integrated water resources assessment is carried out by applying a set of indicators the indicators should be located in an analytical framework to be able to provide integrated analysis of the system under study analytical frameworks are capable of making inter relationships among indicators from different disciplines to figure out the role of water in the environmental social and economic sectors and the effect of those sectors on the state of water resources and the associated processes among different analytical frameworks for the purpose of integrated assessment those associated to water accounting systems are more prevail there is a variety of water accounting frameworks with different premises and applications chalmers et al 2012 some of the most popular frameworks for water accounting are international water management institute iwmi water accounting molden 1997 water footprint accounting hoekstra and chapagain 2006 general purpose water accounting united nations 2009 system of environmental and economic accounts for water seea water united nations statistics division 2012 and water accounts plus wa karimi et al 2013 karimi et al 2012 while the other water accounting frameworks focus on physical water balance the seea water suggests a combination of quantitative and qualitative physical water data with social economic data through which one can show the contribution of water in economic production as well as the impacts of economic production on water bodies quantities and qualities it can be applied from a farm level to a basin scale or even to a national level the seea water is a part of the satellite accounting system which has been initiated by the un to standardize the system of data gathering and reporting worldwide the first generation of those accounts was the system of national accounts sna launched in 1953 in 2003 the new series of system of environmental and economic accounts seea was launched to combine economic data with environmental data the seea water is a specific sub category of seea series seea water consists of five categories of accounts unsd 2012 which are as below category 1 physical supply and use tables and emission accounts category 2 hybrid and economic accounts category 3 asset accounts category 4 quality accounts category 5 valuation of water resources a water accounting framework is a system of organizing data the water accounts will then play roles to produce indicators and indices to generate inter related water economic information the indicators would be analyzed according to their trends of variation in time and or comparing with norms the analytical results would provide useful feed for decision policy making the water accounts can also be linked to simulation models to analyze the consequences of potential scenarios and policy options as well seea water is a framework which should be customized for application in each country according to its attributes of concern and also availability of data there are several case studies in which the seea water has been used to generate water accounts for instance one can see project consultant egis bceom international 2010 for water allocation planning in malawi mauritius namibia and zambia as well as in maputo and orange rivers basins karimov et al 2012 in fergana valley a sub basin of sirdarya basin in central asia for developing strategies to store water vicente et al 2016 in duero river basin in spain edens and graveland 2014 in a country scale in the netherlands falaki ilkhchi 2012 in zarrinehrud basin in iran yousofzadeh chabok 2013 in a regional aquifer scale in mashad plain in iran and babaeian et al 2016 in the rafsanjan local aquifer in iran the major challenge in producing water accounts is to generate figures to fill in the tables and the methods to derive those figures from the recorded raw data according to the interested scales of water accounts that could be more controversial in areas with lack of data or data gaps the present paper aims to apply the seea water in the azarshahr aquifer area in the northwestern iran emphasizing the methodologies to customize the framework to underpin the water accounts and derivation of corresponding information from raw data the methodologies adopted in this paper could be inspiring for building water accounting systems in similar areas 2 method first of all the purpose of assessment should be determined clearly in the present paper azarshahr plain will be assessed regarding its vulnerability of water security therefore the paper will adopt the vulnerability assessment framework developed by fussel 2007 according to fussel s framework four components should be studied for assessment of a system vulnerability the four components of vulnerability are the system under study threat time reference and the attribute of concern in our case study the system under study is the aquifer system in azarshahr the threat is water scarcity the time reference is annual and finally the attribute of concern is the local water security thus the purpose of integrated assessment of the aquifer system in azarshahr is to assess its water security vulnerability to water scarcity water security as understood in this paper will be assessed using different indexes which are categorized in three dimensions of water resources economic and social the main function of water accounting system in this case study is to organize the huge number of data in terms of different water accounting tables which will underpin the indexes corresponding to water security assessment among the water accounts associated to seea water accounting framework in this paper only physical supply and use tables hybrid and economic accounts and asset accounts are produced for the study area in years 2006 and 2016 in addition a suggested social economic account babaeian et al 2016 will be also produced which can be corresponded to category 5 of water accounts for which there is not yet a universally agreed format the physical supply and use tables show the water flow between the environment and the economy as well as the water flow within the economic sector the hybrid and economic accounts elaborate the revenues and costs associated to different water uses the asset account shows the water storage in the beginning and the end of water accounting period as well as the variation in water storage during that period finally the social accounts indicate social costs and benefits associated to water uses based on the information organized within the water accounts indicators are produced to assess the regional water security embracing hydrological economic and social aspects different policy options could have been devised to affect the water security to investigate the effects of policy options a system dynamics model was built to simulate the behavior of the system under study affected by each option the feedback inter relationships among the system actors have been taken into account in terms of sub systems the steps which will be followed in this paper are shown in fig 1 3 the study area being as a sub basin in lake urmia the azarshahr study area is located in eastern azerbaijan province south of tabriz fig 2 the whole area is 468 km2 of which 110 km2 is covered by plain areas the main river flowing through the area is gambarchay table 1 shows the crop area for different crops cultivated in the study area for years 2006 and 2016 the industrial activities are located in an industrial town near the study area table 2 shows the categories and the number of industrial units in years 2006 and 2016 and the associated water supplied for those activities 4 results to analyze water security in the azarshahr study area the associated indicators according to babaeian et al 2016 were generated based on the data arranged in the water accounts the categories of water uses are agricultural detailed in the sub categories as indicated in table 1 industrial as aggregated of the sub categories in table 2 except services services and households known as isic 36 and isic 37 the water accounts are demonstrated in tables 3 14 to remove the effect of inflation all the prices are reported according to the fixed prices of base year 2011 water security is an important issue in most of the basins in iran in this paper water security is considered as the main attribute of concern in the azarshahr study area we use the definition of water security by grey and sadoff 2007 as the availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health livelihoods ecosystems and production coupled with an acceptable level of water related risks to people environments and economies the methods to assess water security apply indicators within an analytical framework dunn et al 2012 unsd 2012 introduced 38 indicators of which 21 indicators can be directly calculated from the water accounts in 2014 global water partnership gwp published indicators for assessing water security which were categorized into four dimensions 1 access to water 2 human vulnerability to water related risks 3 human needs focusing on food security and 4 sustainability gwp 2014 in this paper the indicators to evaluate water security in the azarshahr study area are categorized in three dimensions of water resources economic and social the indicators are associated to three pillars of sustainable development environment water resources economy and society moreover we took also into account availability of data social indicators include variables such as population employment labor per capita income and water economic indicators correspond to the components of water consumption and productivity in different economic sectors water resources indicators associate to the components of volume of internal and external renewable water resources the percentage of dependence on different sources of water surface groundwater and soil water and water quality the applied indicators which are shown in table 15 are calculated based on the data provided in the water accounts for years 2006 and 2016 the values of indicators are compared with their associated norms worldwide or nationwide the description of indicators are given in appendix 1 5 integrated assessment of water security the system conceptual model is depicted in fig 3 it shows the components of water balance in the system under study and how water flows between the components based on the conceptual model the values associated to the water balance are conceptually shown at a glance in fig 4 for years 2006 and 2016 as it is shown the water flows between the economic sectors and the environment within the study area in this paper the concept of water use has been applied as water depletion rather than water withdrawal the later refers to the volume of water abstracted from the resource while some part of the abstracted water will be returned back to the resource the depleted water instead refers to that part of abstracted water which has been consumed in the processes such as evapotranspiration and does in fact exit from the basin boundaries in this paper depleted water will be calculated corresponding to abstracted water minus returned water the water security within the study area is mapped in fig 5 using the indicators elaborated in table 15 for years 2006 and 2016 comparing the water security indicators between 2006 and 2016 and analyzing the variations of mean and marginal values one can figure out the major driver of change in the area is economic relative water stress index rwsi indicates the pressure on the water resources due to the ratio of water demand to the renewable water supply the corresponding values for that index in 2006 and 2016 in the study area were 1 54 and 1 37 respectively while it is advised to utilize the water resources in a way to keep the rwsi below 0 4 unsd 2012 the values of rwsi in the study area show that the local water resource is highly stressed looking at the water accounting tables one can see that the decrease in rwsi in 2016 was because of trans basin water import from zarrinehrud river as well as decreasing in water discharge into lake urmia not because of reduction in water consumption water use intensity index wuii indicates the local water resource sustainability in terms of the ratio of water use to the internal renewable water supply the value of wuii was higher in 2016 than that of in 2006 that means the local water resource is in a highly unsustainable condition contributing in 94 of the area water consumption agriculture is the most pressuring sector on the local water resource followed by services and industries respectively groundwater dependency index gwdi shows the share of local groundwater resource in supplying for the total water demands the gwdi in the study area is lower than its universal norm which is 50 unsd 2012 that is because of low water quality due to salt water intrusion from lake urmia being at the level of 1319 m the groundwater table in azarshahr plain used to be in equilibrium until 1994 95 since that year the groundwater table has been declining gradually it faced a drastic drawdown to the level of 1315 89 m in 2002 03 following a drought incident occurred in 1999 2000 because of groundwater table drawdown in the western part of the aquifer salt water intruded from lake urmia causing the salinity of the aquifer to increase despite groundwater table rise due to artificial recharge from gamabrchay river in the recent years the aquifer water quality has not improved to an acceptable level for agricultural use economic water productivity index ecwpi indicates the economic output in terms of monetary units due to water utilization the industrial sector with 1 43 and 1 shares of water utilization in 2006 and 2016 respectively has had the highest ecwpi standing the services with 3 97 and 5 shares of water utilization in 2006 and 2016 respectively in the next and the agriculture with 94 6 and 94 shares of water utilization in 2006 and 2016 respectively in the last places the value of per capita renewable water resources index pcrwi has increased from 366 m3 per capita in 2006 to 476 m3 per capita in 2016 the increase in the index is because of trans basin water import from zarrinehrud river as well as decreasing in water discharge into lake urmia nevertheless the index is much lower than the falkenmark index which is 1700 m3 yr per capita for water stress and 1000 m3 yr per capita for water scarcity falkenmark and widstrand 1992 while industries and services have the most contribution to the local employment respectively the employment water productivity index emwpi which means the number of employment per unit of water utilization associated to industries is higher than that of services table 16 compares the marginal variations of epi and ecwpi values in the study area versus the variations of averages for those indices from 2006 to 2016 according to table 16 it can be seen that while the changes in the average values of economic indices increased during the period of 10 years the changes in the marginal values were much higher that means the economic drivers were highly dominating the growth mechanism in the study area resulting in ignoring strategic water resources restrictions in favor of short term individual economic gains 6 discussion policy scenario simulation results several policies could have been devised to prevent the water security to worse off during the ten years period of study in this section we are going to examine the policy options that could affect the water security to analyze the consequences of different policy options on the system under study under different scenarios a system dynamics model was built according to the conceptual model depicted in fig 2 the model consists of social economic and environmental sub systems the social economic part includes population and the employment and revenues associated to services industries and agriculture the environmental sub system includes water resources quantity and quality fig 6 a and b 6 1 model verification for the purpose of model verification a number of tests have been proposed sterman 2000 in this paper structural assessment and dimensional consistency tests are checked in vensim more than ten extreme conditions tests have been carried out only four of which are presented in fig 7 finally behavior reproduction tests were checked for more than 10 variables fig 8 shows the behavior reproduction test for 4 variables 6 2 the model base line at the first step the model was run for the historic period with bau policy options the indicators of water security were calculated based on the outputs of bau run since there was no significant difference between the results of simulated data from those of observed table 17 the calculated indicators based on the simulated data will be referred to as the base line in this section at the next step different policy options are examined according to the overarching development programs associated to the study area table 18 the effectiveness of the suggested policy options on reducing the system vulnerability to water security are investigated by the model given that those options could have been devised in the area during the study period the results are depicted in fig 9 the elasticity of indicators are shown in table 19 a variable elasticity indicates the percentage of change in the variable according to one percent of change in each of the affecting policies for instance in policy option 1 corresponding to decrease in irrigated agricultural area the elasticity of economic water productivity index indicates the ratio of percentage change in ecwpi referenced to its initial value due to the percentage of decrease in the area of irrigated agriculture if the elasticity value is greater than one then the ecwpi is elastic i e one percent change in the crop area will affect the index more than one percent if the elasticity value is equal to one then the ecwpi has unit elasticity i e each one percent change in the crop area will result in one percent change in the index finally if the elasticity value is less than one then the ecwpi is inelastic i e each one percent change in the crop area will result in less than one percent change in the index the policy options are targeted to improve the water security indicators from 2006 to 2016 implementation of each policy option will correspond to costs that the local government should bear however those costs have not been directly taken into account when analysing the policies in this paper all the policy options except option4 are effective to reduce water salinity however option 1 seems to be more cost effective policy options 3 and 5 are more effective to improveemwpi ecwpi ecwpi a epi and pci due to noticeable reduction in water consumption nevertheless policy option 5 seems more costly than option 3 while the elasticity of policy option 5 is 10 corresponding to reducing the volume of saline water and it is more than 3 corresponding to the indicators of water consumption rwsi ariinwb ecwpi a ecwpi emwpi and emwpi a in terms of elasticity of indicators corresponding to volume of saline water water consumption rwsi ariinwb ecwpi a ecwpi emwpi and emwpi a policy option 3 is two times more efficient than the other policies table 19 overall the policy options 1 and 2 are the most prioritized respectively and the policy option 5 is the least prioritized policies regarding cost effectiveness 7 conclusions the local water resource in the azarshahr study area is highly stressed as it is illustrated by rwsi and pcrwi indicators in addition according to the value of wuii the area suffers severely from unsustainability and disequilibrium between water resource and consumption the local water security is highly vulnerable due to its 40 dependency on external water resources a huge amount of water is being consumed by agriculture the economic and employment productivities of which were 5 709 000 000 irr 150 000 and 158 persons per mcm in 2016 respectively those productivity indicators are too low probably because of water low prices in spite of its 15 share in the regional economic production the agricultural sector contributes in 24 of regional employment which is a sign of biased policies the annual improvement in the regional agricultural services and industrial economic water productivity rates during the study period have been 4 2 and 5 respectively which is still very low comparing with the international norms the policy option 1 stepwise reduction in the irrigated agricultural area from 2006 to 2010 and constant decline 2 from 2010 to 2016 is effective in controlling the water salinity since it is highly inelastic in terms of the regional economic revenue it could be a cost effective policy to prevent from salinization of more than 30 mcm of water with very low impacts on the regional revenue on the other hand the policy options 3 stepwise increase in both agricultural and horticultural irrigation efficiency from 2006 to 2016 and 5 combination of the all four policy options are elastic in terms of reducing water consumption and improvement in water productivity indicators however they seem more costly in practice according to the elasticity values less than one for all indicators in option 4 one can conclude that this option is totally inelastic overall the policy options 1 and 2 stepwise reduction in the irrigated horticultural area from 2006 to 2016 are the most prioritized respectively and the policy option 5 is the least prioritized policies regarding cost effectiveness appendix 1 description of water security indicators indicator description internal renewable water resources average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater

abstraction is recovered from groundwater in the area ratio of groundwater abstraction to total water abstraction in the study area if this indicator is greater than 0 5 it indicates a high dependency on the groundwater relative water stress index rwsi this indicator provides a measure of water demand pressures from the domestic industrial and agricultural sectors relative to the local and upstream water supplies and calculated as ratio of total water consumption twc to actual renewable water resources areas experiencing water stress and water scarcity can be identified by relative water demand ratios exceeding 0 2 and 0 4 respectively a threshold of 0 4 or 40 percent consumption relative to supply signifies severely water stressed conditions the combination of a water stress threshold and gridded population data enables identification of water stress hot spots areas where large number of people may be suffering from the effects of water stress and its consequent impacts water use
