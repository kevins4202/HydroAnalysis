20150,flood risk management has proven successful at reducing the threat of some flooding hazards preventing loss of life during flooding events and easing the economic burden to communities and regions following floods it is a useful approach for assessing risks and guiding decisions on implementing protection measures recently in addition to flood risk management flood resilience is discussed as a new approach in academic literature this contribution tries to unravel the relation between flood risk management and flood resilience therefore three aspects are discussed the definition of resilience its measurement methods and also its possible implementation and embedding in flood risk management keywords flood risk management flood resilience climate change adaptation 1 introduction resilience is a relatively new concept as applied to environmental hazard management 2 currently a risk based approach is dominating the way society deals with natural hazards such as floods whereas the risk based approach provides a rational way of balancing the costs of mitigation and adaptation measures 38 resilience embraces the uncertainties associated with natural hazards by focusing on the ability of affected systems to absorb shocks 33 the idea of resilience follows closely with a modern emphasis on integrated solutions to environmental issues which are becoming increasingly complex as they expand geographically economically socially and politically at the same time resilience is considered to be too abstract apolitical and ahistorical in social science 49 the traditional ways of applying measures which consider closed and simplified boundary conditions are no longer adequate in a modern world processes and people are highly dynamic and far reaching therefore our measures must reflect society by learning to become similarly flexible and inclusive it is no simple task however as the direction toward the implementation of resilience concepts is hazy at best 32 consider for example the difficulty of simultaneously implementing the concept s seemingly opposing properties of stability and adaptation in unison 32 54 resilience supports to some extent a bouncing back to a previous state of a system this promotes a notion of stability of the state of a system at the same time resilience also embraces adaption or bouncing forward this seeming contradiction of stability and adaptation is embedded in the term resilience and creates fuzziness in regard to the concept when difficult but important goals are born from unclear concepts terms which are paramount to understanding a new directional shift can become buzzwords lacking concrete meaning 39 41 resilience in its most general interpretation as applied to flood management seeks to reduce adverse impacts of extreme events which can otherwise prove devastating for communities and potentially produce disasters therefore it is important to improve the ambiguity associated with resilience develop techniques for quantifying its state and improve measures for its implementation the following work is broken into sections and subsections which allow for much larger topics to be organized and summarized in a clear and comprehensible way first a brief background and a review of the basic principles of flood risk management are provided along with a discussion on the relation to flood resilience next a review and discussion of current flood resilience literature is presented this work is centered around three main thematic areas conceptualizing resilience measuring resilience and implementing resilience by highlighting the current progress in regard to these themes we hope to unravel the relation between flood risk management and flood resilience 2 flood risk management flood risk management has become a dominant approach in much of the world for addressing the potential consequences due to flooding events it is in fact a vast improvement from traditional measures which had prevailed previously traditional methods can be characterized by structures built in an attempt to control rivers largely ignoring vulnerability 43 the european floods directive 2007 60 ec 22 institutionalized an ongoing shift from this traditional approach of flood protection to a risk based approach 30 within flood risk management a more differentiated protection is suggested it implies taking different risk levels into account and assessing and designing measures taking the potential damages into account not only according to a design level regardless of the vulnerabilities 26 48 flood risk management emerged in europe as a result of major flood events in the early 1990s at the rhine river it was institutionally embedded at the european level after major flooding events in 2002 at the elbe river and its tributaries it is still in a process of evolving out of the resistance culture from which it originated 46 this leads to some important issues in the face of change which are likely to be further exploited in the coming years a call to return to living with rivers in order to counteract the trend of resistance is gaining traction 58 but will require a long planning process to make this shift a reality 43 flood risk management has proven successful at reducing the threat of some flooding hazards preventing loss of life during flooding events and easing the economic burden to communities and regions following floods it is a useful tool for assessing risks and guiding decisions on how best to implement protection measures however in order to demonstrate the potential for strengthening the relation to flood resilience the following sections provide theoretical background of flood risk management present the ways in which resilience is only marginally applied in many flood risk management strategies and discuss the differences in focus between the two strategies 2 1 review of terms and concept the management of environmental risk centers around a singular principle as formulated by the risk equation fig 1 though the equation is seldom applied in its explicit form due to lack of data imprecise estimates of some inputs or complexity compared to other satisfactory methods 34 it is upon this basic idea which specific applications of risk estimation are derived in environmental risk management the probability of interest is often the likelihood of a hazard event being exceeded in a given period for example the probability that a flooding event which exceeds a specified stage occurs in the course of a year accurate estimation of the probability density function for flooding hazards is difficult but highly important ideally a sufficiently long record of historical stage measurements in a relatively unchanging catchment would result in low uncertainties associated with the probability density function however even in the ideal case the exceedance probability of extreme events is potentially impossible to estimate because of their long return periods 34 additionally climate change may also increase the uncertainties associated with hazard probabilities due to its effects on stationarity the principle of hazard stationarity allows for the critical assumption that environmental variables fluctuate within an unchanging envelope 44 as climate change warms the earth the resulting changes on environmental variables may render the assumption invalid though there is currently limited evidence of a change in global flood magnitudes and frequencies there is higher confidence that heavy rainfall events will increase in frequency for many regions in the coming decades 34 consequences in the context of flood risk management are the outcomes typically adverse should the flooding event of interest occur for example the cost of water damages to homes following an event as fig 1 shows this component can be considered as a combination of exposure and vulnerability according to the united nations office for disaster risk reduction 57 undrr exposure can be defined as the situation of people infrastructure housing production capacities and other tangible human assets located in hazard prone areas accurate determination of hazard prone areas depends to a large extent on the ability to estimate and extrapolate hydrological variables as flood model inputs the ability to derive the model inputs is consequently dependent on corresponding data availability additionally data regarding assets in flood prone areas is necessary though more easily estimated through remote sensing and governmental sources management strategies related to removing people and assets from flood plains including land use management through zoning laws for example help to reduce exposure likewise undrr 57 defines vulnerability as the conditions determined by physical social economic and environmental factors or processes which increase the susceptibility of an individual a community assets or systems to the impacts of hazards the actual estimation and application of vulnerability is quite difficult in flood risk management and contributes a lot of uncertainty aerts 1 explains that damage functions correlating flood depth with potential damages to assets or loss of life are used to estimate vulnerability because this vulnerability curve is difficult to estimate it is often empirically derived or based on expert opinions it is further argued by aerts 1 that this approach fails to adequately represent vulnerability because it is an oversimplified representation of human behavior requiring greater input from social sciences vulnerability can be reduced for example physically through management strategies including wet and dry proofing buildings or socially by improving education about flood safety vulnerability is often seen as the component of flood risk management most closely related with flood resilience however conceptual distinctions between the two terms are not universal one position is that vulnerability and resilience are opposite attributes of the same system for example twigg 55 describes vulnerability and resilience as two sides of the same coin while conceding that both terms are also relative this idea of opposite attributes though clear is overly simplistic therefore others argue that the two terms are related but remain distinct 18 twigger ross et al 56 states contrary to some conceptualizations where resilience and vulnerability are oppositional we propose that there is overlap within these concepts vulnerability and resilience so that they are not totally mutually exclusive nor totally mutually inclusive additionally it is argued that emphasizing resilience over vulnerability demonstrates what communities are able to do for themselves rather than focusing on aspects which are weak in regard to floods 41 55 2 2 current applications of flood resilience measures in flood risk management flood risk management and flood resilience have the potential to act as strong complements to one another however in reality resilience tends to be only marginally applied as a supplement to flood risk management this section provides some brief examples of the ways in which flood resilience measures are used in current flood risk management strategies in order to demonstrate the potential for greater emphasis and improvement ashley et al 4 and white et al 61 describe some such examples of flood resilience methods as they appear in flood risk management policy these strategies are often referred to by catchy acronyms and names and applied as an addition to flood risk management rather than taking an integral role in flood management policy the four a s approach attributed to the scottish government is one such example the strategy comprises awareness building knowledge among the community and committing flooding potential to memory avoidance removal of assets from flood prone areas alleviation flood minded design of buildings wet proofing and dry proofing and assistance insurance of assets or the infrastructure and plans associated with recovery and response efforts another example identified is the four capacities approach developed in the netherlands according to graaf giesen and ven 25 these four capacities include threshold capacity ability to resist floods coping capacity ability to reduce damage from flood exceeding damage threshold recovery capacity ability to restore losses after an event and adaptive capacity ability to apply a diversity of measures this review will demonstrate that flood resilience has more to offer and is more complex than what is condensed into these policies it is important that flood resilience takes a less marginal role in future flood management and is viewed with equal standing with flood risk management for addressing flooding hazards instead of a small addition to it 2 3 focusing on recovery versus damage flood risk management is primarily concerned with damage to assets this approach to flood management is rather appealing due to the relatively easily defined and clearly established components this is a method focused on the aspects of flood management which can be directly quantified monetary value of an asset such as a building or an automobile for example as opposed to the more qualitative aspects which can be difficult to quantify sense of community feeling of safety or diversity of included voices whereas flood risk management operates best when presented with quantitative aspects of flood management flood resilience thrives in the more qualitative aspects 16 35 which are also important to consider 59 flood risk management is also not especially suited for managing the way in which an affected area recovers from an event consider that two events which have the same expected value of damage may not follow the same timeline for recovery of that damage consider further that a wealthy urban center may have a higher flood risk than a poorer urban center due to the value of assets involved though the poorer urban center may have a longer and more difficult recovery process than the wealthier urban center when presented with the same magnitude flooding event this demonstrates another distinction of flood resilience from flood risk management one of the primary objectives of resilience in almost every definition of the term is to improve the recovery following an event so flood risk management may provide an excellent tool for accountability and reduction of damages but flood resilience can aid in the reduction of losses quantitative and qualitative in the aftermath of an event the remainder of this work is dedicated to presenting the current state of the literature regarding flood resilience 3 flood resilience in order to organize current flood resilience literature the following has been grouped around three thematic areas conceptualizing resilience measuring resilience and implementing resilience the section on conceptualizing resilience primarily focuses on defining the term as this is highly important for guiding the other aspects of application the section focused on measuring resilience reviews methods of assessing current system resilience and the areas in which resilience can be improved finally the section on implementing resilience discusses current strategies for bringing resilience theory into practice these three areas are key to understanding what resilience means and how it can be applied to flood management 3 1 conceptualizing resilience throughout the literature much work is dedicated to defining resilience as a concept for use in flood management 2 40 49 51 one could argue that the amount of emphasis placed on the nuances of developing a comprehensive definition pales in comparison to the vast need for research into other potentially more applicable aspects of resilience it would also seem that after years of integrating the topic into environmental hazard management that a single unifying definition would be adopted by the field at this point however this is not yet the case perhaps due to the generally fragmented nature of water management 49 the debate about what it means to be resilient in regard to floods continues 12 as a solid definition of the term is in fact the cornerstone of the theory defining it merits review of the potential definitions in order to establish a consensus which further work can build upon accomplishing this feat will allow future research to devote less time and resource to the most basic aspects of flood resilience in order to delve deeper into the applications of the concept because much has already been conducted in way of developing a definition this work will not seek to create a formalization of its own for conceptualizing resilience rather some of the most relevant points will be explained in brief their criticisms summarized and their merits highlighted few literature reviews on the topic of resilience begin without mentioning the term s origin with holling 33 a point which is disputed 2 though the root of the term holds importance it is the focus of this work to define resilience in its current application in order to progress the subject forward four main types of definitions are considered here engineering resilience ecological resilience social ecological resilience and definitions from field applications often including terms related to both of the former concepts but not explicitly associated to either the scope is narrowed in this way because the literature has tended to consider these conceptualizations most relevant for example rodina 49 identified that of 149 articles focused on resilience in water management between 1982 and 2017 45 6 utilized an engineering resilience definition 18 8 used a social ecological resilience definition 11 4 used an ecological resilience definition and 12 1 used an unspecified resilience definition the highest ranking categories in this work inductive resilience definitions are considered in lieu of unspecified resilience definitions because of the large number and potential issues with categorization fischer 23 suggests that there may be more than seventy such resilience definitions in recent literature centering the focus to the most applicable definitions will help to move the debate forward by excluding more peripheral definitions of the term 3 1 1 resilience in practice inductive definitions many conceptualizations of resilience have been constructed as working definitions for practical applications this type of definition often contains more expanded ideas and utilizes more concrete terms than the more abstract concepts contained in engineering or social ecological resilience because working definitions are created specific to their application they are numerous and vary widely however many utilize similar terminology bahadur and pichon 5 identify some of the key components common to popular working definitions along with the frequency in which they appear among the definitions surveyed table 1 among the definitions assessed were those used by action research for community action in bangladesh arcab mercy corps international federation of the red cross and red crescent societies ifrc the u s agency for international development usaid the un development program undp community based resilience analysis cobra and the fao s resilience index measurement and analysis rima though subtleties exist between the specific terms used five general components were most common system disturbance pre event action damage limitation and managing change the existence of common components demonstrates an opportunity for developing consensus on a resilience definition another working definition not considered in the previous list is that presented by the intergovernmental panel on climate change which defines resilience as the ability of a system and its component parts to anticipate absorb accommodate or recover from the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner including through ensuring the preservation restoration or improvement of its essential basic structures and functions 34 this definition incorporates all of the five common components identified by bahadur and pichon 5 most importantly though this definition was formed from an international collaboration by a prominent organization this point may significantly aid in forming needed consensus 3 1 2 engineering resilience for complicated systems resilience as utilized in engineering systems can be defined as resisting change from an original state while a stress is applied and returning back to that original state after the stress subsides regaining previous functionality and equilibrium 19 40 49 this is often referred to as bouncing back 19 fig 2 demonstrates the concept in the engineering resilience concept the target goal for the system is to remain at the idealized state when a disturbance occurs it is expected that recovery work is oriented at returning the system back to its previous state it is argued that this approach is one which only maintains the status quo and lacks the critical component of adaptation without adaptation the city will not learn to better manage such shocks and remains potentially vulnerable to disaster should another disturbance occur 34 36 40 45 liao 40 points out that as engineered systems often possess an idealized state in which they are designed to function this definition has many suitable applications in closed boundary problems however the concept fails to adequately describe those systems which are complex or open the reason is that the disturbance will have changed the system so that the status it falls back to is either no longer possible or has other implications it is worth noting complex refers to a system in which a change of one component can have unforeseen consequences for the whole system contrary to complicated systems where an intervention can be reversed or restored complicated systems are foremost focused on elements themselves complex systems consist of situational and changing relations between the elements of the system 10 engineering resilience is thus suitable for individual measures of flood protection a dike a dam a mobile barrier but also the ability of constructions such as bridges or waterways in rivers to withstand the impact of floods however flood risk management can better be conceived as a complex system not only because of the larger spatial scope i e a catchment but also because of the socio economic dynamics related to a risk approach the levee effect for example illustrates that improving flood protection can lead to unintended incentives to accumulate assets behind dikes 6 7 29 similarly flood insurances can set false incentives that change the conditions of a system 11 in other words whereas engineering resilience is suitable for flood protection it falls short on flood risk management 3 1 3 ecological and social ecological resilience for complex systems ecological resilience describes how complex systems continue functioning after experiencing a disturbance namely by the ability to change the state of the equilibrium 8 19 40 49 62 like in engineering resilience ecological resilience describes how systems absorb shocks 19 33 fig 3 illustrates the functioning of ecological resilience as the system experiences a stress it initially functions much like the engineering model of resilience in that it resists a state change if the applied stress or shock is small the system is likely to return to its initial functional state after a period of time like in engineering resilience however in complex systems the shock i e a flooding event changes the system in itself it may disturb land markets or change people s perception on risk respectively the system reacts in unforeseen ways such as policy interventions subsidies etc for example the flood event in 1993 and 1995 at the river rhine triggered a change in paradigms by initiating a debate on space for the rivers 28 ultimately this changed the whole system of flood protection to flood risk management with huge spatial implications polders have been built restrictions for building in floodplains have been increased etc similarly social ecological resilience also known as evolutionary resilience 20 can be defined as the ability of a system to adjust accordingly in order to maintain functionality when it experiences a disturbance 8 49 this definition is characterized by the ideas of coping transformation 49 and bouncing forward 19 and does not involve equilibrium states but rather constant change 20 when a community experiences an extreme flooding event it is unlikely to seek to return to the exact state of conditions which existed prior to the event instead communities often seek to make adaptations which improve conditions and help to prevent the extenuating circumstances which were caused by the flood from happening again this conceptualization incorporates the idea that communities are in a constant state of change even without disturbances these definitions with their basis in natural systems better describe the nature of human societies than their engineering counterpart due the incorporation of adaptation adaptation is important for making adjustments after flooding events to better prepare for future floods as pointed out when discussing the engineering resilience definition academic literature supports the ecologically based interpretations as being the most appropriate for use in flood risk management because of the complexities associated with human systems 13 52 54 58 liao 40 advocates very strongly for the adoption of ecological resilience as the basis for a flood resilience application primarily due to its higher applicability for a dynamic world in assessing literature trends rodina 49 identified that definitions of resilience in the water management field are beginning to converge around the ecological and social ecological interpretations possibly due to an expanded understanding of complexity in the sector which is outgrowing the simplified engineering definition 3 1 4 conceptual model though not an explicit definition a conceptual model originally developed by community and regional resilience institute 17 and further adapted by white et al 60 and dabson 19 representing resilience is shown in fig 4 this model possesses many attributes which are overlooked in other similar models while combining attributes of engineering and social ecological resilience for instance functional capacity vertical axis is not bound by a maximum this is characteristic of societies because they are continuously developing and do not therefore possess an idealized maximum capacity state the model incorporates the immediate added benefit of incorporating resilience measures for societal and economic gains additionally this model provides for multiple outcomes lines a b c and d each of which represent new post shock equilibrium states 3 2 measuring resilience measurement of resilience is among the most applicable and important aspects of resilience without sound resilience measurement practices it is difficult or impossible to adequately determine how prepared a community is to face a flooding event it is similarly difficult to determine which interventions should be made and to what extent those interventions will improve resilience this directly hinders the ability of managers to make informed decisions and to produce an accountability of investments in resilience measures consensus on the topic of resilience measurement is relatively weak this is likely due to the difficulty of standardizing approaches to resilience which are often highly localized and strongly varying dabson 19 summarizes the current situation the challenge is to develop a measurement system that is comprehensive across physical economic and social dimensions incorporates rigorous procedures for data collection analysis weighting and combination and is open and transparent it is clear that a unified approach to applying resilience in flood management is challenging though not impossible if research efforts focus their attention on clarifying the issues of scale and process 3 2 1 resilience indicators because resilience measurement must incorporate so many vastly different dimensions the first question becomes which aspects of resilience can be measured there is debate among some in the field about whether vulnerability or resilience can be directly measured at all 41 63 therefore as a potential solution to this dilemma indicators have emerged as the most promising method for assessment but there are many challenges to consider for indicator development and use oecd 47 categorizes indicators into five groups according to the aspects of resilience which each attempts to measure these include system resilience indicators negative resilience indicators process indicators output indicators and proxy impact indicators table 2 describes each of these in detail likely the most well known indicators in use today are those developed by arup and the rockefeller foundation through their work titled city resilience index 3 there are 52 indicators used in the metric the indicators are divided into four dimensions which are subsequently subdivided into three goals per dimension twelve goals total the four dimensions used in the index cover aspects of community like health and well being economy and society infrastructures and ecosystems and leadership and strategy fig 5 displays the infrastructures and ecosystems dimension as an example of the city resilience index structure 3 2 2 resilience indices indices are metrics used to visually convey the status of resilience in a system at the time of measurement indicators are used to quantify various aspects which directly or indirectly relate to the system s resilience within a particular theme these metrics are often presented in graphical form so to be easily communicated to stakeholders like the public and to policy makers the fully developed version of arup s city resilience index 3 discussed in the previous subsection is an typical example of what is commonly used consider the seven inner rings in fig 6 they correspond to the qualitative attributes flexible redundant robust resourceful reflective inclusive and integrated scores are generated as the indicators are measured via qualitative and quantitative assessment the places on the inner rings then get a color code corresponding to the outcome darkest color represents very poor and lightest represents excellent the resulting product is often primarily visual messages are conveyed in a way that are easily understood by most regardless of background or education for cross sector collaboration and education of the public this is quite important the drawback of such comprehensive methods is that data is often not equally available across different areas 53 the resulting indices of computed resilience are therefore not directly comparable across different studies the helpfulness of this method of communicating resilience for flood management is to be determined 3 3 implementing resilience the definition that resilience describes the ability of a system to absorb shocks becomes imprecise when applied to specific situations the questions that arise are i what are the system boundaries ii what exactly does absorb mean and iii what is a shock event meerow newell and stults 42 add to the definition that this ability relates to the socio economic and socio technical networks across temporal and spatial scales this indicates that not only the disciplinary perspective but also time and spatial scale matter the following sections discuss each of these points 3 3 1 time matters on a theoretical notion resilience describes the ability of a system to absorb shocks especially quantitative scientists and engineers often prefer more narrowed down resilience concepts for instance in water resource management focusing on time elapsed 21 31 this shows that the definition and the boundaries of the system are crucial to understand what resilience means so the question of the time frame applied to resilience is important to decide whether a system is resilient or not forrest et al 24 defines resilience through the actions taken during three phases of the flood management timeline the first is the pre flood phase which includes the actions taken to mitigate and prepare for floods the second phase is the during flood phase comprising resistance of and response to the flood at the time it is occurring the last phase is the post flood phase and includes recovery and adaptation after a flood similarly davoudi et al 20 mentions the importance of considering the panarchy model of adaptive cycle this cycle describes the pattern by which resilience evolves over time the four phases of the cycle represent the stages in which communities find themselves as they deal with increasing and decreasing resilience following flooding events the phases include conservation phase stable and inflexible period of slower growth and low resilience creative destruction phase period of uncertainty at the time of a flooding event reorganization phase highly dynamic and highly resilient period of innovation and growth phase period of rapid growth and decreasing resilience according to this model it is the flooding event which produces resilience in a community by forcing change 3 3 2 scale matters among the most important attributes for defining systems is to establish the spatial extent of that system spatial scale in human systems can however be difficult to define perhaps this is why there exists such little uniformity among the vocabulary used to describe spatial scale in flood resilience table 3 lists some of the various terms used to express the spatial scale in recent flood resilience literature if it is explicitly stated at all as identified by cai et al 14 nonetheless it is important for those applying or measuring resilience to clearly define the spatial scale considered as the idea of what makes a system resilient can vary greatly across scale for example an individual construction can be resilient if it is able to withstand and absorb a shock event but also a society as a whole can be resilient if it is able to financially recover from a shock event 3 3 3 disciplines matter it is stressed in literature that resilience also has a non structural dimension in policy and practice 50 we can distinguish resilience in terms of civil engineering financial resilience economic resilience etc for that matter a good example is that an insurance coverage of a system can contribute to resilience of the whole system from an engineering perspective constructions and buildings have been destroyed and could not be considered resilient an example is the destruction of a railway track during a flood event in eastern germany in this case the track was destroyed and the rover company reconstructed their track at the same place in the same way asked about resilience the company said that it would be cheaper to reconstruct the rail track after every flood event than the effort to try to relocate the track to an alternative route because that would raise issues like property rights and planning issues this is an example of a financial resilience that contradicts a resilience from a civil engineering point of perspective this means that measuring resilience also implies making some thoughts about the disciplinary perspectives through which resilience is viewed so finally resilience depends on the spatial and temporal scale and also the disciplinary perspective which perspective is most appropriate for a certain system or a certain situation depends on a careful balancing of all involved stakeholders that means that resilience is highly locational and context specific in other words resilience is a political concept 4 conclusions flood risk and flood resilience both have much to offer in the management of floods each presents its own benefits and challenges resilience for example offers a more integrated approach to the problem of managing floods by measuring and strengthening the less tangible aspects of community this however comes at the expense of sometimes complicated metrics plagued by individualized approaches and a general lack of comparability across regions flood risk management on the other hand provides a clear metric with common units which can be readily compared and used to derive accountable interventions flood risk management s central focus on the immediate impacts of floods and its inability to adequately consider recovery are among the approach s shortcomings therefore it is not an abandonment of risk management practices and full adoption of resilience strategies which will produce cities ready for future flooding hazards nor is a continuation of risk based management alone adequate to handle future needs rather it is a complementary posture in which the strengths of each strategy inform the practice of the other by combining flood resilience and flood risk measures can be effective against a broader range of hazards than when considering either method alone this approach helps to address some of the uncertainties involved with flood risk management not by reducing them but by adding much needed flexibility to a field oriented toward optimization considering social and economic pathways as presented the current strategies attempting to bridge risk and resilience are lacking they are often little more than a peripheral application of flood resilience while focusing primarily on flood risk management this falls well short of reaching the potential benefits of a truly combined approach the pace of bringing this complementary structure into practice will need to match the urgency associated with climate change adaptation however it is unlikely that the currently fragmented development of flood resilience metrics and strategies will create a unified implementation in that required time frame a path forward will be more likely found when more research is dedicated to studying applications and less upon deriving new resilience frameworks instead of development of new metrics for each new community or region studied there is a need for research on applications of existing metrics to multiple study areas in order to discern which aspects are most promising modification of metrics for individual studies will remain inevitable due to the nature of the subject however the temptation to add new metrics to the literature does little to build the much needed consensus around resilience theory there is much work still remaining to be done for the future of resilience upon reviewing the literature it became obvious that there currently exists little research making systematic comparisons of resilience frameworks and indicators this is likely due to the difficultly of such an undertaking as both vary widely in approach and scope it may also be due to the fact that most of the work in regard to development of resilience frameworks and indicators is currently being conducted primarily by individual policy research institutes governmental bodies and non governmental organizations it appears that each group tends to frame their approach on the specific characteristics of the regions which each supports and develops its frameworks in a similarly context specific manner a categorical review of resilience frameworks and indicators which forms groups according to type and area focus assesses the thematic areas of interest and which evaluates implementation case studies of each would be a highly useful resource though similar small scale studies have been conducted a more in depth survey would help to better understand the current state of resilience work and help to forge a more unified path forward appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article

floods whereas the risk based approach provides a rational way of balancing the costs of mitigation and adaptation measures 38 resilience embraces the uncertainties associated with natural hazards by

to flood resilience next a review and discussion of current flood resilience literature is presented this work is centered around three main thematic areas conceptualizing resilience measuring resilience and implementing resilience by highlighting the current progress in regard to these themes we hope to unravel the relation between flood risk management and flood resilience 2 flood risk management flood risk management has become a dominant approach in much of the world for addressing the potential consequences due to flooding events it is in fact a vast improvement from traditional measures which had prevailed previously traditional methods can be characterized by structures built in an attempt to control rivers largely ignoring vulnerability 43 the european floods directive 2007 60 ec 22 institutionalized an ongoing shift from this traditional approach of flood protection to a risk based approach 30 within flood risk management a more differentiated protection is suggested it implies taking different risk levels into account and assessing and designing measures taking the potential damages into account not only according to a design level regardless of the vulnerabilities 26 48 flood risk management emerged in europe as a result of major flood events in the early 1990s at the rhine river it was institutionally embedded at the european level after major flooding events in 2002 at the elbe river and its tributaries it is still in a process of evolving out of the resistance culture from which it originated 46 this leads to some important issues in the face of change which are likely to be further exploited in the coming years a call to return to living with rivers in order to counteract the trend of resistance is gaining traction 58 but will require a long planning process to make this shift a reality 43 flood risk management has proven successful at reducing the threat of some flooding hazards preventing loss of life during flooding events and easing the economic burden to communities and regions following floods it is a useful tool for assessing risks and guiding decisions on how best to implement protection measures however in order to demonstrate the potential for strengthening the relation to flood resilience the following sections provide theoretical background of flood risk management present the ways in which resilience is only marginally applied in many flood risk management strategies and discuss the differences in focus between the two strategies 2 1 review of terms and concept the management of environmental risk centers around a singular principle as formulated by the risk equation fig 1 though the equation is seldom applied in its explicit form due to lack of data imprecise estimates of some inputs or complexity compared to other satisfactory methods 34 it is upon this basic idea which specific applications of risk estimation are derived in environmental risk management the probability of interest is often the likelihood of a hazard event being exceeded in a given period for example the probability that a flooding event which exceeds a specified stage occurs in the course of a year accurate estimation of the probability density function for flooding hazards is difficult but highly important ideally a sufficiently long record of historical stage measurements in a relatively unchanging catchment would result in low uncertainties associated with the probability density function however even in the ideal case the exceedance probability of extreme events is potentially impossible to estimate because of their long return periods 34 additionally climate change may also increase the uncertainties associated with hazard probabilities due to its effects on stationarity the principle of hazard stationarity allows for the critical assumption that environmental variables fluctuate within an unchanging envelope 44 as climate change warms the earth the resulting changes on environmental variables may render the assumption invalid though there is currently limited evidence of a change in global flood magnitudes and frequencies there is higher confidence that heavy rainfall events will increase in frequency for many regions in the coming decades 34 consequences in the context of flood risk management are the outcomes typically adverse should the flooding event of interest occur for example the cost of water damages to homes following an event as fig 1 shows this component can be considered as a combination of exposure and vulnerability according to the united nations office for disaster risk reduction 57 undrr exposure can be defined as the situation of people infrastructure housing production capacities and other tangible human assets located in hazard prone areas accurate determination of hazard prone areas depends to a large extent on the ability to estimate and extrapolate hydrological variables as flood model inputs the ability to derive the model inputs is consequently dependent on corresponding data availability additionally data regarding assets in flood prone areas is necessary though more easily estimated through remote sensing and governmental sources management strategies related to removing people and assets from flood plains including land use management through zoning laws for example help to reduce exposure likewise undrr 57 defines vulnerability as the conditions determined by physical social economic and environmental factors or processes which increase the susceptibility of an individual a community assets or systems to the impacts of hazards the actual estimation and application of vulnerability is quite difficult in flood risk management and contributes a lot of uncertainty aerts 1 explains that damage functions correlating flood depth with potential damages to assets or loss of life are used to estimate vulnerability because this vulnerability curve is difficult to estimate it is often empirically derived or based on expert opinions it is further argued by aerts 1 that this approach fails to adequately represent vulnerability because it is an oversimplified representation of human behavior requiring greater input from social sciences vulnerability can be reduced for example physically through management strategies including wet and dry proofing buildings or socially by improving education about flood safety vulnerability is often seen as the component of flood risk management most closely related with flood resilience however conceptual distinctions between the two terms are not universal one position is that vulnerability and resilience are opposite attributes of the same system for example twigg 55 describes vulnerability and resilience as two sides of the same coin while conceding that both terms are also relative this idea of opposite attributes though clear is overly simplistic therefore others argue that the two terms are related but remain distinct 18 twigger ross et al 56 states contrary to some conceptualizations where resilience and vulnerability are oppositional we propose that there is overlap within these concepts vulnerability and resilience so that they are not totally mutually exclusive nor totally mutually inclusive additionally it is argued that emphasizing resilience over vulnerability demonstrates what communities are able to do for themselves rather than focusing on aspects which are weak in regard to floods 41 55 2 2 current applications of flood resilience measures in flood risk management flood risk management and flood resilience have the potential to act as strong complements to one another however in reality resilience tends to be only marginally applied as a supplement to flood risk management this section provides some brief examples of the ways in which flood resilience measures are used in current flood risk management strategies in order to demonstrate the potential for greater emphasis and improvement ashley et al 4 and white et al 61 describe some such examples of flood resilience methods as they appear in flood risk management policy these strategies are often referred to by catchy acronyms and names and applied as an addition to flood risk management rather than taking an integral role in flood management policy the four a s approach attributed to the scottish government is one such example the strategy comprises awareness building knowledge among the community and committing flooding potential to memory avoidance removal of assets from flood prone areas alleviation flood minded design of buildings wet proofing and dry proofing and assistance insurance of assets or the infrastructure and plans associated with recovery and response efforts another example identified is the four capacities approach developed in the netherlands according to graaf giesen and ven 25 these four capacities include threshold capacity ability to resist floods coping capacity ability to reduce damage from flood exceeding damage threshold recovery capacity ability to restore losses after an event and adaptive capacity ability to apply a diversity of measures this review will demonstrate that flood resilience has more to offer and is more complex than what is condensed into these policies it is important that flood resilience takes a less marginal role in future flood management and is viewed with equal standing with flood risk management for addressing flooding hazards instead of a small addition to it 2 3 focusing on recovery versus damage flood risk management is primarily concerned with damage to assets this approach to flood management is rather appealing due to the relatively easily defined and clearly established components this is a method focused on the aspects of flood management which can be directly quantified monetary value of an asset such as a building or an automobile for example as opposed to the more qualitative aspects which can be difficult to quantify sense of community feeling of safety or diversity of included voices whereas flood risk management operates best when presented with quantitative aspects of flood management flood resilience thrives in the more qualitative aspects 16 35 which are also important to consider 59 flood risk management is also not especially suited for managing the way in which an affected area recovers from an event consider that two events which have the same expected value of damage may not follow the same timeline for recovery of that damage consider further that a wealthy urban center may have a higher flood risk than a poorer urban center due to the value of assets involved though the poorer urban center may have a longer and more difficult recovery process than the wealthier urban center when presented with the same magnitude flooding event this demonstrates another distinction of flood resilience from flood risk management one of the primary objectives of resilience in almost every definition of the term is to improve the recovery following an event so flood risk management may provide an excellent tool for accountability and reduction of damages but flood resilience can aid in the reduction of losses quantitative and qualitative in the aftermath of an event the remainder of this work is dedicated to presenting the current state of the literature regarding flood resilience 3 flood resilience in order to organize current flood resilience literature the following has been grouped around three thematic areas conceptualizing resilience measuring resilience and implementing resilience the section on conceptualizing resilience primarily focuses on defining the term as this is highly important for guiding the other aspects of application the section focused on measuring resilience reviews methods of assessing current system resilience and the areas in which resilience can be improved finally the section on implementing resilience discusses current strategies for bringing resilience theory into practice these three areas are key to understanding what resilience means and how it can be applied to flood management 3 1 conceptualizing resilience throughout the literature much work is dedicated to defining resilience as a concept for use in flood management 2 40 49 51 one could argue that the amount of emphasis placed on the nuances of developing a comprehensive definition pales in comparison to the vast need for research into other potentially more applicable aspects of resilience it would also seem that after years of integrating the topic into environmental hazard management that a single unifying definition would be adopted by the field at this point however this is not yet the case perhaps due to the generally fragmented nature of water management 49 the debate about what it means to be resilient in regard to floods continues 12 as a solid definition of the term is in fact the cornerstone of the theory defining it merits review of the potential definitions in order to establish a consensus which further work can build upon accomplishing this feat will allow future research to devote less time and resource to the most basic aspects of flood resilience in order to delve deeper into the applications of the concept because much has already been conducted in way of developing a definition this work will not seek to create a formalization of its own for conceptualizing resilience rather some of the most relevant points will be explained in brief their criticisms summarized and their merits highlighted few literature reviews on the topic of resilience begin without mentioning the term s origin with holling 33 a point which is disputed 2 though the root of the term holds importance it is the focus of this work to define resilience in its current application in order to progress the subject forward four main types of definitions are considered here engineering resilience ecological resilience social ecological resilience and definitions from field applications often including terms related to both of the former concepts but not explicitly associated to either the scope is narrowed in this way because the literature has tended to consider these conceptualizations most relevant for example rodina 49 identified that of 149 articles focused on resilience in water management between 1982 and 2017 45 6 utilized an engineering resilience definition 18 8 used a social ecological resilience definition 11 4 used an ecological resilience definition and 12 1 used an unspecified resilience definition the highest ranking categories in this work inductive resilience definitions are considered in lieu of unspecified resilience definitions because of the large number and potential issues with categorization fischer 23 suggests that there may be more than seventy such resilience definitions in recent literature centering the focus to the most applicable definitions will help to move the debate forward by excluding more peripheral definitions of the term 3 1 1 resilience in practice inductive definitions many conceptualizations of resilience have been constructed as working definitions for practical applications this type of definition often contains more expanded ideas and utilizes more concrete terms than the more abstract concepts contained in engineering or social ecological resilience because working definitions are created specific to their application they are numerous and vary widely however many utilize similar terminology bahadur and pichon 5 identify some of the key components common to popular working definitions along with the frequency in which they appear among the definitions surveyed table 1 among the definitions assessed were those used by action research for community action in bangladesh arcab mercy corps international federation of the red cross and red crescent societies ifrc the u s agency for international development usaid the un development program undp community based resilience analysis cobra and the fao s resilience index measurement and analysis rima though subtleties exist between the specific terms used five general components were most common system disturbance pre event action damage limitation and managing change the existence of common components demonstrates an opportunity for developing consensus on a resilience definition another working definition not considered in the previous list is that presented by the intergovernmental panel on climate change which defines resilience as the ability of a system and its component parts to anticipate absorb accommodate or recover from the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner including through ensuring the preservation restoration or improvement of its essential basic structures and functions 34 this definition incorporates all of the five common components identified by bahadur and pichon 5 most importantly though this definition was formed from an international collaboration by a prominent organization this point may significantly aid in forming needed consensus 3 1 2 engineering resilience for complicated systems resilience as utilized in engineering systems can be defined as resisting change from an original state while a stress is applied and returning back to that original state after the stress subsides regaining previous functionality and equilibrium 19 40 49 this is often referred to as bouncing back 19 fig 2 demonstrates the concept in the engineering resilience concept the target goal for the system is to remain at the idealized state when a disturbance occurs it is expected that recovery work is oriented at returning the system back to its previous state it is argued that this approach is one which only maintains the status quo and lacks the critical component of adaptation without adaptation the city will not learn to better manage such shocks and remains potentially vulnerable to disaster should another disturbance occur 34 36 40 45 liao 40 points out that as engineered systems often possess an idealized state in which they are designed to function this definition has many suitable applications in closed boundary problems however the concept fails to adequately describe those systems which are complex or open the reason is that the disturbance will have changed the system so that the status it falls back to is either no longer possible or has other implications it is worth noting complex refers to a system in which a change of one component can have unforeseen consequences for the whole system contrary to complicated systems where an intervention can be reversed or restored complicated systems are foremost focused on elements themselves complex systems consist of situational and changing relations between the elements of the system 10 engineering resilience is thus suitable for individual measures of flood protection a dike a dam a mobile barrier but also the ability of constructions such as bridges or waterways in rivers to withstand the impact of floods however flood risk management can better be conceived as a complex system not only because of the larger spatial scope i e a catchment but also because of the socio economic dynamics related to a risk approach the levee effect for example illustrates that improving flood protection can lead to unintended incentives to accumulate assets behind dikes 6 7 29 similarly flood insurances can set false incentives that change the conditions of a system 11 in other words whereas engineering resilience is suitable for flood protection it falls short on flood risk management 3 1 3 ecological and social ecological resilience for complex systems ecological resilience describes how complex systems continue functioning after experiencing a disturbance namely by the ability to change the state of the equilibrium 8 19 40 49 62 like in engineering resilience ecological resilience describes how systems absorb shocks 19 33 fig 3 illustrates the functioning of ecological resilience as the system experiences a stress it initially functions much like the engineering model of resilience in that it resists a state change if the applied stress or shock is small the system is likely to return to its initial functional state after a period of time like in engineering resilience however in complex systems the shock i e a flooding event changes the system in itself it may disturb land markets or change people s perception on risk respectively the system reacts in unforeseen ways such as policy interventions subsidies etc for example the flood event in 1993 and 1995 at the river rhine triggered a change in paradigms by initiating a debate on space for the rivers 28 ultimately this changed the whole system of flood protection to flood risk management with huge spatial implications polders have been built restrictions for building in floodplains have been increased etc similarly social ecological resilience also known as evolutionary resilience 20 can be defined as the ability of a system to adjust accordingly in order to maintain functionality when it experiences a disturbance 8 49 this definition is characterized by the ideas of coping transformation 49 and bouncing forward 19 and does not involve equilibrium states but rather constant change 20 when a community experiences an extreme flooding event it is unlikely to seek to return to the exact state of conditions which existed prior to the event instead communities often seek to make adaptations which improve conditions and help to prevent the extenuating circumstances which were caused by the flood from happening again this conceptualization incorporates the idea that communities are in a constant state of change even without disturbances these definitions with their basis in natural systems better describe the nature of human societies than their engineering counterpart due the incorporation of adaptation adaptation is important for making adjustments after flooding events to better prepare for future floods as pointed out when discussing the engineering resilience definition academic literature supports the ecologically based interpretations as being the most appropriate for use in flood risk management because of the complexities associated with human systems 13 52 54 58 liao 40 advocates very strongly for the adoption of ecological resilience as the basis for a flood resilience application primarily due to its higher applicability for a dynamic world in assessing literature trends rodina 49 identified that definitions of resilience in the water management field are beginning to converge around the ecological and social ecological interpretations possibly due to an expanded understanding of complexity in the sector which is outgrowing the simplified engineering definition 3 1 4 conceptual model though not an explicit definition a conceptual model originally developed by community and regional resilience institute 17 and further adapted by white et al 60 and dabson 19 representing resilience is shown in fig 4 this model possesses many attributes which are overlooked in other similar models while combining attributes of engineering and social ecological resilience for instance functional capacity vertical axis is not bound by a maximum this is characteristic of societies because they are continuously developing and do not therefore possess an idealized maximum capacity state the model incorporates the immediate added benefit of incorporating resilience measures for societal and economic gains additionally this model provides for multiple outcomes lines a b c and d each of which represent new post shock equilibrium states 3 2 measuring resilience measurement of resilience is among the most applicable and important aspects of resilience without sound resilience measurement practices it is difficult or impossible to adequately determine how prepared a community is to face a flooding event it is similarly difficult to determine which interventions should be made and to what extent those interventions will improve resilience this directly hinders the ability of managers to make informed decisions and to produce an accountability of investments in resilience measures consensus on the topic of resilience measurement is relatively weak this is likely due to the difficulty of standardizing approaches to resilience which are often highly localized and strongly varying dabson 19 summarizes the current situation the challenge is to develop a measurement system that is comprehensive across physical economic and social dimensions incorporates rigorous procedures for data collection analysis weighting and combination and is open and transparent it is clear that a unified approach to applying resilience in flood management is challenging though not impossible if research efforts focus their attention on clarifying the issues of scale and process 3 2 1 resilience indicators because resilience measurement must incorporate so many vastly different dimensions the first question becomes which aspects of resilience can be measured there is debate among some in the field about whether vulnerability or resilience can be directly measured at all 41 63 therefore as a potential solution to this dilemma indicators have emerged as the most promising method for assessment but there are many challenges to consider for indicator development and use oecd 47 categorizes indicators into five groups according to the aspects of resilience which each attempts to measure these include system resilience indicators negative resilience indicators process indicators output indicators and proxy impact indicators table 2 describes each of these in detail likely the most well known indicators in use today are those developed by arup and the rockefeller foundation through their work titled city resilience index 3 there are 52 indicators used in the metric the indicators are divided into four dimensions which are subsequently subdivided into three goals per dimension twelve goals total the four dimensions used in the index cover aspects of community like health and well being economy and society infrastructures and ecosystems and leadership and strategy fig 5 displays the infrastructures and ecosystems dimension as an example of the city resilience index structure 3 2 2 resilience indices indices are metrics used to visually convey the status of resilience in a system at the time of measurement indicators are used to quantify various aspects which directly or indirectly relate to the system s resilience within a particular theme these metrics are often presented in graphical form so to be easily communicated to stakeholders like the public and to policy makers the fully developed version of arup s city resilience index 3 discussed in the previous subsection is an typical example of what is commonly used consider the seven inner rings in fig 6 they correspond to the qualitative attributes flexible redundant robust resourceful reflective inclusive and integrated scores are generated as the indicators are measured via qualitative and quantitative assessment the places on the inner rings then get a color code corresponding to the outcome darkest color represents very poor and lightest represents excellent the resulting product is often primarily visual messages are conveyed in a way that are easily understood by most regardless of background or education for cross sector collaboration and education of the public this is quite important the drawback of such comprehensive methods is that data is often not equally available across different areas 53 the resulting indices of computed resilience are therefore not directly comparable across different studies the helpfulness of this method of communicating resilience for flood management is to be determined 3 3 implementing resilience the definition that resilience describes the ability of a system to absorb shocks becomes imprecise when applied to specific situations the questions that arise are i what are the system boundaries ii what exactly does absorb mean and iii what is a shock event meerow newell and stults 42 add to the definition that this ability relates to the socio economic and socio technical networks across temporal and spatial scales this indicates that not only the disciplinary perspective but also time and spatial scale matter the following sections discuss each of these points 3 3 1 time matters on a theoretical notion resilience describes the ability of a system to absorb shocks especially quantitative scientists and engineers often prefer more narrowed down resilience concepts for instance in water resource management focusing on time elapsed 21 31 this shows that the definition and the boundaries of the system are crucial to understand what resilience means so the question of the time frame applied to resilience is important to decide whether a system is resilient or not forrest et al 24 defines resilience through the actions taken during three phases of the flood management timeline the first is the pre flood phase which includes the actions taken to mitigate and prepare for floods the second phase is the during flood phase comprising resistance of and response to the flood at the time it is occurring the last phase is the post flood phase and includes recovery and adaptation after a flood similarly davoudi et al 20 mentions the importance of considering the panarchy model of adaptive cycle this cycle describes the pattern by which resilience evolves over time the four phases of the cycle represent the stages in which communities find themselves as they deal with increasing and decreasing resilience following flooding events the phases include conservation phase stable and inflexible period of slower growth and low resilience creative destruction phase period of uncertainty at the time of a flooding event reorganization phase highly dynamic and highly resilient period of innovation and growth phase period of rapid growth and decreasing resilience according to this model it is the flooding event which produces resilience in a community by forcing change 3 3 2 scale matters among the most important attributes for defining systems is to establish the spatial extent of that system spatial scale in human systems can however be difficult to define perhaps this is why there exists such little uniformity among the vocabulary used to describe spatial scale in flood resilience table 3 lists some of the various terms used to express the spatial scale in recent flood resilience literature if it is explicitly stated at all as identified by cai et al 14 nonetheless it is important for those applying or measuring resilience to clearly define the spatial scale considered as the idea of what makes a system resilient can vary greatly across scale for example an individual construction can be resilient if it is able to withstand and absorb a shock event but also a society as a whole can be resilient if it is able to financially recover from a shock event 3 3 3 disciplines matter it is stressed in literature that resilience also has a non structural dimension in policy and practice 50 we can distinguish resilience in terms of civil engineering financial resilience economic resilience etc for that matter a good example is that an insurance coverage of a system can contribute to resilience of the whole system from an engineering perspective constructions and buildings have been destroyed and could not be considered resilient an example is the destruction of a railway track during a flood event in eastern germany in this case the track was destroyed and the rover company reconstructed their track at the same place in the same way asked about resilience the company said that it would be cheaper to reconstruct the rail track after every flood event than the effort to try to relocate the track to an alternative route because that would raise issues like property rights and planning issues this is an example of a financial resilience that contradicts a resilience from a civil engineering point of perspective this means that measuring resilience also implies making some thoughts about the disciplinary perspectives through which resilience is viewed so finally resilience depends on the spatial and temporal scale and also the disciplinary perspective which perspective is most appropriate for a certain system or a certain situation depends on a careful balancing of all involved stakeholders that means that resilience is highly locational and context specific in other words resilience is a political concept 4 conclusions flood risk and flood resilience both have much to offer in the management of floods each presents its own benefits and challenges resilience for example offers a more integrated approach to the problem of managing floods by measuring and strengthening the less tangible aspects of community this however comes at the expense of sometimes complicated metrics plagued by individualized approaches and a general lack of comparability across regions flood risk management on the other hand provides a clear metric with common units which can be readily compared and used to derive accountable interventions flood risk management s central focus on the immediate impacts of floods and its inability to adequately consider recovery are among the approach s shortcomings therefore it is not an abandonment of risk management practices and full adoption of resilience strategies which will produce cities ready for future flooding hazards nor is a continuation of risk based management alone adequate to handle future needs rather it is a complementary posture in which the strengths of each strategy inform the practice of the other by combining flood resilience and flood risk measures can be effective against a broader range of hazards than when considering either method alone this approach helps to address some of the uncertainties involved with flood risk management not by reducing them but by adding much needed flexibility to a field oriented toward optimization considering social and economic pathways as presented the current strategies attempting to bridge risk and resilience are lacking they are often little more than a peripheral application of flood resilience while focusing primarily on flood risk management this falls well short of reaching the potential benefits of a truly combined approach the pace of bringing this complementary structure into practice will need to match the urgency associated with climate change adaptation however it is unlikely that the currently fragmented development of flood resilience metrics and strategies will create a unified implementation in that required time frame a path forward will be more likely found when more research is dedicated to studying applications and less upon deriving new resilience frameworks instead of development of new metrics for each new community or region studied there is a need for research on applications of existing metrics to multiple study areas in order to discern which aspects are most promising modification of metrics for individual studies will remain inevitable due to the nature of the subject however the temptation to add new metrics to the literature does little to build the much needed consensus around resilience theory there is much work still remaining to be done for the future of resilience upon reviewing the literature it became obvious that there currently exists little research making systematic comparisons of resilience frameworks and indicators this is likely due to the difficultly of such an undertaking as both vary widely in approach and scope it may also be due to the fact that most of the work in regard to development of resilience frameworks and indicators is currently being conducted primarily by individual policy research institutes governmental bodies and non governmental organizations it appears that each group tends to frame their approach on the specific characteristics of the regions which each supports and develops its frameworks in a similarly context specific manner a categorical review of resilience frameworks and indicators which forms groups according to type and area focus assesses the thematic areas of interest and which evaluates implementation case studies of each would be a highly useful resource though similar small scale studies have been conducted a more in depth survey would help to better understand the current state of resilience work and help to forge a more unified path forward appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article

20151,water scarcity affects many countries around the world and increases in severity over time as populations grow and climate change further intensifies governments and water regulators address increased water scarcity in a regional setting by introducing policy interventions including non structural such as pricing mechanisms and quotas to affect demand and supply management means such as water storage and extraction one of the most extreme policy interventions is to build infrastructure to move water from locations where it is abundant to locations facing scarcity such interventions are known as intra and inter basin transfers ibts of water and have been quite frequently practiced in many river basins around the world in recent years in moving water from one place to another benefits and costs are realized some of which are private and some are public in nature the objective of this paper is to discern whether or not the documented ibts have been sustainable in addressing scarcity since very few quantitative cost benefit analyses are available for ibts we apply a variation of the qualitative structural approach for ranking quasar method to 121 studies of documented ibts within 40 territories and basins around the world using five attributes of impact that were found to be associated with the transfers our findings suggest that the majority of the ibts have been associated with overall negligible or negative impacts on the water exporting regions the water transmitting regions or the water importing regions within the basins studied our findings also suggest that ibts that were meant to relieve higher levels of water scarcity in the importing regions might be more prone to overall negative impacts jel codes q25 keywords inter basin water transfer qualitative structural approach for ranking quasar water scarcity irrigation environmental justice impacts 1 introduction water scarcity levels which can be measured by several metrics 6 vary across geographical locations and over time regional differences in water supply and availability occur for various reasons these include natural environmental impacts human interventions which affect the quality of water and the ability to handle and manage water at the country state county and city levels and changes in demand due to population growth and changes in human lifestyle 9 several assessments of spatial and intertemporal water scarcity levels 38 47 suggest that by 2050 economic growth and population change alone could lead to an additional 1 8 billion people living under various levels of water stress with the majority in developing countries the strongest climate impacts on water stress are observed in africa but strong impacts also occur throughout europe southeast asia and north america 38 over 2 billion people live in countries experiencing already high water stress and about 4 billion people experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year 47 1 1 stress 1000 1700 scarcity 500 1000 severe scarcity 500 m3 person per year an assessment of water demands by sectors is provided by amarasinghe and smakhtin 2 who examine how closely past projected withdrawals match current actual water withdrawals by comparing six water demand projections wpds conducted before 1990 and seven conducted after 1990 they show that the pre 1990 wdps based on population as the main driver of change and unrealistic assumptions of sectoral water use norms overpredicted current water use by 20 to 130 the post 1990 wdps were based on sophisticated modeling frameworks considering many exogenous and endogenous drivers of food and water supply and demand of different sectors however the post 1990 wdps of the business as usual scenarios show substantial underestimation globally and large deviations for sectors and countries from the current water use patterns the sustainable water use scenarios are even more downward biased clearly supply of water in many parts of the world lags behind the demand under existing conditions and the actual use by sectors the substantial reduction including deterioration in water quality in the available renewable water resources over time and the increase in water consuming economic activities e g food production increase in standards of living deterioration in water quality has led to a widening gap between the water quantities supplied and demanded these trends indicate a clear need for effective policy interventions water scarcity at the country state county and city levels could be addressed by using different policy intervention mechanisms directed both at demand and supply side management demand side management policies include various types of water quotas various water pricing schemes increasing block rate to reduce residential water use and incentives subsidies for adoption of water efficient technologies 13 for supply side management policies include public investment in water supply including manufacturing of water from the ocean desalination and treating wastewater to potable conditions for human consumption or treating wastewater for use in agriculture or for aquifer recharge 16 33 many studies have been conducted to assess the efficiency of such policy interventions in specific regions or countries 20 30 one major supply side management policy that has been practiced in many parts of the world for quite some time is the transfer of water from locations where it is relatively abundant to locations where it is relatively scarce both within one river basin intra or between discrete river basins inter inter and intra basin transfers are simply the transfer of water from one basin to another distinct basin or river catchment or a sub basin within a shared basin or river reach respectively 22 2 2 from hereafter we will use the acronym ibt for both intra and inter basin transfers this policy intervention involves massive investments in infrastructure and storage and is different from a policy that allows the introduction of water trade for marketing of water among water rights holders using existing conveyance infrastructure for example the national river linking plan nrlp is being developed by the government of india to resolve water scarcity across states and various river basins 26 some of the transfers in the indian subcontinent do exist and some are in the planning phase nrlp includes 30 links ibts to connect 37 rivers across the sub continent through a network of nearly 3000 storage dams all of which form a gigantic a national water grid in another recent study shumilova et al 39 review water transfer megaprojects wtmp defined as large scale engineering interventions to divert water within and between river basins such projects are mainly multi purpose large scale agricultural and energy schemes the study includes 34 operating and 76 planned or under construction wtmps the authors estimate a total volume of 1 910 km3 per year of all 110 mentioned wtmps in north america asia and africa once realized snaddon et al 40 provide a comprehensive global list of existing and proposed ibts at the time of the publication of their study the study reviews the capacity and the possible ecological consequences of individual ibts by countries and river basins this study reviews 51 existing ibts with a total capacity of 1316 5 km3 per year 16 14 2 4 9 6 in africa north america south america asia oceania and europe respectively fifty three additional proposed ibts were identified in that study some of which without information on the volume if water to be transferred another more recent assessment of the extent of water transfers by ibts is provided by gupta and zaag 22 suggesting that in the year 2000 inter basin water transfers diverted about 14 of all global water withdrawals there are proposed schemes which if implemented ibt of water would represent more than a quarter of all water withdrawals in the world by the year 2025 3 3 we have not been able to find recently published studies with updated accounts of existing and planned ibts perhaps the fact that ibt projects are very long term could suggest that the number of observed ibts in the existing studies that we present from the early 2000s did not increase much in the past 10 15 years since the publication of the works we report as it appears ibts have been considered planned and implemented in many parts of the world what drives policy makers to advance ibts as a possible solution to water scarcity the ultimate failure or partial success of the demand management interventions or locations of water scarce regions which do not allow producing water from the ocean or treat and reuse wastewater open the door for the public to accept ibts as a policy intervention in addition ibts can be supported due to the presence of short and long term concerns by policy makers such as climate change and population growth which may affect the availability of water in certain territories and basins while many studies have been undertaken in order to estimate the efficiency effectiveness and social cost of policy interventions in the form of water pricing and water quotas as was indicated earlier in the paper relatively few studies address the sustainability of ibt policies most of the published work on ibts evaluate particular aspects of selected ibts or document various ibts or even take stock of all ibts 41 48 43 29 however they do not conduct a comparative analysis of the impacts of ibts to allow any type of assessment of the sustainability of ibt as a policy intervention ibts have been practiced and reported in the literature but there is a lack of a global analysis of ibts as a water scarcity policy ibt affects the local population and the environment in water exporting regions water transmitting regions through which water moves from the exporting to the importing regions and in water importing regions by transferring water from a natural habitat for the purpose of benefitting a different region could the policy itself become harmful the policy was established to move water and the original intention was appropriate but there could be unforeseen and obstructive outcomes some of the outcomes result in immediate problems such as perpetuating inequality through the act of displacing people close to a basin or in the path of pipeline or canal that is used for the purpose of transferring water however sometimes the damage takes a long time to surface or to be realized for example the selenium problem that occurred on the west side of the san joaquin valley that surfaced in 1985 25 30 years after the federal and state water transfer projects cvp and swp respectively had begun operation we used information in the published literature on ibts to assess their sustainability as a policy intervention aimed to ease water scarcity at both the local intra basin transfer and regional interbasin transfer levels since very few quantitative cost benefit analyses are available for ibts we identified 21 reported ibts based on quantitative cost benefit analysis cba that vary from each other to the extent that they cannot be compared we applied qualitative structural approach for ranking quasar to 121 studies of documented ibts from around the world using five attributes of impacts that in the literature were associated with the transfers these attributes include social impacts private impacts are included where applicable including any negative and positive externalities that are found within the literature describing these ibts the paper develops as follows in section 2 we highlight advantages and disadvantages citing a handful of examples from the literature of ibts and methods used to assess the impacts of these transfers both qualitative and quantitative in section 3 we lay out the analytical framework we used to analyze the overall impacts of the different ibts in our sample section 4 presents the major features of the empirical methodology our coded attributes of the ibts in our sample section 5 presents the results of our analysis section 6 discusses the issues we faced and addressed section 7 concludes highlights policy implications and discusses some of the caveats of the analysis 2 pros and cons of ibt affected parties interested parties and benefits and losses 4 4 the literature included in this section is by no mean a representative sample of the ibts around the world our aim in this selected previous work review is to provide an anecdotal flavor of the issues that could be faced by the different ibts and to show that the comparison between different ibts is difficult if not impossible authors who have discussed the various economic and policy related aspects of past ibts use the rising demand for water around the world as the reason for transfers as early as 50 years ago 24 ibts are associated with both positive and negative impacts to water exporting water transmitting and water importing regions ibts are associated with building reservoirs and dams the world commission on dams 44 stated that the unprecedented expansion of dam building during the twentieth century clearly benefited many people globally but the positive impacts upon individuals and groups brought by these dams have been offset by negative social economic and environmental impacts such as high numbers of displaced people estimated to range from 40 to 80 million lack of equity in the distribution of benefits and negative impacts on ecological services rivers watersheds and aquatic ecosystems 19 ibts are also associated with indirect costs in the form of political objection or persuasion of the population in the exporting and importing regions for example in 1992 yemeni people living in habir discovered that their region had been proposed as the next source of water for ta iz city however the people living in habir had seen the impact that a water transfer had on the neighbouring valley of al haima so they were determined to stop the transfer until 1995 they were able to postpone the project but eventually a financial understanding was agreed upon and the villagers allowed construction to take place 25 in some countries with very large land areas the inter basin water transfers are on the agenda of policymakers for quite some time mahabaleshwara and nagabhushan 31 review the challenges engineering political and institutional associated with several of the river inter links that have been proposed and initiated to a certain extent negative impacts including those in the exporting regions and basins involve higher levels of aridity and increased levels of salinity both of which damage the ecology of the exporting basins additional damages are associated with an increase in water consumption in the importing basins and the possible spread of disease due to contamination of the water at the source or along the conveyance route in addition some effective alternative measures have been established for ibts such as improving efficient water use investing in desalination technology and rainwater harvesting practices 51 one of the major features of an ibt which is commonly labelled as positive is the redistribution of water resources between regions however this could lead to inequity for the exporting basin and also the territories or areas between the exporting and importing basins where the conveyance infrastructure is proposed to be constructed showing that ibts are double edged swords 51 these construction projects will most likely introduce long term issues to the surrounding territories and to the ecological environment compared with water conservation measures 36 ibts involve far more problems that could arise along a more distant horizon 51 the environmental impacts of water transfers vary around the world for example in bangladesh negative impacts on fish resulted from an ibt and from an environmental justice perspective displacement of people and loss of crops occurred 45 in the sibaral basin in central asia negative environmental justice issues resulted because of the river reversal where central asia and kazakhstan called for water within the ob to be redirected south where the water was actually needed 45 another example is the snowy mountains which were met with adverse impacts because of the scheme that produces gigawatts of electricity for the surrounding region and also because of poor natural resource management leading to reduced flows below each diversion point 45 yevjevich 49 explains that while it is generally assumed that water users in the exporting region will lose future benefits of the water by allowing for that diversion water users in the importing region will benefit from importing that diversion this creates a winner vs loser scenario in which the source region loses for having a surplus of water and the importing region is rewarded for having a deficit however it is not that simple it needs to be assessed and if possible enumerated how much damage will occur in the region that receives the diverted water and if any positive impacts could occur in the region from which the water is diverted diversions or transfers of water are multi disciplinary problems with a physical aspect that is related to the geomorphology water quality and overall water resources in the exporting and importing regions hydraulic engineering assessments should determine how the water will actually be conveyed from point a to point b for the sociologic aspects of a diversion or transfer the components are political administrative economic ecological environmental and legal because these components define how people and the environment will be affected by this transfer of water 49 inter basin transfers require joint planning between the interconnected basins in more complex cases though several basins become interconnected and need to cooperate in order to implement the transfer successfully in extreme cases all river basins and regions through basin or regional water transfers become interconnected such as the national river interlink project in india 49 snaddon et al 40 provide a qualitative accounting of the impacts of the 51 existing and 53 proposed ibts in their study while the impacts assessed are only described rather than measured one can have a meaningful grasp of what constitutes the range of impacts of ibts snaddon et al 40 identified but did not monetize or quantify several types of impacts affecting part of the 104 ibt projects such impacts include positive and negative effects both in the exporting and in the importing regions certain ibts could be affected by several of the following impacts a effects on water quantity and flow patterns 9 ibts b effects on erosion and geomorphology of riverine systems 7 ibts c effects on groundwater resources 5 ibts d effects on water quality 15 ibts e effects on aquatic ecosystems 48 ibts f socio economic effects 8 ibts and g cultural and aesthetic effects 5 ibts 3 analytical framework as we described earlier ibts are associated with positive and negative impacts in the exporting and importing regions as well as in the transit regions that constitute the transfer infrastructure some of the impacts are direct and some are indirect some are immediate and some are likely in the future howe and easter 24 developed a set of two necessary conditions for economically efficient ibts 1 the additional net benefits realized in the importing and transit regions must be greater than the loss in benefits incurred by the exporting regions and other regions indirectly affected by the transfer plus the additional costs associated with the conveyance infrastructure and 2 the cost of the infrastructure for the transfer scheme including the net opportunity cost of the water must be smaller than the cost of the best alternative for supplying the same amount of water in the importing region these two conditions imply many difficulties in measurement in identifying gaining and loosing parties and in assigning values to direct and indirect positive and negative impacts they also place difficulties on possible comparison among ibts these difficulties explain our observation that only few of the ibt reporting studies include a benefit cost analysis moreover even the handful of ibt studies that include benefit cost analysis cannot be compared because they incorporate different assumptions they use different horizons for the project analysis period and they use different discount rates the majority of the studies in our review provide only ordinary dichotomous measures of the impacts benefits or costs they indicate whether or not there is a negative impact a positive impact or no impact of certain attributes associated with the transfer as was mentioned in the previous section another challenge in evaluating the ibt is the existence of impacts costs or benefits that are difficult to quantify and to monetize van den bergh 46 and rogers et al 37 explain different approaches to a qualitative cba but they both focus on the difficulties associated with assigning values to qualitative data whether it is in regard to identifying environmental costs and benefits associated with climate change policy or the efforts associated with quantifying socioeconomic costs due to the nature of the information we extracted from all reviewed ibt studies and following the earlier discussion on the difficulties to compare extent of impacts within an ibt and across ibts we adopted and adapted the quasar method as explained in galassi and levarlet 18 the approach applied in galassi and levarlet 18 allows to compare between plans and programs p ps measuring their ability to address environmental consequences of particular p ps quasar makes it possible to quantify the effects using an a priory determined scale of values which makes the assessment of the effectiveness of the p ps reproducible and independent of the evaluating individual while galassi and levarlet 18 applied an assessment scale ranging between 6 and 6 several works cited in arvidsson 4 referred to the controversy in using ordinal scale measurements the controversy arises from the unknown distance between ordinal values and the resulting mathematical limitations of the comparison in social life cycle assessments lca the use of ordinal scoring scales has become the common practice as summarized by arvidsson 4 the common ordinal scales include but are not limited to a 0 1 3 5 7 9 23 b low medium high very high 32 c 1 2 3 4 35 and 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 ordinal scale values are also transformed into integers at some point in the assessment e g very high 6 one more example similar to our methodological ranking was used in fontes 17 where the ordinal scale 2 1 0 1 2 is used for scoring the individual impact scores can then be aggregated by social groups of activities and then can be further weighted to reflect social preferences into aggregated scores by social geographical or size of the group overall score 4 our assessment model was developed as follows our literature review consisted of published titles that include inter and intra basin water transfers during the review of the literature we identified impact attributes that were discussed by the authors of the ibts reviewed each ibt reviewed was associated with up to n attributes as will be explained in the next section we found several analyses of the same ibt some of the analyses included subsets of the n attributes therefore in these cases we combined the attributes from the various reports we did not find different impacts e g negative or positive effects in the various publications addressing the same ibt because no quantitative measurement was provided or even in the few that included benefit cost analyses we just marked whether or not an attribute is mentioned as having a positive negative or neutral impact let a i be the impact of the water transfer on the sustainability of attribute i i 1 n a i 1 if t h e i b t h a s a n e g a t i v e e f f e c t 0 if t h e i b t h a s a n e u t r a l e f f e c t 1 if t h e i b t h a s a p o s i t i v e e f f e c t f o r i 1 n then the total net effect ne of the water transfer or the composite impact is ne i 1 n a i where ne could take a negative integer value of 1 a zero value or a positive integer value of 1 given the nature of the a i s we can expect that n n e n assume n sustainability attributes that can be identified in relation to the intra or inter basin transfer some of these sustainability attributes could remain neutral as a result of the transfer some could be affected negatively and some could be affected positively in each particular reported transfer study we could identify effects on all or a subset n of the n sustainability attributes where 0 n n therefore where a given attribute was mentioned but no particular cost or benefit was mentioned in the reported analysis of the transfer we assumed that its impact on that particular attribute is neutral zero this quasar adapted model is described as likert scale like because it has assigned values of 1 0 and 1 in order to value this qualitative data in a quasi quantitative manner a short definition of the likert scale for the purpose of this adapted methodology is that it is a symmetric scale where the position of neutrality which is typically represented within the scale as don t know lies exactly in between the two extremes of strong disagreement to strong agreement this method was chosen for the purpose of our analysis because of its ability to cater to either extreme or remain conservative close to center the position of neutrality the attribute values were assigned based on how a reviewed study described an attribute related to a transfer whether the transfer was damaging or beneficial for humans or the environment was used as the basis of coding each respective attribute 27 42 the total net impact of an ibt can also be presented using an area graph 14 1 as is depicted in figs 1 and 2 for two different ibts with relatively overall high impacts and overall low impacts in our sample 4 empirical methodology the literature on ibt doesn t provide too many consistent sources that can serve as basis for the development of our empirical methodology das 12 analyzes the environmental and ecological impacts of major inter basin water transfers in canada using criteria such as policy making procedures water laws as well as other decision making criteria the objective was to explain the procedures leading to the transfers rather than the impact of the transfers zhuang 51 reviews 10 ibt cases from around the world to extract criteria by which environmental impacts can be assessed using the 10 ibt examples the author described the positive and negative impacts on the exporting the transmitting and the importing regions however that specific approach cannot be generalized and adopted elsewhere kibiiy and ndambuki 28 introduce what they coin new criteria to justify inter basin water transfers their approach resembles an ex ante analysis of water transfers rather an ex post assessment that we attempt in our analysis their three criteria justification of the transfer demonstration that the negative impacts are minimized and demonstration that the positive impact are maximized are applied to a proposed basin transfer in kenya finally the work by gupta and van der zaag 22 which was to some extent the departing point for the work by kibiiy and ndambuki 28 which uses criteria to assess whether or not an ibt can be justified they review a criteria examined in policy literature aiming at the nature of the process leading to the involvement of the local parties in the design of the transfer b criteria used in legal documents addressing mainly rights of local communities and equity of the transfer c criteria used in scientific literature which examine ecological integrity and economic efficiency they suggested 5 criteria for justification of an ibt 1 water scarcity in the importing region cannot be satisfied by any other means but ibt 2 loss of water in the exporting region must be compensated 3 no sustainable environmental damages in either the exporting importing or transmitting regions 4 socio cultural disruptions in either region should be minimized and 5 the entire benefits from the ibt should be equitably allocated among all regions involved gupta and van der zaag 22 applied their criteria to the river linking program in india another set of criteria applied to yet ex ante interbasin transfers analyses in iran 3 based on cox 10 which also included economic environmental and sociocultural criterions having some similarities with criteria used by others they include 1 whether or not ibt is the last possible alternative after other alternatives have been exhausted in the importing region 2 physical impact on the exporting region must be minimal unless the exporting region is compensated by the importing region through side payment 3 no substantial environmental quality degradation within the exporting or importing regions we would also add the transmitting region unless compensation to offset environmental damage is provided 4 no substantial sociocultural disruption in the exporting or importing regions we would also add the transmitting region unless compensation to offset potential sociocultural losses is provided and finally 5 the net benefits from the transfer have to be shared equitably between the exporting and importing regions while the objectives and scale of the analysis in the several reviewed studies above as well as the focus on ex ante analysis is not similar to what we attempt of doing there are several similarities in the criteria suggested for justification of the ibt 3 22 28 and the impacts of ibts on overall water efficiency economic and agricultural production environmental sustainability and sociocultural justice one particular point to be highlighted is that in such complicated water projects as ibts ex ante results may not hold for the ex post period given the many uncertainties and interrupting events that may change the values calculated in the ex ante analysis this is a major aspect that differentiate our work from several of the ones we discussed in this section and thus our methodology is based on the empirical investigation of the ibt cases as is explained below during our review of the identified ibt cases in the literature we marked the various impacts identified by the authors of each ibt analysis description impacts of ibts were divided into five categories themes 1 efficiency management effect em measuring the overall efficiency associated with the management of the basin water 2 irrigation outcome effect ir measuring the effects associated with irrigation projects which were the destination of the transferred water in many cases 3 environmental rehabilitation effect er measuring the effects of transfers aimed to move water in order to support ecosystems in the receiving regions 4 environmental ecological effect ee measuring the pervasive effects of the transfer on the environment ecosystems and 5 environmental justice equity effect ej measuring the social and cultural effects of the transfer on indigenous and poor communities in the exporting transmitting and importing regions 5 5 we should emphasize that the five attributes are not mutually exclusive this is especially important to mention in the case of er ee and ej all somehow related to environmental aspects however they do not overlap as mistakenly can be thought of but rather each of them relates to specific and particular effects that have been seen separately in water related negative externalities efficiency management effect indicates that an ibt uses allocates the transferred water for higher or lower value than was originally used irrigation outcome effect indicates that the transfer in many cases focusing on an irrigation project has a significant effect negative or positive on crop production environmental rehabilitation effect indicates whether the ibt is either supporting environmental flows or promoting the use of water transfers to benefit the environment environmental ecological effects indicated whether or not the ibt had negative or positive externalities affecting the environment in the exporting transmitting or importing regions environmental justice effect indicates whether the ibt created inequitable distribution of benefits or costs or even deprives local communities from their existing rights 4 1 empirical specifications the scoring codes were assigned albeit with some subjectivity by each author separately in case of disagreement the authors discussed and reached an agreement there have been 17 disagreements only mainly across the values of 1 and 0 values were assigned upon reading of the ibt analyses and identifying prevalence of each of the attributes we have not identified an ordinal scale for the severity or for the level of benefits associated with each attribute but rather whether or not a particular attribute was mentioned as effect positive neutral or negative on the ibt we also did not distinguish between the effects of the attributes and assigned all the same range of impacts see annex 1 for scoring on all 121 ibts and attribute ranking scores for each attribute were 1 0 or 1 for example if a transfer was categorized as being solely associated with positive environmental effects then its summed score would be set at 1 if an ibt was categorised as being about sustainable management ee or er along with em then its impact could be assigned on a spectrum but the sum would not exceed a value of 2 or 2 while this ibt could be more focused on sustainability than management it could be qualitatively assigned as a 1 for environmental rehabilitation and a 1 for efficient management leading to a total aggregated score of 0 which is referred to as a neutral impact transfer within this analysis 5 analysis and results we conduct various distributional analyses of the attribute scores of the 121 ibts the results are presented in tables 1 and 2 below table 1 presents the frequency distribution of the five attributes over the 121 ibts table 1 suggests that efficiency management effects em and environmental ecological effects ee were the majority of detected effects in the reported ibts the table also suggests that negative effects from ibts have been associated with efficiency management 32 0 irrigation outcomes effects 51 5 and ecological effects 92 4 the distribution of the aggregated attribute score per ibt helps answer the question of whether or not ibts are a sustainable policy table 2 presents the distribution of the aggregated attributes over the sample of the 121 ibts the table records the range of the overall effects ranging between 4 and 4 and their frequencies as seen in table 2 and in fig 3 the number of ibts with a total negative attribute value is 58 48 of the sample the number of ibts with no effect either negative or positive is 26 21 5 of the sample leaving the number of ibts with positive effects at 37 30 5 of the sample this overall finding leaves us with a major policy question regarding the sustainability of ibts that have been documented and used in this paper we found a relatively high level of variation for each of the five attributes across the sample projects table 3 leading in their level of variation and measured as the coefficient of variation are the irrigation outcome effect 1600 and the environmental rehabilitation effect 343 lowest variability in the attribute scores is seen in the case of the environmental or ecological effect 51 all these values indicate a wide range of effects across geographical locations we found a relatively reasonable level of variability sd of the aggregate attribute scores across the 121 ibts we analyzed results in table 4 suggest that 43 percent of the ibt scores are associated with sd values of 0 4 0 5 while only 9 percent of the ibts show sd values ranging between 0 8 and 1 0 another interesting observation is that of the 27 ibts with a mean impact score of 0 we observe 3 ibts in the highest variability level sd of 1 0 and 24 ibts with a lower variability range of 0 6 0 8 the latter observations range of sds of zero between attributes suggest that most of our neutral scored overall impacts are the result of both positive and negative effects in all five attributes rather than a low or no impact 6 discussion facing various water scarcity levels and their impacts policymakers consider intra and inter basin transfers among other policy interventions such as pricing of water and local supply amendment projects while many of the other policy interventions have been evaluated for their effectiveness and efficiency ibts which are much more complicated interventions have not at least in the global context mainly due to the difficulties to harmonize the analyses across all cases and to find appropriate economic indicators for all possible attributes impact of the transfers in recognition of such difficult conditions for a global analysis and with the growing importance of comparing across the many ibts reported in the literature we apply a simple but useful approach that allows for the dichotomous identification of impacts associated with the various attributes of the transfers the distributions of the five attributes of the ibt effects that we were able to identify in the 121 ibts show that several attributes are harder to obtain in the positive range than others environmental or ecological effects ee irrigation outcome effects ir and environmental justice equity effects ej are associated with negative means indicating the difficulty to obtain positive effects of these attributes in a water transfer all other attributes em and er are associated with a small positive effect nearly half of the transfers that target irrigation projects ir were found to be associated with negative impacts which is bothersome due to the fact that irrigation water captures 60 90 of the available water in the world therefore the irrigation component might have a much larger negative effect if the impact can be calculated using more specific impact analysis methods ibts that include efficiency management effects em and environmental rehabilitation effects er have scored a lower percentage of negative effects in total around one third of such ibts had negative effects overall it could be seen that there is a negative share for the assigned codes if a zero effect is not included within the positive effects with nearly 70 of the ibts with an overall negative score another observation that characterizes the ibts in our sample is the relatively high level of variation of each of the five attributes across the sample projects table 3 this observation may indicate a need for a more comprehensive global analysis of ibts as we will allude to in the conclusion section below we also observed table 4 that overall scored impacts of 0 in 27 121 ibts are a reflection of positive 1 and negative 1 impacts rather than no impact 0 7 conclusion policy implications and caveats regional water transfers whether inter or intra basin deal with or combat scarcity by acting as a means for protecting the water security within several basins since there is a problem with equitable and efficient allotments there inevitably will be an inequitable distribution of water externalities in some regions environmental issues such as land subsidence exist in exporting regions or the exporting or importing regions may be at risk of losing a species would it be better to stop using transfers for cases such as these a solution that has been called on in the past is to demand comprehensive cbas and more detailed information on places that have either done ibt right or know how to ameliorate these wrong outcomes based on past failures elsewhere from the sample of 121 ibts that we were able to review we found that only 21 are based on cba but they differ in many of the assumptions used to the extent that they cannot be compared therefore our recommendation is to establish an agreed upon procedure for cba of ibts that will allow not only individual analyses but also comparisons across ibts and lessons learned a possible departure point is the framework suggested by howe and easter 24 7 1 policy recommendations several policy implications can be generated from our analysis a suggested policy direction is to pursue the development of more sustainable technology we offer several policy approaches for consideration in order to reduce possible negative effects of the ibts while the first three approaches assume that ibt of water will be reduced and drastically changed the last two approaches assume that ibt of water will continue unchanged 1 movement of urban centers to the vicinity of the basin from which they have historically received their ibt water this solution is modified from the common public transport utilizing utopia described by many public policy experts if it is socially unsustainable to move the water supply it could be more sustainable and beneficial to the environment to have the demand centered around and adjacent to the water supply source of course this suggested solution may bring up new issues of both private and social benefits and external costs but is has to be addressed as part of a possible solution 2 sharing water rights between humans and the environment this was done in australia in response to an overdraft of water rights for water originating within the murray darling basin the government pledged 13 billion to buy back water rights for the sake of the environment and used subsidies to incentivize farmers although found not to be very effective to use more sustainable technology and practices to extract and use less water from the basin 11 the australian response to drought and unsustainable conditions could be used as a basis that can be adapted for use at a localized level in counties and cities before being used on a state or national scale we are aware of the ongoing public discourse in australia and around the world 21 11 regarding the effectiveness of the australian federal government buy back and irrigation equipment subsidy programs and its perverse outcomes manifested in movements of significant amounts of water across parts of the basin re examination and re adjustment of this policy could be relevant for other geographical locations 3 smart water markets water banks environmental flow allocations for the betterment of the environment and the food web payment for environmental services to offset environmental damages these markets banks and allocations using local water sources in the importing regions should be considered as opposed to a heavy reliance on transfers of water from another basin or region to offset water deficits in the local region this solution would create water markets in which people are incentivized to become more efficient with their water use because they can bank excess water or sell excess water to those living in their local area this would allow for more water independence in which people rather than utilities decide how they want to use or if they want to conserve their water 7 34 4 institutions and regulations to promote cooperation there should be more policy solutions such as the 2014 sustainable groundwater management act sgma in california and the resulting groundwater sustainability agencies gsas which were created to support surface water and groundwater transfers or water banks to increase efficiency of water use gsas could promote the use of recycled water for the sake of groundwater recharge and for water independence to lessen demand for water delivered through ibts in the importing regions if there were localized transfer agencies while this is considered to be more regulation there could be more accountability for ibts or water rights holders and a step towards actually placing a number on the real costs and benefits of water transfer for the exporting and importing basins and how the environment is affected by the conveyance between these two points 5 assigning a value to nature and water and considering it in the evaluation of the transfer sun et al 43 attempted at valuing water using three methods to examine the payment for ecosystem services by calculating the willingness and ability to pay for water and environmental conservation at both ends of the transfer in particular the conservation cost method ccm the market value method mvm and the payment ability method pam 7 2 implementation plan of different types of transfers involuntary government enacting top down implementation due to a state of emergency many transfers within the united arab emirates uae gulf cooperation council gcc could be defined as being involuntary simply because there are not a lot of other options to be considered other than exploration of desalination or informal talks about moving urban concentrations from one water impoverished region to another voluntary or cooperative meeting with the people and conducting environmental studies to determine the impact of the policy on all of the affected groups this may take longer and can be more complicated but it would be more sustainable however it is also the most unrealistic permanent bureaucracy entrenching a transfer so that it cannot be undone the majority of these transfers appear to be nested within this category specifically the sources in the literature discussing the south north water transfer project in china 5 temporary transferring water from one territory to another for a fixed period of time one specific transfer described by zeidan 50 occurring within the nile basin seems to encompass this category the transfer is based on a water compact attempting to be reached between eight countries but egypt and sudan refuse to reallocate their water rights so the other six countries will in effect have to suffer because a mechanism for water rights re assignments in this region between these riparian countries doesn t exist but its introduction will increase water transfers among riparian states 15 possible unseen problems result when private economic or monetary interests that people view as important supersede environmental ones for example the transfers from the tuolumne river to the san francisco public utilities commission sfpuc could be a viewed as a positive for urban society by one source but seen as a scourge on the environment by another source depending on the values placed on san francisco and its inhabitants it may be seen as more important to supply affordable clean water to humans than it is to preserve the tuolumne river by withdrawing flows from don pedro reservoir considering that water transfers can be assigned to these specific categories is where difficulties lies for territories to follow new policy directions these difficulties include transboundary and nature issues not having well defined costs and benefits difficulties also arose during data analysis with regard to the way the quantitative sources in the literature discussed water transfers as opposed to how qualitative sources in the literature discussed water transfers people from different disciplines and organizations from varying backgrounds could view a water transfer with completely differing views 7 3 caveats the approach and data we used might be subject to several caveats that were discussed earlier in the paper and are summarized below a lack of information on the total number of ibts doesn t allow us to assess whether or not our sample is representative however from comparing our sample to earlier studies we can argue that our sample is equal or larger than those listed not analyzed in previous publications 40 22 39 similar to the issue of a lack of information on the total number of ibts occurring in the world there is a lack of diversity in disciplines that analyze the effects of ibts within the literature the assumptions used in the various studies we collected could be biased somehow toward the beliefs of the authors there is no feasible way we could control for such possible biases and finally by using the metric of 1 0 1 to measure the effects of each of the five attributes we assigned them of equal importance across the ibts that we analyzed this assignment may likely not be appropriate because the exporting transmitting and importing regions of an ibt are subject to different physical conditions that may make each of them sensitive in different manners to the different attributes these caveats however should not prevent scholars from continuing to research and improve the analyses that assess the importance and risks of ibts as a policy intervention for securing water in regions with high levels of scarcity as climates change populations grow and water use intensifies we can expect only increases in regional water scarcities and thus realize the importance and interest of intra and inter basin transfers ibts of water acknowledgement this paper is based to a large extent on the capstone project submitted by logan purvis to the university of california riverside school of public policy on june 7 2019 under the supervision of ariel dinar support from the w4190 multistate nifa usda funded project management and policy challenges in a water scarce world is greatly appreciated annex 1

20151,water scarcity affects many countries around the world and increases in severity over time as populations grow and climate change further intensifies governments and water regulators address increased water scarcity in a regional setting by introducing policy interventions including non structural such as pricing mechanisms and quotas to affect demand and supply management means such as water storage and extraction one of the most extreme policy interventions is to build infrastructure to move water from locations where it is abundant to locations facing scarcity such interventions are known as intra and inter basin transfers ibts of water and have been quite frequently practiced in many river basins around the world in recent years in moving water from one place to another benefits and costs are realized some of which are private and some are public in nature the objective of this paper is to discern whether or not the documented ibts have been sustainable in addressing scarcity since very few quantitative cost benefit analyses are available for ibts we apply a variation of the qualitative structural approach for ranking quasar method to 121 studies of documented ibts within 40 territories and basins around the world using five attributes of impact that were found to be associated with the transfers our findings suggest that the majority of the ibts have been associated with overall negligible or negative impacts on the water exporting regions the water transmitting regions or the water importing regions within the basins studied our findings also suggest that ibts that were meant to relieve higher levels of water scarcity in the importing regions might be more prone to overall negative impacts jel codes q25 keywords inter basin water transfer qualitative structural approach for ranking quasar water scarcity irrigation environmental justice impacts 1 introduction water scarcity levels which can be measured by several metrics 6 vary across geographical locations and over time regional differences in water supply and availability occur for various reasons these include natural environmental impacts human interventions which affect the quality of water and the ability to handle and manage water at the country state county and city levels and changes in demand due to population growth and changes in human lifestyle 9 several assessments of spatial and intertemporal water scarcity levels 38 47 suggest that by 2050 economic growth and population change alone could lead to an additional 1 8 billion people living under various levels of water stress with the majority in developing countries the strongest climate impacts on water stress are observed in africa but strong impacts also occur throughout europe southeast asia and north america 38 over 2 billion people live in countries experiencing already high water stress and about 4 billion people experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year 47 1 1 stress 1000 1700 scarcity 500 1000 severe scarcity 500 m3 person per year an assessment of water demands by sectors is provided by amarasinghe and smakhtin 2 who examine how closely past projected withdrawals match current actual water withdrawals by comparing six water demand projections wpds conducted before 1990 and seven conducted after 1990 they show that the pre 1990 wdps based on population as the main driver of change and unrealistic assumptions of sectoral water use norms overpredicted current water use by 20 to 130 the post 1990 wdps were based on sophisticated modeling frameworks considering many exogenous and endogenous drivers of food and water supply and demand of different sectors however the post 1990 wdps of the business as usual scenarios show substantial underestimation globally and large deviations for sectors and countries from the current water use patterns the sustainable water use scenarios are even more downward biased clearly supply of water in many parts of the world lags behind the demand under existing conditions and the actual use by sectors the substantial reduction including deterioration in water quality in the available renewable water resources over time and the increase in water consuming economic activities e g food production increase in standards of living deterioration in water quality has led to a widening gap between the water quantities supplied and demanded these trends indicate a clear need for effective policy interventions water scarcity at the country state county and city levels could be addressed by using different policy intervention mechanisms directed both at demand and supply side management demand side management policies include various types of water quotas various water pricing schemes increasing block rate to reduce residential water use and incentives subsidies for adoption of water efficient technologies 13 for supply side management policies include public investment in water supply including manufacturing of water from the ocean desalination and treating wastewater to potable conditions for human consumption or treating wastewater for use in agriculture or for aquifer recharge 16 33 many studies have been conducted to assess the efficiency of such policy interventions in specific regions or countries 20 30 one major supply side management policy that has been practiced in many parts of the world for quite some time is the transfer of water from locations where it is relatively abundant to locations where it is relatively scarce both within one river basin intra or between discrete river basins inter inter and intra basin transfers are simply the transfer of water from one basin to another distinct basin or river catchment or a sub basin within a shared basin or river reach respectively 22 2 2 from hereafter we will use the acronym ibt for both intra and inter basin transfers this policy intervention involves massive investments in infrastructure and storage and is different from a policy that allows the introduction of water trade for marketing of water among water rights holders using existing conveyance infrastructure for example the national river linking plan nrlp is being developed by the government of india to resolve water scarcity across states and various river basins 26 some of the transfers in the indian subcontinent do exist and some are in the planning phase nrlp includes 30 links ibts to connect 37 rivers across the sub continent through a network of nearly 3000 storage dams all of which form a gigantic a national water grid in another recent study shumilova et al 39 review water transfer megaprojects wtmp defined as large scale engineering interventions to divert water within and between river basins such projects are mainly multi purpose large scale agricultural and energy schemes the study includes 34 operating and 76 planned or under construction wtmps the authors estimate a total volume of 1 910 km3 per year of all 110 mentioned wtmps in north america asia and africa once realized snaddon et al 40 provide a comprehensive global list of existing and proposed ibts at the time of the publication of their study the study reviews the capacity and the possible ecological consequences of individual ibts by countries and river basins this study reviews 51 existing ibts with a total capacity of 1316 5 km3 per year 16 14 2 4 9 6 in africa north america south america asia oceania and europe respectively fifty three additional proposed ibts were identified in that study some of which without information on the volume if water to be transferred another more recent assessment of the extent of water transfers by ibts is provided by gupta and zaag 22 suggesting that in the year 2000 inter basin water transfers diverted about 14 of all global water withdrawals there are proposed schemes which if implemented ibt of water would represent more than a quarter of all water withdrawals in the world by the year 2025 3 3 we have not been able to find recently published studies with updated accounts of existing and planned ibts perhaps the fact that ibt projects are very long term could suggest that the number of observed ibts in the existing studies that we present from the early 2000s did not increase much in the past 10 15 years since the publication of the works we report as it appears ibts have been considered planned and implemented in many parts of the world what drives policy makers to advance ibts as a possible solution to water scarcity the ultimate failure or partial success of the demand management interventions or locations of water scarce regions which do not allow producing water from the ocean or treat and reuse wastewater open the door for the public to accept ibts as a policy intervention in addition ibts can be supported due to the presence of short and long term concerns by policy makers such as climate change and population growth which may affect the availability of water in certain territories and basins while many studies have been undertaken in order to estimate the efficiency effectiveness and social cost of policy interventions in the form of water pricing and water quotas as was indicated earlier in the paper relatively few studies address the sustainability of ibt policies most of the published work on ibts evaluate particular aspects of selected ibts or document various ibts or even take stock of all ibts 41 48 43 29 however they do not conduct a comparative analysis of the impacts of ibts to allow any type of assessment of the sustainability of ibt as a policy intervention ibts have been practiced and reported in the literature but there is a lack of a global analysis of ibts as a water scarcity policy ibt affects the local population and the environment in water exporting regions water transmitting regions through which water moves from the exporting to the importing regions and in water importing regions by transferring water from a natural habitat for the purpose of benefitting a different region could the policy itself become harmful the policy was established to move water and the original intention was appropriate but there could be unforeseen and obstructive outcomes some of the outcomes result in immediate problems such as perpetuating inequality through the act of displacing people close to a basin or in the path of pipeline or canal that is used for the purpose of transferring water however sometimes the damage takes a long time to surface or to be realized for example the selenium problem that occurred on the west side of the san joaquin valley that surfaced in 1985 25 30 years after the federal and state water transfer projects cvp and swp respectively had begun operation we used information in the published literature on ibts to assess their sustainability as a policy intervention aimed to ease water scarcity at both the local intra basin transfer and regional interbasin transfer levels since very few quantitative cost benefit analyses are available for ibts we identified 21 reported ibts based on quantitative cost benefit analysis cba that vary from each other to the extent that they cannot be compared we applied qualitative structural approach for ranking quasar to 121 studies of documented ibts from around the world using five attributes of impacts that in the literature were associated with the transfers these attributes include social impacts private impacts are included where applicable including any negative and positive externalities that are found within the literature describing these ibts the paper develops as follows in section 2 we highlight advantages and disadvantages citing a handful of examples from the literature of ibts and methods used to assess the impacts of these transfers both qualitative and quantitative in section 3 we lay out the analytical framework we used to analyze the overall impacts of the different ibts in our sample section 4 presents the major features of the empirical methodology our coded attributes of the ibts in our sample section 5 presents the results of our analysis section 6 discusses the issues we faced and addressed section 7 concludes highlights policy implications and discusses some of the caveats of the analysis 2 pros and cons of ibt affected parties interested parties and benefits and losses 4 4 the literature included in this section is by no mean a representative sample of the ibts around the world our aim in this selected previous work review is to provide an anecdotal flavor of the issues that could be faced by the different ibts and to show that the comparison between different ibts is difficult if not impossible authors who have discussed the various economic and policy related aspects of past ibts use the rising demand for water around the world as the reason for transfers as early as 50 years ago 24 ibts are associated with both positive and negative impacts to water exporting water transmitting and water importing regions ibts are associated with building reservoirs and dams the world commission on dams 44 stated that the unprecedented expansion of dam building during the twentieth century clearly benefited many people globally but the positive impacts upon individuals and groups brought by these dams have been offset by negative social economic and environmental impacts such as high numbers of displaced people estimated to range from 40 to 80 million lack of equity in the distribution of benefits and negative impacts on ecological services rivers watersheds and aquatic ecosystems 19 ibts are also associated with indirect costs in the form of political objection or persuasion of the population in the exporting and importing regions for example in 1992 yemeni people living in habir discovered that their region had been proposed as the next source of water for ta iz city however the people living in habir had seen the impact that a water transfer had on the neighbouring valley of al haima so they were determined to stop the transfer until 1995 they were able to postpone the project but eventually a financial understanding was agreed upon and the villagers allowed construction to take place 25 in some countries with very large land areas the inter basin water transfers are on the agenda of policymakers for quite some time mahabaleshwara and nagabhushan 31 review the challenges engineering political and institutional associated with several of the river inter links that have been proposed and initiated to a certain extent negative impacts including those in the exporting regions and basins involve higher levels of aridity and increased levels of salinity both of which damage the ecology of the exporting basins additional damages are associated with an increase in water consumption in the importing basins and the possible spread of disease due to contamination of the water at the source or along the conveyance route in addition some effective alternative measures have been established for ibts such as improving efficient water use investing in desalination technology and rainwater harvesting practices 51 one of the major features of an ibt which is commonly labelled as positive is the redistribution of water resources between regions however this could lead to inequity for the exporting basin and also the territories or areas between the exporting and importing basins where the conveyance infrastructure is proposed to be constructed showing that ibts are double edged swords 51 these construction projects will most likely introduce long term issues to the surrounding territories and to the ecological environment compared with water conservation measures 36 ibts involve far more problems that could arise along a more distant horizon 51 the environmental impacts of water transfers vary around the world for example in bangladesh negative impacts on fish resulted from an ibt and from an environmental justice perspective displacement of people and loss of crops occurred 45 in the sibaral basin in central asia negative environmental justice issues resulted because of the river reversal where central asia and kazakhstan called for water within the ob to be redirected south where the water was actually needed 45 another example is the snowy mountains which were met with adverse impacts because of the scheme that produces gigawatts of electricity for the surrounding region and also because of poor natural resource management leading to reduced flows below each diversion point 45 yevjevich 49 explains that while it is generally assumed that water users in the exporting region will lose future benefits of the water by allowing for that diversion water users in the importing region will benefit from importing that diversion this creates a winner vs loser scenario in which the source region loses for having a surplus of water and the importing region is rewarded for having a deficit however it is not that simple it needs to be assessed and if possible enumerated how much damage will occur in the region that receives the diverted water and if any positive impacts could occur in the region from which the water is diverted diversions or transfers of water are multi disciplinary problems with a physical aspect that is related to the geomorphology water quality and overall water resources in the exporting and importing regions hydraulic engineering assessments should determine how the water will actually be conveyed from point a to point b for the sociologic aspects of a diversion or transfer the components are political administrative economic ecological environmental and legal because these components define how people and the environment will be affected by this transfer of water 49 inter basin transfers require joint planning between the interconnected basins in more complex cases though several basins become interconnected and need to cooperate in order to implement the transfer successfully in extreme cases all river basins and regions through basin or regional water transfers become interconnected such as the national river interlink project in india 49 snaddon et al 40 provide a qualitative accounting of the impacts of the 51 existing and 53 proposed ibts in their study while the impacts assessed are only described rather than measured one can have a meaningful grasp of what constitutes the range of impacts of ibts snaddon et al 40 identified but did not monetize or quantify several types of impacts affecting part of the 104 ibt projects such impacts include positive and negative effects both in the exporting and in the importing regions certain ibts could be affected by several of the following impacts a effects on water quantity and flow patterns 9 ibts b effects on erosion and geomorphology of riverine systems 7 ibts c effects on groundwater resources 5 ibts d effects on water quality 15 ibts e effects on aquatic ecosystems 48 ibts f socio economic effects 8 ibts and g cultural and aesthetic effects 5 ibts 3 analytical framework as we described earlier ibts are associated with positive and negative impacts in the exporting and importing regions as well as in the transit regions that constitute the transfer infrastructure some of the impacts are direct and some are indirect some are immediate and some are likely in the future howe and easter 24 developed a set of two necessary conditions for economically efficient ibts 1 the additional net benefits realized in the importing and transit regions must be greater than the loss in benefits incurred by the exporting regions and other regions indirectly affected by the transfer plus the additional costs associated with the conveyance infrastructure and 2 the cost of the infrastructure for the transfer scheme including the net opportunity cost of the water must be smaller than the cost of the best alternative for supplying the same amount of water in the importing region these two conditions imply many difficulties in measurement in identifying gaining and loosing parties and in assigning values to direct and indirect positive and negative impacts they also place difficulties on possible comparison among ibts these difficulties explain our observation that only few of the ibt reporting studies include a benefit cost analysis moreover even the handful of ibt studies that include benefit cost analysis cannot be compared because they incorporate different assumptions they use different horizons for the project analysis period and they use different discount rates the majority of the studies in our review provide only ordinary dichotomous measures of the impacts benefits or costs they indicate whether or not there is a negative impact a positive impact or no impact of certain attributes associated with the transfer as was mentioned in the previous section another challenge in evaluating the ibt is the existence of impacts costs or benefits that are difficult to quantify and to monetize van den bergh 46 and rogers et al 37 explain different approaches to a qualitative cba but they both focus on the difficulties associated with assigning values to qualitative data whether it is in regard to identifying environmental costs and benefits associated with climate change policy or the efforts associated with quantifying socioeconomic costs due to the nature of the information we extracted from all reviewed ibt studies and following the earlier discussion on the difficulties to compare extent of impacts within an ibt and across ibts we adopted and adapted the quasar method as explained in galassi and levarlet 18 the approach applied in galassi and levarlet 18 allows to compare between plans and programs p ps measuring their ability to address environmental consequences of particular p ps quasar makes it possible to quantify the effects using an a priory determined scale of values which makes the assessment of the effectiveness of the p ps reproducible and independent of the evaluating individual while galassi and levarlet 18 applied an assessment scale ranging between 6 and 6 several works cited in arvidsson 4 referred to the controversy in using ordinal scale measurements the controversy arises from the unknown distance between ordinal values and the resulting mathematical limitations of the comparison in social life cycle assessments lca the use of ordinal scoring scales has become the common practice as summarized by arvidsson 4 the common ordinal scales include but are not limited to a 0 1 3 5 7 9 23 b low medium high very high 32 c 1 2 3 4 35 and 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 ordinal scale values are also transformed into integers at some point in the assessment e g very high 6 one more example similar to our methodological ranking was used in fontes 17 where the ordinal scale 2 1 0 1 2 is used for scoring the individual impact scores can then be aggregated by social groups of activities and then can be further weighted to reflect social preferences into aggregated scores by social geographical or size of the group overall score 4 our assessment model was developed as follows our literature review consisted of published titles that include inter and intra basin water transfers during the review of the literature we identified impact attributes that were discussed by the authors of the ibts reviewed each ibt reviewed was associated with up to n attributes as will be explained in the next section we found several analyses of the same ibt some of the analyses included subsets of the n attributes therefore in these cases we combined the attributes from the various reports we did not find different impacts e g negative or positive effects in the various publications addressing the same ibt because no quantitative measurement was provided or even in the few that included benefit cost analyses we just marked whether or not an attribute is mentioned as having a positive negative or neutral impact let a i be the impact of the water transfer on the sustainability of attribute i i 1 n a i 1 if t h e i b t h a s a n e g a t i v e e f f e c t 0 if t h e i b t h a s a n e u t r a l e f f e c t 1 if t h e i b t h a s a p o s i t i v e e f f e c t f o r i 1 n then the total net effect ne of the water transfer or the composite impact is ne i 1 n a i where ne could take a negative integer value of 1 a zero value or a positive integer value of 1 given the nature of the a i s we can expect that n n e n assume n sustainability attributes that can be identified in relation to the intra or inter basin transfer some of these sustainability attributes could remain neutral as a result of the transfer some could be affected negatively and some could be affected positively in each particular reported transfer study we could identify effects on all or a subset n of the n sustainability attributes where 0 n n therefore where a given attribute was mentioned but no particular cost or benefit was mentioned in the reported analysis of the transfer we assumed that its impact on that particular attribute is neutral zero this quasar adapted model is described as likert scale like because it has assigned values of 1 0 and 1 in order to value this qualitative data in a quasi quantitative manner a short definition of the likert scale for the purpose of this adapted methodology is that it is a symmetric scale where the position of neutrality which is typically represented within the scale as don t know lies exactly in between the two extremes of strong disagreement to strong agreement this method was chosen for the purpose of our analysis because of its ability to cater to either extreme or remain conservative close to center the position of neutrality the attribute values were assigned based on how a reviewed study described an attribute related to a transfer whether the transfer was damaging or beneficial for humans or the environment was used as the basis of coding each respective attribute 27 42 the total net impact of an ibt can also be presented using an area graph 14 1 as is depicted in figs 1 and 2 for two different ibts with relatively overall high impacts and overall low impacts in our sample 4 empirical methodology the literature on ibt doesn t provide too many consistent sources that can serve as basis for the development of our empirical methodology das 12 analyzes the environmental and ecological impacts of major inter basin water transfers in canada using criteria such as policy making procedures water laws as well as other decision making criteria the objective was to explain the procedures leading to the transfers rather than the impact of the transfers zhuang 51 reviews 10 ibt cases from around the world to extract criteria by which environmental impacts can be assessed using the 10 ibt examples the author described the positive and negative impacts on the exporting the transmitting and the importing regions however that specific approach cannot be generalized and adopted elsewhere kibiiy and ndambuki 28 introduce what they coin new criteria to justify inter basin water transfers their approach resembles an ex ante analysis of water transfers rather an ex post assessment that we attempt in our analysis their three criteria justification of the transfer demonstration that the negative impacts are minimized and demonstration that the positive impact are maximized are applied to a proposed basin transfer in kenya finally the work by gupta and van der zaag 22 which was to some extent the departing point for the work by kibiiy and ndambuki 28 which uses criteria to assess whether or not an ibt can be justified they review a criteria examined in policy literature aiming at the nature of the process leading to the involvement of the local parties in the design of the transfer b criteria used in legal documents addressing mainly rights of local communities and equity of the transfer c criteria used in scientific literature which examine ecological integrity and economic efficiency they suggested 5 criteria for justification of an ibt 1 water scarcity in the importing region cannot be satisfied by any other means but ibt 2 loss of water in the exporting region must be compensated 3 no sustainable environmental damages in either the exporting importing or transmitting regions 4 socio cultural disruptions in either region should be minimized and 5 the entire benefits from the ibt should be equitably allocated among all regions involved gupta and van der zaag 22 applied their criteria to the river linking program in india another set of criteria applied to yet ex ante interbasin transfers analyses in iran 3 based on cox 10 which also included economic environmental and sociocultural criterions having some similarities with criteria used by others they include 1 whether or not ibt is the last possible alternative after other alternatives have been exhausted in the importing region 2 physical impact on the exporting region must be minimal unless the exporting region is compensated by the importing region through side payment 3 no substantial environmental quality degradation within the exporting or importing regions we would also add the transmitting region unless compensation to offset environmental damage is provided 4 no substantial sociocultural disruption in the exporting or importing regions we would also add the transmitting region unless compensation to offset potential sociocultural losses is provided and finally 5 the net benefits from the transfer have to be shared equitably between the exporting and importing regions while the objectives and scale of the analysis in the several reviewed studies above as well as the focus on ex ante analysis is not similar to what we attempt of doing there are several similarities in the criteria suggested for justification of the ibt 3 22 28 and the impacts of ibts on overall water efficiency economic and agricultural production environmental sustainability and sociocultural justice one particular point to be highlighted is that in such complicated water projects as ibts ex ante results may not hold for the ex post period given the many uncertainties and interrupting events that may change the values calculated in the ex ante analysis this is a major aspect that differentiate our work from several of the ones we discussed in this section and thus our methodology is based on the empirical investigation of the ibt cases as is explained below during our review of the identified ibt cases in the literature we marked the various impacts identified by the authors of each ibt analysis description impacts of ibts were divided into five categories themes 1 efficiency management effect em measuring the overall efficiency associated with the management of the basin water 2 irrigation outcome effect ir measuring the effects associated with irrigation projects which were the destination of the transferred water in many cases 3 environmental rehabilitation effect er measuring the effects of transfers aimed to move water in order to support ecosystems in the receiving regions 4 environmental ecological effect ee measuring the pervasive effects of the transfer on the environment ecosystems and 5 environmental justice equity effect ej measuring the social and cultural effects of the transfer on indigenous and poor communities in the exporting transmitting and importing regions 5 5 we should emphasize that the five attributes are not mutually exclusive this is especially important to mention in the case of er ee and ej all somehow related to environmental aspects however they do not overlap as mistakenly can be thought of but rather each of them relates to specific and particular effects that have been seen separately in water related negative externalities efficiency management effect indicates that an ibt uses allocates the transferred water for higher or lower value than was originally used irrigation outcome effect indicates that the transfer in many cases focusing on an irrigation project has a significant effect negative or positive on crop production environmental rehabilitation effect indicates whether the ibt is either supporting environmental flows or promoting the use of water transfers to benefit the environment environmental ecological effects indicated whether or not the ibt had negative or positive externalities affecting the environment in the exporting transmitting or importing regions environmental justice effect indicates whether the ibt created inequitable distribution of benefits or costs or even deprives local communities from their existing rights 4 1 empirical specifications the scoring codes were assigned albeit with some subjectivity by each author separately in case of disagreement the authors discussed and reached an agreement there have been 17 disagreements only mainly across the values of 1 and 0 values were assigned upon reading of the ibt analyses and identifying prevalence of each of the attributes we have not identified an ordinal scale for the severity or for the level of benefits associated with each attribute but rather whether or not a particular attribute was mentioned as effect positive neutral or negative on the ibt we also did not distinguish between the effects of the attributes and assigned all the same range of impacts see annex 1 for scoring on all 121 ibts and attribute ranking scores for each attribute were 1 0 or 1 for example if a transfer was categorized as being solely associated with positive environmental effects then its summed score would be set at 1 if an ibt was categorised as being about sustainable management ee or er along with em then its impact could be assigned on a spectrum but the sum would not exceed a value of 2 or 2 while this ibt could be more focused on sustainability than management it could be qualitatively assigned as a 1 for environmental rehabilitation and a 1 for efficient management leading to a total aggregated score of 0 which is referred to as a neutral impact transfer within this analysis 5 analysis and results we conduct various distributional analyses of the attribute scores of the 121 ibts the results are presented in tables 1 and 2 below table 1 presents the frequency distribution of the five attributes over the 121 ibts table 1 suggests that efficiency management effects em and environmental ecological effects ee were the majority of detected effects in the reported ibts the table also suggests that negative effects from ibts have been associated with efficiency management 32 0 irrigation outcomes effects 51 5 and ecological effects 92 4 the distribution of the aggregated attribute score per ibt helps answer the question of whether or not ibts are a sustainable policy table 2 presents the distribution of the aggregated attributes over the sample of the 121 ibts the table records the range of the overall effects ranging between 4 and 4 and their frequencies as seen in table 2 and in fig 3 the number of ibts with a total negative attribute value is 58 48 of the sample the number of ibts with no effect either negative or positive is 26 21 5 of the sample leaving the number of ibts with positive effects at 37 30 5 of the sample this overall finding leaves us with a major policy question regarding the sustainability of ibts that have been documented and used in this paper we found a relatively high level of variation for each of the five attributes across the sample projects table 3 leading in their level of variation and measured as the coefficient of variation are the irrigation outcome effect 1600 and the environmental rehabilitation effect 343 lowest variability in the attribute scores is seen in the case of the environmental or ecological effect 51 all these values indicate a wide range of effects across geographical locations we found a relatively reasonable level of variability sd of the aggregate attribute scores across the 121 ibts we analyzed results in table 4 suggest that 43 percent of the ibt scores are associated with sd values of 0 4 0 5 while only 9 percent of the ibts show sd values ranging between 0 8 and 1 0 another interesting observation is that of the 27 ibts with a mean impact score of 0 we observe 3 ibts in the highest variability level sd of 1 0 and 24 ibts with a lower variability range of 0 6 0 8 the latter observations range of sds of zero between attributes suggest that most of our neutral scored overall impacts are the result of both positive and negative effects in all five attributes rather than a low or no impact 6 discussion facing various water scarcity levels and their impacts policymakers consider intra and inter basin transfers among other policy interventions such as pricing of water and local supply amendment projects while many of the other policy interventions have been evaluated for their effectiveness and efficiency ibts which are much more complicated interventions have not at least in the global context mainly due to the difficulties to harmonize the analyses across all cases and to find appropriate economic indicators for all possible attributes impact of the transfers in recognition of such difficult conditions for a global analysis and with the growing importance of comparing across the many ibts reported in the literature we apply a simple but useful approach that allows for the dichotomous identification of impacts associated with the various attributes of the transfers the distributions of the five attributes of the ibt effects that we were able to identify in the 121 ibts show that several attributes are harder to obtain in the positive range than others environmental or ecological effects ee irrigation outcome effects ir and environmental justice equity effects ej are associated with negative means indicating the difficulty to obtain positive effects of these attributes in a water transfer all other attributes em and er are associated with a small positive effect nearly half of the transfers that target irrigation projects ir were found to be associated with negative impacts which is bothersome due to the fact that irrigation water captures 60 90 of the available water in the world therefore the irrigation component might have a much larger negative effect if the impact can be calculated using more specific impact analysis methods ibts that include efficiency management effects em and environmental rehabilitation effects er have scored a lower percentage of negative effects in total around one third of such ibts had negative effects overall it could be seen that there is a negative share for the assigned codes if a zero effect is not included within the positive effects with nearly 70 of the ibts with an overall negative score another observation that characterizes the ibts in our sample is the relatively high level of variation of each of the five attributes across the sample projects table 3 this observation may indicate a need for a more comprehensive global analysis of ibts as we will allude to in the conclusion section below we also observed table 4 that overall scored impacts of 0 in 27 121 ibts are a reflection of positive 1 and negative 1 impacts rather than no impact 0 7 conclusion policy implications and caveats regional water transfers whether inter or intra basin deal with or combat scarcity by acting as a means for protecting the water security within several basins since there is a problem with equitable and efficient allotments there inevitably will be an inequitable distribution of water externalities in some regions environmental issues such as land subsidence exist in exporting regions or the exporting or importing regions may be at risk of losing a species would it be better to stop using transfers for cases such as these a solution that has been called on in the past is to demand comprehensive cbas and more detailed information on places that have either done ibt right or know how to ameliorate these wrong outcomes based on past failures elsewhere from the sample of 121 ibts that we were able to review we found that only 21 are based on cba but they differ in many of the assumptions used to the extent that they cannot be compared therefore our recommendation is to establish an agreed upon procedure for cba of ibts that will allow not only individual analyses but also comparisons across ibts and lessons learned a possible departure point is the framework suggested by howe and easter 24 7 1 policy recommendations several policy implications can be generated from our analysis a suggested policy direction is to pursue the development of more sustainable technology we offer several policy approaches for consideration in order to reduce possible negative effects of the ibts while the first three approaches assume that ibt of water will be reduced and drastically changed the last two approaches assume that ibt of water will continue unchanged 1 movement of urban centers to the vicinity of the basin from which they have historically received their ibt water this solution is modified from the common public transport utilizing utopia described by many public policy experts if it is socially unsustainable to move the water supply it could be more sustainable and beneficial to the environment to have the demand centered around and adjacent to the water supply source of course this suggested solution may bring up new issues of both private and social benefits and external costs but is has to be addressed as part of a possible solution 2 sharing water rights between humans and the environment this was done in australia in response to an overdraft of water rights for water originating within the murray darling basin the government pledged 13 billion to buy back water rights for the sake of the environment and used subsidies to incentivize farmers although found not to be very effective to use more sustainable technology and practices to extract and use less water from the basin 11 the australian response to drought and unsustainable conditions could be used as a basis that can be adapted for use at a localized level in counties and cities before being used on a state or national scale we are aware of the ongoing public discourse in australia and around the world 21 11 regarding the effectiveness of the australian federal government buy back and irrigation equipment subsidy programs and its perverse outcomes manifested in movements of significant amounts of water across parts of the basin re examination and re adjustment of this policy could be relevant for other geographical locations 3 smart water markets water banks environmental flow allocations for the betterment of the environment and the food web payment for environmental services to offset environmental damages these markets banks and allocations using local water sources in the importing regions should be considered as opposed to a heavy reliance on transfers of water from another basin or region to offset water deficits in the local region this solution would create water markets in which people are incentivized to become more efficient with their water use because they can bank excess water or sell excess water to those living in their local area this would allow for more water independence in which people rather than utilities decide how they want to use or if they want to conserve their water 7 34 4 institutions and regulations to promote cooperation there should be more policy solutions such as the 2014 sustainable groundwater management act sgma in california and the resulting groundwater sustainability agencies gsas which were created to support surface water and groundwater transfers or water banks to increase efficiency of water use gsas could promote the use of recycled water for the sake of groundwater recharge and for water independence to lessen demand for water delivered through ibts in the importing regions if there were localized transfer agencies while this is considered to be more regulation there could be more accountability for ibts or water rights holders and a step towards actually placing a number on the real costs and benefits of water transfer for the exporting and importing basins and how the environment is affected by the conveyance between these two points 5 assigning a value to nature and water and considering it in the evaluation of the transfer sun et al 43 attempted at valuing water using three methods to examine the payment for ecosystem services by calculating the willingness and ability to pay for water and environmental conservation at both ends of the transfer in particular the conservation cost method ccm the market value method mvm and the payment ability method pam 7 2 implementation plan of different types of transfers involuntary government enacting top down implementation due to a state of emergency many transfers within the united arab emirates uae gulf cooperation council gcc could be defined as being involuntary simply because there are not a lot of other options to be considered other than exploration of desalination or informal talks about moving urban concentrations from one water impoverished region to another voluntary or cooperative meeting with the people and conducting environmental studies to determine the impact of the policy on all of the affected groups this may take longer and can be more complicated but it would be more sustainable however it is also the most unrealistic permanent bureaucracy entrenching a transfer so that it cannot be undone the majority of these transfers appear to be nested within this category specifically the sources in the literature discussing the south north water transfer project in china 5 temporary transferring water from one territory to another for a fixed period of time one specific transfer described by zeidan 50 occurring within the nile basin seems to encompass this category the transfer is based on a water compact attempting to be reached between eight countries but egypt and sudan refuse to reallocate their water rights so the other six countries will in effect have to suffer because a mechanism for water rights re assignments in this region between these riparian countries doesn t exist but its introduction will increase water transfers among riparian states 15 possible unseen problems result when private economic or monetary interests that people view as important supersede environmental ones for example the transfers from the tuolumne river to the san francisco public utilities commission sfpuc could be a viewed as a positive for urban society by one source but seen as a scourge on the environment by another source depending on the values placed on san francisco and its inhabitants it may be seen as more important to supply affordable clean water to humans than it is to preserve the tuolumne river by withdrawing flows from don pedro reservoir considering that water transfers can be assigned to these specific categories is where difficulties lies for territories to follow new policy directions these difficulties include transboundary and nature issues not having well defined costs and benefits difficulties also arose during data analysis with regard to the way the quantitative sources in the literature discussed water transfers as opposed to how qualitative sources in the literature discussed water transfers people from different disciplines and organizations from varying backgrounds could view a water transfer with completely differing views 7 3 caveats the approach and data we used might be subject to several caveats that were discussed earlier in the paper and are summarized below a lack of information on the total number of ibts doesn t allow us to assess whether or not our sample is representative however from comparing our sample to earlier studies we can argue that our sample is equal or larger than those listed not analyzed in previous publications 40 22 39 similar to the issue of a lack of information on the total number of ibts occurring in the world there is a lack of diversity in disciplines that analyze the effects of ibts within the literature the assumptions used in the various studies we collected could be biased somehow toward the beliefs of the authors there is no feasible way we could control for such possible biases and finally by using the metric of 1 0 1 to measure the effects of each of the five attributes we assigned them of equal importance across the ibts that we analyzed this assignment may likely not be appropriate because the exporting transmitting and importing regions of an ibt are subject to different physical conditions that may make each of them sensitive in different manners to the different attributes these caveats however should not prevent scholars from continuing to research and improve the analyses that assess the importance and risks of ibts as a policy intervention for securing water in regions with high levels of scarcity as climates change populations grow and water use intensifies we can expect only increases in regional water scarcities and thus realize the importance and interest of intra and inter basin transfers ibts of water acknowledgement this paper is based to a large extent on the capstone project submitted by logan purvis to the university of california riverside school of public policy on june 7 2019 under the supervision of ariel dinar support from the w4190 multistate nifa usda funded project management and policy challenges in a water scarce world is greatly appreciated annex 1

20152,increasing competition for freshwater underscores the need for scalable solutions to manage and mitigate the impacts of freshwater scarcity appropriate rules and incentives can facilitate a shift to more sustainable patterns of water use including water reallocation to restore rivers and aquifers in regions already experiencing excessive water extractions despite their potential water markets and other incentive based approaches to manage water have struggled to scale up beyond pilot initiatives due to political resistance financing shortfalls and data deficits recent advances in our understanding of incentives for sustainable water use can help to overcome persistent barriers that have hindered past efforts we provide a review of two well established yet disconnected fields of research and practice and establish an agenda at their intersection i incentive based approaches to water allocation and management and ii theory of change approaches to strategic development and impact evaluation doing so allows us to situate incentive based approaches to water allocation in a broader context identifying the potential synergies and frictions with wider processes of institutional reform and infrastructure development an explicit focus on theory of change approaches can identify the key assumptions and knowledge gaps hindering progress such as drivers enabling conditions and sequencing issues for different approaches and the key factors constraining adoption in different contexts we identify three areas where interdisciplinary research can support the development implementation and evaluation of theories of change for water markets and other incentive based water management 1 identifying where and when to develop different types of incentives for sustainable water use 2 designing and testing incentives as part of a broader package of institutional reforms and infrastructure investments and 3 systematically evaluating the impact of incentives using diverse data sources from satellites to the field multiple methods and multiple criteria a global network of water researchers and practitioners supported by common frameworks and observatories can enable systematic learning from experiments to strengthen incentives for sustainable water use and scale up their adoption keywords incentives sustainable water use water markets water scarcity theories of change 1 the challenge of sustainable water use 1 1 spread of freshwater scarcity over half of the global population experiences severe water scarcity for at least one month of the year 1 urbanisation rising incomes changing diets and growing populations are intensifying competition for water whilst climate change is decreasing the reliability of available supplies and infrastructure in many areas experiences from cape town to california are emblematic of these global trends by 2050 imbalances between supply and demand are projected to involve an urban surface water deficit of up to 6 75 million m3 2 with approximately four billion people expected to live in severely stressed river basins 3 these pressures are straining rivers and aquifers leading to hotspots of competition for water between cities agriculture hydropower and ecosystems in 2015 the member states of the united nations adopted the sustainable development goals sdgs including goal 6 to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all 1 1 an overview of the sustainable development goals and the knowledge platform created to support their further definition measurement and evaluation are available at https sustainabledevelopment un org under sdg 6 major efforts are underway to step up investment in piped water infrastructure in the coming decade to meet goals 6 1 and 6 2 for safe drinking water and sanitation which is projected to require a tripling of current average annual investments 4 the commitment to achieve 6 4 efficient water allocation and use and 6 6 healthy water ecosystems for sustainable water withdrawals by 2030 demands a comparable global response to better understand measure and manage freshwater scarcity 5 1 2 limits of supply solutions supply augmentation demand management and water reallocation offer three distinct yet interrelated and overlapping approaches to respond to water scarcity 2 in cities the fraction of water consumed for domestic and industrial purposes is relatively low with the vast majority of water being discharged as wastewater wastewater treatment and reuse for residential industrial irrigation and agricultural purposes creates an important linkage between water supply development and demand management 2 6 supply augmentation relies on technology and infrastructure including dams desalination and distribution systems demand side management includes education conservation technology regulations planning processes and economic incentives water reallocation enables changes in patterns of water use as supply and demand fluctuate relying on markets administrative or community centred approaches or often some combination of the three to minimise risks 7 reallocation depends on both supply augmentation and demand management natural or built water supply infrastructure facilitates the movement of water among users and demand management limits cumulative water consumption and encourages conservation through behavioural interventions regulatory changes and incentives including water markets and subsidies for these reasons water markets and incentives are complementary to supply augmentation and other demand management strategies policy reform and government investment remain largely focussed on supply side solutions yet many current proposals ignore the paradox of increasing water supply increasing water supply may initially address water scarcity but it also enables higher water demand 8 this paradox has several implications as the behavioural response can involve increasing water use to levels that cannot be sustained through dry periods for example increasing irrigation efficiency can lead to increases in aggregate water consumption unless the efficiency investments are underpinned by behaviour change and a cap on water extraction 9 reservoirs may heighten vulnerability to shortages unless linked with demand management and effective allocation 10 water users may adjust to average water supply conditions without reserving water to buffer for extreme events and conserve freshwater ecosystems the paradox of increasing water supply combined with the high social economic and environmental costs of reservoirs and inter basin transfers have prompted calls for a paradigm shift in how water is allocated water conservation and reallocation consistently rank among the lower cost options for enhancing water security and improved water allocation policies have been associated with reduced risks from water scarcity and shocks 11 this is illustrated by assessments of options in diverse geographies globally 12 13 in the colorado river basin for example an assessment of demand and supply options for reducing risks of water shortages illustrate this contrast the costs of generating one cubic meter of water range from 0 03 for deficit irrigation irrigation triggered by water stress to over 2 43 for imported water supplies 14 1 3 paper objective and scope in this paper we provide a review at the intersection of two well established yet disconnected fields of research and practice i incentive based approaches to water allocation section 2 and ii theory of change approaches to strategic development and impact evaluation section 3 the former is a mainstay of applied economic and policy research regarding water allocation and management the latter is increasingly prevalent in the development and conservation sectors often driven by funders seeking scalable impacts and accountability connecting these two fields see section 4 allows us to situate incentive based approaches to water allocation in a broader context identifying the potential synergies and frictions with wider processes of institutional reform and infrastructure development it also facilitates a coherent agenda for research that can inform conservation and development practice the review is indicative rather than exhaustive featuring seminal contributions in each of these two fields with an emphasis on contributions over the past 10 years it is global in scope but draws disproportionately on examples in north america usa and mexico and australia which are uniquely relevant due to the duration and scale of reform and experimentation yet it also offers a global perspective often lacking from discussions of water markets 2 incentives for sustainable water use the spectre of water shortages has renewed interest in creating incentives for sustainable water use yet the need for improved demand management has been apparent for decades since the beginning of the 21st century there have been increasing calls to pursue a soft path to freshwater sustainability involving shifts from developing new water supplies towards water conservation and reallocation 15 economic instruments for managing water scarcity have now been widely used and include a diverse tool box of incentives water pricing water trading payments for watershed services subsidies insurance and voluntary agreements 16 17 contrary to early optimism which envisioned free market environmentalism unlocking efficient water use through an upfront process of reforming property rights followed by decentralised exchanges 18 it is now clear that economic instruments for addressing water scarcity depend on sustained investments in governance and adequate institutional capacity to manage conflicts and adapt to changing conditions 19 we focus on two prominent approaches to reallocate water from human uses to environmental uses i water markets and ii public investments in irrigation efficiency 3 3 irrigation efficiency is defined as the ratio of the volume of all irrigation water used on a farmer s field mainly through evapotranspiration by crops and salt removal to maintain soil productivity to the total volume of irrigation water applied 9 p 748 these two types of incentive based approaches have been used by governments and non profit organisations to reallocate water from irrigation to environmental uses or incentivise water conservation and dedicate the conserved water for environmental needs payments for watershed services primarily address changes in land use to preserve or enhance water quality and are beyond the scope of the current analysis however such incentive based approaches may prove synergistic as illustrated by the rising interest in nature based solutions which have primarily focused on water quality but are increasingly being explored as a strategy for addressing water quantity issues in water stressed regions such as south africa and spain 20 there is some interplay between the two incentive based approaches examined here markets may encourage conservation as they provide an additional revenue stream for conserved water the ability to trade water increases its value and can spur public and private investments in irrigation efficiency however increasing water use efficiency and the economic value of water can lead to perverse outcomes without a cap on water extractions investments in irrigation efficiency can encourage the expansion of irrigation with the saved water increasing the economic value of water can increase the burden of water accounting compliance and enforcement as illustrated by scandals associated with water theft in the darling river of australia 21 22 these incentive based water management approaches can address multiple environmental objectives including the restoration of instream flows to support fisheries and water deliveries to sustain wetlands and other watershed services 23 increasingly however such environmental water allocation programmes are systemic in their objectives namely ensuring a regime of environmental flows or aquifer conditions to sustain all other uses below we examine water markets and public investments for agricultural water conservation to document the enabling conditions and pathways through which these incentives can deliver and enhance benefits for people and the environment 2 1 water markets in theory water markets involve three regulatory elements the creation of a cap that limits how much water can be extracted from the ecosystem allocation of water rights with a legal basis and creation of trading rules to facilitate reallocation 24 these elements exist within a broader framework of water governance and institutions and are underpinned by enabling conditions related to data e g water accounting trading registers monitoring governance e g well defined water rights conflict resolution mechanisms basin planning administrative capacity and financing e g public and private financing mitigation banks 25 28 firstly a cap on water extractions sets the limit on how much water is available for use setting a cap to meet human needs based on the regime of water availability required to sustain rivers and aquifers over time can ensure that ecosystems receive the water they need 29 in regulated rivers a cap can be partnered with reservoir operating rules that ensure the delivery of an appropriate environmental flow regime in unregulated rivers a cap on water extractions must be supported by other access rules to protect important aspects of the flow regime such as low flows and pulses caps must reflect short and long term water availability and should include a mechanism for sharing the impacts of climate change which can disproportionately affect environmental flows 30 secondly water rights must be allocated to users and defined as a legal instrument or some other form of socially recognised right the allocation process can define and distribute new water use rights or it can formalise and quantify existing rights as with a cap on extractions water allocation processes will involve a range of considerations related to short term use and long term allocation plans court adjudications or legislative processes to define rights to water sometimes as a form of property right formalisation of existing rights can enable reallocation between users moving water to higher value uses and supporting economic growth however such formalisation runs the risk of side lining existing legal and customary practices of water access which underscores the need for pluralistic or hybrid systems for water allocation reform based on local conditions and traditions 31 this is particularly important in colonial contexts where indigenous peoples have lost access to their traditional land and water rights although water markets may also provide an opportunity to redress this historical injustice 32 thirdly trading rules enable reallocation to account for equity and sustainability considerations by avoiding harm to other water users and the environment the need to identify and mitigate the third party effects 4 4 a third party effect refers to the unintended and uncompensated impact positive or negative on an actor who is not party to the transaction neither the buyer and seller in economic terms third party effects are described as externalities of water trading presents a formidable barrier to trading and indeed any form of reallocation as the reliability of water rights for downstream water users or adjacent groundwater pumpers is impacted by changing patterns of water use 33 reallocation also can present a real or perceived threat to rural economies due to the potential loss of jobs and industries dependent on agriculture or other water intensive sectors e g mining recognising the environment as a potential holder of water rights also enables water trading to be used to improve environmental flows many regions are experimenting with buying and selling water use rights to balance consumptive needs the first wave of experimentation occurred in australia 34 chile 35 36 and the us 25 43 where success has been mixed involving relatively high levels of trading within the agricultural sector but more limited and contentious experiences with water moving from agriculture to industrial urban or environmental uses the second wave of experimentation occurred since early 1990s where trading has been even more limited than expected in mexico 42 and spain 39 40 and almost completely abandoned in canada 41 the case of china bears watching with evidence of water trading involving a unique form of group to group transactions 37 38 in regions already experiencing unsustainable extractions environmental water transactions can enable the purchase or leasing of water rights to recover water for the environment or for emerging municipal or industrial demands one of the first experiments with such approaches is in the columbia basin of the usa where environmental water transactions programmes have evolved over the last 30 years dating from the 1987 oregon instream water rights act 44 45 environmental water transactions have since spread with varying levels of success to australia china mexico and spain among others 46 despite pockets of innovation overall progress in the use of water markets to enhance sustainable water management has been limited stemming from failures to address equity concerns infrastructure constraints financing deficits and political resistance 49 as a consequence efforts to tap markets and other forms of incentive based water management have struggled to shift from local projects to regional strategies the murray darling basin of australia is an exception to this trend an interim cap on water diversions increasingly formalised water rights and some initial trading rules were established in the 1990s followed by a national framework that embedded water markets as a core element of water management in 2004 and a new sustainable diversion limit in 2019 trading activity has grown in response to sustained drought and structural changes in the agricultural economy increasing the value of water entitlements to 13 billion aud by 2016 with surface water recovery of 1931 gigalitres based on a long term average annual yield as of september 30 2017 34 despite this progress there are ongoing challenges to the legitimacy and enforcement of recent planning efforts to recover water for the environment 50 while growth and development of formal water markets have lagged globally there is a growing recognition of the potential of less formal arrangements such as self organisation by water users to ensure sustainable water use and create incentives 43 caps on extractions can be established from the bottom up as exemplified by limits on groundwater extraction in the san luis valley of colorado 51 in the northern and central high plains of the united states much of the policy change related to innovations in groundwater management has occurred at a local level 52 such as the upper republican river of nebraska where a cap on irrigated acres was implemented by the local natural resource district 48 informal water markets have flourished in many regions that lack regulatory and administrative capacities to establish and enforce property rights 43 53 in these cases transactions involve informal water claims and trading water services such as time bound access to private tube wells 54 such markets develop in regions where agricultural development and urbanisation outpace the capacity of formal water supply systems ranging from groundwater markets for pump irrigation services in india to informal water vending in rapidly growing cities of the global south 55 such informal markets can exacerbate problems of over use inequity and water quality although regulation by central governments is not always an option or an effective solution 2 2 public investments to increase irrigation water use efficiency incentives for sustainable water use are not limited to water markets the second policy strategy for review involves public investments aimed at enhancing irrigation water use efficiency 9 56 agricultural subsidies represent one of the most influential levers on freshwater use with public investment in irrigation efficiency as one of the most common and controversial approaches the strategy is premised on conserving water to address water policy objectives such as expanded agricultural production or water savings to support growing urban demand and neglected environmental needs although public investments in irrigation efficiency can yield public benefits global experiences highlight how they can increase consumption when they fail to impose a cap on water extractions and account for the behavioural responses to increased water use efficiency 9 57 linstead 58 reviews the potential contribution of improvements in irrigation efficiency to environmental flows charting a middle ground in the polarised debate regarding its potential to reduce consumptive use of water in agriculture particularly at the basin level he argues that the net effect of irrigation efficiency on environmental flows hinges on the spatial and temporal scale of analysis a multi scale perspective tracks how the water savings generated by field level improvements in irrigation efficiency influence water availability for key components of the flow regime at specific places and times in other words irrigation efficiency can influence environmental flows by altering the timing and place of water availability even if the quantity of water consumed does not change examples include enhanced water availability to connect a tributary to the main stem of the river or increases in water availability at specific times of the year to alter low or high flows public investment in irrigation efficiency to conserve water for the environment has grown despite the technical and governance challenges australia and the western us form the two most prominent examples in australia almost 6 billion aud 2008 prices were committed to save water for the environment through irrigation efficiency improvements in the murray darling basin political pressure from irrigation lobbies have favoured such approaches to environmental water recovery despite their relatively high costs and risk of lock in compared with direct buyback of entitlements 59 in the western us individual states e g oregon montana have adopted statutes that permit the reallocation of water conserved through irrigation efficiency improvements in specific hydrologic conditions such projects have restored instream flows for dewatered fish habitat 60 despite the large investments and intense scientific and technical debates efforts to quantify and validate the water saved through irrigation efficiency remain limited 61 62 in this context the prevailing evidence and implementation experience suggests that investments in irrigation efficiency require a multi scale approach including finer grained accounting within sub basins and high frequency changes in consumptive water use and return flows 58 they also require complementary and coordinated sets of water management interventions to cap water extractions strengthen water allocation institutions and account for the behavioural response to improved efficiency which are important steps to ensure the compatibility of incentives 9 56 58 the existing experience with investments in irrigation efficiency underscores the importance of understanding the influence of subsidies on water use as investments aimed at conserving water can be undermined by offsetting signals that can increase consumptive use data from a subset of oecd countries estimates producer support of usd 500 million in 2017 alone although this represents a substantial decline over the preceding 30 years 47 of this total only a relatively small fraction explicitly focus on the implications for water use for example the common agricultural policy involves direct payments 48 including green payments for agricultural practices that benefit climate and the environment and rural development measures focussed on irrigation infrastructure and techniques that reduce water abstraction 2 3 summary the review of water markets and public investments in irrigation efficiency to reallocate water for environmental purposes demonstrates that incentive based water management and improved governance must go hand in hand realising the potential of these incentives and limiting their negative impacts requires a greater understanding of the factors associated with the success and failure of incentive based approaches identifying these factors and how they vary across contexts and over time can benefit from insights and methods associated with theory of change approaches to strategic development and impact evaluation 3 theories of change for scaling up incentive based water management 3 1 necessary conditions and pathways the oecd 47 described the necessary conditions for successful water policy reforms addressing agricultural water use through incentive based water management highlighting the importance of aligning incentives with wider governance reforms 5 5 their review identified five necessary conditions 1 diagnosing and framing problems based on evidence and an inclusive process 2 developing governance systems and institutions that are aligned with necessary policy changes 3 engaging stakeholders inclusively and strategically 4 coordinating economic incentives with policy changes and 5 sequencing reforms the oecd also underscored the importance of considering incentives for sustainable water management in the context of theories of change tocs explicit statements about the expected effects of an intervention usually showing causal links 63 p 10 a theories of change approach enables a step wise approach to identify the goals assumptions and impacts of potential reforms in this section we consider the different pathways used to achieve environmental objectives through incentive based water allocation and management pathways to new modes of water allocation will not be linear there will be interactions mid stream changes and instances where multiple approaches are used particularly when viewed over multiple years or decadal time scales here we examine these pathways to review key assumptions involved with both incremental approaches involving pilots and large scale efforts as well as hybrid approaches that involve a portfolio with both implementation and ongoing policy changes we then provide a review of the rapidly expanding literature and practical experience with toc approaches to strategic development and impact evaluation we identify three broad pathways of reform for incentive based water allocation and management table 1 each approach can be defined and illustrated using global experiences 1 pilots as experiments that are typically bottom up incremental approaches 2 big bang reforms which are typically top down centralised and rapid 64 and 3 portfolio approaches that blend elements of both within an adaptive management process overall we highlight how portfolio approaches counteract the weaknesses of either of the other approaches on its own first pilots as experiments are typically bottom up approaches that rely on pilots and expect the uptake of incentives to follow an s shaped curve similar to that observed in technology adoption and diffusion pilot programmes offer opportunities for experimentation and risk taking to demonstrate the potential of different types of incentives they are expected to be adjusted based on results and scaled up through a large infusion of capital individual organisations may prioritise bottom up approaches because of tractable outcomes that can be justified to funders or because their influence on state policies or regional outcomes is constrained or because local projects offer opportunities to enhance their legitimacy 62 communities may use pilot programmes to gain implementation experience to build support for policy and governance reforms or to have difficult conversations about the risks of shortages and the outcomes of changing water allocation arrangements 70 in the jiao river basin in china a pilot project demonstrated the role of catchment planning in allocation planning and rules using water resource modelling and scenario analysis to identify and incorporate environmental flow requirements 67 in the colorado river basin programmes to fallow water rights through leasing arrangements and to adopt agricultural water practices to conserve and reallocate water for system wide water reliability offer prominent and recent examples of bottom up experimentation 66 however pilots must take care to avoid sabotaging subsequent projects through inadequate consideration of the precedent established by the prices paid for water the need to reduce transaction costs necessary policy reform or inadequate infrastructure and monitoring networks to scale up second incentives for more sustainable water use may rely on a big bang reform involving a step change in government regulation and financing such tocs involve punctuated equilibria alternating between long periods of stability and short bursts of rapid change 64 examples include setting a new basin wide cap on water extractions financial infusions for large scale water buybacks or major public investments in subsidies and technologies including modernising or adding infrastructure for water savings through irrigation efficiency often ushered in during periods of crisis they are typically associated with national or regional policy reforms and can lead to unintended consequences or rushed policies that prove difficult to implement unless the technical analysis and political engagement precede the opportunity for reform 62 such risks are illustrated by a 66 million programme to buy back water licences for environmental restoration in the upper guadiana basin of spain which lacked essential legal reforms and monitoring capacities and led to acquisitions of water licences with no historical validity 71 72 even relatively successful efforts have encountered challenges such as poor enforcement and charges of corruption in water buybacks in the northern murray darling basin that jeopardised progress toward sustainable diversions 50 big bang reforms may suffer from insufficient attention to the groups and users who lose out and can struggle to generate lasting support for sustained change once the immediate crisis is over 62 at the basin level we have limited examples of large scale sustained reform in the water sector outside australia although the last decade has shown promising trends in the colorado river and yellow river 66 73 lastly there is a portfolio approach a blend of the proactive approaches that involves a sequence of policy reforms financial commitments and implementation efforts conducting small scale projects within a longer term reform agenda creates a space for difficult conversations and the capacity to build widespread acceptance and legitimacy for the programme the deschutes river basin is a prime example of a portfolio approach which involved the simultaneous development of a water plan identifying the needs of cities agriculture and the environment and a range of incentive based mechanisms for sharing water including a mitigation bank leasing programme and investment in irrigation efficiency 69 such portfolios also involve investments in capacity development including human capital institutions and education that though expensive and time consuming help to ensure stakeholder buy in and increase the sustainability of initiatives however even in the case of the murray darling national level reform has been undermined by insufficient state support there is no universal blueprint for using incentives to address water scarcity as context always matters yet the three pathways demonstrate a set of necessary conditions and common barriers necessary conditions involve a minimum platform of data governance infrastructure and financing highlighting the trend toward portfolio approaches that involve implementation and parallel and coordinated investment in planning water rights reform data and accounting frameworks and complementary incentives and infrastructure 28 common barriers stem from the third party effects and associated political and cultural resistance from rural communities concerned about their viability over the long term a portfolio approach and an adaptive management process are needed for sustained and scalable changes integrating a blend of pilots and policy reforms to learn by doing whilst also addressing systemic barriers to change lessons from other relevant sectors illustrate how political concerns can be addressed through grandfathering of property rights and side payments to affected parties in order to overcome political resistance as experienced in carbon emissions trading individual transferrable quotas for fisheries and wetland banking 74 3 2 developing theories of change to strengthen incentives for sustainable water use the oecd 47 review and growing global experience suggest that tocs may help to realise the potential for incentives limit their risks and pinpoint the knowledge gaps that hinder uptake and scalability tocs have become popular in conservation science and development studies for two reasons first they require clarification of the problems or opportunities to illuminate the causal mechanisms through which proposed interventions are expected to reduce threats or seize opportunities 75 explicit tocs in water management can clarify the objectives of incentives the short and long term impacts of different projects and policies and the role of incentives within broader institutional reform infrastructure development and innovations in data second tocs provide the basis for evaluating performance by documenting the causal chain linking interventions and impacts and identifying data that need to be collected 76 under growing pressure to deliver returns on public and private investments tocs are part of a wider shift toward rigorous impact measurement and evaluation the justification for using tocs is often practical and driven by the need for results but their use has not been without criticism tocs are often built on a broad understanding of how the world works and may rely on weak and selective evidence to create a misleading sense of security in the assumptions and level of analysis 77 we use concepts from the literature on toc approaches to show how they can improve the development and testing of incentives to achieve more sustainable water use clarify the assumptions and conditions hindering scalable progress to ambitious long term targets and identify important research gaps the first step in forming a toc is to define the problem or threat being addressed identify the opportunity for impact and describe desired outcomes water security captures multiple dimensions and shows the importance of considering multiple objectives linkages and trade offs the risk of water scarcity may be addressed through incentives which seek to achieve a range of human and environmental outcomes fig 1 though actions may be taken with only social or ecological systems in mind human and environmental needs are interdependent and a rigorous toc can explicitly explore the extent to which both systems benefit for example controlling groundwater overdraft yields benefits for dependent ecosystems and the communities of water users relying on the aquifer this first stage of developing a toc is expressly linked with efforts to understand water scarcity and define the goals of proposed market based and related policy reforms the sustainable groundwater management act 2014 in california is an example where the goals of the reform controlling groundwater overdraft lead to pumping limits and enable the development of trading mechanisms and other management strategies to achieve these goals 78 by contrast efforts to ensure more sustainable and equitable outcomes from informal urban water markets would involve a distinct set of goals and associated design options the second step in developing a toc is to identify the strategies and actions that can lead to desired outcomes the initial theory of change for markets and incentives to deliver efficiency through capping allocating and trading water neglected the synergistic investments in data governance and finance including infrastructure required for a broader range of outcomes see fig 2 while incentives address multiple problems they can also create additional ones the contribution of incentives to successful problem solving for people and the environment hinges on effective policy and planning to integrate incentives into wider processes of institutional reform and infrastructure development including both grey and green infrastructure e g nature based solutions further it requires an understanding of behavioural responses which can amplify or undermine such actions which may be illuminated through advances in behavioural modelling 79 a rigorous toc can identify complementary and synergistic investments here the implementation of specific transactional tools temporary or permanent trading is increasingly coordinated with wider planning and governance reforms as illustrated by the deschutes river of central oregon where leasing and irrigation efficiency programmes emerged from water planning and mitigation strategies underpinned by hydrogeologic and land use studies 69 the third step is to establish a link between the strategies and the desired outcomes to enable robust measurement and evaluation using a results chain to capture the causal linkage between an intervention and desired impacts through a series of expected intermediate results 80 this involves clarifying which actors must be involved and when intermediate results are expected to occur which can yield insights into the synergies of different actions for example both water transactions and crop switching may involve an intermediate step between changes in irrigation technology and the reallocation of water to restore environmental water requirements tailoring enabling conditions to specific strategies or actions may facilitate better outcomes for people and nature 26 this final step in developing tocs can leverage and accelerate research advances in impact evaluation which is critical in benchmarking progress identifying appropriate indicators and metrics and evaluating incremental and cumulative impacts of different portfolios of actions it also allows the specification of counterfactuals to compare the results of different interventions with the likely trajectories and outcomes under business as usual scenarios 81 a final consideration is that tocs are strongest when they are constantly revisited which is especially true when trying to build resilience or working in areas that are dynamic 4 concluding remarks agenda for science policy and enterprise sdg 6 raises the global ambition to reduce the impacts of water scarcity without compromising freshwater ecosystem health sdg 6 4 and sdg 6 6 we argue that incentives are key to global efforts towards sustainable water use and describe how tocs can guide their development testing and evaluation although multiple tocs exist and the terminology and its application remains in its infancy in the context of water allocation the step wise process outlined in section 3 2 can be used to think carefully about the scalability of water markets and other forms of incentives for sustainable water use by being as explicit as possible about the goals addressed the mechanisms and the causal linkages involved we identify five key findings that are increasingly well established across disparate frameworks and contexts namely 1 human and environmental water uses are interdependent 2 there is unrealised potential for incentives to enhance and share the benefits of water use between people and the environment 3 incentives for sustainable water use are not restricted to markets but include public investments in irrigation efficiency and a broader class of incentives that aim at changing behaviour but 4 incentives must be coupled with sound governance accounting and infrastructure to realise their potential for system level outcomes and limit their unintended consequences and 5 interdisciplinary research and practice is needed to prioritise design and evaluate incentive based strategies together these findings highlight a clear forward agenda for science policy and enterprise 4 1 determine which incentives are needed when and where designing appropriate incentives requires identifying where the drivers of water scarcity and opportunities for incentives intersect this research priority connects directly with the first step of the toc defining water scarcity problems and diagnosing those caused by inadequate supply poor demand management or some combination based on evidence and inclusive decision making the spread of water scarcity has prompted efforts to identify hotspots their drivers and risks integrated assessments have identified areas of greatest risk in future scenarios 11 82 83 and yielded tools that harness global data streams such as aqueduct and water risk filter 84 87 these approaches can identify areas affected by water scarcity by accounting for both hydrological and social dimensions 88 89 though there has been progress in developing indicators to assess mismatches between supply and demand 90 existing approaches suffer from shortcomings many metrics do not focus on scarcity related to different water sources indicators mostly lack a physical interpretation and the causes of scarcity are rarely traced back to their specific determinants 91 existing global assessments frequently lack resolution and thus utility in identifying drivers and formulating responses progress is needed to measure water scarcity disaggregate its drivers pinpoint where incentives may be most useful and engage with appropriate users and groups in the process of measuring water scarcity advances in earth observation networks crowd sourcing and citizen science can address emerging research questions regarding the dimensions and determinants of water scarcity 92 parallel progress is required to ensure that social economic and institutional variables are integrated into assessments of vulnerability higher resolution predictive modelling and scenario development will identify emerging hotspots where proactive and strategic investments can foster scalable change through the coupling of modelling related to physical factors and agent based behavioural models 79 such analysis would allow or enable the development of typologies of water stress that allow actions to be tailored to local conditions based on data regarding infrastructure institutional capacities costs and the distribution of benefits 4 2 design incentives as part of a broader package of reforms once scarcity has been identified and diagnosed through improved understanding of its drivers multi scale analysis of water scarcity coupled with diagnosis of governance arrangements can determine which types of incentives are contextually feasible and set priorities for institutional strengthening and governance reform 93 analysis of water as a coupled human natural system can prioritise action based on the scarcity of water the potential gains from trade and the feasibility of different incentives tocs can reveal enabling conditions and how these vary in relation to differences in environmental challenges and socio economic contexts existing efforts have considered the legal requirements for markets where water rights systems are suitable 94 examined the potential of irrigation efficiency to create water for the environment 56 and hypothesised the necessary enabling conditions and institutional foundations for different mechanisms 25 28 despite progress in identifying potential design options and enabling conditions approaches remain constrained by several factors 1 reliance on global data 2 universal context unspecific assumptions 3 coarse data resolution and 4 insufficient focus on limiting factors and the political economic aspects of incentives including the reflexive relationship between policy reform and cultural narratives 95 progress will rely on a coordinated agenda to address questions regarding the most effective design options and the factors associated with their success and failure this agenda will involve three key areas market design institutional design and sequencing of the two as part of dynamic adaptive pathways market design refers to the field which turns economic theory into practical solutions by creating marketplaces with rules to guide transactions and infrastructure that enables transactions to take place 74 institutional design refers to the property right systems and governance structures required for an incentive to work including the engagement and participation processes needed to address barriers to change the gap between theory and practice can be addressed by combining market design with institutional analysis and design engaging with questions of legitimacy and working with policy makers and local communities to pursue pathways that work locally for example strengthening institutions for water markets requires the clarification of property rights and reduction of transaction costs 96 sequencing must be taken into account regarding the implementation of market and institutional designs as reforms can involve decadal processes and may benefit from pilots and experimentation coupled with periodic legal and policy reforms when crises and innovations present the opportunities for step changes research regarding socio technical transitions and dynamic adaptive pathways commitments to short term actions and frameworks to guide future actions can inform the development and evaluation of different portfolios of policy reform and projects 97 98 lessons can be learned from other complex decadal processes such as the net zero carbon transition and sustainable urbanisation 4 3 define and measure success across multiple dimensions though billions have been invested in water markets and public subsidies for sustainable water use our understanding of returns on these investments is limited due to incompatible frameworks inconsistent metrics and inadequate data data advances have opened new frontiers of impact evaluation by enabling measurement that has not been feasible historically for example recent advances in conservation science have focused on the scalability of programmes considering distinct pathways ranging from slow fast slow or s curve shaped trajectories analogous with the piloting as experiments approach above contrasted with a fast slow trajectory similar to the big bang model 99 such evaluation methods require long term data which is increasingly becoming available yet have so far struggled to address freshwater due to the complexities involved while the joint monitoring programme jmp for sdg 6 has enabled nationally comparable data on drinking water and sanitation services globally water scarcity has proven more difficult to measure 100 101 and efforts to benchmark the design and performance of water institutions are nascent 102 monitoring frameworks must ensure consistency across different contexts and build on existing advances to provide broad and reliable performance indicators this presents an opportunity for a data architecture to define and track the hydrology economic and governance variables required complex objectives can benefit from the development of tocs to define criteria for success over various time scales and establish measurable indicators that include intermediate milestones towards overall goals performance measures should ensure that multiple criteria can be assessed as well as the trade offs between them such as economic returns and natural systems indicators 60 performance evaluation of incentives will require progress in data quality and resolution correcting biases towards short term performance over long term objectives and amending the tendency to focus on measuring what is easy over what matters 100 frameworks for evaluating the effectiveness of incentive based approaches to water allocation and management should not start from scratch the proliferation of frameworks indicators and metrics points to the need for integration and alignment the appropriate framework will depend on the precise problems and objectives addressed by a given toc in the context of freshwater conservation spatial action mapping offers a framework to guide decision making aimed at delivering the most effective conservation gains per unit investment 103 efforts to promote behaviour change and the adoption of different agricultural water use technologies and practices may benefit from field experiments particularly when identification of future winners and losers is difficult and sharing the benefits is crucial to the success of the reform regardless of the approach taken frameworks and methods must take on the thorny challenge of benchmarking and evaluating institutional design and performance recent advances have evaluated the governance of social ecological systems by examining the trajectories of key outcomes in relation to changes in institutional design and comparing these trajectories with the counterfactual 81 these studies suggest that greater integration will be needed to address multiple objectives and criteria a global network of observatories long term instrumented sites experiencing a similar set of challenges offers an opportunity to integrate multiple streams of data and methods over long periods such observatories can facilitate systematic and interdisciplinary approaches to evaluation and policy transfer 104 and can bridge the divide between global modelling and local field expertise and measurement when paired with networks of local researchers and practitioners 105 a global network of observatories guided by shared frameworks and common data architecture can identify transferable lessons regarding the evolution design and performance of incentives and their integration into broader institutional reforms and infrastructure systems our review illustrates how tocs can provide a useful link between research and practice and guide priorities for science and strategy by providing the framework for designing testing and evaluating incentive based approaches to water allocation and management concerted efforts by water researchers and practitioners can accelerate progress toward sustainable water use by identifying the places

20152,increasing competition for freshwater underscores the need for scalable solutions to manage and mitigate the impacts of freshwater scarcity appropriate rules and incentives can facilitate a shift to more sustainable patterns of water use including water reallocation to restore rivers and aquifers in regions already experiencing excessive water extractions despite their potential water markets and other incentive based approaches to manage water have struggled to scale up beyond pilot initiatives due to political resistance financing shortfalls and data deficits recent advances in our understanding of incentives for sustainable water use can help to overcome persistent barriers that have hindered past efforts we provide a review of two well established yet disconnected fields of research and practice and establish an agenda at their intersection i incentive based approaches to water allocation and management and ii theory of change approaches to strategic development and impact evaluation doing so allows us to situate incentive based approaches to water allocation in a broader context identifying the potential synergies and frictions with wider processes of institutional reform and infrastructure development an explicit focus on theory of change approaches can identify the key assumptions and knowledge gaps hindering progress such as drivers enabling conditions and sequencing issues for different approaches and the key factors constraining adoption in different contexts we identify three areas where interdisciplinary research can support the development implementation and evaluation of theories of change for water markets and other incentive based water management 1 identifying where and when to develop different types of incentives for sustainable water use 2 designing and testing incentives as part of a broader package of institutional reforms and infrastructure investments and 3 systematically evaluating the impact of incentives using diverse data sources from satellites to the field multiple methods and multiple criteria a global network of water researchers and practitioners supported by common frameworks and observatories can enable systematic learning from experiments to strengthen incentives for sustainable water use and scale up their adoption keywords incentives sustainable water use water markets water scarcity theories of change 1 the challenge of sustainable water use 1 1 spread of freshwater scarcity over half of the global population experiences severe water scarcity for at least one month of the year 1 urbanisation rising incomes changing diets and growing populations are intensifying competition for water whilst climate change is decreasing the reliability of available supplies and infrastructure in many areas experiences from cape town to california are emblematic of these global trends by 2050 imbalances between supply and demand are projected to involve an urban surface water deficit of up to 6 75 million m3 2 with approximately four billion people expected to live in severely stressed river basins 3 these pressures are straining rivers and aquifers leading to hotspots of competition for water between cities agriculture hydropower and ecosystems in 2015 the member states of the united nations adopted the sustainable development goals sdgs including goal 6 to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all 1 1 an overview of the sustainable development goals and the knowledge platform created to support their further definition measurement and evaluation are available at https sustainabledevelopment un org under sdg 6 major efforts are underway to step up investment in piped water infrastructure in the coming decade to meet goals 6 1 and 6 2 for safe drinking water and sanitation which is projected to require a tripling of current average annual investments 4 the commitment to achieve 6 4 efficient water allocation and use and 6 6 healthy water ecosystems for sustainable water withdrawals by 2030 demands a comparable global response to better understand measure and manage freshwater scarcity 5 1 2 limits of supply solutions supply augmentation demand management and water reallocation offer three distinct yet interrelated and overlapping approaches to respond to water scarcity 2 in cities the fraction of water consumed for domestic and industrial purposes is relatively low with the vast majority of water being discharged as wastewater wastewater treatment and reuse for residential industrial irrigation and agricultural purposes creates an important linkage between water supply development and demand management 2 6 supply augmentation relies on technology and infrastructure including dams desalination and distribution systems demand side management includes education conservation technology regulations planning processes and economic incentives water reallocation enables changes in patterns of water use as supply and demand fluctuate relying on markets administrative or community centred approaches or often some combination of the three to minimise risks 7 reallocation depends on both supply augmentation and demand management natural or built water supply infrastructure facilitates the movement of water among users and demand management limits cumulative water consumption and encourages conservation through behavioural interventions regulatory changes and incentives including water markets and subsidies for these reasons water markets and incentives are complementary to supply augmentation and other demand management strategies policy reform and government investment remain largely focussed on supply side solutions yet many current proposals ignore the paradox of increasing water supply increasing water supply may initially address water scarcity but it also enables higher water demand 8 this paradox has several implications as the behavioural response can involve increasing water use to levels that cannot be sustained through dry periods for example increasing irrigation efficiency can lead to increases in aggregate water consumption unless the efficiency investments are underpinned by behaviour change and a cap on water extraction 9 reservoirs may heighten vulnerability to shortages unless linked with demand management and effective allocation 10 water users may adjust to average water supply conditions without reserving water to buffer for extreme events and conserve freshwater ecosystems the paradox of increasing water supply combined with the high social economic and environmental costs of reservoirs and inter basin transfers have prompted calls for a paradigm shift in how water is allocated water conservation and reallocation consistently rank among the lower cost options for enhancing water security and improved water allocation policies have been associated with reduced risks from water scarcity and shocks 11 this is illustrated by assessments of options in diverse geographies globally 12 13 in the colorado river basin for example an assessment of demand and supply options for reducing risks of water shortages illustrate this contrast the costs of generating one cubic meter of water range from 0 03 for deficit irrigation irrigation triggered by water stress to over 2 43 for imported water supplies 14 1 3 paper objective and scope in this paper we provide a review at the intersection of two well established yet disconnected fields of research and practice i incentive based approaches to water allocation section 2 and ii theory of change approaches to strategic development and impact evaluation section 3 the former is a mainstay of applied economic and policy research regarding water allocation and management the latter is increasingly prevalent in the development and conservation sectors often driven by funders seeking scalable impacts and accountability connecting these two fields see section 4 allows us to situate incentive based approaches to water allocation in a broader context identifying the potential synergies and frictions with wider processes of institutional reform and infrastructure development it also facilitates a coherent agenda for research that can inform conservation and development practice the review is indicative rather than exhaustive featuring seminal contributions in each of these two fields with an emphasis on contributions over the past 10 years it is global in scope but draws disproportionately on examples in north america usa and mexico and australia which are uniquely relevant due to the duration and scale of reform and experimentation yet it also offers a global perspective often lacking from discussions of water markets 2 incentives for sustainable water use the spectre of water shortages has renewed interest in creating incentives for sustainable water use yet the need for improved demand management has been apparent for decades since the beginning of the 21st century there have been increasing calls to pursue a soft path to freshwater sustainability involving shifts from developing new water supplies towards water conservation and reallocation 15 economic instruments for managing water scarcity have now been widely used and include a diverse tool box of incentives water pricing water trading payments for watershed services subsidies insurance and voluntary agreements 16 17 contrary to early optimism which envisioned free market environmentalism unlocking efficient water use through an upfront process of reforming property rights followed by decentralised exchanges 18 it is now clear that economic instruments for addressing water scarcity depend on sustained investments in governance and adequate institutional capacity to manage conflicts and adapt to changing conditions 19 we focus on two prominent approaches to reallocate water from human uses to environmental uses i water markets and ii public investments in irrigation efficiency 3 3 irrigation efficiency is defined as the ratio of the volume of all irrigation water used on a farmer s field mainly through evapotranspiration by crops and salt removal to maintain soil productivity to the total volume of irrigation water applied 9 p 748 these two types of incentive based approaches have been used by governments and non profit organisations to reallocate water from irrigation to environmental uses or incentivise water conservation and dedicate the conserved water for environmental needs payments for watershed services primarily address changes in land use to preserve or enhance water quality and are beyond the scope of the current analysis however such incentive based approaches may prove synergistic as illustrated by the rising interest in nature based solutions which have primarily focused on water quality but are increasingly being explored as a strategy for addressing water quantity issues in water stressed regions such as south africa and spain 20 there is some interplay between the two incentive based approaches examined here markets may encourage conservation as they provide an additional revenue stream for conserved water the ability to trade water increases its value and can spur public and private investments in irrigation efficiency however increasing water use efficiency and the economic value of water can lead to perverse outcomes without a cap on water extractions investments in irrigation efficiency can encourage the expansion of irrigation with the saved water increasing the economic value of water can increase the burden of water accounting compliance and enforcement as illustrated by scandals associated with water theft in the darling river of australia 21 22 these incentive based water management approaches can address multiple environmental objectives including the restoration of instream flows to support fisheries and water deliveries to sustain wetlands and other watershed services 23 increasingly however such environmental water allocation programmes are systemic in their objectives namely ensuring a regime of environmental flows or aquifer conditions to sustain all other uses below we examine water markets and public investments for agricultural water conservation to document the enabling conditions and pathways through which these incentives can deliver and enhance benefits for people and the environment 2 1 water markets in theory water markets involve three regulatory elements the creation of a cap that limits how much water can be extracted from the ecosystem allocation of water rights with a legal basis and creation of trading rules to facilitate reallocation 24 these elements exist within a broader framework of water governance and institutions and are underpinned by enabling conditions related to data e g water accounting trading registers monitoring governance e g well defined water rights conflict resolution mechanisms basin planning administrative capacity and financing e g public and private financing mitigation banks 25 28 firstly a cap on water extractions sets the limit on how much water is available for use setting a cap to meet human needs based on the regime of water availability required to sustain rivers and aquifers over time can ensure that ecosystems receive the water they need 29 in regulated rivers a cap can be partnered with reservoir operating rules that ensure the delivery of an appropriate environmental flow regime in unregulated rivers a cap on water extractions must be supported by other access rules to protect important aspects of the flow regime such as low flows and pulses caps must reflect short and long term water availability and should include a mechanism for sharing the impacts of climate change which can disproportionately affect environmental flows 30 secondly water rights must be allocated to users and defined as a legal instrument or some other form of socially recognised right the allocation process can define and distribute new water use rights or it can formalise and quantify existing rights as with a cap on extractions water allocation processes will involve a range of considerations related to short term use and long term allocation plans court adjudications or legislative processes to define rights to water sometimes as a form of property right formalisation of existing rights can enable reallocation between users moving water to higher value uses and supporting economic growth however such formalisation runs the risk of side lining existing legal and customary practices of water access which underscores the need for pluralistic or hybrid systems for water allocation reform based on local conditions and traditions 31 this is particularly important in colonial contexts where indigenous peoples have lost access to their traditional land and water rights although water markets may also provide an opportunity to redress this historical injustice 32 thirdly trading rules enable reallocation to account for equity and sustainability considerations by avoiding harm to other water users and the environment the need to identify and mitigate the third party effects 4 4 a third party effect refers to the unintended and uncompensated impact positive or negative on an actor who is not party to the transaction neither the buyer and seller in economic terms third party effects are described as externalities of water trading presents a formidable barrier to trading and indeed any form of reallocation as the reliability of water rights for downstream water users or adjacent groundwater pumpers is impacted by changing patterns of water use 33 reallocation also can present a real or perceived threat to rural economies due to the potential loss of jobs and industries dependent on agriculture or other water intensive sectors e g mining recognising the environment as a potential holder of water rights also enables water trading to be used to improve environmental flows many regions are experimenting with buying and selling water use rights to balance consumptive needs the first wave of experimentation occurred in australia 34 chile 35 36 and the us 25 43 where success has been mixed involving relatively high levels of trading within the agricultural sector but more limited and contentious experiences with water moving from agriculture to industrial urban or environmental uses the second wave of experimentation occurred since early 1990s where trading has been even more limited than expected in mexico 42 and spain 39 40 and almost completely abandoned in canada 41 the case of china bears watching with evidence of water trading involving a unique form of group to group transactions 37 38 in regions already experiencing unsustainable extractions environmental water transactions can enable the purchase or leasing of water rights to recover water for the environment or for emerging municipal or industrial demands one of the first experiments with such approaches is in the columbia basin of the usa where environmental water transactions programmes have evolved over the last 30 years dating from the 1987 oregon instream water rights act 44 45 environmental water transactions have since spread with varying levels of success to australia china mexico and spain among others 46 despite pockets of innovation overall progress in the use of water markets to enhance sustainable water management has been limited stemming from failures to address equity concerns infrastructure constraints financing deficits and political resistance 49 as a consequence efforts to tap markets and other forms of incentive based water management have struggled to shift from local projects to regional strategies the murray darling basin of australia is an exception to this trend an interim cap on water diversions increasingly formalised water rights and some initial trading rules were established in the 1990s followed by a national framework that embedded water markets as a core element of water management in 2004 and a new sustainable diversion limit in 2019 trading activity has grown in response to sustained drought and structural changes in the agricultural economy increasing the value of water entitlements to 13 billion aud by 2016 with surface water recovery of 1931 gigalitres based on a long term average annual yield as of september 30 2017 34 despite this progress there are ongoing challenges to the legitimacy and enforcement of recent planning efforts to recover water for the environment 50 while growth and development of formal water markets have lagged globally there is a growing recognition of the potential of less formal arrangements such as self organisation by water users to ensure sustainable water use and create incentives 43 caps on extractions can be established from the bottom up as exemplified by limits on groundwater extraction in the san luis valley of colorado 51 in the northern and central high plains of the united states much of the policy change related to innovations in groundwater management has occurred at a local level 52 such as the upper republican river of nebraska where a cap on irrigated acres was implemented by the local natural resource district 48 informal water markets have flourished in many regions that lack regulatory and administrative capacities to establish and enforce property rights 43 53 in these cases transactions involve informal water claims and trading water services such as time bound access to private tube wells 54 such markets develop in regions where agricultural development and urbanisation outpace the capacity of formal water supply systems ranging from groundwater markets for pump irrigation services in india to informal water vending in rapidly growing cities of the global south 55 such informal markets can exacerbate problems of over use inequity and water quality although regulation by central governments is not always an option or an effective solution 2 2 public investments to increase irrigation water use efficiency incentives for sustainable water use are not limited to water markets the second policy strategy for review involves public investments aimed at enhancing irrigation water use efficiency 9 56 agricultural subsidies represent one of the most influential levers on freshwater use with public investment in irrigation efficiency as one of the most common and controversial approaches the strategy is premised on conserving water to address water policy objectives such as expanded agricultural production or water savings to support growing urban demand and neglected environmental needs although public investments in irrigation efficiency can yield public benefits global experiences highlight how they can increase consumption when they fail to impose a cap on water extractions and account for the behavioural responses to increased water use efficiency 9 57 linstead 58 reviews the potential contribution of improvements in irrigation efficiency to environmental flows charting a middle ground in the polarised debate regarding its potential to reduce consumptive use of water in agriculture particularly at the basin level he argues that the net effect of irrigation efficiency on environmental flows hinges on the spatial and temporal scale of analysis a multi scale perspective tracks how the water savings generated by field level improvements in irrigation efficiency influence water availability for key components of the flow regime at specific places and times in other words irrigation efficiency can influence environmental flows by altering the timing and place of water availability even if the quantity of water consumed does not change examples include enhanced water availability to connect a tributary to the main stem of the river or increases in water availability at specific times of the year to alter low or high flows public investment in irrigation efficiency to conserve water for the environment has grown despite the technical and governance challenges australia and the western us form the two most prominent examples in australia almost 6 billion aud 2008 prices were committed to save water for the environment through irrigation efficiency improvements in the murray darling basin political pressure from irrigation lobbies have favoured such approaches to environmental water recovery despite their relatively high costs and risk of lock in compared with direct buyback of entitlements 59 in the western us individual states e g oregon montana have adopted statutes that permit the reallocation of water conserved through irrigation efficiency improvements in specific hydrologic conditions such projects have restored instream flows for dewatered fish habitat 60 despite the large investments and intense scientific and technical debates efforts to quantify and validate the water saved through irrigation efficiency remain limited 61 62 in this context the prevailing evidence and implementation experience suggests that investments in irrigation efficiency require a multi scale approach including finer grained accounting within sub basins and high frequency changes in consumptive water use and return flows 58 they also require complementary and coordinated sets of water management interventions to cap water extractions strengthen water allocation institutions and account for the behavioural response to improved efficiency which are important steps to ensure the compatibility of incentives 9 56 58 the existing experience with investments in irrigation efficiency underscores the importance of understanding the influence of subsidies on water use as investments aimed at conserving water can be undermined by offsetting signals that can increase consumptive use data from a subset of oecd countries estimates producer support of usd 500 million in 2017 alone although this represents a substantial decline over the preceding 30 years 47 of this total only a relatively small fraction explicitly focus on the implications for water use for example the common agricultural policy involves direct payments 48 including green payments for agricultural practices that benefit climate and the environment and rural development measures focussed on irrigation infrastructure and techniques that reduce water abstraction 2 3 summary the review of water markets and public investments in irrigation efficiency to reallocate water for environmental purposes demonstrates that incentive based water management and improved governance must go hand in hand realising the potential of these incentives and limiting their negative impacts requires a greater understanding of the factors associated with the success and failure of incentive based approaches identifying these factors and how they vary across contexts and over time can benefit from insights and methods associated with theory of change approaches to strategic development and impact evaluation 3 theories of change for scaling up incentive based water management 3 1 necessary conditions and pathways the oecd 47 described the necessary conditions for successful water policy reforms addressing agricultural water use through incentive based water management highlighting the importance of aligning incentives with wider governance reforms 5 5 their review identified five necessary conditions 1 diagnosing and framing problems based on evidence and an inclusive process 2 developing governance systems and institutions that are aligned with necessary policy changes 3 engaging stakeholders inclusively and strategically 4 coordinating economic incentives with policy changes and 5 sequencing reforms the oecd also underscored the importance of considering incentives for sustainable water management in the context of theories of change tocs explicit statements about the expected effects of an intervention usually showing causal links 63 p 10 a theories of change approach enables a step wise approach to identify the goals assumptions and impacts of potential reforms in this section we consider the different pathways used to achieve environmental objectives through incentive based water allocation and management pathways to new modes of water allocation will not be linear there will be interactions mid stream changes and instances where multiple approaches are used particularly when viewed over multiple years or decadal time scales here we examine these pathways to review key assumptions involved with both incremental approaches involving pilots and large scale efforts as well as hybrid approaches that involve a portfolio with both implementation and ongoing policy changes we then provide a review of the rapidly expanding literature and practical experience with toc approaches to strategic development and impact evaluation we identify three broad pathways of reform for incentive based water allocation and management table 1 each approach can be defined and illustrated using global experiences 1 pilots as experiments that are typically bottom up incremental approaches 2 big bang reforms which are typically top down centralised and rapid 64 and 3 portfolio approaches that blend elements of both within an adaptive management process overall we highlight how portfolio approaches counteract the weaknesses of either of the other approaches on its own first pilots as experiments are typically bottom up approaches that rely on pilots and expect the uptake of incentives to follow an s shaped curve similar to that observed in technology adoption and diffusion pilot programmes offer opportunities for experimentation and risk taking to demonstrate the potential of different types of incentives they are expected to be adjusted based on results and scaled up through a large infusion of capital individual organisations may prioritise bottom up approaches because of tractable outcomes that can be justified to funders or because their influence on state policies or regional outcomes is constrained or because local projects offer opportunities to enhance their legitimacy 62 communities may use pilot programmes to gain implementation experience to build support for policy and governance reforms or to have difficult conversations about the risks of shortages and the outcomes of changing water allocation arrangements 70 in the jiao river basin in china a pilot project demonstrated the role of catchment planning in allocation planning and rules using water resource modelling and scenario analysis to identify and incorporate environmental flow requirements 67 in the colorado river basin programmes to fallow water rights through leasing arrangements and to adopt agricultural water practices to conserve and reallocate water for system wide water reliability offer prominent and recent examples of bottom up experimentation 66 however pilots must take care to avoid sabotaging subsequent projects through inadequate consideration of the precedent established by the prices paid for water the need to reduce transaction costs necessary policy reform or inadequate infrastructure and monitoring networks to scale up second incentives for more sustainable water use may rely on a big bang reform involving a step change in government regulation and financing such tocs involve punctuated equilibria alternating between long periods of stability and short bursts of rapid change 64 examples include setting a new basin wide cap on water extractions financial infusions for large scale water buybacks or major public investments in subsidies and technologies including modernising or adding infrastructure for water savings through irrigation efficiency often ushered in during periods of crisis they are typically associated with national or regional policy reforms and can lead to unintended consequences or rushed policies that prove difficult to implement unless the technical analysis and political engagement precede the opportunity for reform 62 such risks are illustrated by a 66 million programme to buy back water licences for environmental restoration in the upper guadiana basin of spain which lacked essential legal reforms and monitoring capacities and led to acquisitions of water licences with no historical validity 71 72 even relatively successful efforts have encountered challenges such as poor enforcement and charges of corruption in water buybacks in the northern murray darling basin that jeopardised progress toward sustainable diversions 50 big bang reforms may suffer from insufficient attention to the groups and users who lose out and can struggle to generate lasting support for sustained change once the immediate crisis is over 62 at the basin level we have limited examples of large scale sustained reform in the water sector outside australia although the last decade has shown promising trends in the colorado river and yellow river 66 73 lastly there is a portfolio approach a blend of the proactive approaches that involves a sequence of policy reforms financial commitments and implementation efforts conducting small scale projects within a longer term reform agenda creates a space for difficult conversations and the capacity to build widespread acceptance and legitimacy for the programme the deschutes river basin is a prime example of a portfolio approach which involved the simultaneous development of a water plan identifying the needs of cities agriculture and the environment and a range of incentive based mechanisms for sharing water including a mitigation bank leasing programme and investment in irrigation efficiency 69 such portfolios also involve investments in capacity development including human capital institutions and education that though expensive and time consuming help to ensure stakeholder buy in and increase the sustainability of initiatives however even in the case of the murray darling national level reform has been undermined by insufficient state support there is no universal blueprint for using incentives to address water scarcity as context always matters yet the three pathways demonstrate a set of necessary conditions and common barriers necessary conditions involve a minimum platform of data governance infrastructure and financing highlighting the trend toward portfolio approaches that involve implementation and parallel and coordinated investment in planning water rights reform data and accounting frameworks and complementary incentives and infrastructure 28 common barriers stem from the third party effects and associated political and cultural resistance from rural communities concerned about their viability over the long term a portfolio approach and an adaptive management process are needed for sustained and scalable changes integrating a blend of pilots and policy reforms to learn by doing whilst also addressing systemic barriers to change lessons from other relevant sectors illustrate how political concerns can be addressed through grandfathering of property rights and side payments to affected parties in order to overcome political resistance as experienced in carbon emissions trading individual transferrable quotas for fisheries and wetland banking 74 3 2 developing theories of change to strengthen incentives for sustainable water use the oecd 47 review and growing global experience suggest that tocs may help to realise the potential for incentives limit their risks and pinpoint the knowledge gaps that hinder uptake and scalability tocs have become popular in conservation science and development studies for two reasons first they require clarification of the problems or opportunities to illuminate the causal mechanisms through which proposed interventions are expected to reduce threats or seize opportunities 75 explicit tocs in water management can clarify the objectives of incentives the short and long term impacts of different projects and policies and the role of incentives within broader institutional reform infrastructure development and innovations in data second tocs provide the basis for evaluating performance by documenting the causal chain linking interventions and impacts and identifying data that need to be collected 76 under growing pressure to deliver returns on public and private investments tocs are part of a wider shift toward rigorous impact measurement and evaluation the justification for using tocs is often practical and driven by the need for results but their use has not been without criticism tocs are often built on a broad understanding of how the world works and may rely on weak and selective evidence to create a misleading sense of security in the assumptions and level of analysis 77 we use concepts from the literature on toc approaches to show how they can improve the development and testing of incentives to achieve more sustainable water use clarify the assumptions and conditions hindering scalable progress to ambitious long term targets and identify important research gaps the first step in forming a toc is to define the problem or threat being addressed identify the opportunity for impact and describe desired outcomes water security captures multiple dimensions and shows the importance of considering multiple objectives linkages and trade offs the risk of water scarcity may be addressed through incentives which seek to achieve a range of human and environmental outcomes fig 1 though actions may be taken with only social or ecological systems in mind human and environmental needs are interdependent and a rigorous toc can explicitly explore the extent to which both systems benefit for example controlling groundwater overdraft yields benefits for dependent ecosystems and the communities of water users relying on the aquifer this first stage of developing a toc is expressly linked with efforts to understand water scarcity and define the goals of proposed market based and related policy reforms the sustainable groundwater management act 2014 in california is an example where the goals of the reform controlling groundwater overdraft lead to pumping limits and enable the development of trading mechanisms and other management strategies to achieve these goals 78 by contrast efforts to ensure more sustainable and equitable outcomes from informal urban water markets would involve a distinct set of goals and associated design options the second step in developing a toc is to identify the strategies and actions that can lead to desired outcomes the initial theory of change for markets and incentives to deliver efficiency through capping allocating and trading water neglected the synergistic investments in data governance and finance including infrastructure required for a broader range of outcomes see fig 2 while incentives address multiple problems they can also create additional ones the contribution of incentives to successful problem solving for people and the environment hinges on effective policy and planning to integrate incentives into wider processes of institutional reform and infrastructure development including both grey and green infrastructure e g nature based solutions further it requires an understanding of behavioural responses which can amplify or undermine such actions which may be illuminated through advances in behavioural modelling 79 a rigorous toc can identify complementary and synergistic investments here the implementation of specific transactional tools temporary or permanent trading is increasingly coordinated with wider planning and governance reforms as illustrated by the deschutes river of central oregon where leasing and irrigation efficiency programmes emerged from water planning and mitigation strategies underpinned by hydrogeologic and land use studies 69 the third step is to establish a link between the strategies and the desired outcomes to enable robust measurement and evaluation using a results chain to capture the causal linkage between an intervention and desired impacts through a series of expected intermediate results 80 this involves clarifying which actors must be involved and when intermediate results are expected to occur which can yield insights into the synergies of different actions for example both water transactions and crop switching may involve an intermediate step between changes in irrigation technology and the reallocation of water to restore environmental water requirements tailoring enabling conditions to specific strategies or actions may facilitate better outcomes for people and nature 26 this final step in developing tocs can leverage and accelerate research advances in impact evaluation which is critical in benchmarking progress identifying appropriate indicators and metrics and evaluating incremental and cumulative impacts of different portfolios of actions it also allows the specification of counterfactuals to compare the results of different interventions with the likely trajectories and outcomes under business as usual scenarios 81 a final consideration is that tocs are strongest when they are constantly revisited which is especially true when trying to build resilience or working in areas that are dynamic 4 concluding remarks agenda for science policy and enterprise sdg 6 raises the global ambition to reduce the impacts of water scarcity without compromising freshwater ecosystem health sdg 6 4 and sdg 6 6 we argue that incentives are key to global efforts towards sustainable water use and describe how tocs can guide their development testing and evaluation although multiple tocs exist and the terminology and its application remains in its infancy in the context of water allocation the step wise process outlined in section 3 2 can be used to think carefully about the scalability of water markets and other forms of incentives for sustainable water use by being as explicit as possible about the goals addressed the mechanisms and the causal linkages involved we identify five key findings that are increasingly well established across disparate frameworks and contexts namely 1 human and environmental water uses are interdependent 2 there is unrealised potential for incentives to enhance and share the benefits of water use between people and the environment 3 incentives for sustainable water use are not restricted to markets but include public investments in irrigation efficiency and a broader class of incentives that aim at changing behaviour but 4 incentives must be coupled with sound governance accounting and infrastructure to realise their potential for system level outcomes and limit their unintended consequences and 5 interdisciplinary research and practice is needed to prioritise design and evaluate incentive based strategies together these findings highlight a clear forward agenda for science policy and enterprise 4 1 determine which incentives are needed when and where designing appropriate incentives requires identifying where the drivers of water scarcity and opportunities for incentives intersect this research priority connects directly with the first step of the toc defining water scarcity problems and diagnosing those caused by inadequate supply poor demand management or some combination based on evidence and inclusive decision making the spread of water scarcity has prompted efforts to identify hotspots their drivers and risks integrated assessments have identified areas of greatest risk in future scenarios 11 82 83 and yielded tools that harness global data streams such as aqueduct and water risk filter 84 87 these approaches can identify areas affected by water scarcity by accounting for both hydrological and social dimensions 88 89 though there has been progress in developing indicators to assess mismatches between supply and demand 90 existing approaches suffer from shortcomings many metrics do not focus on scarcity related to different water sources indicators mostly lack a physical interpretation and the causes of scarcity are rarely traced back to their specific determinants 91 existing global assessments frequently lack resolution and thus utility in identifying drivers and formulating responses progress is needed to measure water scarcity disaggregate its drivers pinpoint where incentives may be most useful and engage with appropriate users and groups in the process of measuring water scarcity advances in earth observation networks crowd sourcing and citizen science can address emerging research questions regarding the dimensions and determinants of water scarcity 92 parallel progress is required to ensure that social economic and institutional variables are integrated into assessments of vulnerability higher resolution predictive modelling and scenario development will identify emerging hotspots where proactive and strategic investments can foster scalable change through the coupling of modelling related to physical factors and agent based behavioural models 79 such analysis would allow or enable the development of typologies of water stress that allow actions to be tailored to local conditions based on data regarding infrastructure institutional capacities costs and the distribution of benefits 4 2 design incentives as part of a broader package of reforms once scarcity has been identified and diagnosed through improved understanding of its drivers multi scale analysis of water scarcity coupled with diagnosis of governance arrangements can determine which types of incentives are contextually feasible and set priorities for institutional strengthening and governance reform 93 analysis of water as a coupled human natural system can prioritise action based on the scarcity of water the potential gains from trade and the feasibility of different incentives tocs can reveal enabling conditions and how these vary in relation to differences in environmental challenges and socio economic contexts existing efforts have considered the legal requirements for markets where water rights systems are suitable 94 examined the potential of irrigation efficiency to create water for the environment 56 and hypothesised the necessary enabling conditions and institutional foundations for different mechanisms 25 28 despite progress in identifying potential design options and enabling conditions approaches remain constrained by several factors 1 reliance on global data 2 universal context unspecific assumptions 3 coarse data resolution and 4 insufficient focus on limiting factors and the political economic aspects of incentives including the reflexive relationship between policy reform and cultural narratives 95 progress will rely on a coordinated agenda to address questions regarding the most effective design options and the factors associated with their success and failure this agenda will involve three key areas market design institutional design and sequencing of the two as part of dynamic adaptive pathways market design refers to the field which turns economic theory into practical solutions by creating marketplaces with rules to guide transactions and infrastructure that enables transactions to take place 74 institutional design refers to the property right systems and governance structures required for an incentive to work including the engagement and participation processes needed to address barriers to change the gap between theory and practice can be addressed by combining market design with institutional analysis and design engaging with questions of legitimacy and working with policy makers and local communities to pursue pathways that work locally for example strengthening institutions for water markets requires the clarification of property rights and reduction of transaction costs 96 sequencing must be taken into account regarding the implementation of market and institutional designs as reforms can involve decadal processes and may benefit from pilots and experimentation coupled with periodic legal and policy reforms when crises and innovations present the opportunities for step changes research regarding socio technical transitions and dynamic adaptive pathways commitments to short term actions and frameworks to guide future actions can inform the development and evaluation of different portfolios of policy reform and projects 97 98 lessons can be learned from other complex decadal processes such as the net zero carbon transition and sustainable urbanisation 4 3 define and measure success across multiple dimensions though billions have been invested in water markets and public subsidies for sustainable water use our understanding of returns on these investments is limited due to incompatible frameworks inconsistent metrics and inadequate data data advances have opened new frontiers of impact evaluation by enabling measurement that has not been feasible historically for example recent advances in conservation science have focused on the scalability of programmes considering distinct pathways ranging from slow fast slow or s curve shaped trajectories analogous with the piloting as experiments approach above contrasted with a fast slow trajectory similar to the big bang model 99 such evaluation methods require long term data which is increasingly becoming available yet have so far struggled to address freshwater due to the complexities involved while the joint monitoring programme jmp for sdg 6 has enabled nationally comparable data on drinking water and sanitation services globally water scarcity has proven more difficult to measure 100 101 and efforts to benchmark the design and performance of water institutions are nascent 102 monitoring frameworks must ensure consistency across different contexts and build on existing advances to provide broad and reliable performance indicators this presents an opportunity for a data architecture to define and track the hydrology economic and governance variables required complex objectives can benefit from the development of tocs to define criteria for success over various time scales and establish measurable indicators that include intermediate milestones towards overall goals performance measures should ensure that multiple criteria can be assessed as well as the trade offs between them such as economic returns and natural systems indicators 60 performance evaluation of incentives will require progress in data quality and resolution correcting biases towards short term performance over long term objectives and amending the tendency to focus on measuring what is easy over what matters 100 frameworks for evaluating the effectiveness of incentive based approaches to water allocation and management should not start from scratch the proliferation of frameworks indicators and metrics points to the need for integration and alignment the appropriate framework will depend on the precise problems and objectives addressed by a given toc in the context of freshwater conservation spatial action mapping offers a framework to guide decision making aimed at delivering the most effective conservation gains per unit investment 103 efforts to promote behaviour change and the adoption of different agricultural water use technologies and practices may benefit from field experiments particularly when identification of future winners and losers is difficult and sharing the benefits is crucial to the success of the reform regardless of the approach taken frameworks and methods must take on the thorny challenge of benchmarking and evaluating institutional design and performance recent advances have evaluated the governance of social ecological systems by examining the trajectories of key outcomes in relation to changes in institutional design and comparing these trajectories with the counterfactual 81 these studies suggest that greater integration will be needed to address multiple objectives and criteria a global network of observatories long term instrumented sites experiencing a similar set of challenges offers an opportunity to integrate multiple streams of data and methods over long periods such observatories can facilitate systematic and interdisciplinary approaches to evaluation and policy transfer 104 and can bridge the divide between global modelling and local field expertise and measurement when paired with networks of local researchers and practitioners 105 a global network of observatories guided by shared frameworks and common data architecture can identify transferable lessons regarding the evolution design and performance of incentives and their integration into broader institutional reforms and infrastructure systems our review illustrates how tocs can provide a useful link between research and practice and guide priorities for science and strategy by providing the framework for designing testing and evaluating incentive based approaches to water allocation and management concerted efforts by water researchers and practitioners can accelerate progress toward sustainable water use by identifying the places

20153,after the central asian republics became independent in 1991 the transformation process challenged water governance arrangements at all levels analysis of transboundary water governance has mainly found that cooperation has been prevailing over conflict much research is driven by the question how global concepts like iwrm or good water governance are implemented in the context of central asia studies reveal how their inherent ideas of participation and transparency clash with local realities only few authors have focussed on national water governance their studies show how powerful actors either resist reforms or use them to secure or enhance their positions a genuine focus on region specific forms of water governance as well as on national politics is underrepresented in the literature which is explained with funding policies and the restrictions of the authoritarian political regimes keywords water governance water politics central asia iwrm knowledge production 1 introduction it is a commonplace that many water challenges in central asia are not related to water scarcity but to unsustainable management practices unequal distribution of water among the countries and resulting conflicts of interests this gave ground to calls that analysis of problems and identification of solutions should focus not only on technical aspects but on water governance thus the different institutions rules organizations and their interrelations that affect the use and management of water this article follows zwarteveen et al 94 in the understanding of water governance being about the rules and practices that regulate distribution of water as much as about the distribution of voice and authority in these processes and about the distribution of knowledge and expertise consequently when reviewing the academic literature on water governance in central asia 1 1 with the term central asia this paper refers to the five former soviet republics kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan this paper aims to also critically reflect which kind of knowledge is produced by whom which aspects of water governance are over or under represented and why this is so when the central asian republics of the ussr became independent in 1991 the subsequent transformation process challenged previous water governance arrangements in three main ways 1 with the independence of the countries previously national rivers and the extended interrepublican canal systems became transboundary and the joint water energy management system among the republics stopped functioning 2 2 in soviet times water and energy resources were part of the region s inter republican integrated management system water from the amudarya and syrdarya rivers was stored in upstream reservoirs in the kyrgyz and tajik soviet socialist republics ssrs and supplied to extensive irrigation systems in the downstream kazakh turkmen and uzbek ssrs for agricultural production in exchange oil coal and gas were transferred from downstream to upstream republics in winter and electricity was provided to all through the soviet common electricity net 2 the political transformation from communist rule to regimes ranging between hybrid and strong authoritarian governance as well as the exposure to western discourses and interventions on good governance and democratization led to reforms of the mechanisms of decision making and bureaucratic organisation of the water sector 3 with the economic transformation from planned economy to privatization with varying degrees of state control collective and state farms were dissolved and left a vacuum of responsibility for local water management and canal maintenance these challenges affected in particular water use in agriculture and for energy production and these are also the fields on which this review will focus the discourse on water in central asia is still mainly a discourse on water management and not on governance a russian translation of the term water governance has not been established yet the global water partnership and some researchers use rukovodstvo vody but this is not understood beyond a small group of experts exposed to international discourses often water governance is translated as upravlenie vodnymi resursami which is the same term as used for water management it does not allow for a distinction among the two nevertheless the last two decades have seen a continuing increase of research addressing even if not using the terminology questions of water governance in central asia 3 3 academic literature focussing explicitly on water governance in the analytical meaning used here is very limited for central asia however there is literature on institutional change like the introduction of integrated water resources management iwrm or on transboundary conflict and cooperation it is included in this article when it addresses governance questions the review includes only english language papers in scientific journals and books until very recently russian was the main language of academic research and education in the region and academic knowledge production was based on publishing monographs and books rather than articles due this difference it was not possible to consider both the english and the russian language literature in full extent in this article the findings thus reflect the international academic discourse rather than the regional academic discourse nevertheless an indicative review done by the author of articles by central asian and russian authors published in russian did not contradict the trends detected in the english language articles it rather shows an even stronger preoccupation with questions of transboundary water management and hardly any studies on governance as such this article reviews this literature with a view on the three challenges mentioned above it is structured according to the level of governance they address regional transboundary river basins national subnational river basins and local level as i will argue the majority of literature focusses on either the transboundary or the local level articles and books analyse interstate water conflict and cooperation or the implementation of integrated water resources management iwrm and water user associations wua in contrast national level governance and politics remain underresearched 2 transboundary level regional conflict and or cooperation since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 many experts expected conflicts over water in central asia e g 61 66 84 while tensions prevail the central asian successor states have also with the support of donors established the international fund for saving the aral sea ifas and a number of sub ordinated bodies including the interstate commission for water coordination icwc as joint governance arrangements to address the aral sea crisis and jointly manage the transboundary rivers weinthal 80 argued that this cooperation evolved because it helped the internal state building of the young states nevertheless there is also wide consensus that the existing transboundary governance arrangements the regional treaties the joint organizations and their implementation mechanisms are not effective collide with national interests and are not perceived as fair and legitimate by all riparian countries typical explanations of the weakness of ifas and icwc refer to their limited mandates insufficient funding lack of implementation and enforcement mechanisms and lack of impartiality 13 51 33 81 66 74 37 39 the broader narratives on regional water governance vary since tensions between upstream and downstream riparians are largely grounded in the conflict between water use for agriculture downstream countries and water use for energy production upstream countries the water energy nexus and the attempts for a coordinated governance approach to balance different interests are often the main focus most prominently with the 1998 syr darya agreement that worked effectively only for a few years see e g 42 16 some studies look at water cooperation from an economic perspective often applying the benefit sharing approach to central asia antipova et al 11 abbink moller and o hara 1 teasley and mckinney 68 jalilov et al 34 35 soliev et al 63 64 as well as bekchanov bhaduri and ringler 12 focus on potential benefits of water cooperation and develop economic models and recommendations for joint water management however they often leave aside political factors and therefore as djanibekov et al 23 note while all such studies agree that the riparians can increase their collective benefits by working together they fail to explain the current failure of transboundary cooperation for that reason authors like wegerich 76 sojamo 62 menga and mirumachi 45 menga 44 zhupankhan et al 85 and zinzani and menga 93 focus on power asymmetries domestic political interests and hegemonic as well as counter hegemonic strategies they argue that these factors rather than economic costs and benefits can explain who has a stake in current arrangements and why they are difficult to change in a similar vein horsman et al 33 mosello 47 bichsel 17 and krasznai 39 highlight that water conflict and cooperation in central asia is closely interlinked with the broader political context in the region and in the individual countries authors have also studied the role of external actors in fostering cooperation usually with sobering assessments regarding their impact 33 46 80 18 in addition there are also studies that are not specifically focussed on governance but take governance and policy aspects into account when analysing transboundary water allocation or water management issues e g 65 43 here the reference to water cooperation shows awareness of the role of the regional political context without providing much detail or an explicit definition of water governance it is also worth mentioning the literature from the legal side e g 71 72 86 88 41 40 it discusses the legal and institutional frameworks for transboundary governance like international conventions intergovernmental treaties regional organisations and assesses their effectiveness the applicability of international water law and the challenges in their implementation some authors also look at the politics behind certain regional bilateral or national laws regarding transboundary waters and show how different actors interpret international law differently 29 60 38 some authors criticize the preoccupation with region wide agreements and cooperation they argue that analysis of cooperation along small transboundary rivers can give a more differentiated picture of the patterns of transboundary water governance in central asia according to holmatov et al 31 agreements on small transboundary tributaries of the syr darya show effective cooperation also in times of general hydropolitical tensions even though many of the treaties are rather short term also wegerich et al 78 79 pak et al 54 pak and wegerich 53 analyse the governance of small transboundary rivers including a perspective on sub national actors i e how provinces cooperate across borders on a bilateral level the kazakh kyrgyz chu talas water basin commission is often praised as an example of functioning water cooperation in central asia e g 41 however it has also received critical assessment by wegerich 75 77 and zinzani and menga 93 who question the depth and sustainability of collaboration to sum up transboundary conflict and cooperation continue to co exist and have led to a rich literature that assesses the challenges of transboundary water governance in central asia in contrast to tense rhetoric by some politicians and alarmistic reports in media most researchers agree that cooperation has been prevailing over conflict even with changed river runoff due to climate change violent water conflicts in central asia are expected to

change in the agricultural production system dissolution of collective and state farms at local level left a vacuum for the governance of tertiary irrigation channels and decision making on local

have been supporting institutional change in local water governance through projects supporting irrigation management transfer establishment of water user associations wuas 4 4 in uzbekistan the term water consumer association wca is used but the concept is similar and other aspects of iwrm water governance at local level thus has been providing fertile ground to study institutional change the politics of implementation and impacts of donor interventions these questions have probably seen the most and also most diverse research it ranges from applied research focused on further developing

russian but some on changing gender roles in agriculture which also affect local water governance arrangements see for example 48 oberkircher and hornridge 52 as well as hornridge et al 32 take local perceptions and practices as a starting point to analyse water management in the khorezm province in uzbekistan 6 6 interestingly none of these six articles were published in an explicit water journal studying the politics of local implementation of global norms and national policies not only reveals the failure or success of donor driven reforms furthermore the newly constructed wuas provide cases to study different interests actors strategies path dependencies and power relations in a microcosmos in this respect many of these studies have been contributing to a better understanding of the everyday politics of water 6 4 in central asia 4 national level political struggles at national and basin scale abdullaev et al 2 state that the biggest challenges for the water sector in the region come from weak decision making capacities of the state water management organizations and from un coordinated and competing interests of different stakeholders and public actors across all levels of water management since the early 2000s all five countries started to reform their legal frameworks and institutional setup for water management all countries but uzbekistan have adopted a new water code several countries introduced major sectoral reform programmes introducing a basin management approach and reorganising administrative responsibilities often with significant involvement of international donors formerly powerful water ministries have been dissolved and merged with others and in some countries later re established it is obvious that all these reforms have been affecting the power relations among different state agencies as well as between state and non state water organisations the analysis of the politics of these governance reforms is necessary to understand the challenges and ultimate policy outcomes nevertheless the academic literature on the national water governance arrangements in the five countries is limited aminova and abdullaev abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 7 8 as well as abdullaev and atabaeva 3 elaborate on general tendencies in water governance and water politics since independence the changing role of water bureaucracies and the need for seeing water management as a political rather than a technical process yalcin and mollinga 83 analyse the administrative reorganization of the water and agriculture sector in uzbekistan in both the decision making on reforms and their implementation they show how actors within the water bureaucracy made use of their networks and the support of donors to achieve certain structural changes sehring 57 compares the politics of water institutional reform in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan and argues that the neo patrimonial context leads to a co existence of formal and informal water governance

kyrgyzstan wegerich 73 zinzani 89 91 and zinzani and bichsel 92 draw attention to the provincial and basin level when analysing the politics of implementation of the transition from administrative to so called hydrographic water management in uzbekistan and kazakhstan they show how the ultimate delineation of a basin is shaped by power relations and resistance and or re interpretation by local bureaucrats all authors have in common that they show how political water resources management indeed is how strongly it depends on informal institutions and how powerful actors in the state bureaucracies either resist structural reform or use the process to secure or even enhance their position academic research on the national level of water governance is often driven by the question of how global concepts like iwrm or good water governance promoted and implemented by international donors can be effective in the political context of central asia as cassara et al 20 point out at the same time there is a lack of attention to both historically documented regional approaches for self organized water management as well as to new governance mechanisms developed without external intervention and drawing on historical knowledge in this respect social anthropological studies while not focussing on governance per se can contribute to the understanding of water politics and its cultural embeddedness e g 25 67 a good example is féaux de la croix and suyarkulova 26 who analyse how huge dam projects in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan affect state citizen relations and track the difference in the political discourse in both countries through historical and ethnographic research the state with the political decision makers and its bureaucratic apparatus decides on national positions regarding transboundary governance and sets the framework for water governance at subnational basin and local level the past 30 years saw drastic changes regarding national water governance including water sector reforms reshuffling of powerful state agencies and controversial infrastructure projects still there is much less literature on national water politics than there are studies analysing transboundary and local water governance the reasons for this are discussed in the next section 5 discussion the political economy of knowledge production on water governance in central asia this review has shown that academic knowledge production on water governance in central asia is unequally distributed there is considerable research output regarding the transboundary and local levels but much less on national governance and politics one could argue that the national level is embedded in both other levels it is governments that determine foreign policies on transboundary waters and studies on the local level provide accounts of the implementation of national policies nevertheless questions like how and why governments decide on which water policies or how different state non state and international actors are involved or marginalized in decision making remain understudied the focus on implementation of concepts like iwrm basin management and wuas represents a bias on norms knowledge and concepts that came from the global north many of these studies result in firm critique of such concepts and the role of international actors promoting them but still these norms are the starting point of the inquiry there are only few studies on water governance or water politics taking local knowledge and concepts as their starting point agents of change seem to be mainly donors by promoting certain concepts and financing the establishment of certain institutional arrangements while local water users and policy makers appear as resistant to change or as making instrumental use of it in their own interest and i won t exclude my own work from this criticism the neglect of region specific water governance practices might be surprising when thinking of central asia as a region with several thousand years of water governance traditions and distinct water institutions 7 7 many of them like the mirab water master or khashar collective work are in place until today see 2 for an overview it is less surprising when realizing central asia s situatedness in the global political economy of knowledge production funding for water research in central asia comes mainly from national governments and from international research projects the warning of conflicts over transboundary water and the promotion of blueprints for water resources and irrigation management created availability of funding for research some more applied research especially on iwrm and wuas is even being directly funded by donor programmes 8 8 in addition to the academic literature reviewed in this article there is considerable additional output by institutions like the international water management institute iwmi global water partnership gwp unesco the scientific information centre of the interstate commission for water coordination sic icwc or the international crisis group icg published as reports and policy papers this affects not only who has access to funding for research and produces the knowledge lead institution role of foreign and local researchers but also which kind of knowledge is produced and considered relevant the production of knowledge and the institutions where this happens universities research institutes etc are thus part of the politics of water and not separate from it not only are concepts like iwrm wuas or basin management concepts from the global north applied to central asia and many other regions also they are policy concepts and not analytical concepts but many academic studies on water in central asia use them as conceptual terms through this they become normative focussing on failures and shortcomings of central asian water users and policy makers in achieving certain norms that are treated as universal principles this power of global normative water concepts is not particular to central asia it can be observed throughout the global south what seems to be specific to the region is that they are not contested by an alternative discourse built on regionally and or disciplinary developed concepts and terms this can be explained by the specific situation and weakness of social sciences and in particular political science in central asia first during soviet times political science was far away from methodological and theoretical pluralism independent empirical research and open debate and more than technical disciplines isolated from global academic discourses and networks see 69 10 this legacy is still weakening the disciplines that would be necessary and best suited to analyse water governance second not only the past but also the present authoritarian regimes in the region pose restrictions for researching governance in the whole region the framework conditions for empirical political and social research deteriorated considerably in the past years 9 9 in uzbekistan political science was even banned from university curricula for some years critically investigating government politics became a safety risk for researchers in particular for those from the region 10 10 see bekmurzaev et al 14 as well as the final report of the central eurasian studies society cess taskforce on fieldwork safety https www centraleurasia org publications reports and the related discussion on https www opendemocracy net en odr renegade research feaux de la croix and suyarkulova 26 reflect about these restrictions and the ethics of doing field research on big dam projects in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan noteworthy is that the bulk of authors from the region focus either on the local level or on economic models for transboundary issues only very few on politics and issues like national decision making processes in this context producing more academic knowledge on the politics of water at all levels remains important but also calls for a careful awareness what and how to research an open discussion of the constraints and incentives in research would be an important step to uncover the mechanisms that impact the unequal distribution of academic knowledge on water governance in central asia 6 conclusion this article reviewed the academic knowledge produced on water governance in central asia while the analytical concept of water governance as such is not widely used in and on the region considerable research has been done that addresses governance challenges and the politics around water driven by warnings of conflicts over transboundary rivers researchers have shown that conflict and cooperation co exist while most argue that cooperation has been prevailing over conflict the literature also shows the struggles in agreeing on and implementing cooperative agreements depending on the perspective prospects for a long term sustainable regional governance arrangements are either seen in economic benefit sharing models or in more equitable decision making processes among the riparian countries at local level studies of water governance have been providing a fertile ground to better understand institutional change the politics of implementation and the impacts of donor interventions much research has critically engaged with newly formed wuas and has shown that even if they might achieve better water use efficiency resistance by state bureaucrats and local elites prevent the inherent aims of reaching more democratic and transparent governance the few authors who have researched national water governance show the interplay of formal and informal institutions and how powerful actors in the state bureaucracies either resist structural reforms or use the process to secure or enhance their position much of the academic literature is driven by the question how policy concepts from the global north like iwrm or good water governance promoted and implemented through projects by international donors can be effective in the political and socio economic context of central asia a genuine focus on region specific forms of governance as well as on national water politics and governance is underrepresented in the literature being aware of the political economy of knowledge production in central asia can help to explain this the incentives of available funding and the restrictions of authoritarian regimes channel research to focus on topics like transboundary conflict and policy implementation studying the politics of water in central asia cannot be separate from the politics of knowledge production as unequal as voice and authority are distributed in decision making about water as unequal are they distributed in the discourse about it declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20153,after the central asian republics became independent in 1991 the transformation process challenged water governance arrangements at all levels analysis of transboundary water governance has mainly found that cooperation has been prevailing over conflict much research is driven by the question how global concepts like iwrm or good water governance are implemented in the context of central asia studies reveal how their inherent ideas of participation and transparency clash with local realities only few authors have focussed on national water governance their studies show how powerful actors either resist reforms or use them to secure or enhance their positions a genuine focus on region specific forms of water governance as well as on national politics is underrepresented in the literature which is explained with funding policies and the restrictions of the authoritarian political regimes keywords water governance water politics central asia iwrm knowledge production 1 introduction it is a commonplace that many water challenges in central asia are not related to water scarcity but to unsustainable management practices unequal distribution of water among the countries and resulting conflicts of interests this gave ground to calls that analysis of problems and identification of solutions should focus not only on technical aspects but on water governance thus the different institutions rules organizations and their interrelations that affect the use and management of water this article follows zwarteveen et al 94 in the understanding of water governance being about the rules and practices that regulate distribution of water as much as about the distribution of voice and authority in these processes and about the distribution of knowledge and expertise consequently when reviewing the academic literature on water governance in central asia 1 1 with the term central asia this paper refers to the five former soviet republics kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan this paper aims to also critically reflect which kind of knowledge is produced by whom which aspects of water governance are over or under represented and why this is so when the central asian republics of the ussr became independent in 1991 the subsequent transformation process challenged previous water governance arrangements in three main ways 1 with the independence of the countries previously national rivers and the extended interrepublican canal systems became transboundary and the joint water energy management system among the republics stopped functioning 2 2 in soviet times water and energy resources were part of the region s inter republican integrated management system water from the amudarya and syrdarya rivers was stored in upstream reservoirs in the kyrgyz and tajik soviet socialist republics ssrs and supplied to extensive irrigation systems in the downstream kazakh turkmen and uzbek ssrs for agricultural production in exchange oil coal and gas were transferred from downstream to upstream republics in winter and electricity was provided to all through the soviet common electricity net 2 the political transformation from communist rule to regimes ranging between hybrid and strong authoritarian governance as well as the exposure to western discourses and interventions on good governance and democratization led to reforms of the mechanisms of decision making and bureaucratic organisation of the water sector 3 with the economic transformation from planned economy to privatization with varying degrees of state control collective and state farms were dissolved and left a vacuum of responsibility for local water management and canal maintenance these challenges affected in particular water use in agriculture and for energy production and these are also the fields on which this review will focus the discourse on water in central asia is still mainly a discourse on water management and not on governance a russian translation of the term water governance has not been established yet the global water partnership and some researchers use rukovodstvo vody but this is not understood beyond a small group of experts exposed to international discourses often water governance is translated as upravlenie vodnymi resursami which is the same term as used for water management it does not allow for a distinction among the two nevertheless the last two decades have seen a continuing increase of research addressing even if not using the terminology questions of water governance in central asia 3 3 academic literature focussing explicitly on water governance in the analytical meaning used here is very limited for central asia however there is literature on institutional change like the introduction of integrated water resources management iwrm or on transboundary conflict and cooperation it is included in this article when it addresses governance questions the review includes only english language papers in scientific journals and books until very recently russian was the main language of academic research and education in the region and academic knowledge production was based on publishing monographs and books rather than articles due this difference it was not possible to consider both the english and the russian language literature in full extent in this article the findings thus reflect the international academic discourse rather than the regional academic discourse nevertheless an indicative review done by the author of articles by central asian and russian authors published in russian did not contradict the trends detected in the english language articles it rather shows an even stronger preoccupation with questions of transboundary water management and hardly any studies on governance as such this article reviews this literature with a view on the three challenges mentioned above it is structured according to the level of governance they address regional transboundary river basins national subnational river basins and local level as i will argue the majority of literature focusses on either the transboundary or the local level articles and books analyse interstate water conflict and cooperation or the implementation of integrated water resources management iwrm and water user associations wua in contrast national level governance and politics remain underresearched 2 transboundary level regional conflict and or cooperation since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 many experts expected conflicts over water in central asia e g 61 66 84 while tensions prevail the central asian successor states have also with the support of donors established the international fund for saving the aral sea ifas and a number of sub ordinated bodies including the interstate commission for water coordination icwc as joint governance arrangements to address the aral sea crisis and jointly manage the transboundary rivers weinthal 80 argued that this cooperation evolved because it helped the internal state building of the young states nevertheless there is also wide consensus that the existing transboundary governance arrangements the regional treaties the joint organizations and their implementation mechanisms are not effective collide with national interests and are not perceived as fair and legitimate by all riparian countries typical explanations of the weakness of ifas and icwc refer to their limited mandates insufficient funding lack of implementation and enforcement mechanisms and lack of impartiality 13 51 33 81 66 74 37 39 the broader narratives on regional water governance vary since tensions between upstream and downstream riparians are largely grounded in the conflict between water use for agriculture downstream countries and water use for energy production upstream countries the water energy nexus and the attempts for a coordinated governance approach to balance different interests are often the main focus most prominently with the 1998 syr darya agreement that worked effectively only for a few years see e g 42 16 some studies look at water cooperation from an economic perspective often applying the benefit sharing approach to central asia antipova et al 11 abbink moller and o hara 1 teasley and mckinney 68 jalilov et al 34 35 soliev et al 63 64 as well as bekchanov bhaduri and ringler 12 focus on potential benefits of water cooperation and develop economic models and recommendations for joint water management however they often leave aside political factors and therefore as djanibekov et al 23 note while all such studies agree that the riparians can increase their collective benefits by working together they fail to explain the current failure of transboundary cooperation for that reason authors like wegerich 76 sojamo 62 menga and mirumachi 45 menga 44 zhupankhan et al 85 and zinzani and menga 93 focus on power asymmetries domestic political interests and hegemonic as well as counter hegemonic strategies they argue that these factors rather than economic costs and benefits can explain who has a stake in current arrangements and why they are difficult to change in a similar vein horsman et al 33 mosello 47 bichsel 17 and krasznai 39 highlight that water conflict and cooperation in central asia is closely interlinked with the broader political context in the region and in the individual countries authors have also studied the role of external actors in fostering cooperation usually with sobering assessments regarding their impact 33 46 80 18 in addition there are also studies that are not specifically focussed on governance but take governance and policy aspects into account when analysing transboundary water allocation or water management issues e g 65 43 here the reference to water cooperation shows awareness of the role of the regional political context without providing much detail or an explicit definition of water governance it is also worth mentioning the literature from the legal side e g 71 72 86 88 41 40 it discusses the legal and institutional frameworks for transboundary governance like international conventions intergovernmental treaties regional organisations and assesses their effectiveness the applicability of international water law and the challenges in their implementation some authors also look at the politics behind certain regional bilateral or national laws regarding transboundary waters and show how different actors interpret international law differently 29 60 38 some authors criticize the preoccupation with region wide agreements and cooperation they argue that analysis of cooperation along small transboundary rivers can give a more differentiated picture of the patterns of transboundary water governance in central asia according to holmatov et al 31 agreements on small transboundary tributaries of the syr darya show effective cooperation also in times of general hydropolitical tensions even though many of the treaties are rather short term also wegerich et al 78 79 pak et al 54 pak and wegerich 53 analyse the governance of small transboundary rivers including a perspective on sub national actors i e how provinces cooperate across borders on a bilateral level the kazakh kyrgyz chu talas water basin commission is often praised as an example of functioning water cooperation in central asia e g 41 however it has also received critical assessment by wegerich 75 77 and zinzani and menga 93 who question the depth and sustainability of collaboration to sum up transboundary conflict and cooperation continue to co exist and have led to a rich literature that assesses the challenges of transboundary water governance in central asia in contrast to tense rhetoric by some politicians and alarmistic reports in media most researchers agree that cooperation has been prevailing over conflict even with changed river runoff due to climate change violent water conflicts in central asia are expected to be unlikely 15 3 local level global blueprints and local practices like the dissolution of the soviet union required new governance arrangements for transboundary waters and infrastructure so did the change in the agricultural production system dissolution of collective and state farms at local level left a vacuum for the governance of tertiary irrigation channels and decision making on local

politics of water at all levels remains important but also calls for a careful awareness what and how to research an open discussion of the constraints and incentives in research would be an important step to uncover the mechanisms that impact the unequal distribution of academic knowledge on water governance in central asia 6 conclusion this article reviewed the academic knowledge produced on water governance in central asia while the analytical concept of water governance as such is not widely used in and on the region considerable research has been done that addresses governance challenges and the politics around water driven by warnings of conflicts over transboundary rivers researchers have shown that conflict and cooperation co exist while most argue that cooperation has been prevailing over conflict the literature also shows the struggles in agreeing on and implementing cooperative agreements depending on the perspective prospects for a long term sustainable regional governance arrangements are either seen in economic benefit sharing models or in more equitable decision making processes among the riparian countries at local level studies of water governance have been providing a fertile ground to better understand institutional change the politics of implementation and the impacts of donor interventions much research has critically engaged with newly formed wuas and has shown that even if they might achieve better water use efficiency resistance by state bureaucrats and local elites prevent the inherent aims of reaching more democratic and transparent governance the few authors who have researched national water governance show the interplay of formal and informal institutions and how powerful actors in the state bureaucracies either resist structural reforms or use the process to secure or enhance their position much of the academic literature is driven by the question how policy concepts from the global north like iwrm or good water governance promoted and implemented through projects by international donors can be effective in the political and socio economic context of central asia a genuine focus on region specific forms of governance as well as on national water politics and governance is underrepresented in the literature being aware of the political economy of knowledge production in central asia can help to explain this the incentives of available funding and the restrictions of authoritarian regimes channel research to focus on topics like transboundary conflict and policy implementation studying the politics of water in central asia cannot be separate from the politics of knowledge production as unequal as voice and authority are distributed in decision making about water as unequal are they distributed in the discourse about it declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20154,in 1994 former president of mexico carlos salinas de gortari inaugurated el cuchillo reservoir to transfer up to 10 m3 s from the lower san juan river to the city of monterrey a major mexican metropolis since 1989 three agreements have been developed to finance construct and operate the el cuchillo project to benefit monterrey and compensate the farmers in the downstream irrigation district this study reviews the agreements and lessons from implementation experience after 25 years since the project s inauguration the el cuchillo demonstrates that water reallocation needs to be designed and assessed within a regional perspective to identify measure and share the costs and benefits of reallocation between rural and urban regions this case study shows the need to compensate the region not the individual keywords water reallocation mexico monterrey el cuchillo dam compensation 1 introduction a global review of rural urban water reallocation found mexico among the top five countries with nine projects serving guadalajara hermosillo mexico city and monterrey 19 the review relies on english language sources and therefore constitutes a lower bound estimate as such mexico is a the leading edge of a now global challenge of responding to competition between cities and agriculture over water in a context of rapid urbanisation 15 20 mexico s experience with rural to urban reallocation has contributed several insights to global observers first water reallocation occurs in many forms in hermosillo scott and pablos 36 found that the city secured water from surrounding rural areas through multiple projects involving different types of water both groundwater and surface water and different institutional and infrastructure systems ranging from conversion of agricultural water use to urban uses through land use change to reservoir reoperations and new pipelines for importing water these diverse forms of water reallocation involve different political financial and environmental implications and therefore different means of compensation second mexico has relied primarily although not exclusively on administrative procedures rather than court decisions markets or community decisions to regulate and enforce reallocation projects in mexico city for example the lerma project involved new infrastructure and a set of administrative decisions to secure water from rural regions to support the urban population 42 mexico has faced growing political pressure to respond to the concerns voiced by rural communities through negotiation and compensation which reflects wider global trends monterrey has growing experience with water reallocation thus this metropolis is an important international example because it incorporates multiple forms of compensation to respond to rural concerns this finding is consistent with the global and regional understanding of compensation approaches discussed by dai et al 14 in 1994 former president of mexico carlos salinas inaugurated el cuchillo reservoir to transfer water from the lower san juan river to the metropolitan area of monterrey mma a 108 kilometre aqueduct delivers up to 5 m3 s from el cuchillo to the mma contributing approximately 20 of the water supply for a metropolis that has increased from a population of 300 000 in 1950 to over four and a half million today monterrey is a rapidly growing semiarid urban center in northern mexico which is strategically important due to its economic significance and role as a hub of international trade the major purpose of this article is to assess the long term impacts of the el cuchillo dam on water allocation in the san juan river basin and the role played by compensation the us 759 million project 2019 dollars up from an original budgeted of us 650 was financed by the inter american development bank idb the overseas economic cooperation fund oecf japan and mexican government including both state and federal sources 30 31 25 el cuchillo dam has enhanced urban water security increasing daily water supply from 15 h day in 1993 to continuous coverage by 1997 despite a period of intense drought that coincided with its filling 27 39 irrigation development predated the dam however requiring a set of agreements to reallocate water from downstream agriculture to the city and to devise compensation mechanisms to offset the initial decrease in water supply reliability experienced by agricultural communities this paper is structured into six parts after this introduction the second centres on methods the third addresses a basic framework for water management in mexico and the reallocation path focusing on the three agreements that enabled the construction of el cuchillo the fourth deals with benefits and compensation section fifth is about key lessons section sixth concludes 2 methods 2 1 the interviews the analysis of this case study draws on interviews archival records agreements meeting minutes and media coverage academic literature and primary data including water deliveries and compensation records twelve interviews were conducted from february to april 2017 to include perspectives and perceptions of former nuevo león governors 3 high officials from the national water agency conagua 4 including a director general and two sub directors water managers from monterrey 2 and the irrigation district 026 id 026 3 the interview guide sought to elicit reflections from these actors about key issues of the reallocation process emphasising the ex post perspective see table 1 2 2 context drivers and goals 2 2 1 el cuchillo reservoir and monterrey iv programme the rapid expansion of the mma was the main driver behind the construction of el cuchillo dam monterrey struggled to meet increasing water demand and relied on heavy rains or hurricanes to periodically fill up its reservoirs shortages in the 1980s caused profound social and political unrest 5 6 41 the construction of cerro prieto dam inaugurated in 1984 as well as a distribution programme called water for all helped to address the water crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s which was felt mostly among the less well off 17 el cuchillo was constructed as part of the monterrey iv programme of water resource development comprising the fourth loan from the inter american development bank to provide a comprehensive response to monterrey s water problems 1 3 el cuchillo drains water from the san juan river basin a major tributary of the rio bravo grande river basin the programme contained multiple projects and a long term financial arrangement the projects included the dam with a capacity of 1123 million m3 a 108 kilometre pipeline from the municipality of china nuevo león to monterrey the extension of a major potable water plant in monterrey the construction of three treatment plants and the construction of additional distribution and sanitation infrastructure within the metropolitan area the aqueduct was developed initially to convey 5 m3 s to monterrey with an additional 5 m3 s planned but never added el cuchillo dam was the flagship of monterrey iv it forms 20 of the average annual water supply in monterrey as part of a regional water supply system that also includes groundwater two other reservoir systems serving monterrey la boca and cerro prieto and the marte r gómez mrg reservoir for downstream agriculture las blancas dam was later constructed in part as a compensation dam to increase supply reliability for irrigation reliant on lower san juan water fig 1 the project was justified by its contributions to efficient water distribution in the san juan river 22 it also fit the three goals established by the salinas administration to develop and finance large infrastructure projects with a mix of public and private finance 8 24 el cuchillo s reallocation process can be understood and analyzed within a systemic regional context the latter involves a complex set of interactions between and within sectors and across the three levels of government federal state and local 1 35 3 the inclusion in the analysis of upstream and downstream users and its association with the hydrological and climate conditions is a clear example of the systemic nature needed to better understand the issues at hand 27 moreover the el cuchillo involved the reallocation of physical volumes of water of different sources and qualities drinking water and treated water and in different directions from el cuchillo to monterrey from monterrey to mrg and from mrg to id 026 there are also financial flows in different parts of this system 2 2 2 recipient and donor regions monterrey the recipient region is a major metropolis in mexico it is at the heart of u s mexico trade and supports a vibrant manufacturing and service industry 21 therefore security of water supply to this metropolis is a matter of national interest monterrey receives its water from servicios de agua y drenaje sadm a public utility established in 1956 to provide water to the mma the growth of the city and its increasing water needs have created tensions with downstream agricultural producers in irrigation district 026 hereafter id 026 which became a donor region when el cuchillo reduced deliveries to the district from the san juan river particularly during the filling of the dam in the 1990s irrigation district 026 the donor region in the state of tamaulipas was established in 1939 in a period of strong rural development policy in mexico the irrigation district is located within the san juan river basin 13 the district has long been a national priority and attracted infrastructure investment and modernization highlighted by the construction of the mrg dam in 1936 near the confluence of the lower san juan river and the rio bravo 33 the location of the district in the lower río bravo and near the end of a binational basin that begins far to the northwest provides a geographical setting full of complexities such as the dependence on upstream waters and the often conflicting binational arena 3 water management in mexico and the reallocation path 3 1 water management in mexico the construction of el cuchillo 1989 1993 coincided with a period of significant institutional reform in mexico in 1989 conagua was established as the national water agency with jurisdiction over water resource development planning and allocation the national water law of 1992 represented a significant effort to decentralize water management including the restructuring of the irrigation sector and the provision of urban services 24 28 more responsibilities were transferred to water users including efforts to develop public private partnerships and to strengthen participation in water resource management decision making urban water services which are constitutionally the responsibility of local government were organized within state wide commissions and encouraged to involve the private sector these institutional reforms occurred three years after the formation of conagua which included a strong national role in water management decisions the 1992 law called for the establishment of basin councils to involve stakeholders in planning and management decisions in 1995 water licences were established through a national registration process with limited coordination with local users and prior to the formation of the councils causing difficulties later in the execution of agreements and compensation mechanisms in relation to the el cuchillo project unlike other cases in mexico involving water transfers the story of el cuchillo shows that reallocation of water can lead to overall positive results with all the avenues for improvement that certainly have the distinct compensation mechanisms that have been designed have reduced the number and scale of conflicts over water sharing this distinct character of el cuchillo has not been present in the relatively recent dispute in hermosillo in the northwestern state of sonora over the 150 km independence aqueduct which has confornted this major city with ciudad obregón and its agricultural area 37 the more traditional case of mexico city and the cutzamala project a provider of one fourth of the water this metropolis consumption 26 40 or the supply of water to guadalajara and the rio lerma 7 11 are cases in point 3 2 the reallocation path 3 2 1 phase i the early studies the dam site was studied as early as the 1920s and initially considered for its potential contribution to regional irrigation development 1 16 in 1952 a presidential accord granted id 026 the right to use the water from the san juan upstream of mrg dam this commitment would become the basis for the irrigators opposition to el cuchillo at the end of the 1970s monterreýs drinking water supply had become a state and national concern 32 10 34 41 17 12 within this context cerro prieto dam was built bringing water 130 km to the city the reservoir inaugurated on july 27 1984 was regarded as the project of the century it was soon discovered that this dam was not sufficient to solve the citýs future water problems despite its benefits 3 2 2 phase ii construction and negotiation el cuchillo agreements 1989 to 1996 3 2 2 1 the 1989 agreement and monterrey iv programme in 1989 an intergovernmental agreement between the federal government and nuevo león paved the way for el cuchillo the special coordination agreement for undertaking and operation of monterrey iv project initiated a series of works between 1990 and 1994 it is striking that the tamaulipas government and farmers did not take part in this agreement despite the projected impacts on id 026 interviews suggested two possible reasons for the exclusion of the tamaulipas government and farmers 1 farmers did not know about the agreement or 2 they knew about it but expected the 1952 presidential accord to prevail and safeguard their water from upstream development it also seems the political influence of nuevo león over president salinas was so strong there was no need to consult the neighboring state it was often expressed that president salinas always felt an inclination for nuevo león his former family on his fatheŕs side was from this state 3 2 2 2 the 1990 agreement opposition to the 1989 agreement from tamaulipas triggered the 1990 special coordination agreement for the use of san juan basin waters 2 the 1990 agreement shared the waters from the project based on negotiations between the national government nuevo león and tamaulipas governments ensuring that monterrey receives up to 10 m3 s in two stages while preserving water requirements in the id 026 the loan of the iadb to mexico was signed at the end of 1990 to finance the construction of el cuchillo originally the total cost of the project was estimated at us 650 million 30 25 the iadb contributed with half of this us 180 million were loaned to sadm and us 145 to the federal government via the national water commission mexico federal government nuevo león government and sadm covered the other us 325 million out of this total us 50 million were loaned by the overseas economic cooperation fund oecf japan to sadm the breakdown of this financing is important to give light to the dispute to come between nuevo leon and tamaulipas the commitments of the 1990 agreement proved difficult to deliver the agreement made a major omission the legal and illegal water users along the pesquería river which carries monterrey s treated wastewater to the san juan river the latteŕs eventual destination is mrg which serves the irrigation water needs of id 026 this situation was compounded by national decisions to regularise water use by establishing in 1995 and 1996 a system of water licences the presidential decrees spurred claims for concessions along the 172 km stretch of the rio pesqueria 3 2 2 3 the 1996 agreement and la guerra del agua the filling of el cuchillo coincided with drought conditions compounding its impacts on downstream irrigators 27 the associated political conflict triggered the development of a new 1996 operational agreement to share the waters of the san juan and design compensation mechanisms to offset the impacts on id 026 the negotiations became contentious and led to disputes described as la guerra del agua or water war 9 the drought and dam filling stoked the simmering tensions associated with tamaulipas exclusion from the 1989 agreement construction and financing and the limited guarantees to preserve the water supply for id 026 as identified in the 1990 agreement distribution of waters 29 in response to these disputes a new accord was signed on november 13 1996 in mexico city by the governor of nuevo león conagua and two thirds of the id 026 farmers the agreement required a delicate political engagement to secure the participation of the farmers the 1996 agreement made formal commitment to share water from el cuchillo between mma and id 026 and to compensate the latter there were requirements for mma to deliver treated wastewater to the id026 at mrg these commitments included among other initiatives the construction of an aqueduct to convey treated water from monterrey to mrg funded by nuevo león and the federal government the delivery capacity of this pipeline would be of 8 m3 s 250 m3 yr a minimum of 6 m3 s or 189 million m3 yr would reach the reservoir though the pipeline was not built the commitment of delivering the minimum volume of 6 m3 s was essential for the government of tamaulipas and id 026 to sign the accord 3 2 3 phase iii implementation and compensation the 1996 agreement was disputed almost immediately 16 2 35 the id 026 farmers focussed their requests on three aspects of the benefit sharing from el cuchillo i direct water transfers from el cuchillo to mrg ii deliveries of the treated wastewater from mma to mrg and iii supplemental compensation for deficits in wastewater delivery this compensation was designed in conjunction with the federal government the state of nuevo león and the state of tamaulipas and basically consisted in a financial amount determined by the value of harvest forgone revisiting these experiences many views have softened demonstrating the need to assess perceptions against the long term realities and impacts of the project fig 2 describes the change in water flows associated with el cuchillo and its water sharing agreements more details about these flows are given further below 4 benefit sharing and compensation the global experience with water reallocation suggests several sources of distributional conflicts including issues of water rights ownership the role of informal water users the perceptions of waste and water use efficiency in both the donor and recipient regions and the level of trust in the data used for monitoring and enforcement the monterrey experience illustrates each of these issues with hindsight it is possible to contrast expectations and realities in regard to costs benefits and their distribution over time monterrey has clearly benefited from el cuchillo dam which has sustained the population and economic growth of the mma waters from this dam have been crucial for overcoming water shortages that took place in the 1980s when the city had water for 4 to 8 h per day these volumes also provided a more robust portfolio of sources from groundwater to surface water and enhanced possibilities for source management to respond to droughts and other circumstances that could compromise specific sources groundwater was the city s major source of water until the mid 1960s when la boca reservoir began supplying water to monterrey el cuchillo has supplied on average one fifth of monterrey s water since 1994 the contribution of el cuchillo to mma has averaged 2 5 m3 s over the 1994 2015 period approximately half of the 5 m3 s authorized el cuchillo helped the city increase water supply from 8 h day in 1992 to 24 h day in 1997 despite mounting drought pressure the impacts of el cuchillo on id 026 are hard to assess and require distinguishing short term and long term impacts there are multiple factors to consider as the dam is part of a multi flow system which involves physical volumes of water as well as financial flows to the district at first assessment irrigation activity has declined in the district fig 3 shows the area of harvested land for the period 1963 2014 there seems to be an influence from el cuchillo in this decline until the agricultural year 1991 1992 it was common to see levels above 80 000 ha in two cycles autumn winter and spring summer the cycle of 1993 1994 which coincides with the opening of el cuchillo appears to mark a new trend in the mid 1990s harvested land declined below 60 000 ha after this initial decline irrigated area recovered approaching 70 000 ha the volumes allocated to the district and agricultural output follow a similar pattern figs 4 and 5 an apparent decline while el cuchillo filled coupled with the presence of the drought of the early and mid 1990s followed by a marked recovery the work of sisto 38 assessing the performance of the district for the period 1972 2002 is consistent with our findings overall it does not appear the dam has had a devastating effect on id 026 in fact as fig 4 shows the district recovered the level of volumes it had in pre cuchillo times this pattern is even clearer in the case of agricultural production fig 5 on the other hand it is well known in mexico that there is relatively plenty of room for efficiencies in the use of agricultural water 4 this has long been demonstrated for the id 026 38 these elements are useful to place in context the impacts of el cuchillo dam downstream on the id 26 however extreme care needs to be taken when interpreting this last trend of agricultural production data refers to aggregate output all crops and this unmask the fact that farmers have reacted to water scarcity in different ways a common practice is to shift from maize to sorghum which is more resistant to droughts this is what happened in the drought of the 1990s after the drought maize became again the main crop yield varies according to crops in addition to the availability of water the decision to which crop cultivate also depends on the prices of them in the national and international markets in addition to these issues the district has received federal and state government support to modernize its infrastructure and irrigation practices the assessment of benefit sharing and compensation to the irrigation district requires a focus on three flows of water 1 transfers from mrg the main source of water for the district 2 transfers from el cuchillo to mrg and 3 transfers of treated wastewater to mrg in the initial years transfers from mrg to id 026 were impacted by the combined effect of el cuchilllós filling and the drought of the 1990s which resulted in low volumes of water storage at mrg during those years scott 2007 reports a marked decline in inflows to mrg in the 10 years after the project 434 6 mm3 compared with the 60 year average prior to the project 883 2 mm3 with withdrawals declining proportionally in the post drought period the levels of mrg and the volumes allocated to the district recovered as shown in fig 4 the reservoir also reflects the intense drought period of 2010 after hurricane alex and 2013 before hurricane ingrid hit the san juan basin illustrating the effect of climate variability and the importance of incorporating climate risk into the assessment the transfer of water from el cuchillo to mrg was a key component of the 1996 agreement to support the id 026 with the exception of the conflicts of the 1996 1997 period data provided by the national water commission indicate that these transfers have become normal practice averaging 237 mm3 per year excluding an extraordinary transfer of 2355 9 mm3 to address hurricane alex in 2010 fig 6 transfers have only been constrained during dry years when no water has been sent to mrg including 1998 1999 2002 and 2007 there have been years in which more than one transfer has occurred some of these transfers have to do with flood control management illustrating the benefits to the farmers associated with el cuchillo hurricane alex which hit the basin in 2010 is a case in point over 2 400 million cubic metres had to be released from el cuchillo dam over a few days in july to protect both the dam and the population and economic activities downstream substantial deliveries of treated wastewater have occurred in 18 of the 22 years since 1995 these deliveries have been above the minimum volume agreed before conveyance losses fig 7 interceptions by farmers along the rio pesqueria and natural losses have meant that the agreed volumes have not always been received 35 historic data of water discharges into the pesquería illustrate a clear increasing trend of water discharged from mma yet the volume that reaches the mrg reservoir is just enough to comply with the 1996 reference of 189 million cubic metres per year the volume of missing water along the 172 kilometre stretch of the rio pesquería has set the basis for compensation how much water reaches the reservoir is a matter of controversy and disputes between the governments of nuevo león tamaulipas and the federal level there is consensus however about the role played by interceptions the financing of the whole programme that paved the way for el cuchillo known as monterrey iv was also a matter of controversy and misunderstanding during the guerra del agua there were voices in nuevo león that opposed sharing el cuchillo s waters because of the perception that the state had financed the entire project however the dam was financed by the federal government while the aqueduct was funded principally by the state of nuevo leon water and sanitation utility sadm still today many people do not know about the financial sources of the programme and believe wrongly that the state and city paid for all the works associated with it 3 revisiting the el cuchillo project illustrates the difficulty of separating benefits and costs the forgoing analysis demonstrates that most actors benefited over the long term but that benefits were not shared equally fair compensation has long been a matter for concern 23 the economic implications of benefit sharing arrangements can be summarized as follows monterrey was the relatively clear winner but mma and sadm also bore substantial costs in its contributions to financing the project irrigation district 026 was a loser in the short term and the impacts were compounded by drought but the district gained over the long term due to regulation capacity volumes of treated water form the mma flood control benefits and commitments to offset the effects of the transfer through compensation mmás commitment to return treated wastewater flows to the mrg dam was a critical form of compensation supplemental compensation to irrigation district 026 came in multiple forms including payments for deficits in treated wastewater a compensation dam las blancas and investments in irrigation efficiency improvements all of these mechanisms have been in place though the farmers dispute the figures about the volumes of treated waters that finally reach marte r gómez dam las blancas dam to supply id 026 was inaugurated in 2000 interviews revealed a strong perception that compensation should support the region not the individual in other words compensation should address and aim to offset the negative impacts of reallocation for those directly affected by the loss of water as well as those indirectly impacted throughout the region through economic activity and sectors linked to agricultural productivity farmers also care about who pays the compensation not only the amount reflecting the ethos that beneficiaries should pay in this context several stakeholders in tamaulipas believe that the state of nuevo león should pay not the federal government through conagua 5 key lessons learned this retrospective assessment of the el cuchillo project and its evolution illustrates a series of lessons about what drove the reallocation how it worked whether it was effective and what were the compensation mechanisms today el cuchillo dam is of crucial relevance for sustaining the socioeconomic health of the san juan basin after almost 25 years there are significant and illustrative policy lessons for the region mexico and international observers which can broadly be summarized as follows reallocation needs to be designed and assessed in a systemic regional context water reallocation is part of a water system and cannot be assessed without recognizing connections between reallocation projects and other water sources this has long been known in the basin 34 from a systems long term perspective the water reallocation contributed to multiple goals and delivered benefits for most key actors furthermore the role of the 1990s drought needs to be considered in this assessment the design and negotiation process for agreements matter central messages include 1 agreements need to take into account wider institutional arrangements and systems of water rights 18 2 informal rules can be important such as those governing compensation under annex 5 of the 1996 agreement which contained a comprehensive draft for the sharing of the san juan river basin waters including a set of rules governing compensation 3 the need to account for the effects of drought in the project s water sharing arrangements and compensation mechanisms 4 the need for a coordinating body to generate robust third party measurement resolve conflicts optimise water sharing arrangements and implement the agreement and 5 monitoring and enforcement of the reallocation agreement must be clearly defined and implemented compensation should focus on the region not only the individual reduced harvests impact the regional economy requiring compensation to be linked with regional development considerations farmers also care that the beneficiary of the reallocated water the city pays not just that they get paid robust data and water accounting are needed to ensure fair transparent timely and predictable compensation drought can magnify the negative effects of reallocation drought had a dual role drought was a trigger for the construction of the project and tipped the balance for the project when considered in the context of monterrey s long term water supply needs 39 however it also affected the implementation of the project due to the onset of a severe drought as the dam began filling reallocation is a political process effective forums for political negotiation and communication matter politics is an inherent part of reallocation showing the importance of effective negotiation processes and the participation of key actors early enough el cuchillo would not have been built without the aid of the federal government it is widely recognized the role president salinas 1988 1994 had in both the decision to go ahead with the project and its financing effective communication also matters as a means of pre empting or counteracting misinformation biases and distorted media coverage in the end it must be recognized that reallocation is a dynamic process with learning and additional stages phases 6 concluding remarks this contribution revisits el cuchillo 25 years after its inauguration to distil the lessons learned from the project and its implementation the drought of the mid 1990s coincided with the filling of the dam and exacerbated the effects of the water transfer on the downstream farmers notwithstanding the expectations that the reallocation of water from the san juan river to monterrey would threaten the viability of the downstream farmers the project is now seen as integral to the regional water supply for both the mma and the farmers the project illustrates the complexities of water reallocation from agriculture to urban uses in a regional context in some circles there was and still is the view that agricultural users lost with this deal against a large and economically powerful metropolis but there are other views that see the water sharing agreements as a win win situation although some gained more than others the main lesson from el cuchillo is that water reallocation needs to be designed and assessed in a regional context using a systems perspective to track the changing costs benefits and mechanisms for sharing them doing so requires well designed agreements including processes for including affected stakeholders compensation schemes that focus on the region not only the individual losses robust and transparent water accounting to inform implementation and appropriate coordination bodies to resolve conflicts in monterrey the project s development and implementation have shaped prospects and debates about the region s water future beyond mexico the experience of el cuchillo speaks specifically to those regions where urban development is upstream of agriculture projects are developed in the context of drought and treated wastewater is integrated into the project s compensation mechanisms acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the support of the world bank to this research 
20154,in 1994 former president of mexico carlos salinas de gortari inaugurated el cuchillo reservoir to transfer up to 10 m3 s from the lower san juan river to the city of monterrey a major mexican metropolis since 1989 three agreements have been developed to finance construct and operate the el cuchillo project to benefit monterrey and compensate the farmers in the downstream irrigation district this study reviews the agreements and lessons from implementation experience after 25 years since the project s inauguration the el cuchillo demonstrates that water reallocation needs to be designed and assessed within a regional perspective to identify measure and share the costs and benefits of reallocation between rural and urban regions this case study shows the need to compensate the region not the individual keywords water reallocation mexico monterrey el cuchillo dam compensation 1 introduction a global review of rural urban water reallocation found mexico among the top five countries with nine projects serving guadalajara hermosillo mexico city and monterrey 19 the review relies on english language sources and therefore constitutes a lower bound estimate as such mexico

of mexico carlos salinas inaugurated el cuchillo reservoir to transfer water from the lower san juan river to the metropolitan area of monterrey mma a 108 kilometre aqueduct delivers up to 5 m3 s from el cuchillo to the mma contributing approximately 20 of the water supply for a metropolis that has increased from a population of 300 000 in 1950 to over four and a half million today monterrey is a rapidly growing semiarid urban center in northern mexico which is strategically important due to its economic significance and role as a hub of international trade the major purpose of this article is to assess the long term impacts of the el cuchillo dam on water allocation in the san juan river basin and the role played by compensation the us 759 million project 2019 dollars up from an original

decrease in water supply reliability experienced by agricultural communities this paper is structured into six parts after this introduction the second centres on methods the third addresses a basic framework for water management in mexico and the reallocation path focusing on the three agreements that enabled the construction of el cuchillo the fourth deals with benefits and compensation section fifth is about key lessons section sixth concludes 2 methods 2 1 the interviews the analysis of this case study draws on interviews archival records agreements meeting minutes and media coverage academic literature and primary data including water deliveries and compensation records twelve interviews were conducted from february to april 2017 to include perspectives and perceptions of former nuevo león governors 3 high officials from the national water agency conagua 4 including a director general and two sub directors water managers from monterrey 2 and the irrigation district 026 id 026 3 the interview guide sought to elicit reflections from these actors about key issues of the reallocation process emphasising the ex post perspective see table 1 2 2 context drivers and goals 2 2 1 el cuchillo reservoir and monterrey iv programme the rapid expansion of the mma was the main driver behind the construction of el cuchillo dam monterrey struggled to meet increasing water demand and relied on heavy rains or hurricanes to periodically fill up its reservoirs shortages in the 1980s caused profound social and political unrest 5 6 41 the construction of cerro prieto dam inaugurated in 1984 as well as a distribution programme called water for all helped to address the water crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s which was felt mostly among the less well off 17 el cuchillo was constructed as part of the monterrey iv programme of water resource development comprising the fourth loan from the inter american development bank to provide a comprehensive response to monterrey s water problems 1 3 el cuchillo drains water from the san juan river basin a major tributary of the rio bravo grande river basin the programme contained multiple projects and a long term financial arrangement the projects included the dam with a capacity of 1123 million m3 a 108 kilometre pipeline from the municipality of china nuevo león to monterrey the extension of a major potable water plant in monterrey the construction of three treatment plants and the construction of additional distribution and sanitation infrastructure within the metropolitan area the aqueduct was developed initially to convey 5 m3 s to monterrey with an additional 5 m3 s planned but never added el cuchillo dam was the flagship of monterrey iv it forms 20 of the average annual water supply in monterrey as part of a regional water supply system that also includes groundwater two other reservoir systems serving monterrey la boca and cerro prieto and the marte r gómez mrg reservoir for downstream agriculture las blancas dam was later constructed in part as a compensation dam to increase supply reliability for irrigation reliant on lower san juan water fig 1 the project was justified by its contributions to efficient water distribution in the san juan river 22 it also fit the three goals established by the salinas administration to develop and finance large infrastructure projects with a mix of public and private finance 8 24 el cuchillo s reallocation process can be understood and analyzed within a systemic regional context the latter involves a complex set of interactions between and within sectors and across the three levels of government federal state and local 1 35 3 the inclusion in the analysis of upstream and downstream users and its association with the hydrological and climate conditions is a clear example of the systemic nature needed to better understand the issues at hand 27 moreover the el cuchillo involved the reallocation of physical volumes of water of different sources and qualities drinking water and treated water and in different directions from el cuchillo to monterrey from monterrey to mrg and from mrg to id 026 there are also financial flows in different parts of this system 2 2 2 recipient and donor regions monterrey the recipient region is a major metropolis in mexico it is at the heart of u s mexico trade and supports a vibrant manufacturing and service industry 21 therefore security of water supply to this metropolis is a matter of national interest monterrey receives its water from servicios de agua y drenaje sadm a public utility established in 1956 to provide water to the mma the growth of the city and its increasing water needs have created tensions with downstream agricultural producers in irrigation district 026 hereafter id 026 which became a donor region when el cuchillo reduced deliveries to the district from the san juan river particularly during the filling of the dam in the 1990s irrigation district 026 the donor region in the state of tamaulipas was established in 1939 in a period of strong rural development policy in mexico the irrigation district is located within the san juan river basin 13 the district has long been a national priority and attracted infrastructure investment and modernization highlighted by the construction of the mrg dam in 1936 near the confluence of the lower san juan river and the rio bravo 33 the location of the district in the lower río bravo and near the end of a binational basin that begins far to the northwest provides a geographical setting full of complexities such as the dependence on upstream waters and the often conflicting binational arena 3 water management in mexico and the reallocation path 3 1 water management in mexico the construction of el cuchillo 1989 1993 coincided with a period of significant institutional reform in mexico in 1989 conagua was established as the national water agency with jurisdiction over water resource development planning and allocation the national water law of 1992 represented a significant effort to decentralize water management including the restructuring of the irrigation sector and the provision of urban services 24 28 more responsibilities were transferred to water users including efforts to develop public private partnerships and to strengthen participation in water resource management decision making urban water services which are constitutionally the responsibility of local government were organized within state wide commissions and encouraged to involve the private sector these institutional reforms occurred three years after the formation of conagua which included a strong national role in water management decisions the 1992 law called for the establishment of basin councils to involve stakeholders in planning and management decisions in 1995 water licences were established through a national registration process with limited coordination with local users and prior to the formation of the councils causing difficulties later in the execution of agreements and compensation mechanisms in relation to the el cuchillo project unlike other cases in mexico involving water transfers the story of el cuchillo shows that reallocation of water can lead to overall positive results with all the avenues for improvement that certainly have the distinct compensation mechanisms that have been designed have reduced the number and scale of conflicts over water sharing this distinct character of el cuchillo has not been present in the relatively recent dispute in hermosillo in the northwestern state of sonora over the 150 km independence aqueduct which has confornted this major city with ciudad obregón and its agricultural area 37 the more traditional case of mexico city and the cutzamala project a provider of one fourth of the water this metropolis consumption 26 40 or the supply of water to guadalajara and the rio lerma 7 11 are cases in point 3 2 the reallocation path 3 2 1 phase i the early studies the dam site was studied as early as the 1920s and initially considered for its potential contribution to regional irrigation development 1 16 in 1952 a presidential accord granted id 026 the right to use the water from the san juan upstream of mrg dam this commitment would become the basis for the irrigators opposition to el cuchillo at the end of the 1970s monterreýs drinking water supply had become a state and national concern 32 10 34 41 17 12 within this context cerro prieto dam was built bringing water 130 km to the city the reservoir inaugurated on july 27 1984 was regarded as the project of the century it was soon discovered that this dam was not sufficient to solve the citýs future water problems despite its benefits 3 2 2 phase ii construction and negotiation el cuchillo agreements 1989 to 1996 3 2 2 1 the 1989 agreement and monterrey iv programme in 1989 an intergovernmental agreement between the federal government and nuevo león paved the way for el cuchillo the special coordination agreement for undertaking and operation of monterrey iv project initiated a series of works between 1990 and 1994 it is striking that the tamaulipas government and farmers did not take part in this agreement despite the projected impacts on id 026 interviews suggested two possible reasons for the exclusion of the tamaulipas government and farmers 1 farmers did not know about the agreement or 2 they knew about it but expected the 1952 presidential accord to prevail and safeguard their water from upstream development it also seems the political influence of nuevo león over president salinas was so strong there was no need to consult the neighboring state it was often expressed that president salinas always felt an inclination for nuevo león his former family on his fatheŕs side was from this state 3 2 2 2 the 1990 agreement opposition to the 1989 agreement from tamaulipas triggered the 1990 special coordination agreement for the use of san juan basin waters 2 the 1990 agreement shared the waters from the project based on negotiations between the national government nuevo león and tamaulipas governments ensuring that monterrey receives up to 10 m3 s in two stages while preserving water requirements in the id 026 the loan of the iadb to mexico was signed at the end of 1990 to finance the construction of el cuchillo originally the total cost of the project was estimated at us 650 million 30 25 the iadb contributed with half of this us 180 million were loaned to sadm and us 145 to the federal government via the national water commission mexico federal government nuevo león government and sadm covered the other us 325 million out of this total us 50 million were loaned by the overseas economic cooperation fund oecf japan to sadm the breakdown of this financing is important to give light to the dispute to come between nuevo leon and tamaulipas the commitments of the 1990 agreement proved difficult to deliver the agreement made a major omission the legal and illegal water users along the pesquería river which carries monterrey s treated wastewater to the san juan river the latteŕs eventual destination is mrg which serves the irrigation water needs of id 026 this situation was compounded by national decisions to regularise water use by establishing in 1995 and 1996 a system of water licences the presidential decrees spurred claims for concessions along the 172 km stretch of the rio pesqueria 3 2 2 3 the 1996 agreement and la guerra del agua the filling of el cuchillo coincided with drought conditions compounding its impacts on downstream irrigators 27 the associated political conflict triggered the development of a new 1996 operational agreement to share the waters of the san juan and design compensation mechanisms to offset the impacts on id 026 the negotiations became contentious and led to disputes described as la guerra del agua or water war 9 the drought and dam filling stoked the simmering tensions associated with tamaulipas exclusion from the 1989 agreement construction and financing and the limited guarantees to preserve the water supply for id 026 as identified in the 1990 agreement distribution of waters 29 in response to these disputes a new accord was signed on november 13 1996 in mexico city by the governor of nuevo león conagua and two thirds of the id 026 farmers the agreement required a delicate political engagement to secure the participation of the farmers the 1996 agreement made formal commitment to share water from el cuchillo between mma and id 026 and to compensate the latter there were requirements for mma to deliver treated wastewater to the id026 at mrg these commitments included among other initiatives the construction of an aqueduct to convey treated water from monterrey to mrg funded by nuevo león and the federal government the delivery capacity of this pipeline would be of 8 m3 s 250 m3 yr a minimum of 6 m3 s or 189 million m3 yr would reach the reservoir though the pipeline was not built the commitment of delivering the minimum volume of 6 m3 s was essential for the government of tamaulipas and id 026 to sign the accord 3 2 3 phase iii implementation and compensation the 1996 agreement was disputed almost immediately 16 2 35 the id 026 farmers focussed their requests on three aspects of the benefit sharing from el cuchillo i direct water transfers from el cuchillo to mrg ii deliveries of the treated wastewater from mma to mrg and iii supplemental compensation for deficits in wastewater delivery this compensation was designed in conjunction with the federal government the state of nuevo león and the state of tamaulipas and basically consisted in a financial amount determined by the value of harvest forgone revisiting these experiences many views have softened demonstrating the need to assess perceptions against the long term realities and impacts of the project fig 2 describes the change in water flows associated with el cuchillo and its water sharing agreements more details about these flows are given further below 4 benefit sharing and compensation the global experience with water reallocation suggests several sources of distributional conflicts including issues of water rights ownership the role of informal water users the perceptions of waste and water use efficiency in both the donor and recipient regions and the level of trust in the data used for monitoring and enforcement the monterrey experience illustrates each of these issues with hindsight it is possible to contrast expectations and realities in regard to costs benefits and their distribution over time monterrey has clearly benefited from el cuchillo dam which has sustained the population and economic growth of the mma waters from this dam have been crucial for overcoming water shortages that took place in the 1980s when the city had water for 4 to 8 h per day these volumes also provided a more robust portfolio of sources from groundwater to surface water and enhanced possibilities for source management to respond to droughts and other circumstances that could compromise specific sources groundwater was the city s major source of water until the mid 1960s when la boca reservoir began supplying water to monterrey el cuchillo has supplied on average one fifth of monterrey s water since 1994 the contribution of el cuchillo to mma has averaged 2 5 m3 s over the 1994 2015 period approximately half of the 5 m3 s authorized el cuchillo helped the city increase water supply from 8 h day in 1992 to 24 h day in 1997 despite mounting drought pressure the impacts of el cuchillo on id 026 are hard to assess and require distinguishing short term and long term impacts there are multiple factors to consider as the dam is part of a multi flow system which involves physical volumes of water as well as financial flows to the district at first assessment irrigation activity has declined in the district fig 3 shows the area of harvested land for the period 1963 2014 there seems to be an influence from el cuchillo in this decline until the agricultural year 1991 1992 it was common to see levels above 80 000 ha in two cycles autumn winter and spring summer the cycle of 1993 1994 which coincides with the opening of el cuchillo appears to mark a new trend in the mid 1990s harvested land declined below 60 000 ha after this initial decline irrigated area recovered approaching 70 000 ha the volumes allocated to the district and agricultural output follow a similar pattern figs 4 and 5 an apparent decline while el cuchillo filled coupled with the presence of the drought of the early and mid 1990s followed by a marked recovery the work of sisto 38 assessing the performance of the district for the period 1972 2002 is consistent with our findings overall it does not appear the dam has had a devastating effect on id 026 in fact as fig 4 shows the district recovered the level of volumes it had in pre cuchillo times this pattern is even clearer in the case of agricultural production fig 5 on the other hand it is well known in mexico that there is relatively plenty of room for efficiencies in the use of agricultural water 4 this has long been demonstrated for the id 026 38 these elements are useful to place in context the impacts of el cuchillo dam downstream on the id 26 however extreme care needs to be taken when interpreting this last trend of agricultural production data refers to aggregate output all crops and this unmask the fact that farmers have reacted to water scarcity in different ways a common practice is to shift from maize to sorghum which is more resistant to droughts this is what happened in the drought of the 1990s after the drought maize became again the main crop yield varies according to crops in addition to the availability of water the decision to which crop cultivate also depends on the prices of them in the national and international markets in addition to these issues the district has received federal and state government support to modernize its infrastructure and irrigation practices the assessment of benefit sharing and compensation to the irrigation district requires a focus on three flows of water 1 transfers from mrg the main source of water for the district 2 transfers from el cuchillo to mrg and 3 transfers of treated wastewater to mrg in the initial years transfers from mrg to id 026 were impacted by the combined effect of el cuchilllós filling and the drought of the 1990s which resulted in low volumes of water storage at mrg during those years scott 2007 reports a marked decline in inflows to mrg in the 10 years after the project 434 6 mm3 compared with the 60 year average prior to the project 883 2 mm3 with withdrawals declining proportionally in the post drought period the levels of mrg and the volumes allocated to the district recovered as shown in fig 4 the reservoir also reflects the intense drought period of 2010 after hurricane alex and 2013 before hurricane ingrid hit the san juan basin illustrating the effect of climate variability and the importance of incorporating climate risk into the assessment the transfer of water from el cuchillo to mrg was a key component of the 1996 agreement to support the id 026 with the exception of the conflicts of the 1996 1997 period data provided by the national water commission indicate that these transfers have become normal practice averaging 237 mm3 per year excluding an extraordinary transfer of 2355 9 mm3 to address hurricane alex in 2010 fig 6 transfers have only been constrained during dry years when no water has been sent to mrg including 1998 1999 2002 and 2007 there have been years in which more than one transfer has occurred some of these transfers have to do with flood control management illustrating the benefits to the farmers associated with el cuchillo hurricane alex which hit the basin in 2010 is a case in point over 2 400 million cubic metres had to be released from el cuchillo dam over a few days in july to protect both the dam and the population and economic activities downstream substantial deliveries of treated wastewater have occurred in 18 of the 22 years since 1995 these deliveries have been above the minimum volume agreed before conveyance losses fig 7 interceptions by farmers along the rio pesqueria and natural losses have meant that the agreed volumes have not always been received 35 historic data of water discharges into the pesquería illustrate a clear increasing trend of water discharged from mma yet the volume that reaches the mrg reservoir is just enough to comply with the 1996 reference of 189 million cubic metres per year the volume of missing water along the 172 kilometre stretch of the rio pesquería has set the basis for compensation how much water reaches the reservoir is a matter of controversy and disputes between the governments of nuevo león tamaulipas and the federal level there is consensus however about the role played by interceptions the financing of the whole programme that paved the way for el cuchillo known as monterrey iv was also a matter of controversy and misunderstanding during the guerra del agua there were voices in nuevo león that opposed sharing el cuchillo s waters because of the perception that the state had financed the entire project however the dam was financed by the federal government while the aqueduct was funded principally by the state of nuevo leon water and sanitation utility sadm still today many people do not know about the financial sources of the programme and believe wrongly that the state and city paid for all the works associated with it 3 revisiting the el cuchillo project illustrates the difficulty of separating benefits and costs the forgoing analysis demonstrates that most actors benefited over the long term but that benefits were not shared equally fair compensation has long been a matter for concern 23 the economic implications of benefit sharing arrangements can be summarized as follows monterrey was the relatively clear winner but mma and sadm also bore substantial costs in its contributions to financing the project irrigation district 026 was a loser in the short term and the impacts were compounded by drought but the district gained over the long term due to regulation capacity volumes of treated water form the mma flood control benefits and commitments to offset the effects of the transfer through compensation mmás commitment to return treated wastewater flows to the mrg dam was a critical form of compensation supplemental compensation to irrigation district 026 came in multiple forms including payments for deficits in treated wastewater a compensation dam las blancas and investments in irrigation efficiency improvements all of these mechanisms have been in place though the farmers dispute the figures about the volumes of treated waters that finally reach marte r gómez dam las blancas dam to supply id 026 was inaugurated in 2000 interviews revealed a strong perception that compensation should support the region not the individual in other words compensation should address and aim to offset the negative impacts of reallocation for those directly affected by the loss of water as well as those indirectly impacted throughout the region through economic activity and sectors linked to agricultural productivity farmers also care about who pays the compensation not only the amount reflecting the ethos that beneficiaries should pay in this context several stakeholders in tamaulipas believe that the state of nuevo león should pay not the federal government through conagua 5 key lessons learned this retrospective assessment of the el cuchillo project and its evolution illustrates a series of lessons about what drove the reallocation how it worked whether it was effective and what were the compensation mechanisms today el cuchillo dam is of crucial relevance for sustaining the socioeconomic health of the san juan basin after almost 25 years there are significant and illustrative policy lessons for the region mexico and international observers which can broadly be summarized as follows reallocation needs to be designed and assessed in a systemic regional context water reallocation is part of a water system and cannot be assessed without recognizing connections between reallocation projects and other water sources this has long been known in the basin 34 from a systems long term perspective the water reallocation contributed to multiple goals and delivered benefits for most key actors furthermore the role of the 1990s drought needs to be considered in this assessment the design and negotiation process for agreements matter central messages include 1 agreements need to take into account wider institutional arrangements and systems of water rights 18 2 informal rules can be important such as those governing compensation under annex 5 of the 1996 agreement which contained a comprehensive draft for the sharing of the san juan river basin waters including a set of rules governing compensation 3 the need to account for the effects of drought in the project s water sharing arrangements and compensation mechanisms 4 the need for a coordinating body to generate robust third party measurement resolve conflicts optimise water sharing arrangements and implement the agreement and 5 monitoring and enforcement of the reallocation agreement must be clearly defined and implemented compensation should focus on the region not only the individual reduced harvests impact the regional economy requiring compensation to be linked with regional development considerations farmers also care that the beneficiary of the reallocated water the city pays not just that they get paid robust data and water accounting are needed to ensure fair transparent timely and predictable compensation drought can magnify the negative effects of reallocation drought had a dual role drought was a trigger for the construction of the project and tipped the balance for the project when considered in the context of monterrey s long term water supply needs 39 however it also affected the implementation of the project due to the onset of a severe drought as the dam began filling reallocation is a political process effective forums for political negotiation and communication matter politics is an inherent part of reallocation showing the importance of effective negotiation processes and the participation of key actors early enough el cuchillo would not have been built without the aid of the federal government it is widely recognized the role president salinas 1988 1994 had in both the decision to go ahead with the project and its financing effective communication also matters as a means of pre empting or counteracting misinformation biases and distorted media coverage in the end it must be recognized that reallocation is a dynamic process with learning and additional stages phases 6 concluding remarks this contribution revisits el cuchillo 25 years after its inauguration to distil the lessons learned from the project and its implementation the drought of the mid 1990s coincided with the filling of the dam and exacerbated the effects of the water transfer on the downstream farmers notwithstanding the expectations that the reallocation of water from the san juan river to monterrey would threaten the viability of the downstream farmers the project is now seen as integral to the regional water supply for both the mma and the farmers the project illustrates the complexities of water reallocation from agriculture to urban uses in a regional context in some circles there was and still is the view that agricultural users lost with this deal against a large and economically powerful metropolis but there are other views that see the water sharing agreements as a win win situation although some gained more than others the main lesson from el cuchillo is that water reallocation needs to be designed and assessed in a regional context using a systems perspective to track the changing costs benefits and mechanisms for sharing them doing so requires well designed agreements including processes for including affected stakeholders compensation schemes that focus on the region not only the individual losses robust and transparent water accounting to inform implementation and appropriate coordination bodies to resolve conflicts in monterrey the project s development and implementation have shaped prospects and debates about the region s water future beyond mexico the experience of el cuchillo speaks specifically to those regions where urban development is upstream of agriculture projects are developed in the context of drought and treated wastewater is integrated into the project s compensation mechanisms acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the support of the world bank to this research
