study has therefore a strong implication for water quality management and for the local urban and economic development planning the approach developed here is also readily to integrate watershed scale water quality monitoring data and can also be applied to estimate wec for other watersheds 2 methods 2 1 research site the maozhou river watershed which is used for demonstrating the integrated approach is located in shenzhen city and dongguan city guangdong province china fig 1 the maozhou river originates from the yangtai mountain and flows westward into the pearl river estuary with a total length of 41 61 km for its mainstream and a total watershed area of 388 km2 the average annual runoff in the study area is 347 million m3 with 1700 mm annual average precipitation and the multi year average temperature of 22 3 c yu et al 2020 80 of this watershed is situated in shenzhen city where has been developed rapidly in industrialization and urbanization in last several decades zhang et al 2017 a side effect is that the water quality of this watershed has been continually degraded due to industrial and domestic wastewater discharges ammonium is one of the most concerned pollutants in this watershed because it was widely detected that affects both river water and groundwater quality in the watershed guo et al 2019 the watershed is currently undergoing restoration and the estimated wec would benefit the site for watershed scale planning and management of land development and water quality 2 2 model framework in the overall framework of the combined process based model with ann for watershed scale wec estimation fig 2 the first step is to select the targets of water quality requirements at the critical locations as the constraints in this study four control sections fig 1 along the maozhou river mainstream loucun section m1 lisonglang section m2 yangchong bridge section m3 and gonghe village section m4 were selected as the critical locations for water quality control based on the water quality requirements from the local government the water quality requirements for ammonium concentrations were taken from the standards for surface water environmental quality gb3838 2002 which divides water quality into five classes from class ⅰ to class ⅴ for demonstrative purpose water quality standards for ammonium were used as the water quality control targets at the four critical locations m1 to m4 in fig 1 because it is the dominant contaminant in the watershed the second step is to set up a process based model for calculating the contaminant concentrations at the critical locations yi in fig 2 in response to contaminant inputs xi in fig 2 the simulated contaminant concentrations were used to train a back propagate artificial neural network bp ann with a goal to establish a quantitative correlation between the contaminant inputs in the watershed and the contaminant concentrations at the critical locations yi f xi in fig 2 luo et al 2019 from the correlation relationship a global optimization method called the shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona algorithm sce ua was used to find the wec that meets the targets of the water quality at critical locations duan et al 1994 2 3 process based model mike 11 a widely used river model www dhigroup com for simulating river hydrodynamics and solute transport is used in this study to integrate physical and chemical processes that affect water quality in the watershed the model uses the following control equations for water flow doulgeris et al 2012 1 q x a t q 2 q t x α q 2 a g a h x n 2 g q q a r 4 3 0 where q is the discharge m3 s a is the cross sectional area m2 q is the lateral inflow m2 s h is the water level above a reference datum m x is the distance m t is the time s n is the manning resistance coefficient s m1 3 r is the hydraulic or resistance radius m g is the acceleration of gravity m2 s and α is the momentum distribution coefficient for accounting for the effect of non uniform vertical distribution of water flow velocity in a given river section the solute transport is simulated using the following equation in the model dhi 2009 3 a c t q c x x ad c x a k c c 2 q where c is the concentration mg l 1 d is the dispersion coefficient m2 s a is the cross sectional area m2 k is the linear decay coefficient d 1 c 2 is the source sink concentration mg l 1 q is the lateral inflow m2 s and other variables have been described for eq 2 the process based model requires the inputs of river topological structure cross section geometry river discharges manning s roughness coefficient and decay parameter in this study year 2012 has been selected as the base initial year with river discharges reported elsewhere tianjin university 2016 table 1 showed the values of parameters used in the process based model the topological structure and cross section geometries were obtained from the survey results of shenzhen municipal water affairs bureau http swj sz gov cn most river channels in the maozhou river watershed have been straightened and hardened a uniform manning s roughness coefficient was adopted in this model for such a river system chow 1959 table 1 with these conditions and parameters equations 1 2 were used to simulate the flow field throughout the watershed which was then used to simulate water quality mike 11 simulates transport and transformation of contaminants i e ammonium for this case in surface water using a one dimensional version of the advection dispersion equation with a first order decay reaction decay parameter was 0 1 d 1 for ammonium which was adopted from previous numerical study of this watershed chen 2016 simulations of water quality using equation 3 also require the influx of contaminant inputs as shown in fig 1 the watershed contains 16 inflow river branches that potentially receive contaminant flux inputs from the upstream and river sides to demonstrate the application of the combined process based model and ann approach in determining wec the contaminant inputs were assumed to be placed on the upstream of each branch fig 1 measured annual changes of ammonium concentrations in several sections and branches in the maozhou river watershed during year 2014 were used for validating the model figs s5 and s6 the results showed that the model outputs were close to the measured results for the most of the sections and branches in the validating period deviations between the model and measured results were observed at downstream sections yangchong bridge and gonghe village due to the uncertainty caused by tidal fluctuation which likely brought in ammonium through the backflow in upstream direction from estuary the ammonium from the backflow was not considered in this study luotian branch was also affected by tidal fluctuation although at a lower level than that at the downstream locations the relative difference between the simulated and measured data was higher at luotian branch that was attributed to its low absolute concentration in absolute term the difference between the measured and simulated concentrations was much higher at the downstream and decreased at luotian and much lower at further upstream locations consistent with the tidal fluctuation effect the strength of the input flux can be different that are expected to give different wec in this study two scenarios were considered in the first scenario the watershed was divided into two regions upstream and downstream table s1 and the contaminant concentrations at the input sites within each region were assumed to be the same but can be different between the two regions because of the similar urban functional zoning within each region and difference between two regions this is partially supported by the measured water quality data zhao 2017 which shows that the ammonium concentration at the upstream region was significantly lower than that in the downstream region with a ratio of 1 2 to 1 6 for simplicity we choose a ratio of 1 3 in all the simulations under scenario 1 by varying input ammonium flux different ammonium concentrations at each critical location were simulated using the process based model these results were used to establish a relationship between the amount of input ammonium and the ammonium concentration at each critical cross section which can be used to determine wec for each river branch and the watershed scenario 1 is a simplified case that has a computational advantage in general however the input flux at different contaminant discharge sources may be different in addition the calculated wec with a fixed ratio of flux between different contaminant input sources may not reflect the maximum potential for the watershed in the second scenario the contaminant input concentration at each input site was assumed to be an independent random variable these random concentrations were randomly generated from the log normal distribution function with parameters fitted from the historical ammonium concentration results total 214 data ranged from 5 3 mg l 1 to 60 6 mg l 1 see fig s4 measured in these branches the randomly generated concentrations were then multiplied by volumetric flow rates to generate contaminant flux inputs from all the river branches in the watershed the process based model was then used to calculate the contaminant concentrations at the critical cross sections as outputs these input output pairs were used to train and test an artificial neural network model as described below 2 4 artificial neural network a relationship between the contaminant concentrations at the critical locations and contaminant flux inputs is the key to estimate the wec in the watershed as mentioned in section 1 the direct estimation using the process based model is computationally expensive especially when the topology or the profiles of flow transiency of the watershed is complicated however an integrated approach of machine learning and process based model is an ideal solution to overcome this problem once trained it can achieve simulations orders of magnitude faster than the original process based model without sacrificing much accuracy camps valls et al 2018 in our case about 1 h was needed for an individual simulation case of process based model while the time consumed for an ann training and validation was only about 10 s which was almost negligible comparing with the time for process based model a quadra core cpu 4 3 4 ghz on the desktop was used in this study a back propagation bp neural network which has a strong nonlinear mapping capability and flexible network structure rumelhart et al 1986 cui jing 2019 hubbard et al 2020 was adopted to establish the relationship between the contaminant inputs and corresponding concentrations at the critical locations the bp approach has been widely used in the study to solve various water environmental problems such as rainfall runoff modeling young et al 2017 water quality prediction shi et al 2018a 2018b and streamflow prediction pradhan et al 2020 the bp neural network model consists of three parts input layer hidden layer and output layer zhang et al 2019 the number of neurons in the input layer and the output layer is respectively equal to the number of the contaminant flux inputs and the number of critical locations to meet water quality targets in this study the input layer contains 16 neurons corresponding to 16 ammonium flux inputs 16 river branches and the output layer contains 4 neurons corresponding to 4 average ammonium concentrations at the critical locations fig 1 typically one or two hidden layers are sufficient to solve most nonlinear complex problems palani et al 2008 karsoliya 2012 increasing the number of hidden layers will increase the complexity of ann and may led to overfitting in this study trial and error method tarassenko 1998 sachaniya et al 2020 was used to find the numbers of hidden layers and neurons in the hidden layers and finally one hidden layer with 10 neurons were selected because it gave the best fit in establishing the correlation between the input and output variables with the lowest numbers of the hidden layer and neurons see tables s3 and s4 the bp neural network model was trained using the steepest descent method to adjust the weights and thresholds by the back propagation and finally minimizes the sum of squares of the prediction errors at the critical locations fig 3 in this study the ann was applied using the python based open source code tensorflow the performance of the ann model was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 eq 4 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 5 pradhan et al 2020 the higher the nse and r2 the better the results 4 r 2 o i o e i e 2 o i o 2 e i e 2 5 nse 1 i 1 n o i e i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 to find the optimal number of samples for training more samples mean more repetitive process based model simulations while less samples may result in poor prediction performance from ann we tested the total sample number ranged from 150 to 600 here the total sample number means the total number of datasets used for both training and validating in each training and validating cases 2 3 of datasets were selected randomly for the training and 1 3 of datasets were used for validation the prediction performance of ann was tested using r2 and nse as abovementioned if r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 the performance of model was considered to be acceptable krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 as presented in table s2 when the sample number increased to 450 the r2 and nse became acceptable sample number 600 was finally selected 2 5 optimization in this example wec is the sum of the maximum ammonium flux inputs from 16 input sites under the constraints of water quality at the critical locations fig 1 the maximum flux inputs were obtained from the correlation relationship between the ammonium flux inputs and the ammonium concentrations at the critical locations that was obtained using the ann described in section 2 4 an optimization method sce ua duan et al 1994 zhang shao 2018 was used in this study to obtain the maximum flux inputs the specific steps of sce algorithm in this study are as follows initially complexes p 60 and each complex containing m 35 points were selected which resulted in a sample size of s 35 60 2100 points these 2100 points were then randomly selected in the feasible parameter space which were then used to calculate the objective function value wmax for each sample secondly 2100 points were sorted in an order of increasing function value and stored in an array d xi wi i 1 2100 thirdly array d was partitioned into 60 complexes each containing 35 points each complex evolved using a competitive evolutionary algorithm and then shuffled and reassigned to new complexes to enable information sharing finally convergence criteria were checked and iteration stopped when the convergence was satisfied otherwise return to the second step and iterated again as the search progresses the global optimal solution wmax will be found 3 results 3 1 results for scenario 1 fig 4 showed the relationship between the ammonium concentrations at the critical locations calculated using the process based model and the total contaminant inputs in the maozhou river watershed i e the sum of contaminant inputs from 16 inflow rivers under scenario 1 in this case the calculated ammonium concentrations almost linearly increased with the total contaminant inputs the wec can then be determined by imposing water quality standard red lines in fig 4 for example the wec was 361 71 t yr 1 under class ⅳ standard and 483 66 t yr 1 under class ⅴ standard fig 4 obviously the estimated wec under class ⅴ standard was higher than that under class ⅳ because the more contaminant mass can be inputted when a higher concentration at the critical locations is allowed in the simulations for scenario 1 the ratio of flux inputs from different input sources was fixed thus the simulated ammonium concentrations as a function of ammonium inputs were different for different critical locations fig 4 because different river branches and sections have different capacities for ammonium removal consequently the wec will depend on the selection of the critical locations in estimating wec in this case the estimated wec that meets the water quality requirements at downstream e g gonghe village fig 4 was larger than that at upstream e g loucun section because all the upstream branches and river sections can remove ammonium generally however the wec estimated from different locations will be affected complexly by upstream contaminant flux inputs and removal capacity along flow water flow path 3 2 results for scenario 2 in scenario 2 as mentioned previously total 600 cases of ammonium flux inputs were generated for the entire watershed for each case process based model simulation was performed to calculate ammonium concentrations at the critical locations as described for scenario1 among the 600 cases 400 were used to train the bp neural network model to establish the relationship between the calculated ammonium concentrations at the critical cross sections and ammonium flux inputs and 200 were used for testing the trained model the model performed well in both fitting and testing steps with r2 0 951 and nse 0 948 fig 5 and with a good overall regression performance over entire the ammonium concentration range 0 30 mg l 1 the trained and tested model was then used to search the maximum flux inputs and their distributions using sce ua under the constraints of water quality targets at the critical locations in the watershed the wec which was estimated using the maximum flux inputs was 766 84 to 880 90 t yr 1 with an average value of 815 44 t yr 1 and from 1118 10 to 1129 88 t yr 1 with an average value of 1123 38 t yr 1 under the water constraints of class ⅳ and class ⅴ standards respectively fig 6 a range value was reported here because there were multiple different distributions of flux inputs that gave a similar wec value fig 7 for all these input distribution patterns the wec value was larger than that obtained from scenario 1 where the ratio of flux inputs from different sources was fixed 4 discussion various process based models have been used to estimate wec that often yield different wec values li et al 2010 li et al 2015 yan et al 2019 the process based model however requires extensive computational resources especially for complex river network systems the new method proposed in this study provide an alternative approach that can significantly reduce computational demand without compromising the sophistication of the process based model about 300 000 times of ann simulations were needed for estimating wec using the sce ua optimization scheme in this study since the ann was a substitutional algorithm to the process based model we could infer that similar numbers 300 000 of independent process based model simulation cases are required without the ann approach as comparison with the ann approach only 600 independent process based model simulation cases were needed to generate the necessary data for training and testing ann model section 2 4 consequently the computational demand was reduced by 500 times since the computation time of ann training and prediction is almost negligible compared with the computation time required for each process based model simulation case note that the ann part of the approach can use not only the data from the process based model simulations but also the data from monitoring programs at the watershed scale if they are available this study found that the estimated wec value was larger when each contaminant flux input can be readily modified than that when the ratio of flux inputs from different sources was fixed scenario 1 represents those watersheds with the fixed ratio between contaminant inputs while scenario 2 represents those watersheds under design to optimize flux inputs in reality however some input sources are fixed and others can be modified or designed so that the estimated wec will be the values within scenarios 1 and 2 under such a condition the wec estimated from scenario 2 represents the maximum potential for contaminant removal in the watershed the watershed scale wec reflects the collective effects of contaminant flux inputs contaminant removal rates and capacities and their distributions in the watershed the result in this study showed that different distributions of contaminant flux inputs yielded a similar wec indicating that there is a certain degree of flexibility for the stakeholders to design flux inputs for watershed scale management of land use distribution that would fully use the natural capacity in removing contaminants without yielding unacceptable impacts 5 conclusion in this study we proposed a machine learning assisted approach to estimate watershed scale wec the advantage of the approach is that it can significantly reduce the computational demand without a need of simplifying process based models for cases when there are multiple possibilities of contaminant flux inputs and their distributions these cases often occur in the estimation of the maximum potential of watershed scale wec or in designing land uses to minimize their impacts to river water quality by maximizing environmental capacity the computational advantage of the approach is expected to increase for a watershed with complex river network and land application structures the approach is also readily to integrate monitoring data in the ann step so that both numerical simulation and monitoring data can be incorporated into the approach in this study maozhou river watershed was used as an example to demonstrate the application of the proposed wec estimation approach the estimated wec using ammonium contamination as an example showed that wec proportionally increased with decreasing water quality requirements indicating that it is important to consider the functions of the entire river or river sections in the watershed in this example there were multiple distributions of ammonium flux inputs that can give the similar wec giving a flexibility in designing the land use and for water quality management ammonium is the contaminant that is most widely detected and has been considered key environmental factor in evaluating the water quality in the maozhou river watershed the results from this study thus have strong implications for the environmental management and water quality control in the maozhou river watershed in eliminating contaminant sources or re distributing contaminant sources by taking the advantage of wec credit authorship contribution statement xin wang conceptualization methodology investigation

the survey results of shenzhen municipal water affairs bureau http swj sz gov cn most river channels in the maozhou river watershed have been straightened and hardened a uniform manning s roughness coefficient was adopted in this model for such a river system chow 1959 table 1 with these conditions and parameters equations 1 2 were used to simulate the flow field throughout the watershed which was then used to simulate water quality mike 11 simulates transport and transformation of contaminants i e ammonium for this case in surface water using a one dimensional version of the advection dispersion equation with a first order decay reaction decay parameter was 0 1 d 1 for ammonium which was adopted from previous numerical study of this watershed chen 2016 simulations of water quality using equation 3 also require the influx of contaminant inputs as shown in fig 1 the watershed contains 16 inflow river branches that potentially receive contaminant flux inputs from the upstream and river sides to demonstrate the application of the combined process based model and ann approach in determining wec the contaminant inputs were assumed to be placed on the upstream of each branch fig 1 measured annual changes of ammonium concentrations in several sections and branches in the maozhou river watershed during year 2014 were used for validating the model figs s5 and s6 the results showed that the model outputs were close to the measured results for the most of the sections and branches in the validating period deviations between the model and measured results were observed at downstream sections yangchong bridge and gonghe village due to the uncertainty caused by tidal fluctuation which likely brought in ammonium through the backflow in upstream direction from estuary the ammonium from the backflow was not considered in this study luotian branch was also affected by tidal fluctuation although at a lower level than that at the downstream locations the relative difference between the simulated and measured data was higher at luotian branch that was attributed to its low absolute concentration in absolute term the difference between the measured and simulated concentrations was much higher at the downstream and decreased at luotian and much lower at further upstream locations consistent with the tidal fluctuation effect the strength of the input flux can be different that are expected to give different wec in this study two scenarios were considered in the first scenario the watershed was divided into two regions upstream and downstream table s1 and the contaminant concentrations at the input sites within each region were assumed to be the same but can be different between the two regions because of the similar urban functional zoning within each region and difference between two regions this is partially supported by the measured water quality data zhao 2017 which shows that the ammonium concentration at the upstream region was significantly lower than that in the downstream region with a ratio of 1 2 to 1 6 for simplicity we choose a ratio of 1 3 in all the simulations under scenario 1 by varying input ammonium flux different ammonium concentrations at each critical location were simulated using the process based model these results were used to establish a relationship between the amount of input ammonium and the ammonium concentration at each critical cross section which can be used to determine wec for each river branch and the watershed scenario 1 is a simplified case that has a computational advantage in general however the input flux at different contaminant discharge sources may be different in addition the calculated wec with a fixed ratio of flux between different contaminant input sources may not reflect the maximum potential for the watershed in the second scenario the contaminant input concentration at each input site was assumed to be an independent random variable these random concentrations were randomly generated from the log normal distribution function with parameters fitted from the historical ammonium concentration results total 214 data ranged from 5 3 mg l 1 to 60 6 mg l 1 see fig s4 measured in these branches the randomly generated concentrations were then multiplied by volumetric flow rates to generate contaminant flux inputs from all the river branches in the watershed the process based model was then used to calculate the contaminant concentrations at the critical cross sections as outputs these input output pairs were used to train and test an artificial neural network model as described below 2 4 artificial neural network a relationship between the contaminant concentrations at the critical locations and contaminant flux inputs is the key to estimate the wec in the watershed as mentioned in section 1 the direct estimation using the process based model is computationally expensive especially when the topology or the profiles of flow transiency of the watershed is complicated however an integrated approach of machine learning and process based model is an ideal solution to overcome this problem once trained it can achieve simulations orders of magnitude faster than the original process based model without sacrificing much accuracy camps valls et al 2018 in our case about 1 h was needed for an individual simulation case of process based model while the time consumed for an ann training and validation was only about 10 s which was almost negligible comparing with the time for process based model a quadra core cpu 4 3 4 ghz on the desktop was used in this study a back propagation bp neural network which has a strong nonlinear mapping capability and flexible network structure rumelhart et al 1986 cui jing 2019 hubbard et al 2020 was adopted to establish the relationship between the contaminant inputs and corresponding concentrations at the critical locations the bp approach has been widely used in the study to solve various water environmental problems such as rainfall runoff modeling young et al 2017 water quality prediction shi et al 2018a 2018b and streamflow prediction pradhan et al 2020 the bp neural network model consists of three parts input layer hidden layer and output layer zhang et al 2019 the number of neurons in the input layer and the output layer is respectively equal to the number of the contaminant flux inputs and the number of critical locations to meet water quality targets in this study the input layer contains 16 neurons corresponding to 16 ammonium flux inputs 16 river branches and the output layer contains 4 neurons corresponding to 4 average ammonium concentrations at the critical locations fig 1 typically one or two hidden layers are sufficient to solve most nonlinear complex problems palani et al 2008 karsoliya 2012 increasing the number of hidden layers will increase the complexity of ann and may led to overfitting in this study trial and error method tarassenko 1998 sachaniya et al 2020 was used to find the numbers of hidden layers and neurons in the hidden layers and finally one hidden layer with 10 neurons were selected because it gave the best fit in establishing the correlation between the input and output variables with the lowest numbers of the hidden layer and neurons see tables s3 and s4 the bp neural network model was trained using the steepest descent method to adjust the weights and thresholds by the back propagation and finally minimizes the sum of squares of the prediction errors at the critical locations fig 3 in this study the ann was applied using the python based open source code tensorflow the performance of the ann model was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 eq 4 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 5 pradhan et al 2020 the higher the nse and r2 the better the results 4 r 2 o i o e i e 2 o i o 2 e i e 2 5 nse 1 i 1 n o i e i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 to find the optimal number of samples for training more samples mean more repetitive process based model simulations while less samples may result in poor prediction performance from ann we tested the total sample number ranged from 150 to 600 here the total sample number means the total number of datasets used for both training and validating in each training and validating cases 2 3 of datasets were selected randomly for the training and 1 3 of datasets were used for validation the prediction performance of ann was tested using r2 and nse as abovementioned if r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 the performance of model was considered to be acceptable krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 as presented in table s2 when the sample number increased to 450 the r2 and nse became acceptable sample number 600 was finally selected 2 5 optimization in this example wec is the sum of the maximum ammonium flux inputs from 16 input sites under the constraints of water quality at the critical locations fig 1 the maximum flux inputs were obtained from the correlation relationship between the ammonium flux inputs and the ammonium concentrations at the critical locations that was obtained using the ann described in section 2 4 an optimization method sce ua duan et al 1994 zhang shao 2018 was used in this study to obtain the maximum flux inputs the specific steps of sce algorithm in this study are as follows initially complexes p 60 and each complex containing m 35 points were selected which resulted in a sample size of s 35 60 2100 points these 2100 points were then randomly selected in the feasible parameter space which were then used to calculate the objective function value wmax for each sample secondly 2100 points were sorted in an order of increasing function value and stored in an array d xi wi i 1 2100 thirdly array d was partitioned into 60 complexes each containing 35 points each complex evolved using a competitive evolutionary algorithm and then shuffled and reassigned to new complexes to enable information sharing finally convergence criteria were checked and iteration stopped when the convergence was satisfied otherwise return to the second step and iterated again as the search progresses the global optimal solution wmax will be found 3 results 3 1 results for scenario 1 fig 4 showed the relationship between the ammonium concentrations at the critical locations calculated using the process based model and the total contaminant inputs in the maozhou river watershed i e the sum of contaminant inputs from 16 inflow rivers under scenario 1 in this case the calculated ammonium concentrations almost linearly increased with the total contaminant inputs the wec can then be determined by imposing water quality standard red lines in fig 4 for example the wec was 361 71 t yr 1 under class ⅳ standard and 483 66 t yr 1 under class ⅴ standard fig 4 obviously the estimated wec under class ⅴ standard was higher than that under class ⅳ because the more contaminant mass can be inputted when a higher concentration at the critical locations is allowed in the simulations for scenario 1 the ratio of flux inputs from different input sources was fixed thus the simulated ammonium concentrations as a function of ammonium inputs were different for different critical locations fig 4 because different river branches and sections have different capacities for ammonium removal consequently the wec will depend on the selection of the critical locations in estimating wec in this case the estimated wec that meets the water quality requirements at downstream e g gonghe village fig 4 was larger than that at upstream e g loucun section because all the upstream branches and river sections can remove ammonium generally however the wec estimated from different locations will be affected complexly by upstream contaminant flux inputs and removal capacity along flow water flow path 3 2 results for scenario 2 in scenario 2 as mentioned previously total 600 cases of ammonium flux inputs were generated for the entire watershed for each case process based model simulation was performed to calculate ammonium concentrations at the critical locations as described for scenario1 among the 600 cases 400 were used to train the bp neural network model to establish the relationship between the calculated ammonium concentrations at the critical cross sections and ammonium flux inputs and 200 were used for testing the trained model the model performed well in both fitting and testing steps with r2 0 951 and nse 0 948 fig 5 and with a good overall regression performance over entire the ammonium concentration range 0 30 mg l 1 the trained and tested model was then used to search the maximum flux inputs and their distributions using sce ua under the constraints of water quality targets at the critical locations in the watershed the wec which was estimated using the maximum flux inputs was 766 84 to 880 90 t yr 1 with an average value of 815 44 t yr 1 and from 1118 10 to 1129 88 t yr 1 with an average value of 1123 38 t yr 1 under the water constraints of class ⅳ and class ⅴ standards respectively fig 6 a range value was reported here because there were multiple different distributions of flux inputs that gave a similar wec value fig 7 for all these input distribution patterns the wec value was larger than that obtained from scenario 1 where the ratio of flux inputs from different sources was fixed 4 discussion various process based models have been used to estimate wec that often yield different wec values li et al 2010 li et al 2015 yan et al 2019 the process based model however requires extensive computational resources especially for complex river network systems the new method proposed in this study provide an alternative approach that can significantly reduce computational demand without compromising the sophistication of the process based model about 300 000 times of ann simulations were needed for estimating wec using the sce ua optimization scheme in this study since the ann was a substitutional algorithm to the process based model we could infer that similar numbers 300 000 of independent process based model simulation cases are required without the ann approach as comparison with the ann approach only 600 independent process based model simulation cases were needed to generate the necessary data for training and testing ann model section 2 4 consequently the computational demand was reduced by 500 times since the computation time of ann training and prediction is almost negligible compared with the computation time required for each process based model simulation case note that the ann part of the approach can use not only the data from the process based model simulations but also the data from monitoring programs at the watershed scale if they are available this study found that the estimated wec value was larger when each contaminant flux input can be readily modified than that when the ratio of flux inputs from different sources was fixed scenario 1 represents those watersheds with the fixed ratio between contaminant inputs while scenario 2 represents those watersheds under design to optimize flux inputs in reality however some input sources are fixed and others can be modified or designed so that the estimated wec will be the values within scenarios 1 and 2 under such a condition the wec estimated from scenario 2 represents the maximum potential for contaminant removal in the watershed the watershed scale wec reflects the collective effects of contaminant flux inputs contaminant removal rates and capacities and their distributions in the watershed the result in this study showed that different distributions of contaminant flux inputs yielded a similar wec indicating that there is a certain degree of flexibility for the stakeholders to design flux inputs for watershed scale management of land use distribution that would fully use the natural capacity in removing contaminants without yielding unacceptable impacts 5 conclusion in this study we proposed a machine learning assisted approach to estimate watershed scale wec the advantage of the approach is that it can significantly reduce the computational demand without a need of simplifying process based models for cases when there are multiple possibilities of contaminant flux inputs and their distributions these cases often occur in the estimation of the maximum potential of watershed scale wec or in designing land uses to minimize their impacts to river water quality by maximizing environmental capacity the computational advantage of the approach is expected to increase for a watershed with complex river network and land application structures the approach is also readily to integrate monitoring data in the ann step so that both numerical simulation and monitoring data can be incorporated into the approach in this study maozhou river watershed was used as an example to demonstrate the application of the proposed wec estimation approach the estimated wec using ammonium contamination as an example showed that wec proportionally increased with decreasing water quality requirements indicating that it is important to consider the functions of the entire river or river sections in the watershed in this example there were multiple distributions of ammonium flux inputs that can give the similar wec giving a flexibility in designing the land use and for water quality management ammonium is the contaminant that is most widely detected and has been considered key environmental factor in evaluating the water quality in the maozhou river watershed the results from this study thus have strong implications for the environmental management and water quality control in the maozhou river watershed in eliminating contaminant sources or re distributing contaminant sources by taking the advantage of wec credit authorship contribution statement xin wang conceptualization methodology investigation

4641,the agricultural water resource carrying capacity awrcc is affected by climate change now as never before however it is still unclear how the awrcc in high latitudes responses to climate change in this study spatiotemporal changes in climatic factors and awrcc during the crop growing season from 1961 to 2014 in the nenjiang river basin nrb a high latitude basin in china were identified via multivariate statistical analysis meanwhile the impact of climatic factors on awrcc was analyzed by using cross wavelet approaches and pearson correlational analysis the results showed that temperature has followed an increasing trend especially the lowest temperature during crop growing season with a trend of 0 57 10a in the local region there was no obvious change trend for precipitation but the interannual change was large the drought index increased first and then decreased which was consistent with the trend of the et0 different spatial distributions of water resource carrying for all crops in a region were shown with a variation range of 0 22 0 76 kg m2 in the nrb it is worth noting that awrcc showed an increasing trend especially in the past decade precipitation et0 and meteorological drought were all key driving factors affecting awrcc the correlation was significant between the crop planting proportion and awrcc under climate change moreover adjusting the planting proportion of wheat soybean and rice and increasing that of maize would be conducive to improving the awrcc and facilitating the synergistic development of agriculture and wetlands in nrb keywords climate change agricultural water resource carrying capacity food safety high latitudes 1 introduction the global average surface temperature increased by about 0 85 c from 1880 to 2012 which

some related research has indicated that extreme climate events e g flood drought extreme precipitation occur frequently with climate change on a global scale particularly in intermediate and high

climate events e g flood and drought zhao et al 2015 it has been pointed out that the production of wheat and maize had reduced by 1 9 and 1 2 on a global scale respectively due to climate change ipcc 2014 recent studies also found that climate change has reduced crop yields by affecting the agricultural water resource carrying capacity yang et al 2021 morton 2007 based on the concept of water

yet to be quantified morton 2007 nenjiang river basin nrb is located in china s northeast and it is one of the most important grain production bases as well as an important area distributed many wetlands located in a middle high latitude nenjiang river basin is sensitive to climate change significant increase in temperature and extreme precipitation has been proved in this basin du et al 2013 li et al 2019 and resulted in frequent floods and droughts which has a great impact on awrcc and then threaten national food security zhou et al 2020 according to the statistics by chinese agricultural department the average annual agricultural disaster area in northeast china is about 6 43 104km2 due to the lack of preventive measures against frequent extreme weather events and meteorological disasters guo et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to quantify the impact of climate change on agricultural production some previous studies have carried out the impact of climate change on food production in this region zhao et al 2015 guo et al 2017 and zhou et al 2020 however there is still a lack of relevant studies from the perspective of the awrcc this study was designed to 1 analyze the spatiotemporal variations of climatic factors and awrcc in the nrb 2 investigate the impact of climatic factors on the awrcc in the nrb from 1961 to 2014 and 3 identify the relationships between the water resource carrying capacity for a single crop and climatic factors and optimize planting structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nenjiang river basin is located within 44 50 n and 120 128 e fig 1 and its area is 29 7 104 km2 fig 1 the basin includes hulunbeier and xing anmeng in the inner mongolia autonomous region heihe suihua qiqihaer and daqing in heilongjiang province and baicheng and songyuan in jilin province table 1 this area is hot and rainy in summer and is cold and dry in winter influenced by the polar ocean air mass or denatured tropical ocean air mass the summer is dominated by easterly and southerly winds warm and rainy it is one of the major food production areas and the area of cultivated land is 8 28 104 km2 in nrb the crops are mainly rice maize wheat and soybean their growth seasons are all within the rainfall season the water demand at each crop growth stage is different monsoon climate variability and seasonal droughts have different effects on the crops within the eight regions huang and a i a s 2004 so it is important to understand the impact of climate change on crops related studies are also important for the ecological protection of wetlands 2 2 data the meteorological data were collected by 32 meteorological stations in the nrb from 1961 to 2014 the variables included the daily precipitation p

indicator ai the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation et0 p was used as the basis for the occurrence and classification of drought hulme 2010 the classification of meteorological drought was shown in table 2 the et0 was calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 3 2 agricultural water resource carrying capacity two indices were calculated for agricultural water resource carrying capacity water resource carrying capacity for a single crop wrccc and the water resource carrying for all crops in a region wrccr the wrccc was built to show the potential water productivity under limited agricultural water resources which was used to measures the green water resources during the growth season that could produce the maximum yield of crops under the current planting patterns meanwhile wrccr that is the maximum agricultural production is supported by the current water resources under the current technical economic and social conditions under the

used for demonstrating the temporal associations between the effects of climatic factors on the agricultural water resource carrying capacity the cross wavelet transform of the two time series x n and y n can be defined as wxy wxwy where stands for their complex conjugation their cross wavelet power is defined as wxy the complex parameter arg w xy can be considered as the local relative phase

factors 1 spatial and temporal variations of temperature the average temperature was 19 08 c during the growing period of crops in the nrb from 1961 to 2014 the spatial distribution was relatively consistent for the average lowest and highest temperatures in the nrb that is the temperature in the mountainous area was low and that in the plain area was high during the growing period of crops fig 3 a c meanwhile the temperatures of each city showed an increasing trend for the average lowest and highest temperatures from 1961 to 2014 on the whole the lowest temperature increased most significantly in the nrb with a rate of about 0 57 c 10a table 4 2 temporal and spatial variations of precipitation the average precipitation was 389 95 mm during the growing period of crops in the nrb from 1961 to 2014 fig 3e the maximum value was 459 6 mm and the minimum value was 339 3 mm it was found that the precipitation variation had obvious spatial differences and generally showed a trend of more in the east and less in the west along with more in the north and less in the south the precipitation in hh and hlbe was obviously higher than that in other cities while that in bc sy and dq was obviously lower than that in other cities fig 3d at the same time except for that in bc and sy the precipitation in the cities presented a trend of increasing year by year the precipitation in sh and qqhe increased most significantly with a rate exceeding 6 9 mm 10a the decreasing trend of precipitation in bc was the most obvious with a rate exceeding 11 8 mm 10a table 4 3 temporal and spatial variations of et0 the average et0 was 593 99 mm during the growing period of crops in the nrb from 1961 to 2014 the et0 values of bc and sy were obviously higher than those of other cities and those of hh and part of hlbe were obviously lower than those of other cities across the entire nrb the maximum et0 was 691 7 mm in bc and the minimum et0 was 479 8 mm in hh fig 3e meanwhile downward trends in et0 were observed in bc sy dq sh and qqhe while upward trends were observed in hh hlbe and xam the maximum increasing trend of et0 was observed in hlbe exceeding 5 5 mm 10a and the maximum decreasing trend of et0 was observed in sh exceeding 20 9 mm 10a table 4 4 temporal and spatial variations in meteorological drought the drought index in the southern region was higher than that in the northern region while that in the eastern region was higher than that in the western region with a variation range of 1 13 2 24 table 4 the degrees of drought in bc and sy were obviously higher than those in other cities identifying these cities as having higher meteorological drought intensity fig 3f 3 2 variation characteristics of agricultural water resource carrying capacity the growing season for wheat and maize is from may to september and those for rice and soybean are from may to august and from june to september respectively in the nrb the crop water productivity was quite different between wheat and maize with values of 10 29 kg m3 and 13 93 kg m3 respectively on the one hand maize is a c4 crop crops with a c4 pathway in the fixation and assimilation of co2 by photosynthesis with high water use efficiency on the other hand the planting proportion of wheat was very small in the study areas although the precipitation during the growth season in hh hlbe and qqhe was roughly the same the water carrying capacities for crops were different moreover the wrccc was different among crops in the same city or for the same crops across the eight cities table 5 the average water capacities in the eight regions were 0 28 kg m2 0 47 kg m2 0 39 kg m2 and 0 23 kg m2 for wheat maize rice and soybean respectively different spatial distributions of wrccr were observed with a variation range of 0 22 0 76 kg m2 the wrccr values for xam hh and sh were significantly higher than those for the other cities on average the wrccr values in hlbe 0 26 kg m2 and dq 0 28 kg m2 were slightly smaller than those in bc 0 32 kg m2 and qqhe 0 32 kg m2 which were in turn far smaller than those in hh 0 42 kg m2 sh 0 42 kg m2 xam 0 48 kg m2 and sy 0 52 kg m2 it is worth noting that during the growth season precipitation was low in the study area but the water resource carrying capacity of rice was much higher than those of wheat and soybean because rice was irrigated extensively during its growth season moreover an increasing trend was also observed for the awrcc in each city fig 4 different spatial distributions of wrccr were shown with the variation range of 0 22 0 76 kg m2 the wrccr of xam hh and sh was significantly higher than that of other cities on average wrccr in hlbe 0 26 kg m2 and dq 0 28 kg m2 was slight smaller than that in bc 0 32 kg m2 and qqhe 0 32 kg m2 which was far smaller than hh 0 42 kg m2 sh 0 42 kg m2 xam 0 48 kg m2 and sy 0 52 kg m2 it is worth noting that the water resource carrying capacity in rice during growth reason precipitation was small in study area while itwas much higher in wheat and soybean because rice was irrigated extensively during its growth season moreover an increasing trend was also shown for the awrcc at each city fig 4 3 3 effects of climatic factors on the agricultural water resource carrying capacity based on the results of wavelet coherence the time frequency relationships and phase angles between climatic factors and wrccr in nrb were shown in fig 5 the dynamic of the wrccr showed a correlation at the 5 significance level with that of climatic factors for the eight cities throughout the entire study period which were the areas surrounded by black lines in fig 5 it should be noted that p et0 and ai had stronger correlations with wrccr than other climatic factors these features indicated that these three factors had a strong effect on wrccr during the entire study period in other words the response of wrccr to these three factors was significant in these time scales aside from the relevant time scales mentioned above more local correlations between wrccr and climatic factors were found via the wtc method for the eight cities during the entire study period table 6 correlations with a 5 significance level were shown with different ranges 3 4 relationships between the agriculture water resource carrying capacity for crops and climatic factors the correlations between the water resource carrying capacities of four crops wheat maize rice and soybean and climate factors were analyzed as follows it is worth noting that wrccc values and their sensitivity to climatic factors were different for the same crop across the different cities the sensitivity to climatic factors was also different for different crops in the same city figs 6 9 meanwhile the wrccc values for the four crops were positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with other climatic factors figs 6 9 that was to say wrccc values for the four crops were greater with increasing precipitation but decreased with the increase of other climatic factors during the growing season relatively speaking the correlations between p et0 and ai and wrccc were stronger than those for other climatic factors 1 as shown in fig 6 except for qqhe and hh the wrccc for wheat in the remaining cities was very sensitive to p and et0 in general the wrccc for wheat showed a significant positive correlation with precipitation and a significant negative correlation with et0 and ai when a mild drought occurred the wrccc for wheat was significantly affected and when a moderate drought occurred the wrccc for wheat would decline rapidly the effect of temperature was complex on the wrccc for wheat with some cities showing a non linear correlation such as that in xam and bc was very sensitive to temperature with peaks occurring when lt was 12 8 c and 14 6 c during the growing season respectively 2 as shown in fig 7 the wrccc for maize was more sensitive to p et0 and ai than to other climatic factors in the watershed scale this index for maize was significantly positively correlated with precipitation and significantly negatively correlated with et0 and ai the effect of temperature was also complex on the wrccc for maize some of them could not indeed be positively or negatively correlated at the watershed scale xam and bc were more sensitive to temperature than other cities especially to the lt the wrccc for maize would peak when the lt was 12 7 c in xam and 14 7 c in bc during growing season respectively this index in hh qqhe and dq was most sensitive to et0 however this index for maize in sh and sy was most sensitive to ai when a mild drought occurred the wrccc for maize was significantly affected when a severe drought occurred the wrccc for maize was only 0 2 kg m2 or less 3 as shown in fig 8 regional differences in the correlation between wrccc for rice and climatic factors were significant although affected by irrigation this index for rice was still very sensitive to climate factors the wrccc for rice was also more sensitive to p et0 and ai than to other climatic factors in the watershed scale this index for rice was also significantly positively correlated with precipitation and significantly negatively correlated with et0 and ai the effect of temperature was also complex on the wrccc for rice the index in bc was more sensitive to lt than that of other cities the wrccc for maize would peak when the lt was 14 6 in bc during growing season this index in hh dq and xam was most sensitive to et0 moreover this index for rice in qqhe and sh and sy was most sensitive to ai when a mild drought occurred the wrccc for rice was significantly affected when a moderate drought occurred the wrccc for rice was only 0 2 kg m2 or less 4 as shown in fig 9 regional differences in the correlation between wrccc for soybean and climatic factors were also significant the wrccc for soybean was also more sensitive to p et0 and ai than to other climatic factors in the watershed scale this index for soybean was also significantly positively correlated with precipitation and significantly negatively correlated with et0 and ai the effect of temperature was also complex on the wrccc for soybean except for some cities the index for rice showed a negative correlation with temperature the wrccc for soybean in xam was more sensitive to lt than that of other cities the wrccc for soybean would peak when the lt was 12 8 c in bc during growing season in addition this index in hh qqhe and xam was most sensitive to et0 moreover this index for soybean in sh bc and sy was most sensitive to ai when a mild drought occurred the wrccc for soybean was significantly affected when a moderate drought occurred the wrccc for rice was only 0 1 kg m2 or less 4 discussion 4 1 the spatiotemporal variation of climate factors and agricultural water resource carrying capacity global climate change has become an indisputable fact and will continue in the future especially in the middle and high latitudes ipcc 2014 pahl wostl 2007 some studies have indicated significant climate change in the middle high latitude northeast china du et al 2013 where nenjiang river basin locates a continuous increasing trend was shown for the temperature in the nrb sun et al 2019 et0 increased first and then decreasing qi et al 2017 liang et al 2010 although there was no significant change for annual precipitation in the nrb sun et al 2019 extreme precipitation was found to be rising in the upper basin but decreasing in the lower basin according to a recent study by li et al 2019 however climate change during the crop growing season has received little attention in the nrb distinct from previous studies this study focused on spatiotemporal changes in climatic factors during the crop growing season the temperature during the crop growing season showed a significant increasing trend from 1961 to 2014 in the nrb especially the lowest temperature with a trend of 0 57 c 10a in qqhe there was no obvious trend for precipitation but the interannual fluctuation was significant the drought index increased first and then decreased which was consistent with the trend of et0 these changes may be related to global carbon dioxide emissions lal 2004 deng et al 2021 and underlying surface changes liu et al 2017 as a result of the complex climate change in crop growing season the phenomenon of flood drought encounter was particularly significant in the nrb leading to extremely adverse effect on awrcc the awrcc is an important index for evaluating the maximum crop production that a regional water resource can support without environmental degradation relevant research will be beneficial to optimizing the agricultural planting structure and protecting water resources he et al 2021 lu et al 2017 however the awrcc has not been given enough attention in nrb which is one of china s main grain producing areas in this study two indices the wrccc and wrccr were calculated to investigate the awrcc in the nrb the average wrccc values across the eight cities were 0 28 kg m2 0 47 kg m2 0 39 kg m2 and 0 23 kg m2 for wheat maize rice and soybean respectively wrccr exhibited obvious spatial differences with a range of 0 22 0 76 kg m2 in the nrb it is worth noting that awrcc showed an increasing trend especially in the past decade this may be related to the improvement of crop varieties or changes in climatic factors such as the decrease in et0 shi et al 2021 piao et al 2010 4 2 effects of climatic factors on the awrcc it is well known that climatic factors play an important role in the awrcc zipper et al 2016 piao et al 2010 in particular the impact of extreme climate on agriculture was more serious lesk et al 2016 lu et al 2017 showed that there was a significant correlation between meteorological drought and awrcc in the nrb wrccc for four crops exhibited a significant decreasing trend with increasing meteorological drought intensity this phenomenon was particularly obvious for the whole nrb the wrccc for four crops was significantly decreased when a mild drought occurred and was only 0 2 kg m2 or less when a severe drought occurred wrccc and its sensitivity to the drought index varies among different crops in the same city or among different cities for the same crop because of variation in climate and crop water use efficiency wang et al 2014 however meteorological drought was not the only factor lt p and et0 were also all found to be key climate factors affecting awrcc in some cities precipitation was significantly positively correlated with wrccc for four crops because a large amount of precipitation was needed to maintain the growth of crops in the early stage of crop growing bannayan et al 2011 increased precipitation provided an increased amount of water available for crop growth and finally lead to increasing crop yields et0 was significantly negatively correlated with wrccc in the whole basin et0 affected the water demand and consumption of crops resulting in a decline in crop production and awrcc the wrccc for four crops would reach a maximum value when the lt was a certain value in bc or xam during growing season as was shown in the fig 5 that in xam and bc was very sensitive to temperature the wrccc for wheat would reach maximum value when lt was 12 8 c and 14 6 c during the growing season respectively similar phenomenon could also be observed for the other three crops in recent decades the proportion of wheat planting in the nrb has decreased while those of maize and rice have increased forming a grain crop planting structure dominated by maize rice and soybean xie et al 2011 the correlation was significant between the crop planting proportion and wrccr under climate change in the nrb fig 10 there was an obvious threshold of planting proportion in hlbe dq bc and sy under which wrccr for rice was the highest value it indicated that it is reasonable to keep the planting proportion for rice between 50 and 55 in hlbe 10 and 12 in dq 18 19 in bc and 11 5 12 in sy compared with other crops rice consumes more water resources chen et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 in dq xam bc and sy where the drought intensity is high planting proportion increment of maize and reduction of rice will be beneficial to improve wrccr however water abundant regions can appropriately increase the cultivation proportion of rice to utilize the water resources such as in hh and qqhe meanwhile appropriate reductions in the proportion of wheat and soybean at the watershed scale would also be beneficial in increasing wrccr the expansion of the area under strong water demanding crops has directly led to a significant shrinkage of the wetland area in the nengjiang river basin so the proper adjustment of the agricultural cultivation structure according to the natural climatic conditions of each city will facilitate the synergistic development of agriculture and wetlands dong et al 2013 5 conclusions this study identified spatiotemporal changes in climatic factors during the crop growing season and their effects on the awrcc in the nrb based on the findings the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the climate change during the crop growing season in the nenjiang river basin is dramatic with a significant increasing trend for temperature especially the lowest temperature with a trend of 0 57 c 10a in the local region from 1961 to 2014 the drought index increased significantly first and then decreased which was consistent with the trend of the et0 2 it is an important index to evaluate the maximum crop production that a regional water resource can support without environmental degradation for the agricultural water resource carrying capacity which will be beneficial to optimizing the agricultural planting structure and protecting water resources different spatial distributions of wrccr were shown with a variation range of 0 22 0 76 kg m2 in the nrb and this index showed an increasing trend especially in the past decades 3 meteorological drought was significantly related to awrcc while lowest temperature precipitation and et0 were also both found to be key climate factors affecting awrcc the correlations between the crop planting proportion and wrccr under climate change were significant therefore adjusting the planting proportion of wheat soybean and rice and increasing that of maize would be conducive to improving the awrcc and facilitating the synergistic development of agriculture and wetlands in nrb author contributions p

4641,the agricultural water resource carrying capacity awrcc is affected by climate change now as never before however it is still unclear how the awrcc in high latitudes responses to climate change in this study spatiotemporal changes in climatic factors and awrcc during the crop growing season from 1961 to 2014 in the nenjiang river basin nrb a high latitude basin in china were identified via multivariate statistical analysis meanwhile the impact of climatic factors on awrcc was analyzed by using cross wavelet approaches and pearson correlational analysis the results showed that temperature has followed an increasing trend especially the lowest temperature during crop growing season with a trend of 0 57 10a in the local region there was no obvious change trend for precipitation but the interannual change was large the drought index increased first and then decreased which was consistent with the trend of the et0 different spatial distributions of water resource carrying for all crops in a region were shown with a variation range of 0 22 0 76 kg m2 in the nrb it is worth noting that awrcc showed an increasing trend especially in the past decade precipitation et0 and meteorological drought were all key driving factors affecting awrcc the correlation was significant between the crop planting proportion and awrcc under climate change moreover adjusting the planting proportion of wheat soybean and rice and increasing that of maize would be conducive to improving the awrcc and facilitating the synergistic development of agriculture and wetlands in nrb keywords climate change agricultural water resource carrying capacity food safety high latitudes 1 introduction the global average surface temperature increased by about 0 85 c from 1880 to 2012 which has posed a significant impact on agricultural production and water resources ipcc 2014 moreover this impact is still a main issue that the world has to deal with in the 21st century piao et al 2010 some related research has indicated that extreme climate events e g flood drought extreme precipitation occur frequently with climate change on a global scale particularly in intermediate and high latitude regions hay et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 there is no doubt that the long term fluctuation of crop yield was closely related to climate factors such as temperature and precipitation and extreme climate events e g flood and drought zhao et al 2015 it has been pointed out that the production of wheat and maize had reduced by 1 9 and 1 2 on a global scale respectively due to climate change ipcc 2014 recent studies also found that climate change has reduced crop yields by affecting the agricultural water resource carrying capacity yang et al 2021 morton 2007 based on the concept of water resource carrying capacity meadows et al 1972 the agricultural water resource carrying capacity awrcc is defined as the maximum crop production that a regional water resource can support without environmental degradation lu et al 2017 if extreme weather occurs it would have an important impact on awrcc lesk et al 2016 the disastrous consequences of climate change have aroused widespread concern among scientists lal 2004 howden et al 2007 future climate change will probably lead to more frequent and severe climatic issues he et al 2021 however the effect of climate change on awrcc is yet to be quantified morton 2007 nenjiang river basin nrb is located in china s northeast and it is one of the most important grain production bases as well as an important area distributed many wetlands located in a middle high latitude nenjiang river basin is sensitive to climate change significant increase in temperature and extreme precipitation has been proved in this basin du et al 2013 li et al 2019 and resulted in frequent floods and droughts which has a great impact on awrcc and then threaten national food security zhou et al 2020 according to the statistics by chinese agricultural department the average annual agricultural disaster area in northeast china is about 6 43 104km2 due to the lack of preventive measures against frequent extreme weather events and meteorological disasters guo et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to quantify the impact of climate change on agricultural production some previous studies have carried out the impact of climate change on food production in this region zhao et al 2015 guo et al 2017 and zhou et al 2020 however there is still a lack of relevant studies from the perspective of the awrcc this study was designed to 1 analyze the spatiotemporal variations of climatic factors and awrcc in the nrb 2 investigate the impact of climatic factors on the awrcc in the nrb from 1961 to 2014 and 3 identify the relationships between the water resource carrying capacity for a single crop and climatic factors and optimize planting structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nenjiang river basin is located within 44 50 n and 120 128 e fig 1 and its area is 29 7 104 km2 fig 1 the basin includes hulunbeier and xing anmeng in the inner mongolia autonomous region heihe suihua qiqihaer and daqing in heilongjiang province and baicheng and songyuan in jilin province table 1 this area is hot and rainy in summer and is cold and dry in winter influenced by the polar ocean air mass or denatured tropical ocean air mass the summer is dominated by easterly and southerly winds warm and rainy it is one of the major food production areas and the area of cultivated land is 8 28 104 km2 in nrb the crops are mainly rice maize wheat and soybean their growth seasons are all within the rainfall season the water demand at each crop growth stage is different monsoon climate variability and seasonal droughts have different effects on the crops within the eight regions huang and a i a s 2004 so it is important to understand the impact of climate change on crops related studies are also important for the ecological protection of wetlands 2 2 data the meteorological data were collected by 32 meteorological stations in the nrb from 1961 to 2014 the variables included the daily precipitation p evapotranspiration et0 average temperature at and the lowest and highest temperatures lt and ht http data cma cn crop yield per unit was collected from the respective statistical yearbooks of hlbe hh qqhe sh dq xam bc sy respectively fig 2 the data were strictly screened and sorted by state and the data were true and reliable 2 3 methods 2 3 1 drought index in this paper the widely applicable arid indicator ai the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation et0 p was used as the basis for the occurrence and classification of drought hulme 2010 the classification of meteorological drought was shown in table 2 the et0 was calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 3 2 agricultural water resource carrying capacity two indices were calculated for agricultural water resource carrying capacity water resource carrying capacity for a single crop wrccc and the water resource carrying for all crops in a region wrccr the wrccc was built to show the potential water productivity under limited agricultural water resources which was used to measures the green water resources during the growth season that could produce the maximum yield of crops under the current planting patterns meanwhile wrccr that is the maximum agricultural production is supported by the current water resources under the current technical economic and social conditions under the specifically regional climate conditions the maximum crop planting area carried by regionally agricultural water resources is a constant or slightly variable value the wrccc was calculated based on

used for demonstrating the temporal associations between the effects of climatic factors on the agricultural water resource carrying capacity the cross wavelet transform of the two time series x n and y n can be defined as wxy wxwy where stands for their complex conjugation their cross wavelet power is defined as wxy the complex parameter arg w xy can be considered as the local relative phase between x n and y n in time frequency space the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power and its background power spectra p k x and p k y for two time series can be referenced to torrence and compo 1998 and expressed as follows 6 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where zv p denotes the confident level associated with the probability p of a probability distribution function which is defined by the square root of the product of two χ 2 distributions the phase difference between the two time series over the basin with statistical significance above 5 was calculated as follows 7 a m arg x y with x i 1 n cos a i a n d y i 1 n sin a i where am is the circular mean of a set of phase angles ai i 1 2 n 3 results 3 1 variation characteristics in climate factors 1 spatial and temporal variations of temperature the average temperature was 19 08 c during the growing period of crops in the nrb from 1961 to 2014 the spatial distribution was relatively consistent for the average lowest and highest temperatures in the nrb that is the temperature in the mountainous area was low and that in the plain area was high during the growing period of crops fig 3 a c meanwhile the temperatures of each city showed an increasing trend for the average lowest and highest temperatures from 1961 to 2014 on the whole the lowest temperature increased most significantly in the nrb with a rate of about 0 57 c 10a table 4 2 temporal and spatial variations of precipitation the average precipitation was 389 95 mm during the growing period of crops in the nrb from 1961 to 2014 fig 3e the maximum value was 459 6 mm and the minimum value was 339 3 mm it was found that the precipitation variation had obvious spatial differences and generally showed a trend of more in the east and less in the west along with more in the north and less in the south the precipitation in hh and hlbe was obviously higher than that in other cities while that in bc sy and dq was obviously lower than that in other cities fig 3d at the same time except for that in bc and sy the precipitation in the cities presented a trend of increasing year by year the precipitation in sh and qqhe increased most significantly with a rate exceeding 6 9 mm 10a the decreasing trend of precipitation in bc was the most obvious with a rate exceeding 11 8 mm 10a table 4 3 temporal and spatial variations of et0 the average et0 was 593 99 mm during the growing period of crops in the nrb from 1961 to 2014 the et0 values of bc and sy were obviously higher than those of other cities and those of hh and part of hlbe were obviously lower than those of other cities across the entire nrb the maximum et0 was 691 7 mm in bc and the minimum et0 was 479 8 mm in hh fig 3e meanwhile downward trends in et0 were observed in bc sy dq sh and qqhe while upward trends were observed in hh hlbe and xam the maximum increasing trend of et0 was observed in hlbe exceeding 5 5 mm 10a and the maximum decreasing trend of et0 was observed in sh exceeding 20 9 mm 10a table 4 4 temporal and spatial variations in meteorological drought the drought index in the southern region was higher than that in the northern region while that in the eastern region was higher than that in the western region with a variation range of 1 13 2 24 table 4 the degrees of drought in bc and sy were obviously higher than those in other cities identifying these cities as having higher meteorological drought intensity fig 3f 3 2 variation characteristics of agricultural water resource carrying capacity the growing season for wheat and maize is from may to september and those for rice and soybean are from may to august and from june to september respectively in the nrb the crop water productivity was quite different between wheat and maize with values of 10 29 kg m3 and 13 93 kg m3 respectively on the one hand maize is a c4 crop crops with a c4 pathway in the fixation and assimilation of co2 by photosynthesis with high water use efficiency on the other hand the planting proportion of wheat was very small in the study areas although the precipitation during the growth season in hh hlbe and qqhe was roughly the same the water carrying capacities for crops were different moreover the wrccc was different among crops in the same city or for the same crops across the eight cities table 5 the average water capacities in the eight regions were 0 28 kg m2 0 47 kg m2 0 39 kg m2 and 0 23 kg m2 for wheat maize rice and soybean respectively different spatial distributions of wrccr were observed with a variation range of 0 22 0 76 kg m2 the wrccr values for xam hh and sh were significantly higher than those for the other cities on average the wrccr values in hlbe 0 26 kg m2 and dq 0 28 kg m2 were slightly smaller than those in bc 0 32 kg m2 and qqhe 0 32 kg m2 which were in turn far smaller than those in hh 0 42 kg m2 sh 0 42 kg m2 xam 0 48 kg m2 and sy 0 52 kg m2 it is worth noting that during the growth season precipitation was low in the study area but the water resource carrying capacity of rice was much higher than those of wheat and soybean because rice was irrigated extensively during its growth season moreover an increasing trend was also observed for the awrcc in each city fig 4 different spatial distributions of wrccr were shown with the variation range of 0 22 0 76 kg m2 the wrccr of xam hh and sh was significantly higher than that of other cities on average wrccr in hlbe 0 26 kg m2 and dq 0 28 kg m2 was slight smaller than that in bc 0 32 kg m2 and qqhe 0 32 kg m2 which was far smaller than hh 0 42 kg m2 sh 0 42 kg m2 xam 0 48 kg m2 and sy 0 52 kg m2 it is worth noting that the water resource carrying capacity in rice during growth reason precipitation was small in study area while itwas much higher in wheat and soybean because rice was irrigated extensively during its growth season moreover an increasing trend was also shown for the awrcc at each city fig 4 3 3 effects of climatic factors on the agricultural water resource carrying capacity based on the results of wavelet coherence the time frequency relationships and phase angles between climatic factors and wrccr in nrb were shown in fig 5 the dynamic of the wrccr showed a correlation at the 5 significance level with that of climatic factors for the eight cities throughout the entire study period which were the areas surrounded by black lines in fig 5 it should be noted that p et0 and ai had stronger correlations with wrccr than other climatic factors these features indicated that these three factors had a strong effect on wrccr during the entire study period in other words the response of wrccr to these three factors was significant in these time scales aside from the relevant time scales mentioned above more local correlations between wrccr and climatic factors were found via the wtc method for the eight cities during the entire study period table 6 correlations with a 5 significance level were shown with different ranges 3 4 relationships between the agriculture water resource carrying capacity for crops and climatic factors the correlations between the water resource carrying capacities of four crops wheat maize rice and soybean and climate factors were analyzed as follows it is worth noting that wrccc values and their sensitivity to climatic factors were different for the same crop across the different cities the sensitivity to climatic factors was also different for different crops in the same city figs 6 9 meanwhile the wrccc values for the four crops were positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with other climatic factors figs 6 9 that was to say wrccc values for the four crops were greater with increasing precipitation but decreased with the increase of other climatic factors during the growing season relatively speaking the correlations between p et0 and ai and wrccc were stronger than those for other climatic factors 1 as shown in fig 6 except for qqhe and hh the wrccc for wheat in the remaining cities was very sensitive to p and et0 in general the wrccc for wheat showed a significant positive correlation with precipitation and a significant negative correlation with et0 and ai when a mild drought occurred the wrccc for wheat was significantly affected and when a moderate drought occurred the wrccc for wheat would decline rapidly the effect of temperature was complex on the wrccc for wheat with some cities showing a non linear correlation such as that in xam and bc was very sensitive to temperature with peaks occurring when lt was 12 8 c and 14 6 c during the growing season respectively 2 as shown in fig 7 the wrccc for maize was more sensitive to p et0 and ai than to other climatic factors in the watershed scale this index for maize was significantly positively correlated with precipitation and significantly negatively correlated with et0 and ai the effect of temperature was also complex on the wrccc for maize some of them could not indeed be positively or negatively correlated at the watershed scale xam and bc were more sensitive to temperature than other cities especially to the lt the wrccc for maize would peak when the lt was 12 7 c in xam and 14 7 c in bc during growing season respectively this index in hh qqhe and dq was most sensitive to et0 however this index for maize in sh and sy was most sensitive to ai when a mild drought occurred the wrccc for maize was significantly affected when a severe drought occurred the wrccc for maize was only 0 2 kg m2 or less 3 as shown in fig 8 regional differences in the correlation between wrccc for rice and climatic factors were significant although affected by irrigation this index for rice was still very sensitive to climate factors the wrccc for rice was also more sensitive to p et0 and ai than to other climatic factors in the watershed scale this index for rice was also significantly positively correlated with precipitation and significantly negatively correlated with et0 and ai the effect of temperature was also complex on the wrccc for rice the index in bc was more sensitive to lt than that of other cities the wrccc for maize would peak when the lt was 14 6 in bc during growing season this index in hh dq and xam was most sensitive to et0 moreover this index for rice in qqhe and sh and sy was most sensitive to ai when a mild drought occurred the wrccc for rice was significantly affected when a moderate drought occurred the wrccc for rice was only 0 2 kg m2 or less 4 as shown in fig 9 regional differences in the correlation between wrccc for soybean and climatic factors were also significant the wrccc for soybean was also more sensitive to p et0 and ai than to other climatic factors in the watershed scale this index for soybean was also significantly positively correlated with precipitation and significantly negatively correlated with et0 and ai the effect of temperature was also complex on the wrccc for soybean except for some cities the index for rice showed a negative correlation with temperature the wrccc for soybean in xam was more sensitive to lt than that of other cities the wrccc for soybean would peak when the lt was 12 8 c in bc during growing season in addition this index in hh qqhe and xam was most sensitive to et0 moreover this index for soybean in sh bc and sy was most sensitive to ai when a mild drought occurred the wrccc for soybean was significantly affected when a moderate drought occurred the wrccc for rice was only 0 1 kg m2 or less 4 discussion 4 1 the spatiotemporal variation of climate factors and agricultural water resource carrying capacity global climate change has become an indisputable fact and will continue in the future especially in the middle and high latitudes ipcc 2014 pahl wostl 2007 some studies have indicated significant climate change in the middle high latitude northeast china du et al 2013 where

a trend of 0 57 c 10a in qqhe there was no obvious trend for precipitation but the interannual fluctuation was significant the drought index increased first and then decreased which was consistent with the trend of et0 these changes may be related to global carbon dioxide emissions lal 2004 deng et al 2021 and underlying surface changes liu et al 2017 as a result of the complex climate change in crop growing season the phenomenon of flood drought encounter was particularly significant in the nrb leading to extremely adverse effect on awrcc the awrcc is an important index for evaluating the maximum crop production that a regional water resource can support without environmental degradation relevant research will be beneficial to optimizing the agricultural planting structure and protecting water resources he et al 2021 lu et al 2017 however the awrcc has not been given enough attention in nrb which is one of china s main grain producing areas in this study two indices the wrccc and wrccr were calculated to investigate the awrcc in the nrb the average wrccc values across the eight cities were 0 28 kg m2 0 47 kg m2 0 39 kg m2 and 0 23 kg m2 for wheat maize rice and soybean respectively wrccr exhibited obvious spatial differences with a range of 0 22 0 76 kg m2 in the nrb it is worth noting that awrcc showed an increasing trend especially in the past decade this may be related to the improvement of crop varieties or changes in climatic factors such as the decrease in et0 shi et al 2021 piao et al 2010 4 2 effects of climatic factors on the awrcc it is well known that climatic factors play an important role in the awrcc zipper et al 2016 piao et al 2010 in particular the impact of extreme climate on agriculture was more serious lesk et al 2016 lu et al 2017 showed that there was a significant correlation between meteorological drought and awrcc in the nrb wrccc for four crops exhibited a significant decreasing trend with increasing meteorological drought intensity this phenomenon was particularly obvious for the whole nrb the wrccc for four crops was significantly decreased when a mild drought occurred and was only 0 2 kg m2 or less when a severe drought occurred wrccc and its sensitivity to the drought index varies among different crops in the same city or among different cities for the same crop because of variation in climate and crop water use efficiency wang et al 2014 however meteorological drought was not the only factor lt p and et0 were also all found to be key climate factors affecting awrcc in some cities precipitation was significantly positively correlated with wrccc for four crops because a large amount of precipitation was needed to maintain the growth of crops in the early stage of crop growing bannayan et al 2011 increased precipitation provided an increased amount of water available for crop growth and finally lead to increasing crop yields et0 was significantly negatively correlated with wrccc in the whole basin et0 affected the water demand and consumption of crops resulting in a decline in crop production and awrcc the wrccc for four crops would reach a maximum value when the lt was a certain value in bc or xam during growing season as was shown in the fig 5 that in xam and bc was very sensitive to temperature the wrccc for wheat would reach maximum value when lt was 12 8 c and 14 6 c during the growing season respectively similar phenomenon could also be observed for the other three crops in recent decades the proportion of wheat planting in the nrb has decreased while those of maize and rice have increased forming a grain crop planting structure dominated by maize rice and soybean xie et al 2011 the correlation was significant between the crop planting proportion and wrccr under climate change in the nrb fig 10 there was an obvious threshold of planting proportion in hlbe dq bc and sy under which wrccr for rice was the highest value it indicated that it is reasonable to keep the planting proportion for rice between 50 and 55 in hlbe 10 and 12 in dq 18 19 in bc and 11 5 12 in sy compared with other crops rice consumes more water resources chen et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 in dq xam bc and sy where the drought intensity is high planting proportion increment of maize and reduction of rice will be beneficial to improve wrccr however water abundant regions can appropriately increase the cultivation proportion of rice to utilize the water resources such as in hh and qqhe meanwhile appropriate reductions in the proportion of wheat and soybean at the watershed scale would also be beneficial in increasing wrccr the expansion of the area under strong water demanding crops has directly led to a significant shrinkage of the wetland area in the nengjiang river basin so the proper adjustment of the agricultural cultivation structure according to the natural climatic conditions of each city will facilitate the synergistic development of agriculture and wetlands dong et al 2013 5 conclusions this study identified spatiotemporal changes in climatic factors during the crop growing season and their effects on the awrcc in the nrb based on the findings the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the climate change during the crop growing season in the nenjiang river basin is dramatic with a significant increasing trend for temperature especially the lowest temperature with a trend of 0 57 c 10a in the local region from 1961 to 2014 the drought index increased significantly first and then decreased which was consistent with the trend of the et0 2 it is an important index to evaluate the maximum crop production that a regional water resource can support without environmental degradation for the agricultural water resource carrying capacity which will be beneficial to optimizing the agricultural planting structure and protecting water resources different spatial distributions of wrccr were shown with a variation range of 0 22 0 76 kg m2 in the nrb and this index showed an increasing trend especially in the past decades 3 meteorological drought was significantly related to awrcc while lowest temperature precipitation and et0 were also both found to be key climate factors affecting awrcc the correlations between the crop planting proportion and wrccr under climate change were significant therefore adjusting the planting proportion of wheat soybean and rice and increasing that of maize would be conducive to improving the awrcc and facilitating the synergistic development of agriculture and wetlands in nrb author contributions p

4642,in the largely dry and increasingly heavily populated western us operational modeling systems for seasonal river runoff volume forecasting are key elements of the practical water and hydropower management infrastructure explainability of model results in terms of known hydroclimatic processes and conditions is a core requirement for these systems to improve geophysical interpretability of a standard statistical modeling approach to operational water supply forecasting wsf we introduce a hybrid statistical artificial intelligence method the procedure involves using a recently developed unsupervised machine learning algorithm designed for improved explainability non negative matrix factorization with k means clustering nmfk to extract a compact basin scale hydroclimatic index from available precipitation and snowpack data that index is then used as the predictor variate in a largely conventional probabilistic regression on seasonal water supply the resulting method dominant signal nmfk regression is applied to a challenging forecast site the owyhee river drawn from the us department of agriculture natural resources conservation service wsf system outcomes demonstrate that improved interpretability and plausibility relative to conventional statistical methods are achieved through physical consistency of nmfk results with nonnegativity of the environmental data being analyzed in particular the nonnegativity property facilitates identifying potential geophysical relationships to input variable type snow water equivalent vs accumulated precipitation location and underlying hydrologic processes and it encourages nonnegative river runoff predictions improving physical realism of wsfs over conventional statistical approaches in certain cases the method also offers straightforward interpretation of relationships to known forms of climate variability however testing suggests that with these capabilities come limitations its primary anticipated role at present is to augment geophysical interpretation when needed by serving as a complement alongside other methods in a next generation us west wide operational forecasting system keywords explainable machine learning water resources management hydropower river forecasting regression probabilistic prediction 1 introduction as margins between water supply and demand continue to narrow in the mostly dry american west loosely defined as the us westward of the great plains the importance of maximizing efficiency of the region s massive river management infrastructure around drinking irrigation and industrial water supplies and hydropower grows in this region water supply forecasts wsfs refer to quantitative model predictions of boreal spring summer total river flow volume at a given location of interest typically issued once per month or for some locations more often beginning the preceding autumn or winter and continuing through late spring or early summer such forecasts of forthcoming seasonal water supply availability based largely on measurements of the winter spring mountain snowpack that provides much of the region s river flow volumes have long been a crucial requirement for the water resource optimization process methods for generating these hydrologic forecasts fall into two general categories process simulation models that aim to explicitly represent the underlying physics of watershed scale runoff generation and data driven phenomenological models that account for the physics implicitly using empirical input output mappings of predictors to predictands a tremendous variety of specific models with a wide range of complexity and applicability fall under these broad umbrellas see reviews and syntheses by for example singh and woolhiser 2002 perkins et al 2009 gelfan and motovilov 2009 bourdin et al 2012 weber et al 2012 cunderlik et al 2013 hrachowitz and clark 2017 fleming and gupta 2020 even modest incremental improvements in wsf skill can reap tens to hundreds of millions of dollars of public benefit per year for a single river basin in the western us yao and georgakakos 2001 hamlet et al 2002 consequently there has been intense interest in improving the prediction accuracy of wsf models in this and adjacent regions e g garen 1998 mahabir et al 2003 hsieh et al 2003 wood and lettenmaier 2006 kennedy et al 2009 gobena and gan 2009 2010 rosenberg et al 2011 gobena et al 2013 robertson et al 2013 fleming and dahlke 2014 demargne et al 2014 pagano et al 2009 trubilowicz et al 2015 harpold et al 2016 najafi and moradkhani 2016 mendoza et al 2017 lehner et al 2017 fleming and goodbody 2019 another crucial aspect of wsf beyond improving predictive accuracy however is geophysical interpretation of modeling methods and results this issue may be particularly significant in the operational hydrologic forecasting community by which we mean large institutions particularly but not exclusively government agencies tasked with routine generation and distribution of wsfs used for responsible and sometimes high stakes decision making in the public interest with corresponding institutional accountabilities for the reliability and timeliness of that information the ability to readily determine how model behaviors relate to physical hydrologic processes is necessary for meeting professional responsibilities around assessing and communicating the reliability of forecasts used for these high impact decisions and for verification diagnostics more broadly physical interpretability is also critically important for explaining key aspects of the forecasts to clients who often include the general public such as why a river volume prediction increased or decreased and by how much since the last forecast date such readily communicated hydroclimatological storylines go beyond simply improving client relations runoff volume forecasts at some locations in the western us are requirements specified in legislation legal decisions or international treaties like various biological opinions biops and the columbia river treaty which govern water management in certain high stakes basins and are therefore subject to intense public and even political scrutiny physical interpretability is therefore a key design criterion for all operational wsf systems including those based on statistical and machine learning methods e g garen 1992 weber et al 2012 fleming and goodbody 2019 achieving such geophysical explainability in a practical wsf system can be challenging even process simulation models which have the advantage of explicitly capturing geophysical processes can suffer from interpretability issues a well known example is equifinality of predictions produced by different representations or parameterizations of the underlying physics e g beven and binley 1992 beven 2006 data driven methods can be still more susceptible statistical regression models are the most widely used wsf technique operationally in western north america due to intrinsically much lower modeling system development and operation costs similar or better forecast skill easier incorporation of emerging new data types greater operational simplicity and robustness and easier and more accurate estimates of forecast uncertainty relative to process based methods e g gobena and gan 2010 gobena et al 2013 risley et al 2005 fleming and dahlke 2014 hsieh et al 2003 grantz et al 2005 harpold et al 2016 regonda et al 2006 rosenberg et al 2011 pagano et al 2014 minxue et al 2016 moradkhani and meier 2010 mendoza et al 2017 robertson et al 2013 however these logistical and prediction performance advantages can be partially offset by less explicit representation of underlying physical processes additionally wsf interpretability considerations for modern data driven methods based on machine learning intersect with more acute and much wider questions around the ostensibly black box nature of these techniques exploration of machine learning for river flow modeling began 25 years ago hsu et al 1995 minns and hall 1996 but in spite of significant ongoing advances e g lima et al 2017 kratzert et al 2018 machine learning has largely failed to transition into production systems e g abrahart et al 2012 fleming and gupta 2020 in particular river forecasting applications of ai to date have consisted almost exclusively of research studies with a narrow emphasis on improved simulation accuracy as expressed in terms of some conventional goodness of fit metric with little attention to improving explainability this has been a key reason for lack of uptake of machine learning by the operational community e g abrahart et al 2012 fleming et al 2015 fleming and goodbody 2019 such obstacles are gradually proving surmountable for example the artificial intelligence ai community is responding to explainability concerns with a major ongoing drive to develop glass box machine learning in environmental and geophysical applications there is a limited but well established track record of using ai to discover and explain governing physical processes e g cannon and mckendry 2002 fleming 2007 kratzert et al 2019 ellenson et al 2020 additionally in hydrologic prediction new machine learning based systems are being developed and implemented in such a way that they explicitly incorporate and obey domain specific expert hydrometeorological knowledge e g fleming et al 2015 cannon 2018 fleming and goodbody 2019 oh and orth 2019 xu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 amounting to a form of theory guided machine learning karpatne et al 2017 we contribute to this process of improving the geophysical trustworthiness and explainability of data driven operational wsf models by introducing a new hybrid method the technique pairs an established statistical regression modeling approach with a new unsupervised machine learning technique nonnegative matrix factorization with k means clustering nmfk vesselinov et al 2018 for hydroclimatic signal extraction as discussed below nmfk was specifically created around the need for physical plausibility and interpretability we then apply the resulting wsf method dominant signal nmfk regression to a particularly complex and difficult forecast site within the wsf system operated by the national water and climate center of the us department of agriculture s natural resources conservation service nrcs this is the largest stand alone wsf system in the american west with approximately 600 forecast locations in the colorado columbia missouri rio grande and other basins and to our knowledge it is the world s largest statistically based operational wsf system for relevance to the operational wsf problems that are our primary focus the implementation here approximately follows standard practices for setting up such systems in western north america including predictor and predictand choices we stress that the goal of our study is the relatively new topic of exploring novel techniques to improve hydroclimatic interpretation of machine learning based wsf models rather than the incremental accuracy improvements that have often been the focus of machine learning applications in hydrology and further that it is framed within the practical context of augmenting a well established production wsf system 2 experimental design and data 2 1 general problem setup to explore dominant signal nmfk regression in a realistic wsf context we set up the overall prediction problem in a manner similar to the existing nrcs forecast system which is in turn broadly similar to most other regression based operational wsf models in western north america this general structure is as follows the predictand is spring summer runoff volume which is usually measured at a us geological survey streamgage with adjustments as needed for upstream diversions or at some other hydrometric monitoring site predictors consist of snow water equivalent swe and wintertime to date accumulated precipitation measurements at mountain climate monitoring stations predominantly nrcs snotel or similar sites various other datasets like antecedent streamflow are occasionally used as supplemental predictors operationally but were not employed in this particular implementation consistent with the existing operational nrcs model for the study basin described below note that research on data driven wsf systems has extensively tested additional predictor types like remotely sensed swe gridded precipitation datasets seasonal scale numerical climate model forecasts and other products but so far these experimental predictors have not experienced significant operational adoption in statistical wsf models similarly to the limited extent that machine learning based wsf models have transitioned into genuinely operational wsf settings they use predictors similar to those in current generation statistical regression based wsf models to illustrate a typical regression based wsf model might predict on march 1 the upcoming april september cumulative flow volume at a given point on a given river using as predictors march 1 swe and october february total precipitation measured at snotel sites within or near the watershed upstream of the streamgage the number of such sites varies widely depending on the basin but about a half dozen to two dozen is roughly typical how these predictors are used in the regression procedure varies depending on the technique as described in section 3 5 below but as part of the modeling process the input datasets are usually amalgamated in some way into an index that serves as the actual regression predictor or to use the machine learning nomenclature a feature that is presented to the supervised learning algorithm we use the same standard approach here 2 2 owyhee river test case in the interest of conciseness and because the goal of dominant signal nmfk regression is to improve ability to identify and interpret relevant geophysical processes and relationships we mainly focus on a reasonably thorough exploration of results and interpretations for one watershed though generality is briefly examined in our assessment of capabilities and limitations in section 4 5 the owyhee river fig 1 is known from operational nrcs experience to be one of the more challenging forecast points in the western us with relatively low accuracy tendency of statistical models to occasionally generate physically unrealistic negative valued runoff predictions in dry years and nonstationary and non gaussian prediction residuals that complicate prediction interval estimation it is also relatively sparsely monitored compared to some other basins its headwaters lie in the remote mountains of northwestern nevada and southwestern idaho it flows northward through eastern oregon to empty into the snake river a major tributary of the international columbia river the region is semi arid and the annual hydrograph is dominated by spring runoff generated mainly by melting of wintertime mountain snowpack the us bureau of reclamation operates owyhee dam and its approximately 80 km long reservoir primarily to provide agricultural irrigation water we consider data from the us geological survey streamgage at rome oregon and precipitation and snowpack data across the upstream drainage area from the snotel network of remotely operated and telemetered snow and climate stations as an illustrative example that captures the main features of established operational wsf practices and therefore meaningfully tests the characteristics of dominant signal nmfk regression in an operational wsf context we take the forecast issue date to be april 1 our predictand is april july total accumulated river runoff volume and our predictors are wintertime to forecast date accumulated precipitation and forecast date swe at several snotel sites within and near the basin this gives a total of one predictand and 18 predictors table 1 for model training and testing a standard 30 year hydroclimatic normal period 1986 2015 is used this is also typical practice in operational wsf and reflects among other considerations trade offs between better model development using longer records vs modest available record lengths at many observation locations in the region see e g fleming and goodbody 2019 as such the input dataset is a matrix containing 30 samples of 18 variables and the output dataset is a vector of length 30 further details of this test case are provided by fleming and goodbody 2019 and the data are freely available at wcc sc egov usda gov reportgenerator 3 method 3 1 general the overall procedure for forming a prediction involves using nmfk to extract a compact basin scale hydroclimatic index from available precipitation and snowpack data and then using that index as the predictor variate in a probabilistic regression on seasonal water supply this process and other information from nmfk contribute to formation of geophysical interpretations details of the method and additional context including its relationships to data driven operational wsf methods in current widespread operational use are described below 3 2 non negative matrix factorization with k means clustering nmfk is an unsupervised learning method used for feature extraction from datasets that are inherently nonnegative and for which the identified features should in turn be nonnegative to be physically realistic and readily interpretable details on the nmfk algorithm and its implementation are discussed in alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 vesselinov et al 2018 and vesselinov et al 2019a 2019b the following is a brief summary let us define a nonnegative valued observational data matrix x of size n m where m is the number of observable variables and n is the number of samples of each variable over time the first step in nmfk analysis is to decompose the data matrix x into a nonnegative signal matrix w of size n k and nonnegative mixing matrix h of size k m 1 x w h where k is an unknown number of features present in the data that is hidden variables in other words a feature represents a time series of an unmeasurable master variable hidden in the data specifically the mixing matrix h describes sets of specific patterns across the variables and the signal matrix w combines all extracted features over time that is it represents time variability in how strongly the various patterns in h are expressed thus for example the i th i 1 k extracted feature hidden master variable is represented by two vectors in the w and h matrices respectively the i th signal column with length n and the i th length m mixing row vector nmfk is a form of blind source separation through multiplication of estimated w and h matrices we can obtain an estimate of x which is a reconstruction of the original data matrix the reconstruction would account for how the extracted signals in w are mixed as defined by h to obtain the original observable variables in x the optimal number of hidden signals k opt is unknown a priori and is estimated by performing a series of nonnegative matrix factorizations for different values of k k 1 2 d the maximum value d cannot exceed n or m this is achieved by minimizing the following objective function o based on the frobenius norm for all possible values of k 2 o x w h f for each k value in the range 1 2 d nonnegative matrix factorization is performed multiple times typically on the order of 1000 times based on random initial guesses for w and h matrices the best estimate of o for a given k from all these runs is applied to define the reconstruction error for each k value ε k the resulting multiple solutions of h or alternatively w typically it is preferred to cluster the smaller matrix are clustered into k clusters using a customized k means clustering during clustering we enforce the condition that each of the k clusters contain equal number of members which is equal to the number of performed multiple random runs e g 1000 solutions after clustering the average silhouette width s k is computed this metric vesselinov et al 2018 see also rousseeuw 1987 measures how well the random nmf solutions are clustered for given value of k the values of s k theoretically can vary from 1 to 1 typically s k declines sharply after an optimal number k opt is reached the k opt value is selected to be equal to the maximum number of signals that accurately reconstructs the observational data matrix x as estimated by ε k opt and the average silhouette width s k opt is close to 1 similar to principal component analysis pca and in contrast to classical nmf nmfk allows identification of the optimal number of features which are somewhat equivalent to basis vectors or eigenvectors nmfk analyses also lead to strictly additive features that are parts of the data paatero and tapper 1994 similar to classical nmf and in contrast to pca nmfk s ability to identify readily understandable features enables the discovery of new causal structures and unknown mechanisms hidden in the data cichocki et al 2009 nmfk and its multi dimensional version nonnegative tensor factorization ntfk have recently been used for various types of analyses on observational data and model outputs see above references note also that the nmfk ntfk algorithms allow for missing entries in the data matrix or tensor x and that the algorithms are capable of reconstructing such data gaps based on the signal mixing matrices extracted from the available data nmfk ntfk are also capable of estimating uncertainties associated with the number of features w and h estimates and reconstructions of x though these additional functionalities around missing data estimation and matrix uncertainty estimation are potentially useful in some contexts in this study we focus on leveraging the inherent interpretability advantages of nmfk by integrating it with the probabilistic regression methods more typically used in in wsf the nmfk algorithm is written in the julia language though patented by los alamos national laboratory open source code and documentation examples and tests are available online at http github com tensordecompositions nmfk jl we emphasize that the foregoing is only a brief conceptual summary of nmfk theoretical and numerical implementation details are non trivial and can be found in the references cited above 3 3 dominant signal nmfk regression the nmfk signal for i 1 which we refer to here as the dominant signal for x consisting of snow water equivalent swe and precipitation time series at various locations within a basin is taken to be an index of wintertime hydroclimatic conditions see discussion in section 2 and used as the predictor in a linear regression on spring summer runoff volume 3 v t β 0 β 1 i t where v is the expectation value of water supply volume in year t 1 n i is the nmfk derived basin scale hydroclimatic index i e the first column of w and β 0 β 1 are coefficients estimated by ordinary least squares ols with β 1 providing a measure of the unit sensitivity of flow to hydroclimatic variability to the extent it is captured by the available input datasets and the signal extraction algorithm prediction intervals and various goodness of fit metrics see below and section 4 5 were assessed using cross validated model predictions calculated largely following the widely used method of garen 1992 motivations for cross validation in data driven wsf modeling are that out of sample performance metrics better reflect true predictive skill than in sample measures and that record lengths are rarely sufficient in western north american wsf applications see section 2 to simply partition data into fully disjoint training and testing subsets of adequate lengths e g garen 1992 see also bergmeir and benitez 2012 syed 2011 koul et al 2018 the statistics and machine learning communities have developed many variants with the two data science branches sometimes adopting different philosophies e g bergmeir and benitez 2012 we followed standard practice for data driven operational wsf systems in the western us by using leave one out cross validation which experience has shown to provide a reliable estimate of prediction error e g garen 1992 pagano et al 2004 rosenberg et al 2012 lehner et al 2017 fleming and goodbody 2019 note also that empirical partial autocorrelation functions of regression residuals from v do not exhibit statistically significant serial dependence again typical of wsf problems in the western us e g garen 1992 fleming and goodbody 2019 most operational wsf systems are probabilistic by which is meant that the best estimate provided by regression or other methods is accompanied by prediction bounds in nrcs practice these are the 0 1 0 3 0 7 and 0 9 quantiles of a probability distribution centered at v which correspond respectively to the 90 70 30 and 10 exceedance probability flows a common heuristic method which is also widely applied in wsf assumes a stationary normal distribution with a standard deviation equal to the cross validated regression standard error or rmse e g garen 1992 hyndman and athanasopoulos 2013 ideally however these quantiles should be estimated with a probability model that can flexibly accommodate non gaussian and heteroscedastic regression residuals as these more complex error structures are seen for many nrcs basins including the owyhee river test case fleming and goodbody 2019 to do this we employ a modified version of the aforementioned heuristic that uses the box cox transform 4 y t ψ y t ψ 1 ψ ψ 0 ln y t ψ 0 where ψ is a parameter and y t ψ denotes the box cox transform of variable y at time t both the observed and model predicted cross validated hindcast time series of water supply volume are transformed into homoscedastic normally distributed data in this way the transformed datasets are then differenced to obtain the residual time series which is normally distributed in transform space the corresponding root mean square error rmse can therefore be used as a convenient approximate metric of the standard deviation of the transform space residuals the transform space α th quantile forecast is estimated as 5 q α v t ψ v t ψ z rmse cv ψ where z are corresponding z scores under the normal distribution and v t ψ is the transform of the best estimate of runoff an inverse box cox transform is applied to the result to obtain final estimates of the α th quantile prediction bounds this method generates around a deterministic best estimate model prediction confidence intervals that if needed are asymmetric about v show excessive kurtosis and have time variant widths or otherwise are gaussian and stationary this post hoc approach which appears to have been introduced to conceptual process simulation based hydrologic modeling by feyen et al 2008 and was adapted to data driven runoff volume forecasting with cross validation by fleming and goodbody 2019 is superficially similar to but fundamentally different from the use of predictand transforms including the box cox transform prior to model building e g garen 1992 wang et al 2012 regression modeling was performed in the r scientific computing environment forward and inverse box cox transforms were performed using the forecast r package hyndman 2017 which also estimates optimal ψ 3 4 comparison to standard statistical wsf methods additional regression models were developed using the same dataset described above but different methods composite index regression and principal component regression pcr these are the two most common approaches for statistically based operational wsf in western north america and serve as meaningful points of comparison pcr uses principal component analysis pca to address dimensionality and multicollinearity it was adapted to wsf by nrcs garen 1992 and forms the primary basis for its official wsfs pca creates a new set of variables obtained by projecting the original data onto a new orthogonal coordinate system defined by eigenvectors of the data correlation matrix the resulting principal component scores are mutually uncorrelated and are used as possible predictors in an otherwise conventional regression in nrcs experience the leading pca mode typically contains at least roughly 70 or often much more of the input dataset total variance and captures overall year to year variability in winter spring snowpack available for spring summer runoff generation higher modes are occasionally retained for some basins for most rivers however the leading mode is the only pca mode retained in the operational wsf regression model on the basis of t tests of regression significance for convenience we refer to this configuration as leading mode pcr in composite index regression dimensionality reduction and multicollinearity handling are accomplished by averaging together the input datasets for a given watershed this amounts to calculating the mean areal cumulative precipitation and snowpack across the basin on the basis of available station data the resulting index captures wintertime climatic inputs to the basin and is used as the sole predictor in a linear regression see garen 1992 the method is a de facto application of stacking which improves signal to noise ratio by the square root of the number of input variables where signal in this context refers to the regionally coherent component of year to year climatic variability across all the input variable locations and types e g telford et al 1990 monteleoni et al 2011 fleming and barton 2015 more complex variants exist but can have disadvantages perkins et al 2009 garen 1992 for convenience we refer to regression of water supply upon an average of the input variables as simple index regression all three modeling frameworks considered invoke a similar overall architecture an index of wintertime hydroclimatic conditions is formed from snotel or other similar data which then serves as the predictor variate in a linear regression model they differ mainly in how the predictive index is created and of particular interest to us here how thoroughly or easily it can be interpreted in simple index regression no information about relationships between input variables is generated during index creation this restricts possibilities for interpretation without taking additional steps like correlation analyses in pcr the eigenvectors contain information about relationships between variates in the input data matrix that can be used to understand the final predictive model however such interpretation is hampered by two characteristics first there is normally no nonnegativity constraint and in general both the eigenvector and scores contain a mixture of positive and negative values second the signs on the eigenvectors and scores are mathematically arbitrary in the sense that one can multiply both by 1 and obtain the same net contribution to the total dataset variance and dynamics that is a positive valued eigenvector entry corresponding to a certain input variable may represent either an above or below average value of that variable depending on the arbitrary polarity of the scores time series in contrast typical operational wsf predictor variables swe and precipitation section 2 are strictly nonnegative so that negative valued pca results are physically unrealistic a consequence is that in wsf practice pca is normally treated only as a data pre processing trick to facilitate application of classical regression to multicollinear problems and detailed pca results e g eigenvectors are typically ignored during interpretation of pcr based wsf models in dominant signal nmfk regression the mixing matrix and signals provide information loosely akin to pca eigenvectors and scores in contrast however the nmfk mixing matrix and signals are nonnegative like the swe and precipitation datasets they represent they are therefore more physically realistic facilitating geophysical interpretation these potential improvements in physical explainability motivated our exploration of nmfk as an alternative feature extraction approach prior to regression modeling other advantages and disadvantages of dominant signal nmfk regression relative to standard statistical models grew clearer after application to the wsf test case these are discussed in section 4 5 3 5 post hoc analysis steps two additional analytical steps were performed during assessment and interpretation of results from dominant signal nmfk regression the first was a simple application of information theory to support preliminary geophysical interpretation of the mixing matrix for general background on information theory see shannon 1948 and pierce 1980 hydrologic applications include e g amorocho and espildora 1972 caselton and husain 1980 krasovskaia 1995 weijs et al 2010 fleming and dahlke 2014 and nearing and gupta 2015 the 18 mixing matrix entries for the leading signal are divided into three bins low middle high with category cutoffs equally spaced between the minimum and maximum values the shannon entropy is then calculated as σpi log2 pi where pi is the estimated probability that any given mixing matrix entry falls within the i th bin found by counting how many times entries fall within each bin this gives the information content in bits of the dominant signal entries in the mixing matrix the same category cutoffs are then used to calculate the probabilities and corresponding entropy only for those mixing matrix entries corresponding to snow data giving an estimate of the quantity of information provided by swe measurements as captured in the nmfk dominant signal the procedure is repeated again to find the information content of mixing matrix entries for the precipitation data alone implications of these results and caveats to their interpretation are discussed in section 4 3 additionally to test interpretability of the nmfk derived basin scale hydroclimatic index in terms of well established large scale climate patterns we examined relationships between it and publicly available indices for nine modes of climate variability known to be at least partially related to north american precipitation and snowpack spearman rank nonparametric correlation was used to robustly estimate statistical significance of linear and monotonically nonlinear associations without making distributional assumptions we consider el niño southern oscillation enso the pacific decadal oscillation pdo pacific north america pattern pna trans niño index tni north atlantic oscillation nao interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo arctic oscillation ao atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and north pacific gyre oscillation npgo note that these patterns are

comparing it to indices of atmosphere ocean oscillations for which hydrologic teleconnections in some regions of north america are already reasonably well known e g mantua et al 1997 garen 1998 hamlet

2005 as such the analysis is not exhaustive for instance though exploring other averaging intervals could be valuable we focus on wintertime to forecast date mean values of these large scale climate indices which corresponds to the seasonal timeframe of our basin scale nmfk index see section 2 similarly while enso has several indices which are in general closely correlated we use only niño 3 4 a common choice for enso teleconnection identification in water resource studies likewise certain climate oscillations may demonstrate parabolic teleconnections in some locations like enso in northern california e g wu et al 2005 fleming and dahlke 2014 but only linear and monotonically nonlinear relationships are considered here as again is common practice in hydroclimatic analysis 4 results and discussion 4 1 raw nmfk results for owyhee river test case nmfk identified three viable solutions for the data matrix described in section 2 containing kopt 2 3 and 6 signals cursory scoping regressions on water supply volume suggested that within each of these solutions signal i 1 i 1 k opt which we refer to as the dominant signal see above provided the best in sample wsf predictive ability the 2 signal nmfk solution was selected over the 3 and 6 signal solutions for the remainder of the analysis primarily because it provides a more compact and parsimonious representation of predictor dataset dynamics and secondarily because its dominant signal provided slightly better flow volume regression results raw results from the 2 signal nmfk solution are illustrated in fig 2 the mixing matrix entries for the dominant signal exhibit moderate heterogeneity across predictor variates and its signal correlates reasonably well r 0 74 with observed flow volumes the mixing matrix values for the second signal are considerably more heterogeneous and the corresponding signal correlates poorly r 0 13 with runoff volume as per section 3 3 the dominant signal was used as the predictor variate in the regression results are described in the remainder of section 4 below geophysical interpretations specifically of the signal time series and mixing matrix entries corresponding to the dominant nmfk signal are provided in sections 4 3 and 4 4 4 2 physical acceptability of runoff volume predictions observed and predicted runoff and associated prediction bounds are shown in fig 3 a notable feature is that the dominant signal nmfk regression based best estimate and its prediction bounds are without exception nonnegative application of regression methods to wsf in some arid or semi arid basins in the us west can lead to 90 exceedance flows and in some cases best estimates that are negative valued during dry years for discussion of these effects and why they occur see fleming and goodbody 2019 physically of course river runoff volume cannot take on negative values this is a known issue for the owyhee river forecast point in particular and the leading mode pcr and simple index regression models both produce negative valued best estimates at one or more sample times when applied to the identical dataset as dominant signal nmfk regression this makes the predictions from conventional statistical wsf methods unacceptable and in operational wsf practice using such techniques subjective choices and manual applications of predictand transforms are required to sidestep the problem when it occurs that nmfk by construction gives strictly nonnegative regression predictors does not guarantee nonnegative best estimate regression model predictions but it does seem to promote this required characteristic of a physically plausible data driven water supply forecast model 4 3 preliminary geophysical interpretation of nmfk mixing matrix maps fig 4 presents the dominant signal nmfk mixing matrix from fig 2 in map format to facilitate interpretation many of the precipitation and swe input variables are co located because they both come from the same snotel site blue dots on fig 4 so for convenience of visualization and interpretation the dominant signal mixing matrix entries are separated into maps corresponding to swe fig 4a and precipitation fig 4b input variables we emphasize however that all the dominant signal nmfk mixing matrix entries are a single vector which can be viewed as coefficients that weight the contributions of each input variable swe and precipitation measurements at various locations to the net dominant signal in the nmfk solution separation of the entries into those corresponding to swe versus precipitation is done only to facilitate viewing and interpretation long term average swe and precipitation fields across the watershed are also shown for reference on fig 4a and 4b respectively as are maps of topography fig 4c and mean air temperature fig 4d the sizes of the blue dots in fig 4a and 4b provide the magnitude of the corresponding mixing matrix entries these mixing matrix maps provide opportunities for physical interpretation of patterns detected by the nmfk algorithm the largest entries in the mixing matrix correspond to swe rather than precipitation this suggests that swe contributes more than precipitation to the dominant pattern primary hidden variable see section 3 2 that underlies the mixed swe precipitation spatiotemporal dataset which in turn seems intuitively reasonable swe data in some sense tell more about overall hydroclimatic conditions than total precipitation data alone as snowpack reflects the cumulative impact of several geophysical and biophysical controls including precipitation temperature wind speed forest canopy and so forth that the mixing matrix entries for precipitation are nearly uniform across sites whereas those for swe show significant variation further reinforces this notion that the swe data contain more information about underlying patterns of hydroclimatic variability in this watershed we can provide a back of the envelope quantitative representation of this effect using information theory following the methodology described in section 3 5 the shannon entropy of all 18 dominant signal mixing matrix entries is 1 1 bits the value rises to 1 4 bits if we use the same category cutoffs but calculate the probabilities and corresponding entropy only for mixing matrix entries corresponding to snow data repeating the procedure again for dominant signal mixing matrix entries corresponding to the precipitation data alone gives 0 bits as they all fall within the same bin this result should not be overinterpreted to mean precipitation data offer no additional value to a basin scale index of hydroclimatic variability beyond what snowpack data provide and more complex analysis steps could provide a more refined view of comparative information contents with these caveats in mind however the outcome does seem to support the physical interpretation above around snow data capturing more information about a wider variety of processes than precipitation as described in sections 2 and 3 as used here nmfk is applied to all the hydrometeorological input data to create an index of wintertime hydroclimatic conditions as such relationships to runoff volume are by construction not part of this first step in the dominant signal nmfk regression process it is nevertheless interesting to note that especially for an april 1 forecast date by which point seasonal snow accumulation has typically peaked swe is widely known by operational hydrologists to be a better predictor of runoff than wintertime to date precipitation that is the nmfk result that snow data captures more information than precipitation data is additionally consistent with the generally established fact that springtime snow data captures more information relevant to wsf than precipitation does the nmfk mixing matrix maps may also suggest hypotheses to help explain spatial structure in this underlying variability pattern for instance many of the larger mixing matrix entries correspond to higher elevation snotel sites these generally experience greater spring snowpack than lower elevation sites and therefore dominate overall basin scale water availability and thus its year to year variability conversely one of the largest mixing matrix entries corresponds to snowpack at mud flat near the northeastern boundary of the watershed which is a relatively warm low elevation location that on average experiences complete melting of the seasonal snowpack in early april several weeks before most of the other snotel sites considered here thus swe data at this site might amount to a de facto snow presence absence indicator on the april 1 measurement date used here and in turn as a powerful index of high versus low snow years potentially making a large contribution to the overall basin scale hydroclimatic signal these nmfk implied hypotheses could form a basis for additional research on how different input data types and locations contribute to overall basin wide hydroclimatic signal indexing and predictive value in water supply forecasting note that simple index regression cannot suggest any such interpretations around the underlying patterns in the dataset and hypotheses for their physical origins similarly the eigenvector in leading mode pca can be physically interpreted but in practice it presents more barriers to doing so than the nmfk mixing matrix because both magnitude and polarity need to be taken account by the interpreter section 3 4 in contrast the nmfk mixing matrix streamlines interpretation because it is strictly nonnegative like the environmental data types it represents and only magnitude of the entries needs to be taken into account by the hydrologic scientist or engineer this relative simplicity is particularly valuable if the model development and interpretation process may have to be repeated dozens or in the nrcs system hundreds of times across sites 4 4 preliminary geophysical interpretation of nmfk dominant signal the precipitation and swe based nmfk dominant signal represents year to year watershed scale cryospheric and meteorological variability such expressions of interannual to interdecadal climate variation in turn generally tend to reflect net superposition of several organized modes of large scale coupled ocean atmosphere circulation patterns these modes provide a well established basis for framing investigations of water resource variations in both explanatory and predictive contexts e g redmond and koch 1991 mantua et al 1997 garen 1998 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 werner et al 2004 hsieh et al 2006 fleming et al 2006 moradkhani and meier 2010 gobena et al 2013 fleming and dahlke 2014 beckers et al 2016 interpretability of the nmfk derived basin scale hydroclimatic index in terms of these circulation patterns was therefore examined using the methods and data discussed in section 3 5 fig 5 illustrates the nmfk dominant signal from fig 2 alongside the large scale climate indices which for purposes of visual comparison have been rescaled to the interval 0 1 in this graphic we found clear statistical evidence p 0 05 and occasionally p 0 01 for monotonic correlations between the nmfk basin scale hydroclimatic index and enso pdo tni and ipo conclusive p 0 05 statistical evidence was not found for associations with nao pna and amo though this does not preclude the presence of subtle teleconnections to one or more of these patterns that might be unambiguously identified using longer observational records or alternative averaging intervals for example there was no statistical support in this case for ao and npgo teleconnections overall the set of teleconnection analysis results is broadly consistent with prior work in western north america and in particular the southern columbia basin e g mantua et al 1997 garen 1998 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 kennedy et al 2009 gobena et al 2013 fleming and dahlke 2014 enfield et al 2001 kingston et al 2006 mccabe et al 2004 pascolini campbell et al 2015 vincent et al 2015 wu et al 2005 note that for each of those climate patterns demonstrating statistically significant relationships to the nmfk index enso pdo ipo and tni the corresponding linear correlation coefficient is as high as for enso or higher than for pdo ipo and tni the average of the correlation coefficients between the respective climate pattern and each of the 18 input variables overall the results demonstrate that like indices of watershed scale wintertime precipitation and snowpack conditions derived using other methods such as pca explanations of interannual variability in the dominant signal nmfk index can be easily and clearly framed in reference to specific known hemispheric to global scale climate processes 4 5 capabilities and limitations considered collectively the results show that dominant signal nmfk regression generates intermediate analytical products refer again to figs 4 and 5 and sections 4 3 and 4 4 and final wsf predictions fig 3 and section 4 2 that meet or beat the physical interpretability and for runoff predictions also the physical plausibility of statistical wsf models of the general types conventionally used in operational wsf for the western us the outcomes are broadly consistent with expectations based on how these various modeling approaches are structured section 3 4 note that we have focused on an apples to apples comparison of several index based linear regression modeling methods based on exactly the same input data with the only free experimental parameter being the approach used for feature extraction other regression and regression like methods are available for the supervised learning component of data driven wsf including far more complex machine learning approaches as are optimization methods for input variable selection such as tree based search methods and genetic algorithms e g garen 1992 fleming and goodbody 2019 some of these techniques can significantly improve predictive performance in terms of both summary goodness of fit measures and physical reliability and in some cases explainability these could in principle be combined with nmfk based feature extraction as a result the outcomes presented here provide a pessimistic assessment of the values of the approaches used including dominant signal nmfk regression however testing also revealed limitations and drawbacks interestingly improvements in a priori physical basis geophysical interpretability and geophysical plausibility come at the price of poorer cross validated section 3 3 statistical goodness of fit metrics table 2 measures considered here include root mean square error rmse which is similar to regression standard error and provides a measure of the typical prediction error that might be expected from the model correlation coefficient r and coefficient of determination r 2 where the former describes how faithfully the predictions reproduce patterns of interannual variability in observed flow volumes and the latter gives the proportion of variance explained by the model and ranked probability skill score rpss a measure of the probabilistic skill of the model framed in terms of its ability relative to a naïve climatology forecast to predict the probability of dry normal or wet years as defined by terciles of the observed flow volumes e g wiegel et al 2007 guihan 2014 fleming and goodbody 2019 however these conventional accuracy metrics do not penalize the non physical predictions made by the standard statistical models or reward the physical acceptability of predictions made by dominant signal nmfk regression this limits the ability of such measures to meaningfully describe and diagnose model quality in this application see again section 4 2 broad based quantitative fitness for purpose rankings of hydrologic models are complex include subjective components and are best formed in competitive team evaluation processes beyond the scope of the current paper see cunderlik et al 2013 nevertheless a more comprehensive and balanced portrayal of model performance is provided in table 2 by additionally noting whether the model predicted best estimates and the lowest of the associated prediction intervals considered in standard wsf applications section 3 3 meet the physicality requirement of being nonnegative for all available sample times in this broader view the dominant signal nmfk regression performance results are more mixed compared to conventional methods additionally though nonnegativity of nmfk outcomes matches the physical characteristics of typical wsf predictors and therefore simplifies and thus encourages deeper interpretations relative to the more conventional alternative of pca see sections 3 4 and 4 3 it bears noting that nonnegativity is not a strict requirement for such interpretation there is a long history of geophysically interpreting eigenvectors derived from pca of fundamentally nonnegative hydrologic quantities examples include watershed regime classification or detecting the impacts of climatic variability and change on streamflow e g bartlein 1982 guetter and georgakakos 1993 lins 1997 fleming et al 2006 nmfk only makes this interpretive process more intuitive and accessible the physical interpretability advantages of nmfk are also premised on the exclusive use of nonnegative wsf predictors this is consistent with most operational wsf practices in the us west as standard statistical wsf predictors are swe precipitation and in some cases antecedent streamflow all of which are strictly nonnegative that said some additional predictor types that have seen extensive experimentation and occasional operational implementation may not be nonnegative for instance though not currently used in its production systems enso indices were introduced into long lead time us west operational forecasting by nrcs as a de facto early season surrogate for winter precipitation and snow data garen 1998 and have also been operationally adopted elsewhere e g gobena et al 2013 dominant signal nmfk regression is not directly applicable to mixed sign predictors although of course such predictors could be rescaled to render them nonnegative as in fig 5 another applicability question is associated with a distinct technical characteristic of nmfk unlike pca the suite of kopt signals in a nmfk solution are not mutually uncorrelated from a rigorous statistical modeling perspective using more than one of these multicollinear signals as candidate features for a multiple linear regression is therefore potentially problematic e g garen 1992 in the context of conventional linear statistical regression modeling then the wsf role of nmfk may be limited to creating a univariate watershed scale hydroclimatic index finally scoping applications to other rivers in the western us suggest that dominant signal nmfk regression is a generally viable wsf method but also that the strengths of its advantages and limitations as compared to standard statistical models vary between basins to illustrate consider another existing nrcs forecast point the yellowstone river at corwin springs located in the rocky mountain headwaters of the missouri basin similar to the owyhee river dominant signal nmfk regression provided serviceable but decreased performance on conventional goodness of fit metrics compared to simple index regression and pcr however conventional statistical regression models for yellowstone wsf do not produce negative valued predictions so the tendency of dominant signal nmfk regression to encourage physically realistic nonnegative volume predictions is irrelevant here unlike the owyhee river the nmfk mixing matrix entries for the dominant signal offered clear physical interpretations for the yellowstone river as it did for the owyhee river that said we should expect the resulting hydroclimatic storyline to differ from basin to basin depending on details of precipitation and swe monitoring sites predominant watershed scale terrestrial hydrologic processes overall climatic characteristics and potentially other factors in each basin this was seen to be the case for the yellowstone river the primary pattern in the dominant signal nmfk mixing matrix entries involved both swe and precipitation data from a single snotel site that stood apart from results for both swe and precipitation at all other sites this pattern presumably reflects local scale characteristics at the anomalous snotel station potentially including but not necessarily limited to its instrumentation local land cover land use or microclimate similar to the owyhee river the dominant nmfk signal for yellowstone showed correlations with various large scale climate indices consistent with established understanding of these teleconnections in western north america all things considered dominant signal nmfk regression provided useful interpretive insights into the yellowstone river but might be considered a somewhat less attractive candidate for operational wsf here than in the owyhee basin in the following section we discuss how the various capabilities and limitations described above may guide potential next steps for exploring the ways that dominant signal nmfk regression might be further developed and ultimately deployed in production systems for operational wsf 5 conclusions operational water supply forecasts are a cornerstone of water management in the largely arid us west ability to tell a hydrologically meaningful story around what the forecast models are telling us is a requirement for understanding and evaluating the models and communicating their outcomes to clients while ai has conventionally had a reputation as an uninterpretable black box recent advances in physics aware ai are changing that perception here we leverage one of these advances nmfk to improve geophysical plausibility and interpretability compared to traditional statistical models the result is a hybrid that pairs this new theory guided glass box unsupervised learning algorithm with a largely conventional statistical prediction model application demonstrates that it facilitates both easier geophysical interpretability and better geophysical plausibility than established data driven wsf methods this demonstration in combination with increasing interest in improving the physical interpretability of data driven wsf systems in turn suggests that continued research and development is warranted on using nmfk for feature extraction in wsf one possibility follows on the existence of multiple kopt signals as noted in section 4 5 these are not mutually independent possibly limiting their role as predictors in conventional multiple linear regression modeling however nmfk appears to reduce dimensionality very effectively and the compressed signals it generates may therefore prove useful as candidate features to a supervised machine learning based prediction system relating nmfk signals to seasonal flow volume such supervised ai methods like neural networks for instance do not strictly require feature independence but do typically benefit from reduced input data dimensionality as this in turn reduces the required size and complexity of the network topology and attendant training and interpretation complications we currently anticipate that the primary use of dominant signal nmfk regression is as a complement to rather than a replacement for established approaches within wsf systems the goal in doing so would be to provide additional geophysical interpretive information as needed for specific forecasting problems that require special attention such as particularly difficult forecast locations like the owyhee river we focused on here our intention is to experiment with integration of nmfk as an additional feature extraction technique alongside pca in a multi method machine learning metasystem that has been developed as the basis of the next generation of the us west wide nrcs operational wsf model fleming and goodbody 2019 more broadly our results seem to reinforce the value of practically minded and selective integrations of existing knowledge methods and processes with certain new machine learning techniques as they emerge to the extent that such techniques may fill certain specific known gaps in this particular case improving the physical interpretability of watershed scale hydroclimatic signal extraction this philosophy may suggest a template for investigating emergent ai technologies in the context of applied hydrometeorological prediction systems where a broad spectrum of quantitative and qualitative considerations including but extending far beyond prediction skill determine operational desirability of available modeling methods and guide design criteria e g weber et

4642,in the largely dry and increasingly heavily populated western us operational modeling systems for seasonal river runoff volume forecasting are key elements of the practical water and hydropower management infrastructure explainability of model results in terms of known hydroclimatic processes and conditions is a core requirement for these systems to improve geophysical interpretability of a standard statistical modeling approach to operational water supply forecasting wsf we introduce a hybrid statistical artificial intelligence method the procedure involves using a recently developed unsupervised machine learning algorithm designed for improved explainability non negative matrix factorization with k means clustering nmfk to extract a compact basin scale hydroclimatic index from available precipitation and snowpack data that index is then used as the predictor variate in a largely conventional probabilistic regression on seasonal water supply the resulting method dominant signal nmfk regression is applied to a challenging forecast site the owyhee river drawn from the us department of agriculture natural resources conservation service wsf system outcomes demonstrate that improved interpretability and plausibility relative to conventional statistical methods are achieved through physical consistency of nmfk results with nonnegativity of the environmental data being analyzed in particular the nonnegativity property facilitates identifying potential geophysical relationships to input variable type snow water equivalent vs accumulated precipitation location and underlying hydrologic processes and it encourages nonnegative river runoff predictions improving physical realism of wsfs over conventional statistical approaches in certain cases the method also offers straightforward interpretation of relationships to known forms of climate variability however testing suggests that with these capabilities come limitations its primary anticipated role at present is to augment geophysical interpretation when needed by serving as a complement alongside other methods in a next generation us west wide operational forecasting system keywords explainable machine learning water resources management hydropower river forecasting regression probabilistic prediction 1 introduction as margins between water supply and demand continue to narrow in the mostly dry american west loosely defined as the us westward of the great plains the importance of maximizing efficiency of the region s massive river management infrastructure around drinking irrigation and industrial water supplies and hydropower grows in this region water supply forecasts wsfs refer to quantitative model predictions of boreal spring summer total river flow volume at a given location of interest typically issued once per month or for some locations more often beginning the preceding autumn or winter and continuing through late spring or early summer such forecasts of forthcoming seasonal water supply availability based largely on measurements of the winter spring mountain snowpack that provides much of the region s river flow volumes have long been a crucial requirement for the water resource optimization process methods for generating these hydrologic forecasts fall into two general categories process simulation models that aim to explicitly represent the underlying physics of watershed scale runoff generation and data driven phenomenological models that account for the physics implicitly using empirical input output mappings of predictors to predictands a tremendous variety of specific models with a wide range of complexity and applicability fall under these broad umbrellas see reviews and syntheses by for example singh and woolhiser 2002 perkins et al 2009 gelfan and motovilov 2009 bourdin et al 2012 weber et al 2012 cunderlik et al 2013 hrachowitz and clark 2017 fleming and gupta 2020 even modest incremental improvements in wsf skill can reap tens to hundreds of millions of dollars of public benefit per year for a single river basin in the western us yao and georgakakos 2001 hamlet et al 2002 consequently there has been intense interest in improving the prediction accuracy of wsf models in this and adjacent regions e g garen 1998 mahabir et al 2003 hsieh et al 2003 wood and lettenmaier 2006 kennedy et al 2009 gobena and gan 2009 2010 rosenberg et al 2011 gobena et al 2013 robertson et al 2013 fleming and dahlke 2014 demargne et al 2014 pagano et al 2009 trubilowicz et al 2015 harpold et al 2016 najafi and moradkhani 2016 mendoza et al 2017 lehner et al 2017 fleming and goodbody 2019 another crucial aspect of wsf beyond improving predictive accuracy however is geophysical interpretation of modeling methods and results this issue may be particularly significant in the operational hydrologic forecasting community by which we mean large institutions particularly but not exclusively government agencies tasked with routine generation and distribution of wsfs used for responsible and sometimes high stakes decision making in the public interest with corresponding institutional accountabilities for the reliability and timeliness of that information the ability to readily determine how model behaviors relate to physical hydrologic processes is necessary for meeting professional responsibilities around assessing and communicating the reliability of forecasts used for these high impact decisions and for verification diagnostics more broadly physical interpretability is also critically important for explaining key aspects of the forecasts to clients who often include the general public such as why a river volume prediction increased or decreased and by how much since the last forecast date such readily communicated hydroclimatological storylines go beyond simply improving client relations runoff volume forecasts at some locations in the western us are requirements specified in legislation legal decisions or international treaties like various biological opinions biops and the columbia river treaty which govern water management in certain high stakes basins and are therefore subject to intense public and even political scrutiny physical interpretability is therefore a key design criterion for all operational wsf systems including those based on statistical and machine learning methods e g garen 1992 weber et al 2012 fleming and goodbody 2019 achieving such geophysical explainability in a practical wsf system can be challenging even process simulation models which have the advantage of explicitly capturing geophysical processes can suffer from interpretability issues a well known example is equifinality of predictions produced by different representations or parameterizations of the underlying physics e g beven and binley 1992 beven 2006 data driven methods can be still more susceptible statistical regression models are the most widely used wsf technique operationally in western north america due to intrinsically much lower modeling system development and operation costs similar or better forecast skill easier incorporation of emerging new data types greater operational simplicity and robustness and easier and more accurate estimates of forecast uncertainty relative to process based methods e g gobena and gan 2010 gobena et al 2013 risley et al 2005 fleming and dahlke 2014 hsieh et al 2003 grantz et al 2005 harpold et al 2016 regonda et al 2006 rosenberg et al 2011 pagano et al 2014 minxue et al 2016 moradkhani and meier 2010 mendoza et al 2017 robertson et al 2013 however these logistical and prediction performance advantages can be partially offset by less explicit representation of underlying physical processes additionally wsf interpretability considerations for modern data driven methods based on machine learning intersect with more acute and much wider questions around the ostensibly black box nature of these techniques exploration of machine learning for river flow modeling began 25 years ago hsu et al 1995 minns and hall 1996 but in spite of significant ongoing advances e g lima et al 2017 kratzert et al 2018 machine learning has largely failed to transition into production systems e g abrahart et al 2012 fleming and gupta 2020 in particular river forecasting applications of ai to date have consisted almost exclusively of research studies with a narrow emphasis on improved simulation accuracy as expressed in terms of some conventional goodness of fit metric with little attention to improving explainability this has been a key reason for lack of uptake of machine learning by the operational community e g abrahart et al 2012 fleming et al 2015 fleming and goodbody 2019 such obstacles are gradually proving surmountable for example the artificial intelligence ai community is responding to explainability concerns with a major ongoing drive to develop glass box machine learning in environmental and geophysical applications there is a limited but well established track record of using ai to discover and explain governing physical processes e g cannon and mckendry 2002 fleming 2007 kratzert et al 2019 ellenson et al 2020 additionally in hydrologic prediction new machine learning based systems are being developed and implemented in such a way that they explicitly incorporate and obey domain specific expert hydrometeorological knowledge e g fleming et al 2015 cannon 2018 fleming and goodbody 2019 oh and orth 2019 xu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 amounting to a form of theory guided machine learning karpatne et al 2017 we contribute to this process of improving the geophysical trustworthiness and explainability of data driven operational wsf models by introducing a new hybrid method the technique pairs an established statistical regression modeling approach with a new unsupervised machine learning technique nonnegative matrix factorization with k means clustering nmfk vesselinov et al 2018 for hydroclimatic signal extraction as discussed below nmfk was specifically created around the need for physical plausibility and interpretability we then apply the resulting wsf method dominant signal nmfk regression to a particularly complex and difficult forecast site within the wsf system operated by the national water and climate center of the us department of agriculture s natural resources conservation service nrcs this is the largest stand alone wsf system in the american west with approximately 600 forecast locations in the colorado columbia missouri rio grande and other basins and to our knowledge it is the world s largest statistically based operational wsf system for relevance to the operational wsf problems that are our primary focus the implementation here approximately follows standard practices for setting up such systems in western north america including predictor and predictand choices we stress that the goal of our study is the relatively new topic of exploring novel techniques to improve hydroclimatic interpretation of machine learning based wsf models rather than the incremental accuracy improvements that have often been the focus of machine learning applications in hydrology and further that it is framed within the practical context of augmenting a well established production wsf system 2 experimental design and data 2 1 general problem setup to explore dominant signal nmfk regression in a realistic wsf context we set up the overall prediction problem in a manner similar to the existing nrcs forecast system which is in turn broadly similar to most other regression based operational wsf models in western north america this general structure is as follows the predictand is spring summer runoff volume which is usually measured at a us geological survey streamgage with adjustments as needed for upstream diversions or at some other hydrometric monitoring site predictors consist of snow water equivalent swe and wintertime to date accumulated precipitation measurements at mountain climate monitoring stations predominantly nrcs snotel or similar sites various other datasets like antecedent streamflow are occasionally used as supplemental predictors operationally but were not employed in this particular implementation consistent with the existing operational nrcs model for the study basin described below note that research on data driven wsf systems has extensively tested additional predictor types like remotely sensed swe gridded precipitation datasets seasonal scale numerical climate model forecasts and other products but so far these experimental predictors have not experienced significant operational adoption in statistical wsf models similarly to the limited extent that machine learning based wsf models have transitioned into genuinely operational wsf settings they use predictors similar to those in current generation statistical regression based wsf models to illustrate a typical regression based wsf model might predict on march 1 the upcoming april september cumulative flow volume at a given point on a given river using as predictors march 1 swe and october february total precipitation measured at snotel sites within or near the watershed upstream of the streamgage the number of such sites varies widely depending on the basin but about a half dozen to two dozen is roughly typical how these predictors are used in the regression procedure varies depending on the technique as described in section 3 5 below but as part of the modeling process the input datasets are usually amalgamated in some way into an index that serves as the actual regression predictor or to use the machine learning nomenclature a feature that is presented to the supervised learning algorithm we use the same standard approach here 2 2 owyhee river test case in the interest of conciseness and because the goal of dominant signal nmfk regression is to improve ability to identify and interpret relevant geophysical processes and relationships we mainly focus on a reasonably thorough exploration of results and interpretations for one watershed though generality is briefly examined in our assessment of capabilities and limitations in section 4 5 the owyhee river fig 1 is known from operational nrcs experience to be one of the more challenging forecast points in the western us with relatively low accuracy tendency of statistical models to occasionally generate physically unrealistic negative valued runoff predictions in dry years and nonstationary and non gaussian prediction residuals that complicate prediction interval estimation it is also relatively sparsely monitored compared to some other basins its headwaters lie in the remote mountains of northwestern nevada and southwestern idaho it flows northward through eastern oregon to empty into the snake river a major tributary of the international columbia river the region is semi arid and the annual hydrograph is dominated by spring runoff generated mainly by melting of wintertime mountain snowpack the us bureau of reclamation operates owyhee dam and its approximately 80 km long reservoir primarily to provide agricultural irrigation water we consider data from the us geological survey streamgage at rome oregon and precipitation and snowpack data across the upstream drainage area from the snotel network of remotely operated and telemetered snow and climate stations as an illustrative example that captures the main features of established operational wsf practices and therefore meaningfully tests the characteristics of dominant signal nmfk regression in an operational wsf context we take the forecast issue date to be april 1 our predictand is april july total accumulated river runoff volume and our predictors are wintertime to forecast date accumulated precipitation and forecast date swe at several snotel sites within and near the basin this gives a total of one predictand and 18 predictors table 1 for model training and testing a standard 30 year hydroclimatic normal period 1986 2015 is used this is also typical practice in operational wsf and reflects among other considerations trade offs between better model development using longer records vs modest available record lengths at many observation locations in the region see e g fleming and goodbody 2019 as such the input dataset is a matrix containing 30 samples of 18 variables and the output dataset is a vector of length 30 further details of this test case are provided by fleming and goodbody 2019 and the data are freely available at wcc sc egov usda gov reportgenerator 3 method 3 1 general the overall procedure for forming a prediction involves using nmfk to extract a compact basin scale hydroclimatic index from available precipitation and snowpack data and then using that index as the predictor variate in a probabilistic regression on seasonal water supply this process and other information from nmfk contribute to formation of geophysical interpretations details of the method and additional context including its relationships to data driven operational wsf methods in current widespread operational use are described below 3 2 non negative matrix factorization with k means clustering nmfk is an unsupervised learning method used for feature extraction from datasets that are inherently nonnegative and for which the identified features should in turn be nonnegative to be physically realistic and readily interpretable details on the nmfk algorithm and its implementation are discussed in alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 vesselinov et al 2018 and vesselinov et al 2019a 2019b the following is a brief summary let us define a nonnegative valued observational data matrix x of size n m where m is the number of observable variables and n is the number of samples of each variable over time the first step in nmfk analysis is to decompose the data matrix x into a nonnegative signal matrix w of size n k and nonnegative mixing matrix h of size k m 1 x w h where k is an unknown number of features present in the data that is hidden variables in other words a feature represents a time series of an unmeasurable master variable hidden in the data specifically the mixing matrix h describes sets of specific patterns across the variables and the signal matrix w combines all extracted features over time that is it represents time variability in how strongly the various patterns in h are expressed thus for example the i th i 1 k extracted feature hidden master variable is represented by two vectors in the w and h matrices respectively the i th signal column with length n and the i th length m mixing row vector nmfk is a form of blind source separation through multiplication of estimated w and h matrices we can obtain an estimate of x which is a reconstruction of the original data matrix the reconstruction would account for how the extracted signals in w are mixed as defined by h to obtain the original observable variables in x the optimal number of hidden signals k opt is unknown a priori and is estimated by performing a series of nonnegative matrix factorizations for different values of k k 1 2 d the maximum value d cannot exceed n or m this is achieved by minimizing the following objective function o based on the frobenius norm for all possible values of k 2 o x w h f for each k value in the range 1 2 d nonnegative matrix factorization is performed multiple times typically on the order of 1000 times based on random initial guesses for w and h matrices the best estimate of o for a given k from all these runs is applied to define the reconstruction error for each k value ε k the resulting multiple solutions of h or alternatively w typically it is preferred to cluster the smaller matrix are clustered into k clusters using a customized k means clustering during clustering we enforce the condition that each of the k clusters contain equal number of members which is equal to the number of performed multiple random runs e g 1000 solutions after clustering the average silhouette width s k is computed this metric vesselinov et al 2018 see also rousseeuw 1987 measures how well the random nmf solutions are clustered for given value of k the values of s k theoretically can vary from 1 to 1 typically s k declines sharply after an optimal number k opt is reached the k opt value is selected to be equal to the maximum number of signals that accurately reconstructs the observational data matrix x as estimated by ε k opt and the average silhouette width s k opt is close to 1 similar to principal component analysis pca and in contrast to classical nmf nmfk allows identification of the optimal number of features which are somewhat equivalent to basis vectors or eigenvectors nmfk analyses also lead to strictly additive features that are parts of the data paatero and tapper 1994 similar to classical nmf and in contrast to pca nmfk s ability to identify readily understandable features enables the discovery of new causal structures and unknown mechanisms hidden in the data cichocki et al 2009 nmfk and its multi dimensional version nonnegative tensor factorization ntfk have recently been used for various types of analyses on observational data and model outputs see above references note also that the nmfk ntfk algorithms allow for missing entries in the data matrix or tensor x and that the algorithms are capable of reconstructing such data gaps based on the signal mixing matrices extracted from the available data nmfk ntfk are also capable of estimating uncertainties associated with the number of features w and h estimates and reconstructions of x though these additional functionalities around missing data estimation and matrix uncertainty estimation are potentially useful in some contexts in this study we focus on leveraging the inherent interpretability advantages of nmfk by integrating it with the probabilistic regression methods more typically used in in wsf the nmfk algorithm is written in the julia language though patented by los alamos national laboratory open source code and documentation examples and tests are available online at http github com tensordecompositions nmfk jl we emphasize that the foregoing is only a brief conceptual summary of nmfk theoretical and numerical implementation details are non trivial and can be found in the references cited above 3 3 dominant signal nmfk regression the nmfk signal for i 1 which we refer to here as the dominant signal for x consisting of snow water equivalent swe and precipitation time series at various locations within a basin is taken to be an index of wintertime hydroclimatic conditions see discussion in section 2 and used as the predictor in a linear regression on spring summer runoff volume 3 v t β 0 β 1 i t where v is the expectation value of water supply volume in year t 1 n i is the nmfk derived basin scale hydroclimatic index i e the first column of w and β 0 β 1 are coefficients estimated by ordinary least squares ols with β 1 providing a measure of the unit sensitivity of flow to hydroclimatic variability to the extent it is captured by the available input datasets and the signal extraction algorithm prediction intervals and various goodness of fit metrics see below and section 4 5 were assessed using cross validated model predictions calculated largely following the widely used method of garen 1992 motivations for cross validation in data driven wsf modeling are that out of sample performance metrics better reflect true predictive skill than in sample measures and that record lengths are rarely sufficient in western north american wsf applications see section 2 to simply partition data into fully disjoint training and testing subsets of adequate lengths e g garen 1992 see also bergmeir and benitez 2012 syed 2011 koul et al 2018 the statistics and machine learning communities have developed many variants with the two data science branches sometimes adopting different philosophies e g bergmeir and benitez 2012 we followed standard practice for data driven operational wsf systems in the western us by using leave one out cross validation which experience has shown to provide a reliable estimate of prediction error e g garen 1992 pagano et al 2004 rosenberg et al 2012 lehner et al 2017 fleming and goodbody 2019 note also that empirical partial autocorrelation functions of regression residuals from v do not exhibit statistically significant serial dependence again typical of wsf problems in the western us e g garen 1992 fleming and goodbody 2019 most operational wsf systems are probabilistic by which is meant that the best estimate provided by regression or other methods is accompanied by prediction bounds in nrcs practice these are the 0 1 0 3 0 7 and 0 9 quantiles of a probability distribution centered at v which correspond respectively to the 90 70 30 and 10 exceedance probability flows a common heuristic method which is also widely applied in wsf assumes a stationary normal distribution with a standard deviation equal to the cross validated regression standard error or rmse e g garen 1992 hyndman and athanasopoulos 2013 ideally however these quantiles should be estimated with a probability model that can flexibly accommodate non gaussian and heteroscedastic regression residuals as these more complex error structures are seen for many nrcs basins including the owyhee river test case fleming and goodbody 2019 to do this we employ a modified version of the aforementioned heuristic that uses the box cox transform 4 y t ψ y t ψ 1 ψ ψ 0 ln y t ψ 0 where ψ is a parameter and y t ψ denotes the box cox transform of variable y at time t both the observed and model predicted cross validated hindcast time series of water supply volume are transformed into homoscedastic normally distributed data in this way the transformed datasets are then differenced to obtain the residual time series which is normally distributed in transform space the corresponding root mean square error rmse can therefore be used as a convenient approximate metric of the standard deviation of the transform space residuals the transform space α th quantile forecast is estimated as 5 q α v t ψ v t ψ z rmse cv ψ where z are corresponding z scores under the normal distribution and v t ψ is the transform of the best estimate of runoff an inverse box cox transform is applied to the result to obtain final estimates of the α th quantile prediction bounds this method generates around a deterministic best estimate model prediction confidence intervals that if needed are asymmetric about v show excessive kurtosis and have time variant widths or otherwise are gaussian and stationary this post hoc approach which appears to have been introduced to conceptual process simulation based hydrologic modeling by feyen et al 2008 and was adapted to data driven runoff volume forecasting with cross validation by fleming and goodbody 2019 is superficially similar to but fundamentally different from the use of predictand transforms including the box cox transform prior to model building e g garen 1992 wang et al 2012 regression modeling was performed in the r scientific computing environment forward and inverse box cox transforms were performed using the forecast r package hyndman 2017 which also estimates optimal ψ 3 4 comparison to standard statistical wsf methods additional regression models were developed using the same dataset described above but different methods composite index regression and principal component regression pcr these are the two most common approaches for statistically based operational wsf in western north america and serve as meaningful points of comparison pcr uses principal component analysis pca to address dimensionality and multicollinearity it was adapted to wsf by nrcs garen 1992 and forms the primary basis for its official wsfs pca creates a new set of variables obtained by projecting the original data onto a new orthogonal coordinate system defined by eigenvectors of the data correlation matrix the resulting principal component scores are mutually uncorrelated and are used as possible predictors in an otherwise conventional regression in nrcs experience the leading pca mode typically contains at least roughly 70 or often much more of the input dataset total variance and captures overall year to year variability in winter spring snowpack available for spring summer runoff generation higher modes are occasionally retained for some basins for most rivers however the leading mode is the only pca mode retained in the operational wsf regression model on the basis of t tests of regression significance for convenience we refer to this configuration as leading mode pcr in composite index regression dimensionality reduction and multicollinearity handling are accomplished by averaging together the input datasets for a given watershed this amounts to calculating the mean areal cumulative precipitation and snowpack across the basin on the basis of available station data the resulting index captures wintertime climatic inputs to the basin and is used as the sole predictor in a linear regression see garen 1992 the method is a de facto application of stacking which improves signal to noise ratio by the square root of the number of input variables where signal in this context refers to the regionally coherent component of year to year climatic variability across all the input variable locations and types e g telford et al 1990 monteleoni et al 2011 fleming and barton 2015 more complex variants exist but can have disadvantages perkins et al 2009 garen 1992 for convenience we refer to regression of water supply upon an average of the input variables as simple index regression all three modeling frameworks considered invoke a similar overall architecture an index of wintertime hydroclimatic conditions is formed from snotel or other similar data which then serves as the predictor variate in a linear regression model they differ mainly in how the predictive index is created and of particular interest to us here how thoroughly or easily it can be interpreted in simple index regression no information about relationships between input variables is generated during index creation this restricts possibilities for interpretation without taking additional steps like correlation analyses in pcr the eigenvectors contain information about relationships between variates in the input data matrix that can be used to understand the final predictive model however such interpretation is hampered by two characteristics first there is normally no nonnegativity constraint and in general both the eigenvector and scores contain a mixture of positive and negative values second the signs on the eigenvectors and scores are mathematically arbitrary in the sense that one can multiply both by 1 and obtain the same net contribution to the total dataset variance and dynamics that is a positive valued eigenvector entry corresponding to a certain input variable may represent either an above or below average value of that variable depending on the arbitrary polarity of the scores time series in contrast typical operational wsf predictor variables swe and precipitation section 2 are strictly nonnegative so that negative valued pca results are physically unrealistic a consequence is that in wsf practice pca is normally treated only as a data pre processing trick to facilitate application of classical regression to multicollinear problems and detailed pca results e g eigenvectors are typically ignored during interpretation of pcr based wsf models in dominant signal nmfk regression the mixing matrix and signals provide information loosely akin to pca eigenvectors and scores in contrast however the nmfk mixing matrix and signals are nonnegative like the swe and precipitation datasets they represent they are therefore more physically realistic facilitating geophysical interpretation these potential improvements in physical explainability motivated our exploration of nmfk as an alternative feature extraction approach prior to regression modeling other advantages and disadvantages of dominant signal nmfk regression relative to standard statistical models grew clearer after application to the wsf test case these are discussed in section 4 5 3 5 post hoc analysis steps two additional analytical steps were performed during assessment and interpretation of results from dominant signal nmfk regression the first was a simple application of information theory to support preliminary geophysical interpretation of the mixing matrix for general background on information theory see shannon 1948 and pierce 1980 hydrologic applications include e g amorocho and espildora 1972 caselton and husain 1980 krasovskaia 1995 weijs et al 2010 fleming and dahlke 2014 and nearing and gupta 2015 the 18 mixing matrix entries for the leading signal are divided into three bins low middle high with category cutoffs equally spaced between the minimum and maximum values the shannon entropy is then calculated as σpi log2 pi where pi is the estimated probability that any given mixing matrix entry falls within the i th bin found by counting how many times entries fall within each bin this gives the information content in bits of the dominant signal entries in the mixing matrix the same category cutoffs are then used to calculate the probabilities and corresponding entropy only for those mixing matrix entries corresponding to snow data giving an estimate of the quantity of information provided by swe measurements as captured in the nmfk dominant signal the procedure is repeated again to find the information content of mixing matrix entries for the precipitation data alone implications of these results and caveats to their interpretation are discussed in section 4 3 additionally to test interpretability of the nmfk derived basin scale hydroclimatic index in terms of well established large scale climate patterns we examined relationships between it and publicly available indices for nine modes of climate variability known to be at least partially related to north american precipitation and snowpack spearman rank nonparametric correlation was used to robustly estimate statistical significance of linear and monotonically nonlinear associations without making distributional assumptions we consider el niño southern oscillation enso the pacific decadal oscillation pdo pacific north america pattern pna trans niño index tni north atlantic oscillation nao interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo arctic oscillation ao atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and north pacific gyre oscillation npgo note that these patterns are not all mutually independent for instance statistical and physical relationships exist between the ipo and pdo and the nao and ao monthly indices were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration earth system research laboratory s physical sciences division e g www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp timeseries data nino34 long data for enso indices except for the npgo index which was obtained from the ocean climate ecosystem science group at georgia tech www o3d org npgo this analysis is intended only to confirm climatic interpretability of the dominant nmfk signal by comparing it to indices of atmosphere ocean oscillations for which hydrologic teleconnections in some regions of north america are already reasonably well known e g mantua et al 1997 garen 1998 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 kennedy et al 2009 gobena et al 2013 fleming and dahlke 2014 enfield et al 2001 kingston et al 2006 mccabe et al 2004 pascolini campbell et al 2015 vincent et al 2015 wu et al 2005 as such the analysis is not exhaustive for instance though exploring other averaging intervals could be valuable we focus on wintertime to forecast date mean values of these large scale climate indices which corresponds to the seasonal timeframe of our basin scale nmfk index see section 2 similarly while enso has several indices which are in general closely correlated we use only niño 3 4 a common choice for enso teleconnection identification in water resource studies likewise certain climate oscillations may demonstrate parabolic teleconnections in some locations like enso in northern california e g wu et al 2005 fleming and dahlke 2014 but only linear and monotonically nonlinear relationships are considered here as again is common practice in hydroclimatic analysis 4 results and discussion 4 1 raw nmfk results for owyhee river test case nmfk identified three viable solutions for the data matrix described in section 2 containing kopt 2 3 and 6 signals cursory scoping regressions on water supply volume suggested that within each of these solutions signal i 1 i 1 k opt which we refer to as the dominant signal see above provided the best in sample wsf predictive ability the 2 signal nmfk solution was selected over the 3 and 6 signal solutions for the remainder of the analysis primarily because it provides a more compact and parsimonious representation of predictor dataset dynamics and secondarily because its dominant signal provided slightly better flow volume regression results raw results from the 2 signal nmfk solution are illustrated in fig 2 the mixing matrix entries for the dominant signal exhibit moderate heterogeneity across predictor variates and its signal correlates reasonably well r 0 74 with observed flow volumes the mixing matrix values for the second signal are considerably more heterogeneous and the corresponding signal correlates poorly r 0 13 with runoff volume as per section 3 3 the dominant signal was used as the predictor variate in the regression results are described in the remainder of section 4 below geophysical interpretations specifically of the signal time series and mixing matrix entries corresponding to the dominant nmfk signal are provided in sections 4 3 and 4 4 4 2 physical acceptability of runoff volume predictions observed and predicted runoff and associated prediction bounds are shown in fig 3 a notable feature is that the dominant signal nmfk regression based best estimate and its prediction bounds are without exception nonnegative application of regression methods to wsf in some arid or semi arid basins in the us west can lead to 90 exceedance flows and in some cases best estimates that are negative valued during dry years for discussion of these effects and why they occur see fleming and goodbody 2019 physically of course river runoff volume cannot take on negative values this is a known issue for the owyhee river forecast point in particular and the leading mode pcr and simple index regression models both produce negative valued best estimates at one or more sample times when applied to the identical dataset as dominant signal nmfk regression this makes the predictions from conventional statistical wsf methods unacceptable and in operational wsf practice using such techniques subjective choices and manual applications of predictand transforms are required to sidestep the problem when it occurs that nmfk by construction gives strictly nonnegative regression predictors does not guarantee nonnegative best estimate regression model predictions but it does seem to promote this required characteristic of a physically plausible data driven water supply forecast model 4 3 preliminary geophysical interpretation of nmfk mixing matrix maps fig 4 presents the dominant signal nmfk mixing matrix from fig 2 in map format to facilitate interpretation many of the precipitation and swe input variables are co located because they both come from the same snotel site blue dots on fig 4 so for convenience of visualization and interpretation the dominant signal mixing matrix entries are separated into maps corresponding to swe fig 4a and precipitation fig 4b input variables we emphasize however that all the dominant signal nmfk mixing matrix entries are a single vector which can be viewed as coefficients that weight the contributions of each input variable swe and precipitation measurements at various locations to the net dominant signal in the nmfk solution separation of the entries into those corresponding to swe versus precipitation is done only to facilitate viewing and interpretation long term average swe and precipitation fields across the watershed are also shown for reference on fig 4a and 4b respectively as are maps of topography fig 4c and mean air temperature fig 4d the sizes of the blue dots in fig 4a and 4b provide the magnitude of the corresponding mixing matrix entries these mixing matrix maps provide opportunities for physical interpretation of patterns detected by the nmfk algorithm the largest entries in the mixing matrix correspond to swe rather than precipitation this suggests that swe contributes more than precipitation to the dominant pattern primary hidden variable see section 3 2 that underlies the mixed swe precipitation spatiotemporal dataset which in turn seems intuitively reasonable swe data in some sense tell more about overall hydroclimatic conditions than total precipitation data alone as snowpack reflects the cumulative impact of several geophysical and biophysical controls including precipitation temperature wind speed forest canopy and so forth that the mixing matrix entries for precipitation are nearly uniform across sites whereas those for swe show significant variation further reinforces this notion that the swe data contain more information about underlying patterns of hydroclimatic variability in this watershed we can provide a back of the envelope quantitative representation of this effect using information theory following the methodology described in section 3 5 the shannon entropy of all 18 dominant signal mixing matrix entries is 1 1 bits the value rises to 1 4 bits if we use the same category cutoffs but calculate the probabilities and corresponding entropy only for mixing matrix entries corresponding to snow data repeating the procedure again for dominant signal mixing matrix entries corresponding to the precipitation data alone gives 0 bits as they all fall within the same bin this result should not be overinterpreted to mean precipitation data offer no additional value to a basin scale index of hydroclimatic variability beyond what snowpack data provide and more complex analysis steps could provide a more refined view of comparative information contents with these caveats in mind however the outcome does seem to support the physical interpretation above around snow data capturing more information about a wider variety of processes than precipitation as described in sections 2 and 3 as used here nmfk is applied to all the hydrometeorological input data to create an index of wintertime hydroclimatic conditions as such relationships to runoff volume are by construction not part of this first step in the dominant signal nmfk regression process it is nevertheless interesting to note that especially for an april 1 forecast date by which point seasonal snow accumulation has typically peaked swe is widely known by operational hydrologists to be a better predictor of runoff than wintertime to date precipitation that is the nmfk result that snow data captures more information than precipitation data is additionally consistent with the generally established fact that springtime snow data captures more information relevant to wsf than precipitation does the nmfk mixing matrix maps may also suggest hypotheses to help explain spatial structure in this underlying variability pattern for instance many of the larger mixing matrix entries correspond to higher elevation snotel sites these generally experience greater spring snowpack than lower elevation sites and therefore dominate overall basin scale water availability and thus its year to year variability conversely one of the largest mixing matrix entries corresponds to snowpack at mud flat near the northeastern boundary of the watershed which is a relatively warm low elevation location that on average experiences complete melting of the seasonal snowpack in early april several weeks before most of the other snotel sites considered here thus swe data at this site might amount to a de facto snow presence absence indicator on the april 1 measurement date used here and in turn as a powerful index of high versus low snow years potentially making a large contribution to the overall basin scale hydroclimatic signal these nmfk implied hypotheses could form a basis for additional research on how different input data types and locations contribute to overall basin wide hydroclimatic signal indexing and predictive value in water supply forecasting note that simple index regression cannot suggest any such interpretations around the underlying patterns in the dataset and hypotheses for their physical origins similarly the eigenvector in leading mode pca can be physically interpreted but in practice it presents more barriers to doing so than the nmfk mixing matrix because both magnitude and polarity need to be taken account by the interpreter section 3 4 in contrast the nmfk mixing matrix streamlines interpretation because it is strictly nonnegative like the environmental data types it represents and only magnitude of the entries needs to be taken into account by the hydrologic scientist or engineer this relative simplicity is particularly valuable if the model development and interpretation process may have to be repeated dozens or in the nrcs system hundreds of times across sites 4 4 preliminary geophysical interpretation of nmfk dominant signal the precipitation and swe based nmfk dominant signal represents year to year watershed scale cryospheric and meteorological variability such expressions of interannual to interdecadal climate variation in turn generally tend to reflect net superposition of several organized modes of large scale coupled ocean atmosphere circulation patterns these modes provide a well established basis for framing investigations of water resource variations in both explanatory and predictive contexts e g redmond and koch 1991 mantua et al 1997 garen 1998 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 werner et al 2004 hsieh et al 2006 fleming et al 2006 moradkhani and meier 2010 gobena et al 2013 fleming and dahlke 2014 beckers et al 2016 interpretability of the nmfk derived basin scale hydroclimatic index in terms of these circulation patterns was therefore examined using the methods and data discussed in section 3 5 fig 5 illustrates the nmfk dominant signal from fig 2 alongside the large scale climate indices which for purposes of visual comparison have been rescaled to the interval 0 1 in this graphic we found clear statistical evidence p 0 05 and occasionally p 0 01 for monotonic correlations between the nmfk basin scale hydroclimatic index and enso pdo tni and ipo conclusive p 0 05 statistical evidence was not found for associations with nao pna and amo though this does not preclude the presence of subtle teleconnections to one or more of these patterns that might be unambiguously identified using longer observational records or alternative averaging intervals for example there was no statistical support in this case for ao and npgo teleconnections overall the set of teleconnection analysis results is broadly consistent with prior work in western north america and in particular the southern columbia basin e g mantua et al 1997 garen 1998 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 kennedy et al 2009 gobena et al 2013 fleming and dahlke 2014 enfield et al 2001 kingston et al 2006 mccabe et al 2004 pascolini campbell et al 2015 vincent et al 2015 wu et al 2005 note that for each of those climate patterns demonstrating statistically significant relationships to the nmfk index enso pdo ipo and tni the corresponding linear correlation coefficient is as high as for enso or higher than for pdo ipo and tni the average of the correlation coefficients between the respective climate pattern and each of the 18 input variables overall the results demonstrate that like indices of watershed scale wintertime precipitation and snowpack conditions derived using other methods such as pca explanations of interannual variability in the dominant signal nmfk index can be easily and clearly framed in reference to specific known hemispheric to global scale climate processes 4 5 capabilities and limitations considered collectively the results show that dominant signal nmfk regression generates intermediate analytical products refer again to figs 4 and 5 and sections 4 3 and 4 4 and final wsf predictions fig 3 and section 4 2 that meet or beat the physical interpretability and for runoff predictions also the physical plausibility of statistical wsf models of the general types conventionally used in operational wsf for the western us the outcomes are broadly consistent with expectations based on how these various modeling approaches are structured section 3 4 note that we have focused on an apples to apples comparison of several index based linear regression modeling methods based on exactly the same input data with the only free experimental parameter being the approach used for feature extraction other regression and regression like methods are available for the supervised learning component of data driven wsf including far more complex machine learning approaches as are optimization methods for input variable selection such as tree based search methods and genetic algorithms e g garen 1992 fleming and goodbody 2019 some of these techniques can significantly improve predictive performance in terms of both summary goodness of fit measures and physical reliability and in some cases explainability these could in principle be combined with nmfk based feature extraction as a result the outcomes presented here provide a pessimistic assessment of the values of the approaches used including dominant signal nmfk regression however testing also revealed limitations and drawbacks interestingly improvements in a priori physical basis geophysical interpretability and geophysical plausibility come at the price of poorer cross validated section 3 3 statistical goodness of fit metrics table 2 measures considered here include root mean square error rmse which is similar to regression standard error and provides a measure of the typical prediction error that might be expected from the model correlation coefficient r and coefficient of determination r 2 where the former describes how faithfully the predictions reproduce patterns of interannual variability in observed flow volumes and the latter gives the proportion of variance explained by the model and ranked probability skill score rpss a measure of the probabilistic skill of the model framed in terms of its ability relative to a naïve climatology forecast to predict the probability of dry normal or wet years as defined by terciles of the observed flow volumes e g wiegel et al 2007 guihan 2014 fleming and goodbody 2019 however these conventional accuracy metrics do not penalize the non physical predictions made by the standard statistical models or reward the physical acceptability of predictions made by dominant signal nmfk regression this limits the ability of such measures to meaningfully describe and diagnose model quality in this application see again section 4 2 broad based quantitative fitness for purpose rankings of hydrologic models are complex include subjective components and are best formed in competitive team evaluation processes beyond the scope of the current paper see cunderlik et al 2013 nevertheless a more comprehensive and balanced portrayal of model performance is provided in table 2 by additionally noting whether the model predicted best estimates and the lowest of the associated prediction intervals considered in standard wsf applications section 3 3 meet the physicality requirement of being nonnegative for all available sample times in this broader view the dominant signal nmfk regression performance results are more mixed compared to conventional methods additionally though nonnegativity of nmfk outcomes matches the physical characteristics of typical wsf predictors and therefore simplifies and thus encourages deeper interpretations relative to the more conventional alternative of pca see sections 3 4 and 4 3 it bears noting that nonnegativity is not a strict requirement for such interpretation there is a long history of geophysically interpreting eigenvectors derived from pca of fundamentally nonnegative hydrologic quantities examples include watershed regime classification or detecting the impacts of climatic variability and change on streamflow e g bartlein 1982 guetter and georgakakos 1993 lins 1997 fleming et al 2006 nmfk only makes this interpretive process more intuitive and accessible the physical interpretability advantages of nmfk are also premised on the exclusive use of nonnegative wsf predictors this is consistent with most operational wsf practices in the us west as standard statistical wsf predictors are swe precipitation and in some cases antecedent streamflow all of which are strictly nonnegative that said some additional predictor types that have seen extensive experimentation and occasional operational implementation may not be nonnegative for instance though not currently used in its production systems enso indices were introduced into long lead time us west operational forecasting by nrcs as a de facto early season surrogate for winter precipitation and snow data garen 1998 and have also been operationally adopted elsewhere e g gobena et al 2013 dominant signal nmfk regression is not directly applicable to mixed sign predictors although of course such predictors could be rescaled to render them nonnegative as in fig 5 another applicability question is associated with a distinct technical characteristic of nmfk unlike pca the suite of kopt signals in a nmfk solution are not mutually uncorrelated from a rigorous statistical modeling perspective using more than one of these multicollinear signals as candidate features for a multiple linear regression is therefore potentially problematic e g garen 1992 in the context of conventional linear statistical regression modeling then the wsf role of nmfk may be limited to creating a univariate watershed scale hydroclimatic index finally scoping applications to other rivers in the western us suggest that dominant signal nmfk regression is a generally viable wsf method but also that the strengths of its advantages and limitations as compared to standard statistical models vary between basins to illustrate consider another existing nrcs forecast point the yellowstone river at corwin springs located in the rocky mountain headwaters of the missouri basin similar to the owyhee river dominant signal nmfk regression provided serviceable but decreased performance on conventional goodness of fit metrics compared to simple index regression and pcr however conventional statistical regression models for yellowstone wsf do not produce negative valued predictions so the tendency of dominant signal nmfk regression to encourage physically realistic nonnegative volume predictions is irrelevant here unlike the owyhee river the nmfk mixing matrix entries for the dominant signal offered clear physical interpretations for the yellowstone river as it did for the owyhee river that said we should expect the resulting hydroclimatic storyline to differ from basin to basin depending on details of precipitation and swe monitoring sites predominant watershed scale terrestrial hydrologic processes overall climatic characteristics and potentially other factors in each basin this was seen to be the case for the yellowstone river the primary pattern in the dominant signal nmfk mixing matrix entries involved both swe and precipitation data from a single snotel site that stood apart from results for both swe and precipitation at all other sites this pattern presumably reflects local scale characteristics at the anomalous snotel station potentially including but not necessarily limited to its instrumentation local land cover land use or microclimate similar to the owyhee river the dominant nmfk signal for yellowstone showed correlations with various large scale climate indices consistent with established understanding of these teleconnections in western north america all things considered dominant signal nmfk regression provided useful interpretive insights into the yellowstone river but might be considered a somewhat less attractive candidate for operational wsf here than in the owyhee basin in the following section we discuss how the various capabilities and limitations described above may guide potential next steps for exploring the ways that dominant signal nmfk regression might be further developed and ultimately deployed in production systems for operational wsf 5 conclusions operational water supply forecasts are a cornerstone of water management in the largely arid us west ability to tell a hydrologically meaningful story around what the forecast models are telling us is a requirement for understanding and evaluating the models and communicating their outcomes to clients while ai has conventionally had a reputation as an uninterpretable black box recent advances in physics aware ai are changing that perception here we leverage one of these advances nmfk to improve geophysical plausibility and interpretability compared to traditional statistical models the result is a hybrid that pairs this new theory guided glass box unsupervised learning algorithm with a largely conventional statistical prediction model application demonstrates that it facilitates both easier geophysical interpretability and better geophysical plausibility than established data driven wsf methods this demonstration in combination with increasing interest in improving the physical interpretability of data driven wsf systems in turn suggests that continued research and development is warranted on using nmfk for feature extraction in wsf one possibility follows on the existence of multiple kopt signals as noted in section 4 5 these are not mutually independent possibly limiting their role as predictors in conventional multiple linear regression modeling however nmfk appears to reduce dimensionality very effectively and the compressed signals it generates may therefore prove useful as candidate features to a supervised machine learning based prediction system relating nmfk signals to seasonal flow volume such supervised ai methods like neural networks for instance do not strictly require feature independence but do typically benefit from reduced input data dimensionality as this in turn reduces the required size and complexity of the network topology and attendant training and interpretation complications we currently anticipate that the primary use of dominant signal nmfk regression is as a complement to rather than a replacement for established approaches within wsf systems the goal in doing so would be to provide additional geophysical interpretive information as needed for specific forecasting problems that require special attention such as particularly difficult forecast locations like the owyhee river we focused on here our intention is to experiment with integration of nmfk as an additional feature extraction technique alongside pca in a multi method machine learning metasystem that has been developed as the basis of the next generation of the us west wide nrcs operational wsf model fleming and goodbody 2019 more broadly our results seem to reinforce the value of practically minded and selective integrations of existing knowledge methods and processes with certain new machine learning techniques as they emerge to the extent that such techniques may fill certain specific known gaps in this particular case improving the physical interpretability of watershed scale hydroclimatic signal extraction this philosophy may suggest a template for investigating emergent ai technologies in the context of applied hydrometeorological prediction systems where a broad spectrum of quantitative and qualitative considerations including but extending far beyond prediction skill determine operational desirability of available modeling methods and guide design criteria e g weber et

4643,regarded as the water towers of numerous large rivers in asia the source area of yellow river sayr on northeast qinghai tibet plateau qtp contains substantial thermokarst lakes which have exerted significant roles on the regional hydrology and water resources under permafrost degradation to address the potential impact of climate and permafrost induced changes in surface hydrological processes in the sayr the hydrological transitions and water balance of thermokarst lakes were characterized on large scales during three years using stable isotope method spatial and seasonal deviations in hydrological processes of thermokarst lakes were remarkable calculations of evaporation to inflow e i ratios based on an isotope mass balance model revealed substantial evaporation for all thermokarst lakes during june due to the control of climate conditions and limited input water substantial feeds from summer fall rain and permafrost meltwater resulted in lower evaporation and positive water balance of lakes during july august september and october based on the relationship between lake specific input water isotope compositions δi and annual average isotope value of precipitation δp the recharge patterns of thermokarst lakes in the sayr were classified supra permafrost water rainfall dominated lakes were mainly concentrated during june and october regardless of spatial divergences and summer precipitation permafrost thaw dominated lakes are popular during july and august qualitatively seasonal diversities in the water balance of thermokarst lakes are combinatively controlled by air temperature precipitation regimes permafrost degradation in the sayr lastly the future hydrological trajectories of thermokarst lakes are expected under climatic warming and permafrost degradation this study serves as an important contribution for understanding future hydrological changes and allocation of water resources on the qtp as well as an indication of permafrost degradation under climate warming keywords thermokarst lakes source area of yellow river sayr stable isotopes ground ice permafrost degradation water balance 1 introduction thermokarst lakes defined as lakes that usually occupy closed depressions formed by the settlement of ground following thawing of ice rich permafrost or melting of massive ice van everdingen 1998 are widespread in high ice content permafrost regions in arctic sub arctic and boreal lowland areas grosse et al 2013 as well as alpine high mountain regions kääb and haeberli 2001 niu et al 2011 șerban et al 2020 the formation and development of thermokarst lakes is a dominant pattern of permafrost degradation and is closely linked with increased air temperature and precipitation turner et al 2014a the deepening of seasonal thawed layer and the resultant melting of near surface ground ice and gradual water impoundment grosse et al 2013 considering the predominant controlling by precipitation lateral or bottom permafrost ice meltwater and evaporation woo and guan 2006 niu et al 2011 levy et al 2013 tondu et al 2013 the water balances of thermokarst lake are sensitive to climate change continued climate warming and permafrost thawing has altered the spatial distribution of thermokarst lakes and regional hydrologic systems turner et al 2014a gibson and reid 2014 gibson et al 2015 and also induced the development of subsurface flow pathways yoshikawa and hinzman 2003 jepsen et al 2013a previous studies documented that permafrost degradation significantly changed the water balance of thermokarst lakes macdonald et al 2016 narancic et al 2017 and meltwater of ground ice contributed about one third of input water to thermokarst lakes fedorov et al 2014 permafrost thaw controlled the changes of thermokarst lake status number size and related hydrological variabilities karlsson et al 2012 gibson et al 2015 importantly the great interest was to determine the effect of changing thermokarst lakes hydrology and the resultant permafrost degradation on carbon release to the atmosphere walter et al 2006 2014 olefeldt et al 2013 which remarkably changed the hydro geomorphic changes e g arp et al 2011 and further accelerated greenhouse gases releases walter et al 2006 as the main runoff generation region the source area of the yellow river sayr provides 34 8 of the total water resources of the yellow river hu et al 2011 yuan et al 2015 qin et al 2017 which is of vital importance to the water supplies of mid lower reaches instrumental records suggested that the degradation of permafrost in the sayr is remarkable sheng et al 2020 including the increase of average active layer thickness by 50 cm during 40 years sheng et al 2020 and the decrease of permafrost area ratio by 1 1 per year qin et al 2017 meanwhile the supra permafrost water was reduced by about 1 5 108 m3 in 20 years peng et al 2003 due to the deepening of active layer and the formation of taliks cheng and jin 2013 which significantly depressed the groundwater table jin et al 2009 importantly the permafrost between 3 m and 10 m in the sayr preserved as much as 49 62 km3 of ground ice wang et al 2017 accounting for 2 89 time of the total reserves of the sister lakes gyaring lake and ngöring lake fig 1 which will exert significant influence on the development and expansion of thermokarst processes jin et al 2010 duan et al 2015 the regional hydrological evolution yang et al 2019a as well as release of doc to alter regional carbon cycle yang et al 2021 latest studies suggested that small alpine lakes have increased in lake surface areas and numbers partly due to permafrost degradation luo et al 2020a based on the multi isotope method studies clarified the thermokarst lake water balance in different sites and illuminated the evaporation characteristics for each lake in the sayr wan et al 2019 in addition researchers also suggested that permafrost thaw and groundwater played important roles on the thermokarst lake water balance in discontinuous permafrost area in the sayr jiang 2020 these studies emphasized the importance of thermokarst lakes on the regional hydrology and effect of permafrost degradation on the water balance however considering the remarkable spatial and temporal variability in the hydrology and water balance of thermokarst lakes turner et al 2010 jepsen et al 2013a these limited studies on small scales only qualitatively exhibited the isotopic patterns of thermokarst lakes due to the spatial differences in the permafrost distributions sheng et al 2020 the distinct climatic conditions and the vegetation covers in the sayr jin et al 2009 the hydrological properties and the water balances of thermokarst lakes were bound to exhibit substantial divergences regionally accordingly great attentions should be paid on thermokarst lake hydrology at spatial dimensions in the sayr accordingly here we aim 1 to clarify the spatial and seasonal differences in the hydrological variations of thermokarst lakes at four different sites in the sayr 2 to determine the recharge types of thermokarst lakes and 3 estimate the seasonal water balance of thermokarst lakes our results cannot only illuminate the spatial and seasonal variations in the hydrological processes of thermokarst lakes but can also provide important information of permafrost degradation indicated by lake isotopes 2 study area the sayr located on the northeastern qtp is encompassing an area of approximately 2 9 104 km2 and defining the duoshixia 34 34 41 n 98 19 28 e as the outlet luo et al 2020a the elevation is ranging between 4197 m and 5266 m with an average of 4500 m the reported mean annual air temperature is lower than 4 c and the annual precipitation amounts ranged between 300 and 400 mm most of which occurs in the ice free season between june and october yang et al 2019a the vegetation patterns exhibit significantly regional differentiations with predominant distribution of alpine meadow in the southern sayr and primary spread of alpine steppe in the northern sayr luo et al 2020a which have exerted remarkable influence on the regional hydrology and development of thermokarst lakes yang et al 2019a as many as 80 of the sayr is underlain by frozen ground consisting of continuous discontinuous sporadic and isolated patches of permafrost as well as seasonally frozen ground which has experienced frequent transitions under climate warming jin et al 2009 an approximate of 49 62 km3 of ground ice is preserved between 3 m and 10 m in the sayr which played important roles on the hydrological processes and water balance of thermokarst lakes due to gradual melting yang et al 2019a 2019b a recent study suggested that the lake surface area and lake numbers changed dramatically partly driven by the degradation of frozen ground luo et al 2020a in this study four sites along the northwest southeast transaction in the sayr are selected fig 1a including the upmost reaches of source area ursa fig 1b the shuangchagou basin in the central sayr scg fig 1c the chalaping region clp fig 1d and the bayan har mountain pass region byh fig 1e the ursa site is classified as high ice content alpine permafrost region with the mean annual ground temperature magt ranging between 2 c and 1 c sheng et al 2020 located at the westernmost area of the sayr numerous rivers were formed via convergence of supra permafrost water supra pw snowmelt water and precipitation runoffs also a great quantity of thermokarst lakes ponds appeared the scg basin is located in the ice rich permafrost region with permafrost thickness of about 20 40 m and a magt of approximately 0 7 c plentiful of thermokarst lakes are distributed in scg basin most of which were shallower less than1 m and smaller yang et al 2019a the clp is located in the southeast part of the sayr fig 1a the permafrost belongs to the marginal zone of plateau discontinuous permafrost of the qtp luo et al 2020b and exhibits an active layer thickness of thinner than 1 5 m luo et al 2018a field investigation identified substantial water bodies 750 in number in this region which accounted for 2 83 of the land area of clp luo et al 2018a for comparison most of the lakes are larger and deeper fig 1d and are considered to be of thermokarst origin the byh region is located in the southeast of the sayr fig 1a and identified as high ice content alpine permafrost region the magt is about 1 5 c and the permafrost thickness is 40 m 50 m substantially enriched in ground ice cao et al 2017 due to the remarkable influence of the summer monsoon on the southern slopes of the byh there is greater precipitation on the southern slopes luo et al 2018b which resulted in the expansion of thermokarst lakes by contrast the thermokarst lakes at byh exhibit larger lake area but shallower depths 3 materials and methods 3 1 description of field sampling work to completely accomplish the objectives thermokarst lakes at 4 sites in the sayr were investigated between 2014 and 2016 during the ice free seasons because most of the regions in the sayr are desolate and uninhabited so it is not very easy to investigate lake around the whole sayr thus we only sampled occasionally one or two times during some months in one or two sites however in total 101 lake water samples were collected from all four sites in 2014 20 and 21 at scg during july and september respectively 29 at byh during october 31 at ursa during october 56 in 2015 11 at scg and 45 at byh during june 74 in 2016 2 and 4 at scg during april and july 27 and 35 at clp during july and august lake water samples were collected near the center of each lake at a depth of 20 cm below the water surface in addition supra pw samples were obtained at each site if possible totally 4 and 13 supra pw samples were obtained in the ursa and scg respectively besides 4 deep well ground water samples were collected in madoi county 2 sub permafrost ground water samples were collected at the scg during drilling work all the water samples were preserved in 30 ml high density polyethylene bottles and kept cool at 4 c for stable isotope analysis three permafrost profiles 0 3 m were evacuated at scg fig 1c in the sayr to collect near surface ground ice 0 3 m yang et al 2017 in total twenty one ground ice samples at different depths were obtained between 1 4 and 2 5 m each ice sample was collected using disposable pe gloves to prevent contamination the exterior of each subsample was removed to avoid any mixing with neighbor ice or surplus water ground ice samples were preserved in hdpe bottles and kept frozen yang et al 2019a 3 2 collection and analysis of meteorological data in order to exactly estimate the spatial and seasonal transisitons of thermokarst lakes the daily meteorological data between 2014 and 2016 from different meteorological stations nearby each site was collected and used in specific the daily data from maduo micro meteorological station 30 km away from the ursa fig 1a was used to constrain the climate conditions of the ursa the data from madoi and qingshuihe national meteorological station were applied in the lake hydrology evaluation at clp 80 km apart fig 1a and byh 70 km apart respectively the climate data from a micro meteorological station setup by state key laboratory of frozen soil engineering was used at scg fig 1 in this study the daily air temperatures ta precipitation amounts p and relative humidity rh were used 3 3 stable isotopes analysis all collected samples were analyzed for stable isotope δ18o δd composition by using an isotope liquid water and water vapor analyzer l2130 i picarro usa with a wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy technique in the state key laboratory of frozen soil engineering chinese academy of sciences before analysis every sample was filtered through 0 22 μm disposable membrane filters to remove impurities isotope compositions are expressed as δ values relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow in per mil such that δsample rsample rvsmow rvsmow 1000 where r is the ratio δ18o 16o or 2h 1h in the sample and vsmow the analytical error was less than 0 08 for δ18o and 0 2 for δd 3 4 stable isotope mass balance modeling isotope hydrology evaporation characteristics water balance of thermokarst lakes in permafrost regions are closely related to the climate conditions the initial source water the permafrost and ice conditions and the hydrological properties for individual lakes the stable isotope clusters of thermokarst lakes at 4 sites were synthesized and the local evaporation lines lels were built and embed in the stable isotope framework in δ18o δd space consisting of the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line lmwl an isotope mass balance imb model put forward by previous research gonfiantini 1986 gibson and edwards 2002 was introduced to illuminate the spatial and seasonal variations in

expressed as il ql and el respectively δ i δ q and δ e values are corresponding to the isotopes of inflow outflow and evaporation it is given that isotope fractionation does not occur in the outflow

composition of total input flow δ i is commonly estimated from the intersection of the local meteoric water line lmwl with the lake specific local evaporative line lel yi et al 2008 the δ e value has

the ck values are experimental constants which are set as 14 2 for δ18o and 12 5 for δd gonfiantini 1986 araguás araguás et al 2000 in cold regions that experience extended periods of ice cover the isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour δa is commonly assumed to be in isotopic equilibrium with the isotopic composition of summer precipitation δps and can therefore be estimated as follows

lake isotope hydrology at the four sites the boxplots of stable isotopes δ18o d excess of thermokarst lakes and monthly climatic factors at the four sites are presented to clarify the seasonal variations in thermokarst lake hydrology fig 2 generally no matter which sites the lakes belong to they exhibit more enriched δ18o and lower d excess during april and june suggesting considerable import of isotopically positive water e g evaporated surface water meltwater of lake ice to lakes and the influence of evaporation during april 2016 at scg all lakes were frozen up due to negative air temperature fig 2c which prevented any kinds of water from feeding lakes accordingly the more enriched δ18o and lower d excess was caused by the evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes δ18o δd during summer and fall season in the previous year before freezing by contrast the reasons for the similarly enriched δ18o and lower d excess of lakes during june fig 2a 2b are considered to be different during june the air temperature increased gradually resulting in the progressive melting of lake river ice with more enriched δ18o yang et al 2019b which mixed with unfrozen lake water and subsequently altered the isotopic contents of original lake water in addition the precipitation amounts were abundant fig 2c and were characterized by much higher δ18o values 5 ren et al 2013 thus these lakes substantially fed by isotopically positive precipitation and meltwater of lake river ice combined with the evaporation are bound to be enriched in heavier isotopes the lakes sampled during july exhibit spatially different isotopic patterns fig 2a 2b more enriched δ18o and lower d excess patterns are showing in lakes monitored in 2014 at scg however lakes surveyed in 2016 in both sites represent more depleted δ18o fig 2a and higher d excess fig 2b this demonstrates distinct factors controlling lake isotope hydrology during july at scg the lakes surveyed in 2014 reveal higher δ18o and lower d excess compared with those in 2016 fig 2a 2b a minority of lakes in 2016 at scg was occasionally sampled near the wanlongwoma wl lake which were susceptible to the transportation of recycled water moisture from wl lake fig 1c thus significantly decreased the δ18o values and elevated the d excess of thermokarst lake water vallet coulomb et al 2008 bowen et al 2012 accordingly the isotopic patterns of lakes in 2016 at scg are unrepresentative however combined with the data in the clp in 2016 they can reflect the average level of precipitation during july in 2016 during august september and october lakes show δ18o approaching to the average value of summer precipitation fig 2a emphasizing the predominant contributions of summer fall precipitation to the lake water balance the lakes monitored during august however display slightly enriched δ18o fig 2a and lower d excess fig 2b than those during the other two months due to stronger evaporation caused by highest air temperature fig 2c during september less precipitation fig 2c with more enriched δ18o ren et al 2013 yang et al 2019a fig 2 was responsible for the more enriched of δ18o in the lake water during october a substantial decrease of precipitation amounts fig 2c is accompanied by a dramatic drop of air temperature which hampered evaporative enrichment the depletions of δ18o values are importantly influenced by the fall precipitation and melting ground ice yang et al 2019a 4 1 2 seasonal differences in the isotope hydrology of thermolarst lakes in order to determine the seasonal differences in the lake hydrology the stable isotopes of lakes collected during different months in the four sites are presented fig 3 generally the majority of thermokarst lakes are substantially enriched in heavier isotopes than ground ice and the average value of annual precipitation except lakes collected during july at clp fig 3c emphasizing the remarkable evaporation characteristics of thermokarst lakes yang et al 2016 turner et al 2014a narancic et al 2017 however the isotope hydrology of the lakes shows regional differences during the same month fig 3b c d e f during june lakes from two sites were investigated fig 3b all the lakes exhibit more enriched isotopes which are mostly except one lake plotting above the average values of summer precipitation fig 3a 3b suggesting the influence of greater evaporation on lake isotopes and the input of isotopically positive water gibson and reid 2014 yang et al 2019b specifically the isotope points of scg lakes concentrate in a narrow range which is far beyond the average value of precipitation and ground ice when comparing with the byh fig 3b reflecting stronger evaporation according to the field survey scg lakes are characterized by shallow water depths and small lake areas the lake water can froze to the lake bottom in cold seasons making the heavier isotopes preferentially incorporate into solid ice yang et al 2019b the lake ice suffered sublimation and further increased the enrichment of heavier isotopes sublimation of lake ice is driven by the differences in the temperature between the ambient air and the surface ice and the moisture deficit of the ambient air this sublimation process caused an isotopic enrichment at the surface ice stichler et al 2001 subsequently the lake ice with more enriched δ18o yang et al 2019b began to melt when air temperature rising gradually and mixed with the remaining unfrozen lake water as calculated the δi of scg lakes is much higher than the average value of summer precipitation fig 3b which further confirms the predominant contributions of isotopically positive water for comparison the isotopes of byh lakes during june extend over a wider range suggesting diversities of initial source water and different lake hydrological conditions wolfe et al 2011 turner et al 2014b narancic et al 2017 yang et al 2017 2019b the δi value for byh lakes is more depleted than that for scg lakes and locates between average value of summer and annual precipitation fig 3b which is suggestive of important influence of summer rain on the lake isotopes field record indicates that the byh lakes are not of uniform size and represent various hydrological conditions including closed system lakes through flow lakes and seasonal lakes dried up in the cold seasons also the vegetation covers surrounding lakes were different all these result in the divergences of the distributions of lake isotopes along the lel turner et al 2014a during july only lakes in the scg and clp were monitored fig 3c the lakes display extensively wide range in isotopes fig 3c reflecting remarkable differences in the initial source water of lakes gibson and reid 2014 the divergences of lake hydrological conditions i e water depth lake area closed system or open system yang et al 2017 and the inter annual and spatial variations in climate condition yang et al 2019b by comparison the majority of the lakes in the scg exhibit more enriched isotopes which are plotting far beyond the average isotope value of precipitation and ground ice fig 3c demonstrating the greater evaporation of lake water the thermokarst lakes at clp display a broader range fig 3c which is extending substantially with a fluctuation extent of 15 for δ18o and 86 for δd remarkably capturing substantial within landscape variability macdonald et al 2016 and the transition of input initial source water anderson et al 2013 stable isotope composition of partial clp lakes were superimposed on the isotope range of ground ice and the average value of winter precipitation fig 3c indicating the important contribution of permafrost ground ice thaw and snowmelt anderson et al 2013 although great differences in the lake isotope composition are observed between scg and clp similar lels are obtained table 1 the calculated δi values in the two sites are much more depleted and are nearly identical fig 3c much more depleted δi values and higher slopes of lels suggest that evaporation was less important and isotopically depleted input water can be identified to feed these lakes during july in the two sites anderson et al 2013 macdonald et al 2016 yang et al 2016 2019b as shown the δi value of scg lakes is nearly identical to the average value of winter precipitation suggesting that recharge from snowmelt to scg lakes is significant if the isotopes of four lakes collected during july 2016 are discarded the lel is expressed as δd 6 09δ18o 20 37 r2 0 71 and the calculated δi 14 4 107 9 is virtually identical to that of clp lakes implying the similar initial source water for the lakes in the two sites importantly the δi values of lakes in scg and clp are ranging between average values of annual and winter precipitation and ground ice fig 3c demonstrating the considerable replenishment of melting ground ice and fall winter precipitation previous study has reported substantial inputs from melting ground ice to small streams at scg basin which reached as high as 5 38 17 5 yang et al 2019a only clp lakes were investigated during august 2016 the isotope dots are plotting well below the lmwl fig 3d indicating strong evaporation of lakes due to higher air temperature gibson and edwards 2002 narancic et al 2017 majority of lakes exhibit much more enriched isotopes than the average value of summer precipitation fig 3d and lower slope of lel table 1 implying appreciable recharge from summer rain and evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes in lake water gibson and edwards 2002 wan et al 2019 a small portion of lakes have isotopes been located among average values of summer and annual precipitation fig 3d suggesting feed from summer and or fall precipitation the calculated δi value table 1 is in between average value of annual precipitation and melting ground ice fig 3d emphasizing the combining influence of summer precipitation and melting ground ice on the lake hydrology during august however the contribution from melting ground ice cannot be neglected which was statistically confirmed that the melting ground ice had contributed 24 31 28 31 of total discharge of streams amount during august in the scg yang et al 2019a during september the scg lakes exhibit much more enriched isotopes which are mostly located above the average value of summer precipitation fig 3e and far beyond the isotopic composition of ground ice the lel presents typical evaporation characteristics gibson and edwards 2002 which further evidenced the characteristic of isotope changes in open water bodies subject to evaporation craig and gordon 1965 gibson 2002b the calculated δi value table 1 is identical to the mean value of summer precipitation fig 3e it is suggestive of replenishment of isotopically positive summer rain ren et al 2013 yang et al 2019a the isotopically positive rain during september was attributed to the admixing of evaporated flux along the monsoon trajectory ren et al 2013 and the local recycled water bowen et al 2012 which substantially recharged the lakes during october the thermokarst lakes at ursa and byh were investigated there are remarkable differences in the lake isotopes between ursa and byh fig 3f with more enriched δ18o and higher d excess at ursa table 1 reflecting distinct divergences in the initial source water and evaporation macdonald et al 2016 narancic et al 2017 between the two sites all of the lakes at ursa extend isotope points above the average value of summer precipitation fig 3f and the δi value is more enriched table 1 suggesting the input of isotopically positive water to these lakes anderson et al 2013 gibson and reid 2014 yang et al 2019b according to field surveys a large number of surface streams and wetlands extensively distributed across the ursa regions the regional evaporated vapor from open water can contribute considerable amounts of precipitation to this region and recharge lakes in addition much slower degradation of permafrost in this region sheng et al 2020 greatly decreased the thermokarst processes and the further deepening of thermokarst lakes and the resultant contribution of isotopically depleted melting water due to permafrost thaw gibson et al 2015 yang et al 2019a 2019b the shallow thermokarst lakes are susceptible to evaporation and directly preserved the isotope signals of evaporative enrichment yang et al 2019b the byh lakes however exhibit more depleted isotopes with the majority of isotope points concentrated on the lmwl and they distributed between average values of summer and annual precipitation fig 3f reflecting the predominant recharge from precipitation moreover the δi value is approaching to the annual average value of precipitation and ground ice emphasizing the influence of melting ground ice on the lake hydrology actually the byh is classified as high ice content permafrost with magt ranging between 1 0 and 0 5 c sheng et al 2020 luo et al 2018b the permafrost has been experiencing remarkable degradation luo et al 2018b the thawing permafrost and melting of ground ice thus exerted important roles on the lake hydrology 4 2 spatial differences in the isotope hydrology of thermokarst lakes 4 2 1 general characteristics of lake isotope hydrology at four sites generally 231 lake water samples from four sites in the sayr yield a maximum δ18o value of 0 2 and 11 4 for δd recorded in june 2015 at byh a minimum value of 16 6 and 126 1 for δd july 2016 at clp and a mean isotope composition of 6 7 for δ18o and 57 1 for δd for comparison the stable isotopic composition of thermokarst lakes in the sayr exhibit substantial deviations from the precipitation and ground ice fig 4 the spread of the δ18o and δd in the thermokarst lakes falls mainly above the average value of summer precipitation in the sayr fig 1 yang et al 2019 indicating the enrichment of heavier isotopes due to evaporation and the predominant feed of summer rain minority of lakes collected during october from byh clp and scg yield isotope clusters locating between average values of summer and annual precipitation fig 4 and they are also overlapping with the isotope range of supra pw fig 4 underlining substantial contributions of summer fall precipitation and supra pw to these lakes however thermokarst lakes at clp shows more depleted isotopes than the average value of annual precipitation and they are isotopically identical to the near surface ground ice in the sayr fig 4 this suggests that the melting of near surface ground ice due to gradual thaw of the active layer and the abundant summer precipitation with more depleted isotopes in july fig 2 considerably fed these lakes a previous study also emphasized the considerable contribution of melting ground ice to the streams during july in the scg yang et al 2019a two lakes at clp in particular exhibit much more depleted isotopes than the average value of winter precipitation fig 4 implying the replenishment of snowmelt water intercepted by alpine meadows specifically the distribution of stable isotopes deviates between the four sites the lakes in the ursa show relatively a narrow range of isotopes from 9 4 to 2 9 for δ18o and 65 1 to 31 9 for δd with a mean value of 6 8 and 52 2 respectively the isotope compositions of clp lakes span a considerable range along the lmwl which is varying between 16 6 and 2 4 for δ18o and from 126 1 to 35 5 for δd with a mean value of 8 5 and 73 1 for comparison the lakes at scg and byh present similar ranges and locations relative to the lmwl fig 4 it ranges from 10 6 to 0 9 for δ18o and 88 3 to 18 9 for δd at scg and between 12 0 to 0 2 for δ18o and from 83 5 to 11 4 for δd at byh these spatial differences indicate the combined influences of permafrost conditions ground ice contents yang et al 2019a landscapes turner et al 2014a climate conditions air temperature and precipitation and the hydrological divergences of thermokarst lakes yang et al 2017 4 2 2 spatial differences in the isotope hydrology of thermokarst lakes in order to clarify the hydrological differences of thermokarst lakes in the four sites the specific δ18o δd relationships called local evaporation lines lels are built based on the stable isotope compositions of individual lakes at each site fig 5 the lake specific input water isotope compositions δi the isotopic composition of a terminal lake at isotopic and hydrological steady state where evaporation equals inflow δssl ground ice isotopes and average values of precipitation are drawn for comparison fig 5 thermokarst lakes at scg basin exhibit a wide range of isotopes and all of them are plotted below the lmwl fig 5a suggesting diverse hydrological behaviors of thermokarst lakes and strong seasonality of climate conditions which have exerted important roles on the input water and evaporation of lakes the lel of scg has a slope in the typical range of evaporated water systems gibson and edwards 2002 suggesting strong evaporation of lakes using the intersection of lmwl and lel the δi was calculated which provides an estimate of the average isotope level of input water overall the calculated δi value is identical to the annual average value of precipitation fig 5a yang et al 2019a and is approaching to the values of supra pw fig 5a it is suggestive of the predominant feed by precipitation and supra pw different lakes however show various isotope distributions along the lmwl for instance the lakes with comparatively depleted isotopes were mainly investigated during july when summer precipitation possessing more depleted isotopes ren et al 2013 yang et al 2019a was abundant fig 2 and the air temperature was higher yang et al 2019a fig 2 both of which accelerated the significant deepening of active layer and the melting of near surface ground ice in addition the local recycled vapor from two large lakes fig 1 was strong due to higher air temperature which brought abundant isotopically depleted moisture to replenish thermokarst lakes vallet coulomb et al 2008 we thus conclude that the isotopically depleted precipitation and melting ground ice is responsible for the depletion of heavier isotope in these lakes during july some lakes isotopically overlapped with the supra pw and are close to the average value of summer precipitation reflecting notable input of summer rain and supra pw in addition another important parameter of δssl was taken for comparison the relative position between stable isotopes of individual lakes δl and the δssl can indicate the evaporation degrees of lakes turner et al 2014a here at scg the majority of thermokarst lakes investigated during june and july present δl plotting close to or beyond the δssl fig 5a indicating greater evaporative isotope enrichment due to the differences in the saturated vapor pressure between light and heavy isotopes the light molecule 16o 1h evaporated preferentially and the heavy molecule 18o 2h increased in liquid phase zhang et al 2005 in addition recharge of melting water from lake ice with more enriched isotopes yang et al 2019b was also responsible for the enriched isotopes in these lakes in cold seasons during the process of freezing the heavier isotopes δ18o and δd preferentially enriched in the ice due to an increase of water molecules and a decrease of solute concentration ferrick et al 2002 lacelle 2011 we conclude that the more enriched isotopes in thermokarst lakes at scg were both influenced by evaporative enrichment and meltwater of lake ice the detailed discussions of evaporative characteristics are characterized further with calculation of δi and e i values at ursa all the isotope dots of lakes are concentrated in the upper corner of the diagram with most of them locating far beyond the average value of summer precipitation and supra pw fig 5b reflecting the recharge of isotopically positive waters and the influence of evaporation similarly the slope of lel in the ursa is in between the range of evaporated water bodies gibson and edwards 2002 evidencing the evaporative enrichment of lake isotopes the estimated δi is close to the average value of summer precipitation and the supra pw values fig 5b suggesting important replenishment of summer rain and supra pw generated surface flow which were ubiquitous in the field in addition these lakes are differentiated according to the relative position between δl and δssl these lakes with δl higher than the δssl indicate remarkable evaporation fig 5b similar to the lakes at scg the isotopes of clp lakes extend a broad range which covers the whole scope of precipitation and partially overlapped with ground ice fig 5c suggesting feed by multiple sources of waters including summer rain winter snowmelt and melting ground ice with different isotopic patterns fig 5c the slope of lel for clp lakes is nearly identical to that of ursa and is in between the range of evaporated water system 4 6 gibson and edwards 2002 reflecting striking evaporation the calculated δi value is more depleted than those at scg and ursa fig 5a b c and is approaching to the average value of near surface ground ice fig 5c yang et al 2019a suggesting the important recharge of melting ground ice and or snowmelt water according to the field investigations lakes at clp are surrounded by alpine meadow of 80 90 in coverage which well intercepted the snow and meanwhile decreased the evaporation intensity of active layer water therefore attenuated the evaporative enrichment in heavier isotopes of the initial source water snowmelt active layer water in particular 4 lakes with δl positioning further along the lel and exhibit extremely depleted isotopes which are plotting close to that of average winter precipitation fig 5c this finding is suggestive of a stronger influence of snowmelt on lake water balance in addition the relative positions of δssl δl are likewise reflecting the lake water balance conditions in the clp more than half of thermokarst lakes present higher δl than the δssl fig 5c emphasizing evaporation as the predominant controls on the lake water balance these lakes with much higher δl δl δssl were mainly collected during august during when the nearly maximum annual air temperature fig 2 could cause strong evaporation instead lakes with δl values larger that the δssl were less susceptible to evaporation and can be considered as positive water balance lakes at byh the isotopes of all lakes are plotting above the annual average value of precipitation fig 5d reflecting different degrees of evaporation in contrast to the distance from δl to δp minority of lakes exhibit isotopes locating between average value of summer and annual precipitation fig 5d indicating replenishment from summer and fall rain most of lakes however are extending δl above the average value of summer precipitation underlining the input of evaporated water e g lake ice evaporated snowmelt water and active layer water and the influence of evaporative enrichment the lel is similar to that of scg lakes fig 5a and is in between the range of evaporated water system 4 6 gibson and edwards 2002 reflecting evaporation characteristics similarly the calculated δi is also identical to the annual average value of precipitation it indicates that the annual precipitation is the predominant source water of these lakes in addition the δi is close to those of partial ground ice in the upper layer 1 0 1 4 m yang et al 2019a implying the contribution of melting ground ice which cannot be neglected under permafrost degradation yang et al 2016 the δssl compositions also make lakes split into two categories evaporative dominated and rainfall dominated the evaporative dominated lakes were mainly collected during june and the rainfall dominated lakes were investigated during october which will be discussed below 4 3 quantification of evaporation to inflow e i ratios for thermokarst lakes the e i ratios of thermokarst lakes for the 4 sites were determined to quantify the importance of evaporative processes for individual lake water balances fig 6 generally most of thermokarst lakes have e i ratios less than 1 fig 6 suggesting positive water balance however minority of thermokarst lakes at scg and byh exhibit more depleted water balance indicating by higher e i ratios 1 brock et al 2009 turner et al 2014b specifically e i ratios range from 0 00 to 1 14 mean 0 41 for scg lakes from 0 00 to 1 98 mean 0 48 for byh lakes from 0 01 to 0 75 for clp lakes mean 0 28 and from 0 03 to 0 51 for ursa lakes mean 0 16 respectively by comparison scg and byh lakes possess the highest e i ratios which is closely related to the sampling periods as shown the higher e i values mainly appear during june and july in both sites fig 6 indicative of negative water balances during june and july turner et al 2014b narancic et al 2017 thus the lower e i ratios at clp and ursa possess strongly positive water balances as reported e i values represent the relative importance of evaporation on lakes with e i 0 5 identifying as evaporation dominated lakes turner et al 2014b accordingly we classified the lakes monitored during june and july as evaporation dominated lakes in the four sites and these investigated from august to september are classified as precipitation permafrost thaw lakes in order to examine the seasonal differences in the lake evaporation the d excess and climate conditions are synthesized fig 6 overall the higher e i values of lakes monitored during june and july are corresponding to the lower d excess fig 6 suggesting the great influences of evaporative enrichment gibson 2002b turner et al 2014a however the corresponding relationships between e i ratios and climate conditions are not totally consistent fig 6 for instance the highest e i mean 0 68 appears at byh lakes during june however the air temperature during june was not the highest fig 6 it was due to the surface area to depth ratios at byh which led to stronger evaporation wang et al 2019 conversely the clp lakes monitored during august exhibit lower e i ratios mean 0 31 although air temperature was highest fig 6 accordingly we conclude that the variations in the e i are comprehensively influenced by multiple constraints i e air temperature precipitation lake hydrological conditions water depths lake areas closed or opened by comparison the lake evaporation was not very strong due to lower air temperature during june fig 6 the higher e i values were influenced by seven extremely evaporation dominated lakes e i 1 0 fig 6 if the e i values of these 7 lakes were discarded the rest of the lakes have mean e i value of 0 55 which represents a nearly equilibrium condition between evaporation e and inflow i due to a large denominator abundant precipitation input see fig 6 narancic et al 2017 the lakes monitored during july and august exhibit the second highest e i mean 0 40 for july and 0 31 for august which are supposed to be mainly controlled both by strong evaporation due to higher air temperature and input of plentiful rainfall fig 6 similarly a minority of lakes exhibits particularly high e i 1 0 during july and august which enhance the average level of e i ratios either at byh or at ursa the e i ratios of lakes are the lowest during september and october mean 0 08 for september and 0 15 for october suggesting rather weak evaporative influence it is indicative of minor influence of due to negative air temperature during october fig 6 which greatly attenuated the evaporation also the feed of fall precipitation and melting ground ice is important in addition the seasonal differences in e i and the related controlling factors are evidenced by the variations in d excess which well reflected the evaporation degrees and the alternations of input water more depleted d excess in july and august lakes is consistent with the higher air temperature suggesting the predominant controls of evaporation on the water balance yang et al 2019b however the more enriched d excess values in june lakes are corresponding to the highest e i and low air temperature emphasizing the combination effects of higher air temperature and low precipitation the highest d excess in september and october lakes demonstrate the predominant control of low air temperature and plentiful precipitation additionally lakes monitored during the same months in different sites show divergences in e i in contrast lakes investigated at scg during june exhibit relatively lower e i than those in byh lakes fig 6 with mean value of 0 60 for scg and 0 68 for byh on one hand the higher e i values were controlled by higher air temperature and relatively low precipitation in the byh evidenced by more depleted d excess in these lakes on the other hand the recycled water moisture at scg basin originating from substantial evaporation of wanlongwoma lake fig 1c can contribute large amounts of precipitable water to thermokarst lakes and well buffered the influence of evaporation which is further evidenced by the more enriched d excess at scg lakes fig 6 during july the scg lakes display much higher e i mean 0 56 than those at clp lakes mean 0 23 fig 6 implying the buffering effect of more precipitation and high coverage of alpine meadow at clp when considering the nearly identical air temperature in both sites during july fig 6 the identically low lake e i ratios at both byh and ursa during october emphasize the weak evaporation due to low air temperature during october fig 6 moreover the thermokarst lakes during october can receive permafrost ground ice meltwater which identified as isotopically depleted yang et al 2019a and tends to be less evaporatively enriched gibson et al 2015 5 discussions 5 1 recharge type classification of thermokarst lakes the lake specific initial source water isotopic composition values δi were calculated for different months at the four sites to evaluate and classify the relative contributions of summer precipitation supra pw and melting water from permafrost ground ice thaw to water balance of lakes the δi values range from 15 3 to 7 7 for δ18o and 115 7 to 52 0 for δd the wide variations in δi fig 7 a indicate the high variability in the average proportion of initial source water to lakes macdonald et al 2016 due to the remarkable seasonality of climate conditions air temperature and precipitation the involvement of supra pw and permafrost ground ice meltwater and the lake hydrological conditions yang et al 2019b lake initial source water classifications were defined by δi relative to the mean annual isotope composition of precipitation δp where δi δp for rainfall dominated lakes δi δp for snowmelt dominated lakes and δi δp for permafrost thaw dominated lakes turner et al 2010 macdonald et al 2016 yang et al 2019b accordingly the recharge patterns of thermokarst lakes in the sayr can be classified into supra permafrost water rainfall dominated and summer precipitaion permafrost thaw dominated fig 7a for comparison the lakes investigated during june september and october have δi values plotting above δp δi δp and are locating in the range of supra pw suggesting summer rainfall and supra pw as the predominant source water fig 7a regionally these kinds of lakes can be divided into two groups relative to the mean isotope composition of summer precipitation fig 7a the lakes at scg and ursa exhibit more enriched δi values which are greater than or equal to the average value of summer precipitation fig 7a but the δi values are much smaller than the average value of summer precipitation at byh lakes fig 7a illustrating the regional differences in climate conditions and the moisture sources of precipitation ren et al 2013 the scg and ursa located in the middle and upper reach are less susceptible to the influence of monsoonal moisture which can bring isotopically depleted precipitation ren et al 2013 yao et al 2013 in addition the lake hydrology at scg was significantly influenced by the recycled water moisture yang et al 2019a originating from ngoring and gyaring lake fig 1a and the wanlongwoma lake fig 1c which also altered the δi of thermokarst lakes by contrast the byh is located at the southeastern of the sayr abundant supra permafrost water from the south slope of bayan har mountain fig 7e can replenish lakes which may be responsible for the lower δi wan et al 2019 during july and august however the lakes exhibit more depleted δi values distributing below δp fig 7a emphasizing the substantial recharge from isotopically depleted summer precipitation fig 7a and permafrost ground ice meltwater evidently the δi values of lakes distribute in the isotope range of the ground ice fig 7a illustrating the considerable influence of ground ice melting on the lake water balance similar depleted stable isotopes were observed at scg streams during july and august yang et al 2019a this was consistent with the conclusions drawn by yang et al 2019a who reported an average contribution of 5 38 31 9 from melting ground ice to streams during july and august in addition the more depleted δi values for the clp lakes are closely related to the low magt and higher coverage of alpine meadow luo et al 2020b which greatly attenuated the evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes when synthesizing the seasonal variations of e i remarkable disconformities are showing fig 7b the lakes monitored during june exhibit higher e i values due to strong evaporation and substantial feed of meltwater of isotopically positive lake ice yang et al 2019b which resulted in the increase of δi comparatively although the lakes investigated during july august september and october exhibit lower e i in different sites fig 7b the δi composition varies significantly fig 7a it is suggestive of alternation of initial input water of lakes during different months due to remarkable differences in the climate conditions and the resultant permafrost thawing turner et al 2014a yang et al 2019b the isotopically positive early summer rain and meltwater of lake ice generated higher δi values and strong evaporation which resulted in higher e i during june and october however monsoonal precipitation and meltwater of permafrost and ground ice with more depleted isotopes substantially mixed with lake water and dramatically decreased δi values the lower e i values are also linked with the substantial input of precipitation narancic et al 2017 and meltwater of permafrost ground ice which has been reported in the previous study yang et al 2019a the exceptionally higher e i of scg lakes monitored during july may be caused by massive input of recycled water moisture from large lake evaporation 5 2 drivers of seasonal hydrological transitions for thermokarst lakes numerous studies have paid attention on evaluating spatial temporal variations in thermokarst lakes and determining the main drivers climate change permafrost source water differences controlling hydrological divergences of thermokarst lakes anderson et al 2013 brock et al 2009 fedorov et al 2014 gibson and reid 2014 jepsen et al 2013b narancic et al 2017 yang et al 2017 wan et al 2019 all these studies suggested substantial changes in the water balances and hydrological behaviors due to anticipated changes on the ongoing climate warming and resultant permafrost thaw karlsson et al 2012 gibson et al 2015 yang et al 2017 fedorov et al 2014 increasing precipitation and rising temperature pan et al 2017 gibson et al 2017 and alternations of thermokarst landscapes turner et al 2014a narancic et al 2017 as shown in our study more than half of the thermokarst lakes in the sayr show lake isotopes δl greater than the δssl indicating intensive evaporation for most of the lakes turner et al 2010 narancic et al 2017 the seasonal variations in isotope hydrology of lakes and the significant divergences in the initial source water for all lakes in different sites are remarkable generally the water balances of thermokarst lakes are divided into four seasonal patterns according to the variations in the lels δi lake isotopes δl d excess e i and climate conditions fig 8 type i lakes these lakes monitored during june exhibited higher slopes of lels higher δl lower d excess and higher e i fig 8 they were classified as high evaporation dominated lakes during june the air temperature was raising gradually fig 8 which resulted in substantial evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes and mixing of isotopically positive meltwater from lake ice yang et al 2019b although showing plentiful precipitation fig 8g the water vapor could only stem from local recycling water in pre monsoon periods ren et al 2013 due to the frozen state of the active layer thus during june the negative water balances were emphasized which were mainly controlled by the evaporation early summer rain input and lake ice melting processes similar studies in canada suggested that the isotopically enriched lakes in june emphasized the relative importance of snowmelt versus rainfall on the lake water balance turner et al 2010 type ii lakes almost the highest slopes of lels and d excess and lowest δi δl and e i values are showing in thermokarst lakes during july fig 8 it indicates low evaporation and substantial replenishment of isotopically depleted source water to thermokarst lakes during turner et al 2010 narancic et al 2017 yang et al 2019b as shown the air temperature is not very high mean 7 5 c which greatly attenuated the evaporative enrichment the abundant precipitation as well buffered the influence of evaporation both of which synthetically resulted in much lower e i turner et al 2014a narancic et al 2017 gao et al 2018 in addition the monsoonal precipitation is prevailing during july and august in the sayr ren et al 2013 and the active layers were deepening greatly luo et al 2014 all these made the ground ice near the permafrost table melting gradually and imported considerable amounts of isotopically depleted water into lakes which significantly diluted the isotopically positive lake water and offset the influence of evaporation fedorov et al 2014 yang et al 2016 2019a however the thermokarst lakes during july at scg presented the opposite trends in parameters with more enriched δl lower d excess and higher e i than the other july lakes considering nearly identical air temperature and precipitation to clp fig 8 this kind of anomalous trends may be related to the lake morphometry and surrounding vegetation which determined the lake evaporation degrees and the plant transpiration turner et al 2010 as documented most of the lakes at scg arecharacterized by higher surface area to depth ratios and vegetation was distinctively degraded making the lakes susceptible to climate induced losses and evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes turner et al 2014a gao et al 2018 yang et al 2019b type iii lakes the lower slope increasing δi and δl and depleted d excess fig 8 indicates that evaporation of lake water during august is remarkable which is attributed to the annually highest air temperature fig 8f however substantial inflow from precipitation permafrost thaw yang et al 2019a as well as the contribution of groundwater jiang 2020 greatly decreased the level of e i although the replenishment of monsoonal precipitation and meltwater of ground ice is important yang et al 2019a the lake water evaporation and regional recycled water moisture was overwhelming which smoothed the input of isotopically depleted monsoonal precipitation and ice meltwater from permafrost ground ice thaw we conclude that the great evaporation and recharge from monsoonal precipitation coordinated the water balance of thermokarst lakes type iv lakes continuous decreasing in the slopes of lels e i and δl and increasing in the δi d excess was showing for lakes during september and october demonstrates weak evaporation the more enriched δl and δi values of lakes are approaching to the δp indicating the predominant recharge of fall precipitation turner et al 2014a yang et al 2019b as shown the air temperature is much lower which exerted little effect on the lake evaporation and the thaw depths reached the maximum during this period luo et al 2014 signifying minimal contribution of meltwater from permafrost thaw to the lakes yang et al 2019a however the amounts of active layer water reached the maximum during this period chang et al 2015 quinton and baltzer 2013 throckmorton et al 2016 which can provide feedback water to lakes therefore it can be established that fall precipitation and active layer water are the primary factors to determine the water balance of lakes 6 future hydrological implications and limitations as demonstrated by our study remarkable spatial temporal divergences in thermokarst lake hydrology are emphasized which are closely related to the climate conditions permafrost distributions and landscape evolutions during the next decades the qtp are expected to experience continuous warming ran et al 2018 leading to the increasing of air temperature prolonging of ice free seasons and substantial degradation of permafrost and the resultant alternation of regional landscapes jin et al 2009 on one hand continuous temperature aggravates the evaporative loss of water vapor from thermokarst lakes during ice free seasons presenting as elevated e i on the other hand strong radiation and higher temperature greatly accelerated the heat conduction from atmosphere to the surrounding permafrost lin et al 2010 gradual thaw of permafrost ground ice expands the thermokarst lakes and meanwhile releases considerable meltwater to feed the lakes at the early stages yang et al 2016 2019a 2019b which significantly alters the isotope signals of lake water and the water balance fedorov et al 2014 however with the gradual transition of climate to be warmer and wetter in the sayr jin et al 2009 the vulnerable permafrost in the sayr is projected to degraded quickly sheng et al 2020 accompanying with the great development of taliks underneath the thermokarst lakes cheng and jin 2013 finally widespread desiccation of thermokarst lakes bouchard et al 2013 would be foreseen which has been observed on central qtp yang et al 2019b in addition formation and extension of taliks in some regions would enhance the hydrological connections between thermokarst lakes and groundwater and absolutely altered the recharge types of thermokarst lakes from rainfall dominated to groundwater dominated macdonald et al 2016 and ultimately disequilibrated the lake water balance actually the previous studies have demonstrated the hydrological transition of thermokarst lakes due to permafrost on the qtp niu et al 2011 lin et al 2010 yang et al 2016 2019b and in the sayr wan et al 2019 jiang 2020 yi et al 2018 șerban et al 2020 yang et al 2019a under the context of a continuous increase of air temperature and rapid decreases in frozen depth the soil water and surface runoff declined drastically and the level of ground water and lake dropped remarkably which resulted in the degradation of ecosystem function and the intensifying of desertification in the sayr zhang et al 2004 wang et al 2020 latest study suggested that the areal extent of permafrost degradation into seasonal frost under the three scenarios of climate change rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 in the sayr by 2050 sheng et al 2020 when the time comes the thermokarst processes would accelerate and finally overturn the surface runoff and discharge behaviors destroyed the regional vegetation and altered the landscapes all these changes reversely influenced the permafrost thaw and finally lead to the transition of thermokarst lakes from rainfall dominated into groundwater dominated or even desiccated 7 conclusions thermokarst lakes were investigated in the source area of yellow river sayr on large scales using stable isotopes combined with the evolution of isotopes in precipitation supra pw ground ice and sub pw the spatial and temporal variations in the isotope hydrology of lakes were remarkable which caused by the seasonal differences in the climate conditions and the resultant transitions in initial recharge water the local evaporation lines lels of thermokarst lakes were built for different sites in the sayr the deviations from the lmwl are indicative of evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes and the input of different water the evaporation to inflow e i ratios reveal substantial evaporation for all thermokarst lakes the recharge patterns of thermokarst lakes are classified according to the relative position of δi δp supra permafrost water rainfall dominated lakes were defined when δi δp i e

thermokarst lakes and the controlling factors are discussed which are suggesting a combination effect of air temperature precipitation regimes permafrost degradation in the sayr considering the intensive degradation of permafrost in the sayr and the expansion of taliks the development and drainage of thermokarst lakes will exert potentially substantial influence on the regional hydrology and

4643,regarded as the water towers of numerous large rivers in asia the source area of yellow river sayr on northeast qinghai tibet plateau qtp contains substantial thermokarst lakes which have exerted significant roles on the regional hydrology and water resources under permafrost degradation to address the potential impact of climate and permafrost induced changes in surface hydrological processes in the sayr the hydrological transitions and water balance of thermokarst lakes were characterized on large scales during three years using stable isotope method spatial and seasonal deviations in hydrological processes of thermokarst lakes were remarkable calculations of evaporation to inflow e i ratios based on an isotope mass balance model revealed substantial evaporation for all thermokarst lakes during june due to the control of climate conditions and limited input water substantial feeds from summer fall rain and permafrost meltwater resulted in lower evaporation and positive water balance of lakes during july august september and october based on the relationship between lake specific input water isotope compositions δi and annual average isotope value of precipitation δp the recharge patterns of thermokarst lakes in the sayr were classified supra permafrost water rainfall dominated lakes were mainly concentrated during june and october regardless of spatial divergences and summer precipitation permafrost thaw dominated lakes are popular during july and august qualitatively seasonal diversities in the water balance of thermokarst lakes are combinatively controlled by air temperature precipitation regimes permafrost degradation in the sayr lastly the future hydrological trajectories of thermokarst lakes are expected under climatic warming and permafrost degradation this study serves as an important contribution for understanding future hydrological changes and allocation of water resources on the qtp as well as an indication of permafrost degradation under climate warming keywords thermokarst lakes source area of yellow river sayr stable isotopes ground ice permafrost degradation water balance 1 introduction thermokarst lakes defined as lakes that usually occupy closed depressions formed by the settlement of ground following thawing of ice rich permafrost or melting of massive ice van everdingen 1998 are widespread in high ice content permafrost regions in arctic sub arctic and boreal lowland areas grosse et al 2013 as well as alpine high mountain regions kääb and haeberli 2001 niu et al 2011 șerban et al 2020 the formation and development of thermokarst lakes is a dominant pattern of permafrost degradation and is closely linked with increased air temperature and precipitation turner et al 2014a the deepening of seasonal thawed layer and the resultant melting of near surface ground ice and gradual water impoundment grosse et al 2013 considering the predominant controlling by precipitation lateral or bottom permafrost ice meltwater and evaporation woo and guan 2006 niu et al 2011 levy et al 2013 tondu et al 2013 the water balances of thermokarst lake are sensitive to climate change continued climate warming and permafrost thawing has altered the spatial distribution of thermokarst lakes and regional hydrologic systems turner et al 2014a gibson and reid 2014 gibson et al 2015 and also induced the development of subsurface flow pathways yoshikawa and hinzman 2003 jepsen et al 2013a previous studies documented that permafrost degradation significantly changed the water balance of thermokarst lakes macdonald et al 2016 narancic et al 2017 and meltwater of ground ice contributed about one third of input water to thermokarst lakes fedorov et al 2014 permafrost thaw controlled the changes of thermokarst lake status number size and related hydrological variabilities karlsson et al 2012 gibson et al 2015 importantly the great interest was to determine the effect of changing thermokarst lakes hydrology and the resultant permafrost degradation on carbon release to the atmosphere walter et al 2006 2014 olefeldt et al 2013 which remarkably changed the hydro geomorphic changes e g arp et al 2011 and further accelerated greenhouse gases releases walter et al 2006 as the main runoff generation region the source area of the yellow river sayr provides 34 8 of the total water resources of the yellow river hu et al 2011 yuan et al 2015 qin et al 2017 which is of vital importance to the water supplies of mid lower reaches instrumental records suggested that the degradation of permafrost in the sayr is remarkable sheng et al 2020 including the increase of average active layer thickness by 50 cm during 40 years sheng et al 2020 and the decrease of permafrost area ratio by 1 1 per year qin et al 2017 meanwhile the supra permafrost water was reduced by about 1 5 108 m3 in 20 years peng et al 2003 due to the deepening of active layer and the formation of taliks cheng and jin 2013 which significantly depressed the groundwater table jin et al 2009 importantly the permafrost between 3 m and 10 m in the sayr preserved as much as 49 62 km3 of ground ice wang et al 2017 accounting for 2 89 time of the total reserves of the sister lakes gyaring lake and ngöring lake fig 1 which will exert significant influence on the development and expansion of thermokarst processes jin et al 2010 duan et al 2015 the regional hydrological evolution yang et al 2019a as well as release of doc to alter regional carbon cycle yang et al 2021 latest studies suggested that small alpine lakes have increased in lake surface areas and numbers partly due to permafrost degradation luo et al 2020a based on the multi isotope method studies clarified the thermokarst lake water balance in different sites and illuminated the evaporation characteristics for each lake in the sayr wan et al 2019 in addition researchers also suggested that permafrost thaw and groundwater played important roles on the thermokarst lake water balance in discontinuous permafrost area in the sayr jiang 2020 these studies emphasized the importance of thermokarst lakes on the regional hydrology and effect of permafrost degradation on the water balance however considering the remarkable spatial and temporal variability in the hydrology and water balance of thermokarst lakes turner et al 2010 jepsen et al 2013a these limited studies on small scales only qualitatively exhibited the isotopic patterns of thermokarst lakes due to the spatial differences in the permafrost distributions sheng et al 2020 the distinct climatic conditions and the vegetation covers in the sayr jin et al 2009 the hydrological properties and the water balances of thermokarst lakes were bound to exhibit substantial divergences regionally accordingly great attentions should be paid on thermokarst lake hydrology at spatial dimensions in the sayr accordingly here we aim 1 to clarify the spatial and seasonal differences in the hydrological variations of thermokarst lakes at four different sites in the sayr 2 to determine the recharge types of thermokarst lakes and 3 estimate the seasonal water balance of thermokarst lakes our results cannot only illuminate the spatial and seasonal variations in the hydrological processes of thermokarst lakes but can also provide important information of permafrost degradation indicated by lake isotopes 2 study area the sayr located on the northeastern qtp is encompassing an area of approximately 2 9 104 km2 and defining the duoshixia 34 34 41 n 98 19 28 e as the outlet luo et al 2020a the elevation is ranging between 4197 m and 5266 m with an average of 4500 m the reported mean annual air temperature is lower than 4 c and the annual precipitation amounts ranged between 300 and 400 mm most of which occurs in the ice free season between june and october yang et al 2019a the vegetation patterns exhibit significantly regional differentiations with predominant distribution of alpine meadow in the southern sayr and primary spread of alpine steppe in the northern sayr luo et al 2020a which have exerted remarkable influence on the regional hydrology and development of thermokarst lakes yang et al 2019a as many as 80 of the sayr is underlain by frozen ground consisting of continuous discontinuous sporadic and isolated patches of permafrost as well as seasonally frozen ground which has experienced frequent transitions under climate warming jin et al 2009 an approximate of 49 62 km3 of ground ice is preserved between 3 m and 10 m in the sayr which played important roles on the hydrological processes and water balance of thermokarst lakes due to gradual melting yang et al 2019a 2019b a recent study suggested that the lake surface area and lake numbers changed dramatically partly driven by the degradation of frozen ground luo et al 2020a in this study four sites along the northwest southeast transaction in the sayr are selected fig 1a including the upmost reaches of source area ursa fig 1b the shuangchagou basin in the central sayr scg fig 1c the chalaping region clp fig 1d and the bayan har mountain pass region byh fig 1e the ursa site is classified as high ice content alpine permafrost region with the mean annual ground temperature magt ranging between 2 c and 1 c sheng et al 2020 located at the westernmost area of the sayr numerous rivers were formed via convergence of supra permafrost water supra pw snowmelt water and precipitation runoffs also a great quantity of thermokarst lakes ponds appeared the scg basin is located in the ice rich permafrost region with permafrost thickness of about 20 40 m and a magt of approximately 0 7 c plentiful of thermokarst lakes are distributed in scg basin most of which were shallower less than1 m and smaller yang et al 2019a the clp is located in the southeast part of the sayr fig 1a the permafrost belongs to the marginal zone of plateau discontinuous permafrost of the qtp luo et al 2020b and exhibits an active layer thickness of thinner than 1 5 m luo et al 2018a field investigation identified substantial water bodies 750 in number in this region which accounted for 2 83 of the land area of clp luo et al 2018a for comparison most of the lakes are larger and deeper fig 1d and are considered to be of thermokarst origin the byh region is located in the southeast of the sayr fig 1a and identified as high ice content alpine permafrost region the magt is about 1 5 c and the permafrost thickness is 40 m 50 m substantially enriched in ground ice cao et al 2017 due to the remarkable influence of the summer monsoon on the southern slopes of the byh there is greater precipitation on the southern slopes luo et al 2018b which resulted in the expansion of thermokarst lakes by contrast the thermokarst lakes at byh exhibit larger lake area but shallower depths 3 materials and methods 3 1 description of field sampling work to completely accomplish the objectives thermokarst lakes at 4 sites in the sayr were investigated between 2014 and 2016 during the ice free seasons because most of the regions in the sayr are desolate and uninhabited so it is not very easy to investigate lake around the whole sayr thus we only sampled occasionally one or two times during some months in one or two sites however in total 101 lake water samples were collected from all four sites in 2014 20 and 21 at scg during july and september respectively 29 at byh during october 31 at ursa during october 56 in 2015 11 at scg and 45 at byh during june 74 in 2016 2 and 4 at scg during april and july 27 and 35 at clp during july and august lake water samples were collected near the center of each lake at a depth of 20 cm below the water surface in addition supra pw samples were obtained at each site if possible totally 4 and 13 supra pw samples were obtained in the ursa and scg respectively besides 4 deep well ground water samples were collected in madoi county 2 sub permafrost ground water samples were collected at the scg during drilling work all the water samples were preserved in 30 ml high density polyethylene bottles and kept cool at 4 c for stable isotope analysis three permafrost profiles 0 3 m were evacuated at scg fig 1c in the sayr to collect near surface ground ice 0 3 m yang et al 2017 in total twenty one ground ice samples at different depths were obtained between 1 4 and 2 5 m each ice sample was collected using disposable pe gloves to prevent contamination the exterior of each subsample was removed to avoid any mixing with neighbor ice or surplus water ground ice samples were preserved in hdpe bottles and kept frozen yang et al 2019a 3 2 collection and analysis of meteorological data in order to exactly estimate the spatial and seasonal transisitons of thermokarst lakes the daily meteorological data between 2014 and 2016 from different meteorological stations nearby each site was collected and used in specific the daily data from maduo micro meteorological station 30 km away from the ursa fig 1a was used to constrain the climate conditions of the ursa the data from madoi and qingshuihe national meteorological station were applied in the lake hydrology evaluation at clp 80 km apart fig 1a and byh 70 km apart respectively the climate data from a micro meteorological station setup by state key laboratory of frozen soil engineering was used at scg fig 1 in this study the daily air temperatures ta precipitation amounts p and relative humidity rh were used 3 3 stable isotopes analysis all collected samples were analyzed for stable isotope δ18o δd composition by using an isotope liquid water and water vapor analyzer l2130 i picarro usa with a wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy technique in the state key laboratory of frozen soil engineering chinese academy of sciences before analysis every sample was filtered through 0 22 μm disposable membrane filters to remove impurities isotope compositions are expressed as

was less than 0 08 for δ18o and 0 2 for δd 3 4 stable isotope mass balance modeling isotope hydrology evaporation characteristics water balance of thermokarst lakes in permafrost regions are closely related to the climate conditions the initial source water the permafrost and ice conditions and the hydrological properties for individual lakes the stable isotope clusters of thermokarst lakes at 4 sites were synthesized and the local evaporation lines lels were built and embed in the stable isotope framework in δ18o δd space consisting of the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line lmwl an isotope mass balance imb model put forward by previous research gonfiantini 1986 gibson and edwards 2002 was introduced to illuminate the spatial and seasonal variations in

the ck values are experimental constants which are set as 14 2 for δ18o and 12 5 for δd gonfiantini 1986 araguás araguás et al 2000 in cold regions that experience extended periods of ice cover the

lake isotope hydrology at the four sites the boxplots of stable isotopes δ18o d excess of thermokarst lakes and monthly climatic factors at the four sites are presented to clarify the seasonal variations in thermokarst lake hydrology fig 2 generally no matter which sites the lakes belong to they exhibit more enriched δ18o and lower d excess during april and june suggesting considerable import of isotopically positive water e g evaporated surface water meltwater of lake ice to lakes and the influence of evaporation during april 2016 at scg all lakes were frozen up due to negative air temperature fig 2c which prevented any kinds of water from feeding lakes accordingly the more enriched δ18o and lower d excess was caused by the evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes δ18o δd during summer and fall season in the previous year before freezing by contrast the reasons for the similarly enriched δ18o and lower d excess of lakes during june fig 2a 2b are considered to be different during june the air temperature increased gradually resulting in the progressive melting of lake river ice with more enriched δ18o yang et al 2019b which mixed with unfrozen lake water and subsequently altered the isotopic contents of original lake water in addition the precipitation amounts were abundant fig 2c and were characterized by much higher δ18o values 5 ren et al 2013 thus these lakes substantially fed by isotopically positive precipitation and meltwater of lake river ice combined with the evaporation are bound to be enriched in heavier isotopes the lakes sampled during july exhibit spatially different isotopic patterns fig 2a 2b more enriched δ18o and lower d excess patterns are showing in lakes monitored in 2014 at scg however lakes surveyed in 2016 in both sites represent more depleted δ18o fig 2a and higher d excess fig 2b this demonstrates distinct factors controlling lake isotope hydrology during july at scg the lakes surveyed in 2014 reveal higher δ18o and lower d excess compared with those in 2016 fig 2a 2b a minority of lakes in 2016 at scg was occasionally sampled near the wanlongwoma wl lake which were susceptible to the transportation of recycled water moisture from wl lake fig 1c thus significantly decreased the δ18o values and elevated the d excess of thermokarst lake water vallet coulomb et al 2008 bowen et al 2012 accordingly the isotopic patterns of lakes in 2016 at scg are unrepresentative however combined with the data in the clp in 2016 they can reflect the average level of precipitation during july in 2016 during august september and october lakes show δ18o approaching to the average value of summer precipitation fig 2a emphasizing the predominant contributions of summer fall precipitation to the lake water balance the lakes monitored during august however display slightly enriched δ18o fig 2a and lower d excess fig 2b than those during the other two months due to stronger evaporation caused by highest air temperature fig 2c during september less precipitation fig 2c with more enriched δ18o ren et al 2013 yang et al 2019a fig 2 was responsible for the more enriched of δ18o in the lake water during october a substantial decrease of precipitation amounts fig 2c is accompanied by a dramatic drop of air temperature which hampered evaporative enrichment the depletions of δ18o values are importantly influenced by the fall precipitation and melting ground ice yang et al 2019a 4 1 2 seasonal differences in the isotope hydrology of thermolarst lakes in order to determine the seasonal differences in the lake hydrology the stable isotopes of lakes collected during different months in the four sites are presented fig 3 generally the majority of thermokarst lakes are substantially enriched in heavier isotopes than ground ice and the average value of annual precipitation except lakes collected during july at clp fig 3c emphasizing the remarkable evaporation characteristics of thermokarst lakes yang et al 2016 turner et al 2014a narancic et al 2017 however the isotope hydrology of the lakes shows regional differences during the same month fig 3b c d e f during june lakes from two sites were investigated fig 3b all the lakes exhibit more enriched isotopes which are mostly except one lake plotting above the average values of summer precipitation fig 3a 3b suggesting the influence of greater evaporation on lake isotopes and the input of isotopically positive water gibson and reid 2014 yang et al 2019b specifically the isotope points of scg lakes concentrate in a narrow range which is far beyond the average value of precipitation and ground ice when comparing with the byh fig 3b reflecting stronger evaporation according to the field survey scg lakes are characterized by shallow water depths and small lake areas the lake water can froze to the lake bottom in cold seasons making the heavier isotopes preferentially incorporate into solid ice yang et al 2019b the lake ice suffered sublimation and further increased the enrichment of heavier isotopes sublimation of lake ice is driven by the differences in the temperature between the ambient air and the surface ice and the moisture deficit of the ambient air this sublimation process caused an isotopic enrichment at the surface ice stichler et al 2001 subsequently the lake ice with more enriched δ18o yang et al 2019b began to melt when air temperature rising gradually and mixed with the remaining unfrozen lake water as calculated the δi of scg lakes is much higher than the average value of summer precipitation fig 3b which further confirms the predominant contributions of isotopically positive water for comparison the isotopes of byh lakes during june extend over a wider range suggesting diversities of initial source water and different lake hydrological conditions wolfe et al 2011 turner et al 2014b narancic et al 2017 yang et al 2017 2019b the δi value for byh lakes is more depleted than that for scg lakes and locates between average value of summer and annual precipitation fig 3b which is suggestive of important influence of summer rain on the lake isotopes field record indicates that the byh lakes are not of uniform size and represent various hydrological conditions including closed system lakes through flow lakes and seasonal lakes dried up in the cold seasons also the vegetation covers surrounding lakes were different all these result in the divergences of the distributions of lake isotopes along the lel turner et al 2014a during july only lakes in the scg and clp were monitored fig 3c the lakes display extensively wide range in isotopes fig 3c reflecting remarkable differences in the initial source water of lakes gibson and reid 2014 the divergences of lake hydrological conditions i e water depth lake area closed system or open system yang et al 2017 and the inter annual and spatial variations in climate condition yang et al 2019b by comparison the majority of the lakes in the scg exhibit more enriched isotopes which are plotting far beyond the average isotope value of precipitation and ground ice fig 3c demonstrating the greater evaporation of lake water the thermokarst lakes at clp display a broader range fig 3c which is extending substantially with a fluctuation extent of 15 for δ18o and 86 for δd remarkably capturing substantial within landscape variability macdonald et al 2016 and the transition of input initial source water anderson et al 2013 stable isotope composition of partial clp lakes were superimposed on the isotope range of ground ice and the average value of winter precipitation fig 3c indicating the important contribution of permafrost ground ice thaw and snowmelt anderson et al 2013 although great differences in the lake isotope composition are observed between scg and clp similar lels are obtained table 1 the calculated δi values in the two sites are much more depleted and are nearly identical fig 3c much more depleted δi values and higher slopes of lels suggest that evaporation was less important and isotopically depleted input water can be identified to feed these lakes during july in the two sites anderson et al 2013 macdonald et al 2016 yang et al 2016 2019b as shown the δi value of scg lakes is nearly identical to the average value of winter precipitation suggesting that recharge from snowmelt to scg lakes is significant if the isotopes of four lakes collected during july 2016 are discarded the lel is expressed as δd 6 09δ18o 20 37 r2 0 71 and the calculated δi 14 4 107 9 is virtually identical to that of clp lakes implying the similar initial source water for the lakes in the two sites importantly the δi values of lakes in scg and clp are ranging between average values of annual and winter precipitation and ground ice fig 3c demonstrating the considerable replenishment of melting ground ice and fall winter precipitation previous study has reported substantial inputs from melting ground ice to small streams at scg basin which reached as high as 5 38 17 5 yang et al 2019a only clp lakes were investigated during august 2016 the isotope dots are plotting well below the lmwl fig 3d indicating strong evaporation of lakes due to higher air temperature gibson and edwards 2002 narancic et al 2017 majority of lakes exhibit much more enriched isotopes than the average value of summer precipitation fig 3d and lower slope of lel table 1 implying appreciable recharge from summer rain and evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes in lake water gibson and edwards 2002 wan et al 2019 a small portion of lakes have isotopes been located among average values of summer and annual precipitation fig 3d suggesting feed from summer and or fall precipitation the calculated δi value table 1 is in between average value of annual precipitation and melting ground ice fig 3d emphasizing the combining influence of summer precipitation and melting ground ice on the lake hydrology during august however the contribution from melting ground ice cannot be neglected which was statistically confirmed that the melting ground ice had contributed 24 31 28 31 of total discharge of streams amount during august in the scg yang et al 2019a during september the scg lakes exhibit much more enriched isotopes which are mostly located above the average value of summer precipitation fig 3e and far beyond the isotopic composition of ground ice the lel presents typical evaporation characteristics gibson and edwards 2002 which further evidenced the characteristic of isotope changes in open water bodies subject to evaporation craig and gordon 1965 gibson 2002b the calculated δi value table 1 is identical to the mean value of summer precipitation fig 3e it is suggestive of replenishment of isotopically positive summer rain ren et al 2013 yang et al 2019a the isotopically positive rain during september was attributed to the admixing of evaporated flux along the monsoon trajectory ren et al 2013 and the local recycled water bowen et al 2012 which substantially recharged the lakes during october the thermokarst lakes at ursa and byh were investigated there are remarkable differences in the lake isotopes between ursa and byh fig 3f with more enriched δ18o and higher d excess at ursa table 1 reflecting distinct divergences in the initial source water and evaporation macdonald et al 2016 narancic et al 2017 between the two sites all of the lakes at ursa extend isotope points above the average value of summer precipitation fig 3f and the δi value is more enriched table 1 suggesting the input of isotopically positive water to these lakes anderson et al 2013 gibson and reid 2014 yang et al 2019b according to field surveys a large number of surface streams and wetlands extensively distributed across the ursa regions the regional evaporated vapor from open water can contribute considerable amounts of precipitation to this region and recharge lakes in addition much slower degradation of permafrost in this region sheng et al 2020 greatly decreased the thermokarst processes and the further deepening of thermokarst lakes and the resultant contribution of isotopically depleted melting water due to permafrost thaw gibson et al 2015 yang et al 2019a 2019b the shallow thermokarst lakes are susceptible to evaporation and directly preserved the isotope signals of evaporative enrichment yang et al 2019b the byh lakes however exhibit more depleted isotopes with the majority of isotope points concentrated on the lmwl and they distributed between average values of summer and annual precipitation fig 3f reflecting the predominant recharge from precipitation moreover the δi value is approaching to the annual average value of precipitation and ground ice emphasizing the influence of melting ground ice on the lake hydrology actually the byh is classified as high ice content permafrost with magt ranging between 1 0 and 0 5 c sheng et al 2020 luo et al 2018b the permafrost has been experiencing remarkable degradation luo et al 2018b the thawing permafrost and melting of ground ice thus exerted important roles on the lake hydrology 4 2 spatial differences in the isotope hydrology of thermokarst lakes 4 2 1 general characteristics of lake isotope hydrology at four sites generally 231 lake water samples from four sites in the sayr yield a maximum δ18o value of 0 2 and 11 4 for δd recorded in june 2015 at byh a minimum value of 16 6 and 126 1 for δd july 2016 at clp and a mean isotope composition of 6 7 for δ18o and 57 1 for δd for comparison the stable isotopic composition of thermokarst lakes in the sayr exhibit substantial deviations from the precipitation and ground ice fig 4 the spread of the δ18o and δd in the thermokarst lakes falls mainly above the average value of summer precipitation in the sayr fig 1 yang et al 2019 indicating the enrichment of heavier isotopes due to evaporation and the predominant feed of summer rain minority of lakes collected during october from byh clp and scg yield isotope clusters locating between average values of summer and annual precipitation fig 4 and they are also overlapping with the isotope range of supra pw fig 4 underlining substantial contributions of summer fall precipitation and supra pw to these lakes however thermokarst lakes at clp shows more depleted isotopes than the average value of annual precipitation and they are isotopically identical to the near surface ground ice in the sayr fig 4 this suggests that the melting of near surface ground ice due to gradual thaw of the active layer and the abundant summer precipitation with more depleted isotopes in july fig 2 considerably fed these lakes a previous study also emphasized the considerable contribution of melting ground ice to the streams during july in the scg yang et al 2019a two lakes at clp in particular exhibit much more depleted isotopes than the average value of winter precipitation fig 4 implying the replenishment of snowmelt water intercepted by alpine meadows specifically the distribution of stable isotopes deviates between the four sites the lakes in the ursa show relatively a narrow range of isotopes from 9 4 to 2 9 for δ18o and 65 1 to 31 9 for δd with a mean value of 6 8 and 52 2 respectively the isotope compositions of clp lakes span a considerable range along the lmwl which is varying between 16 6 and 2 4 for δ18o and from 126 1 to 35 5 for δd with a mean value of 8 5 and 73 1 for comparison the lakes at scg and byh present similar ranges and locations relative to the lmwl fig 4 it ranges from 10 6 to 0 9 for δ18o and 88 3 to 18 9 for δd at scg and between 12 0 to 0 2 for δ18o and from 83 5 to 11 4 for δd at byh these spatial differences indicate the combined influences of permafrost conditions ground ice contents yang et al 2019a landscapes turner et al 2014a climate conditions air temperature and precipitation and the hydrological divergences of thermokarst lakes yang et al 2017 4 2 2 spatial differences in the isotope hydrology of thermokarst lakes in order to clarify the hydrological differences of thermokarst lakes in the four sites the specific δ18o δd relationships called local evaporation lines lels are built based on the stable isotope compositions of individual lakes at each site fig 5 the lake specific input water isotope compositions δi the isotopic composition of a terminal lake at isotopic and hydrological steady state where evaporation equals inflow δssl ground ice isotopes and average values of precipitation are drawn for comparison fig 5 thermokarst lakes at scg basin exhibit a wide range of isotopes and all of them are plotted below the lmwl fig 5a suggesting diverse hydrological behaviors of thermokarst lakes and strong seasonality of climate conditions which have exerted important roles on the input water and evaporation of lakes the lel of scg has a slope in the typical range of evaporated water systems gibson and edwards 2002 suggesting strong evaporation of lakes using the intersection of lmwl and lel the δi was calculated which provides an estimate of the average isotope level of input water overall the calculated δi value is identical to the annual average value of precipitation fig 5a yang et al 2019a and is approaching to the values of supra pw fig 5a it is suggestive of the predominant feed by precipitation and supra pw different lakes however show various isotope distributions along the lmwl for instance the lakes with comparatively depleted isotopes were mainly investigated during july when summer precipitation possessing more depleted isotopes ren et al 2013 yang et al 2019a was abundant fig 2 and the air temperature was higher yang et al 2019a fig 2 both of which accelerated the significant deepening of active layer and the melting of near surface ground ice in addition the local recycled vapor from two large lakes fig 1 was strong due to higher air temperature which brought abundant isotopically depleted moisture to replenish thermokarst lakes vallet coulomb et al 2008 we thus conclude that the isotopically depleted precipitation and melting ground ice is responsible for the depletion of heavier isotope in these lakes during july some lakes isotopically overlapped with the supra pw and are close to the average value of summer precipitation reflecting notable input of summer rain and supra pw in addition another important parameter of δssl was taken for comparison the relative position between stable isotopes of individual lakes δl and the δssl can indicate the evaporation degrees of lakes turner et al 2014a here at scg the majority of thermokarst lakes investigated during june and july present δl plotting close to or beyond the δssl fig 5a indicating greater evaporative isotope enrichment due to the differences in the saturated vapor pressure between light and heavy isotopes the light molecule 16o 1h evaporated preferentially and the heavy molecule 18o 2h increased in liquid phase zhang et al 2005 in addition recharge of melting water from lake ice with more enriched isotopes yang et al 2019b was also responsible for the enriched isotopes in these lakes in cold seasons during the process of freezing the heavier isotopes δ18o and δd preferentially enriched in the ice due to an increase of water molecules and a decrease of solute concentration ferrick et al 2002 lacelle 2011 we conclude that the more enriched isotopes in thermokarst lakes at scg were both influenced by evaporative enrichment and meltwater of lake ice the detailed discussions of evaporative characteristics are characterized further with calculation of δi and e i values at ursa all the isotope dots of lakes are concentrated in the upper corner of the diagram with most of them locating far beyond the average value of summer precipitation and supra pw fig 5b reflecting the recharge of isotopically positive waters and the influence of evaporation similarly the slope of lel in the ursa is in between the range of evaporated water bodies gibson and edwards 2002 evidencing the evaporative enrichment of lake isotopes the estimated δi is close to the average value of summer precipitation and the supra pw values fig 5b suggesting important replenishment of summer rain and supra pw generated surface flow which were ubiquitous in the field in addition these lakes are differentiated according to the relative position between δl and δssl these lakes with δl higher than the δssl indicate remarkable evaporation fig 5b similar to the lakes at scg the isotopes of clp lakes extend a broad range which covers the whole scope of precipitation and partially overlapped with ground ice fig 5c suggesting feed by multiple sources of waters including summer rain winter snowmelt and melting ground ice with different isotopic patterns fig 5c the slope of lel for clp lakes is nearly identical to that of ursa and is in between the range of evaporated water system 4 6 gibson and edwards 2002 reflecting striking evaporation the calculated δi value is more depleted than those at scg and ursa fig 5a b c and is approaching to the average value of near surface ground ice fig 5c yang et al 2019a suggesting the important recharge of melting ground ice and or snowmelt water according to the field investigations lakes at clp are surrounded by alpine meadow of 80 90 in coverage which well intercepted the snow and meanwhile decreased the evaporation intensity of active layer water therefore attenuated the evaporative enrichment in heavier isotopes of the initial source water snowmelt active layer water in particular 4 lakes with δl positioning further along the lel and exhibit extremely depleted isotopes which are plotting close to that of average winter precipitation fig 5c this finding is suggestive of a stronger influence of snowmelt on lake water balance in addition the relative positions of δssl δl are likewise reflecting the lake water balance conditions in the clp more than half of thermokarst lakes present higher δl than the δssl fig 5c emphasizing evaporation as the predominant controls on the lake water balance these lakes with much higher δl δl δssl were mainly collected during august during when the nearly maximum annual air temperature fig 2 could cause strong evaporation instead lakes with δl values larger that the δssl were less susceptible to evaporation and can be considered as positive water balance lakes at byh the isotopes of all lakes are plotting above the annual average value of precipitation fig 5d reflecting different degrees of evaporation in contrast to the distance from δl to δp minority of lakes exhibit isotopes locating between average value of summer and annual precipitation fig 5d indicating replenishment from summer and fall rain most of lakes however are extending δl above the average value of summer precipitation underlining the input of evaporated water e g lake ice evaporated snowmelt water and active layer water and the influence of evaporative enrichment the lel is similar to that of scg lakes fig 5a and is in between the range of evaporated water system 4 6 gibson and edwards 2002 reflecting evaporation characteristics similarly the calculated δi is also identical to the annual average value of precipitation it indicates that the annual precipitation is the predominant source water of these lakes in addition the δi is close to those of partial ground ice in the upper layer 1 0 1 4 m yang et al 2019a implying the contribution of melting ground ice which cannot be neglected under permafrost degradation yang et al 2016 the δssl compositions also make lakes split into two categories evaporative dominated and rainfall dominated the evaporative dominated lakes were mainly collected during june and the rainfall dominated lakes were investigated during october which will be discussed below 4 3 quantification of evaporation to inflow e i ratios for thermokarst lakes the e i ratios of thermokarst lakes for the 4 sites were determined to quantify the importance of evaporative processes for individual lake water balances fig 6 generally most of thermokarst lakes have e i ratios less than 1 fig 6 suggesting positive water balance however minority of thermokarst lakes at scg and byh exhibit more depleted water balance indicating by higher e i ratios 1 brock et al 2009 turner et al 2014b specifically e i ratios range from 0 00 to 1 14 mean 0 41 for scg lakes from 0 00 to 1 98 mean 0 48 for byh lakes from 0 01 to 0 75 for clp lakes mean 0 28 and from 0 03 to 0 51 for ursa lakes mean 0 16 respectively by comparison scg and byh lakes possess the highest e i ratios which is closely related to the sampling periods as shown the higher e i values mainly appear during june and july in both sites fig 6 indicative of negative water balances during june and july turner et al 2014b narancic et al 2017 thus the lower e i ratios at clp and ursa possess strongly positive water balances as reported e i values represent the relative importance of evaporation on lakes with e i 0 5 identifying as evaporation dominated lakes turner et al 2014b accordingly we classified the lakes monitored during june and july as evaporation dominated lakes in the four sites and these investigated from august to september are classified as precipitation permafrost thaw lakes in order to examine the seasonal differences in the lake evaporation the d excess and climate conditions are synthesized fig 6 overall the higher e i values of lakes monitored during june and july are corresponding to the lower d excess fig 6 suggesting the great influences of evaporative enrichment gibson 2002b turner et al 2014a however the corresponding relationships between e i ratios and climate conditions are not totally consistent fig 6 for instance the highest e i mean 0 68 appears at byh lakes during june however the air temperature during june was not the highest fig 6 it was due to the surface area to depth ratios at byh which led to stronger evaporation wang et al 2019 conversely the clp lakes monitored during august exhibit lower e i ratios mean 0 31 although air temperature was highest fig 6 accordingly we conclude that the variations in the e i are comprehensively influenced by multiple constraints i e air temperature precipitation lake hydrological conditions water depths lake areas closed or opened by comparison the lake evaporation was not very strong due to lower air temperature during june fig 6 the higher e i values were influenced by seven extremely evaporation dominated lakes e i 1 0 fig 6 if the e i values of these 7 lakes were discarded the rest of the lakes have mean e i value of 0 55 which represents a nearly equilibrium condition between evaporation e and inflow i due to a large denominator abundant precipitation input see fig 6 narancic et al 2017 the lakes monitored during july and august exhibit the second highest e i mean 0 40 for july and 0 31 for august which are supposed to be mainly controlled both by strong evaporation due to higher air temperature and input of plentiful rainfall fig 6 similarly a minority of lakes exhibits particularly high e i 1 0 during july and august which enhance the average level of e i ratios either at byh or at ursa the e i ratios of lakes are the lowest during september and october mean 0 08 for september and 0 15 for october suggesting rather weak evaporative influence it is indicative of minor influence of due to negative air temperature during october fig 6 which greatly attenuated the evaporation also the feed of fall precipitation and melting ground ice is important in addition the seasonal differences in e i and the related controlling factors are evidenced by the variations in d excess which well reflected the evaporation degrees and the alternations of input water more depleted d excess in july and august lakes is consistent with the higher air temperature suggesting the predominant controls of evaporation on the water balance yang et al 2019b however the more enriched d excess values in june lakes are corresponding to the highest e i and low air temperature emphasizing the combination effects of higher air temperature and low precipitation the highest d excess in september and october lakes demonstrate the predominant control of low air temperature and plentiful precipitation additionally lakes monitored during the same months in different sites show divergences in e i in contrast lakes investigated at scg during june exhibit relatively lower e i than those in byh lakes fig 6 with mean value of 0 60 for scg and 0 68 for byh on one hand the higher e i values were controlled by higher air temperature and relatively low precipitation in the byh evidenced by more depleted d excess in these lakes on the other hand the recycled water moisture at scg basin originating from substantial evaporation of wanlongwoma lake fig 1c can contribute large amounts of precipitable water to thermokarst lakes and well buffered the influence of evaporation which is further evidenced by the more enriched d excess at scg lakes fig 6 during july the scg lakes display much higher e i mean 0 56 than those at clp lakes mean 0 23 fig 6 implying the buffering effect of more precipitation and high coverage of alpine meadow at clp when considering the nearly identical air temperature in both sites during july fig 6 the identically low lake e i ratios at both byh and ursa during october emphasize the weak evaporation due to low air temperature during october fig 6 moreover the thermokarst lakes during october can receive permafrost ground ice meltwater which identified as isotopically depleted yang et al 2019a and tends to be less evaporatively enriched gibson et al 2015 5 discussions 5 1 recharge type classification of thermokarst lakes the lake specific initial source water isotopic composition values δi were calculated for different months at the four sites to evaluate and classify the relative contributions of summer precipitation supra pw and melting water from permafrost ground ice thaw to water balance of lakes the δi values range from 15 3 to 7 7 for δ18o and 115 7 to 52 0 for δd the wide variations in δi fig 7 a indicate the high variability in the average proportion of initial source water to lakes macdonald et al 2016 due to the remarkable seasonality of climate conditions air temperature and precipitation the involvement of supra pw and permafrost ground ice meltwater and the lake hydrological conditions yang et al 2019b lake initial source water classifications were defined by δi relative to the mean annual isotope composition of precipitation δp where δi δp for rainfall dominated lakes δi δp for snowmelt dominated lakes and δi δp for permafrost thaw dominated lakes turner et al 2010 macdonald et al 2016 yang et al 2019b accordingly the recharge patterns of thermokarst lakes in the sayr can be classified into supra permafrost water rainfall dominated and summer precipitaion permafrost thaw dominated fig 7a for comparison the lakes investigated during june september and october have δi values plotting above δp δi δp and are locating in the range of supra pw suggesting summer rainfall and supra pw as the predominant source water fig 7a regionally these kinds of lakes can be divided into two groups relative to the mean isotope composition of summer precipitation fig 7a the lakes at scg and ursa exhibit more enriched δi values which are greater than or equal to the average value of summer precipitation fig 7a but the δi values are much smaller than the average value of summer precipitation at byh lakes fig 7a illustrating the regional differences in climate conditions and the moisture sources of precipitation ren et al 2013 the scg and ursa located in the middle and upper reach are less susceptible to the influence of monsoonal moisture which can bring isotopically depleted precipitation ren et al 2013 yao et al 2013 in addition the lake hydrology at scg was significantly influenced by the recycled water moisture yang et al 2019a originating from ngoring and gyaring lake fig 1a and the wanlongwoma lake fig 1c which also altered the δi of thermokarst lakes by contrast the byh is located at the southeastern of the sayr abundant supra permafrost water from the south slope of bayan har mountain fig 7e can replenish lakes which may be responsible for the lower δi wan et al 2019 during july and august however the lakes exhibit more depleted δi values distributing below δp fig 7a emphasizing the substantial recharge from isotopically depleted summer precipitation fig 7a and permafrost ground ice meltwater evidently the δi values of lakes distribute in the isotope range of the ground ice fig 7a illustrating the considerable influence of ground ice melting on the lake water balance similar depleted stable isotopes were observed at scg streams during july and august yang et al 2019a this was consistent with the conclusions drawn by yang et al 2019a who reported an average contribution of 5 38 31 9 from melting ground ice to streams during july and august in addition the more depleted δi values for the clp lakes are closely related to the low magt and higher coverage of alpine meadow luo et al 2020b which greatly attenuated the evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes when synthesizing the seasonal variations of e i remarkable disconformities are showing fig 7b the lakes monitored during june exhibit higher e i values due to strong evaporation and substantial feed of meltwater of isotopically positive lake ice yang et al 2019b which resulted in the increase of δi comparatively although the lakes investigated during july august september and october exhibit lower e i in different sites fig 7b the δi composition varies significantly fig 7a it is suggestive of alternation of initial input water of lakes during different months due to remarkable differences in the climate conditions and the resultant permafrost thawing turner et al 2014a yang et al 2019b the isotopically positive early summer rain and meltwater of lake ice generated higher δi values and strong evaporation which resulted in higher e i during june and october however monsoonal precipitation and meltwater of permafrost and ground ice with more depleted isotopes substantially mixed with lake water and dramatically decreased δi values the lower e i values are also linked with the substantial input of precipitation narancic et al 2017 and meltwater of permafrost ground ice which has been reported in the previous study yang et al 2019a the exceptionally higher e i of scg lakes monitored during july may be caused by massive input of recycled water moisture from large lake evaporation 5 2 drivers of seasonal hydrological transitions for thermokarst lakes numerous studies have paid attention on evaluating spatial temporal variations in thermokarst lakes and determining the main drivers climate change permafrost source water differences controlling hydrological divergences of thermokarst lakes anderson et al 2013 brock et al 2009 fedorov et al 2014 gibson and reid 2014 jepsen et al 2013b narancic et al 2017 yang et al 2017 wan et al 2019 all these studies suggested substantial changes in the water balances and hydrological behaviors due to anticipated changes on the ongoing climate warming and resultant permafrost thaw karlsson et al 2012 gibson et al 2015 yang et al 2017 fedorov et al 2014 increasing precipitation and rising temperature pan et al 2017 gibson et al 2017 and alternations of thermokarst landscapes turner et al 2014a narancic et al 2017 as shown in our study more than half of the thermokarst lakes in the sayr show lake isotopes δl greater than the δssl indicating intensive evaporation for most of the lakes turner et al 2010 narancic et al 2017 the seasonal variations in isotope hydrology of lakes and the significant divergences in the initial source water for all lakes in different sites are remarkable generally the water balances of thermokarst lakes are divided into four seasonal patterns according to the variations in the lels δi lake isotopes δl d excess e i and climate conditions fig 8 type i lakes these lakes monitored during june exhibited higher slopes of lels higher δl lower d excess and higher e i fig 8 they were classified as high evaporation dominated lakes during june the air temperature was raising gradually fig 8 which resulted in substantial evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes and mixing of isotopically positive meltwater from lake ice yang et al 2019b although showing plentiful precipitation fig 8g the water vapor could only stem from local recycling water in pre monsoon periods ren et al 2013 due to the frozen state of the active layer thus during june the negative water balances were emphasized which were mainly controlled by the evaporation early summer rain input and lake ice melting processes similar studies in canada suggested that the isotopically enriched lakes in june emphasized the relative importance of snowmelt versus rainfall on the lake water balance turner et al 2010 type ii lakes almost the highest slopes of lels and d excess and lowest δi δl and e i values are showing in thermokarst lakes during july fig 8 it indicates low evaporation and substantial replenishment of isotopically depleted source water to thermokarst lakes during turner et al 2010 narancic et al 2017 yang et al 2019b as shown the air temperature is not very high mean 7 5 c which greatly attenuated the evaporative enrichment the abundant precipitation as well buffered the influence of evaporation both of which synthetically resulted in much lower e i turner et al 2014a narancic et al 2017 gao et al 2018 in addition the monsoonal precipitation is prevailing during july and august in the sayr ren et al 2013 and the active layers were deepening greatly luo et al 2014 all these made the ground ice near the permafrost table melting gradually and imported considerable amounts of isotopically depleted water into lakes which significantly diluted the isotopically positive lake water and offset the influence of evaporation fedorov et al 2014 yang et al 2016 2019a however the thermokarst lakes during july at scg presented the opposite trends in parameters with more enriched δl lower d excess and higher e i than the other july lakes considering nearly identical air temperature and precipitation to clp fig 8 this kind of anomalous trends may be related to the lake morphometry and surrounding vegetation which determined the lake evaporation degrees and the plant transpiration turner et al 2010 as documented most of the lakes at scg arecharacterized by higher surface area to depth ratios and vegetation was distinctively degraded making the lakes susceptible to climate induced losses and evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes turner et al 2014a gao et al 2018 yang et al 2019b type iii lakes the lower slope increasing δi and δl and depleted d excess fig 8 indicates that evaporation of lake water during august is remarkable which is attributed to the annually highest air temperature fig 8f however substantial inflow from precipitation permafrost thaw yang et al 2019a as well as the contribution of groundwater jiang 2020 greatly decreased the level of e i although the replenishment of monsoonal precipitation and meltwater of ground ice is important yang et al 2019a the lake water evaporation and regional recycled water moisture was overwhelming which smoothed the input of isotopically depleted monsoonal precipitation and ice meltwater from permafrost ground ice thaw we conclude that the great evaporation and recharge from monsoonal precipitation coordinated the water balance of thermokarst lakes type iv lakes continuous decreasing in the slopes of lels e i and δl and increasing in the δi d excess was showing for lakes during september and october demonstrates weak evaporation the more enriched δl and δi values of lakes are approaching to the δp indicating the predominant recharge of fall precipitation turner et al 2014a yang et al 2019b as shown the air temperature is much lower which exerted little effect on the lake evaporation and the thaw depths reached the maximum during this period luo et al 2014 signifying minimal contribution of meltwater from permafrost thaw to the lakes yang et al 2019a however the amounts of active layer water reached the maximum during this period chang et al 2015 quinton and baltzer 2013 throckmorton et al 2016 which can provide feedback water to lakes therefore it can be established that fall precipitation and active layer water are the primary factors to determine the water balance of lakes 6 future hydrological implications and limitations as demonstrated by our study remarkable spatial temporal divergences in thermokarst lake hydrology are emphasized which are closely related to the climate conditions permafrost distributions and landscape evolutions during the next decades the qtp are expected to experience continuous warming ran et al 2018 leading to the increasing of air temperature prolonging of ice free seasons and substantial degradation of permafrost and the resultant alternation of regional landscapes jin et al 2009 on one hand continuous temperature aggravates the evaporative loss of water vapor from thermokarst lakes during ice free seasons presenting as elevated e i on the other hand strong radiation and higher temperature greatly accelerated the heat conduction from atmosphere to the surrounding permafrost lin et al 2010 gradual thaw of permafrost ground ice expands the thermokarst lakes and meanwhile releases considerable meltwater to feed the lakes at the early stages yang et al 2016 2019a 2019b which significantly alters the isotope signals of lake water and the water balance fedorov et al 2014 however with the gradual transition of climate to be warmer and wetter in the sayr jin et al 2009 the vulnerable permafrost in the sayr is projected to degraded quickly sheng et al 2020 accompanying with the great development of taliks underneath the thermokarst lakes cheng and jin 2013 finally widespread desiccation of thermokarst lakes bouchard et al 2013 would be foreseen which has been observed on central qtp yang et al 2019b in addition formation and extension of taliks in some regions would enhance the hydrological connections between thermokarst lakes and groundwater and absolutely altered the recharge types of thermokarst lakes from rainfall dominated to groundwater dominated macdonald et al 2016 and ultimately disequilibrated the lake water balance actually the previous studies have demonstrated the hydrological transition of thermokarst lakes due to permafrost on the qtp niu et al 2011 lin et al 2010 yang et al 2016 2019b and in the sayr wan et al 2019 jiang 2020 yi et al 2018 șerban et al 2020 yang et al 2019a under the context of a continuous increase of air temperature and rapid decreases in frozen depth the soil water and surface runoff declined drastically and the level of ground water and lake dropped remarkably which resulted in the degradation of ecosystem function and the intensifying of desertification in the sayr zhang et al 2004 wang et al 2020 latest study suggested that the areal extent of permafrost degradation into seasonal frost under the three scenarios of climate change rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 in the sayr by 2050 sheng et al 2020 when the time comes the thermokarst processes would accelerate and finally overturn the surface runoff and discharge behaviors destroyed the regional vegetation and altered the landscapes all these changes reversely influenced the permafrost thaw and finally lead to the transition of thermokarst lakes from rainfall dominated into groundwater dominated or even desiccated 7 conclusions thermokarst lakes were investigated in the source area of yellow river sayr on large scales using stable isotopes combined with the evolution of isotopes in precipitation supra pw ground ice and sub pw the spatial and temporal variations in the isotope hydrology of lakes were remarkable which caused by the seasonal differences in the climate conditions and the resultant transitions in initial recharge water the local evaporation lines lels of thermokarst lakes were built for different sites in the sayr the deviations from the lmwl are indicative of evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes and the input of different water the evaporation to inflow e i ratios reveal substantial evaporation for all thermokarst lakes the recharge patterns of thermokarst lakes are classified according to the relative position of δi δp supra permafrost water rainfall dominated lakes were defined when δi δp i e lakes monitored during june and october and summer precipitation permafrost thaw dominated lakes are considered when δi δp these investigated during july and august in addition the water balance of thermokarst lakes and the controlling factors are discussed which are suggesting a combination effect of air temperature precipitation regimes permafrost degradation in the sayr considering the intensive degradation of permafrost in the sayr and the expansion of taliks the development and drainage of thermokarst lakes will exert potentially substantial influence on the regional hydrology and

4644,satellite laser altimetry offers an opportunity to accurately measure inland water levels over the earth s surface this paper described the validation and comparison of three spaceborne missions for inland water level retrievals including the geoscience laser altimeter system glas onboard the ice cloud and land elevation satellite 1 icesat 1 as well as the newly launched advanced topographic laser altimeter system atlas onboard icesat 2 and the global ecosystem dynamics investigation gedi lidar on the international space station this study was conducted over the great lakes and lower mississippi river using in situ data from 22 gauging stations where the potential for monitoring inland water dynamics was explored the results showed that icesat 2 provided lake water level retrievals with an unprecedented accuracy rmse 0 06 m biases 0 01 0 05 m followed by icesat 1 rmse 0 10 m biases 0 04 0 10 m and then by gedi rmse 0 28 m biases 0 10 0 23 m icesat 2 also offered more accurate river water level measurements rmse 0 12 m biases 0 08 0 07 m than those of icesat 1 rmse 0 25 m biases 0 18 0 16 m and gedi rmse 0 40 m biases 0 24 0 24 m the analysis suggested that for all the altimeters the strong beam achieved higher water level accuracies than those of the weak and the nighttime acquisitions were slightly more accurate than those of the daytime however our result indicated no considerable differences between measurement accuracy and river width furthermore the analysis demonstrated their great potential in monitoring inland water dynamics especially with the combination of icesat 2 and gedi platforms this study provided a comprehensive understanding of measurement accuracies of three recent missions and recommended that end users should employ the strong beam data acquired during the nighttime for accurate water level retrievals keywords spaceborne laser altimetry icesat 2 gedi inland water level validation 1 introduction inland water plays an important role in various components of earth systems such as hydrological climatic and ecological processes pekel et al 2016 monitoring of water level variations is fundamental for the understanding of hydrological processes and for the management of water resources as well as balance of ecosystems ma et al 2020 water level has been traditionally measured in situ at selected locations with gauging stations however the deployment of spatially representative stations is insufficient on the global scale due to the cost of installation and maintenance hannah et al 2011 as well as accessibility and political issues hossain et al 2014 meanwhile the availability of global in situ stations has been decreasing in the past decades lawford et al 2013 in this context the development of new techniques for the global monitoring of water levels through satellite observations is highly desired recent satellite altimetry offers an opportunity to monitor worldwide inland water level changes there are two types of satellite altimeters the radar and the laser altimeter compared to radar altimeters laser altimeters are characterized by small footprints and high density samplings as well as high accuracies making them more suitable for inland water bodies baghdadi et al 2011 phan et al 2012 to date three spaceborne laser altimeters have been built the geoscience laser altimeter system glas onboard the ice cloud and land elevation satellite 1 icesat 1 mission launched by nasa in january 2003 schutz et al 2005 the advanced topographic laser altimeter system atlas on the follow up icesat 2 mission by nasa launched in 2018 neuenschwander et al 2020 and the global ecosystem dynamics investigation gedi lidar by nasa to fly on the international space station iss in 2019 dubayah et al 2020 although these altimeters were primarily designed for glacier sea ice and vegetation structure observation they showed potentials in inland water level measurement phan et al 2012 yuan et al 2020 fayad et al 2020 due to different data acquisition technologies and processing algorithms the laser altimetry derived elevation products may contain varying amounts of errors it is necessary to validate these products against gauged data to characterize the errors before they are employed for water level measurement much research has been conducted to assess the accuracy of icesat 1 over different inland waters around the world for example abdallah et al 2011 assessed the accuracy of icesat 1 data over the great lakes in north america and found it had an overall bias of 4 6 cm underestimation and a standard deviation of 11 6 cm at the great lakes scale zhang et al 2011 compared icesat 1 altimetry data with the gauged measurements in lake qinghai china and found a strong correlation between the two datasets r2 0 90 rmse 0 08 m baghdadi et al 2011 applied icesat 1 data to french rivers and found the rmse of water level measurements was 1 14 m for small rivers and better than 0 15 m for rivers wider than 1 5 km jarihani et al 2013 validated multiple satellite altimetry data with in situ gauged data on lake argyle and found icesat 1 provided the most accurate lake water surface elevation measurements rmse 0 04 m ye et al 2017 validated the icesat 1 glas data against in situ gauged data over the bosten lake and showed good agreement between the gauged and glas data r2 0 99 rmse 0 173 m xu et al 2020 compared icesat 1 data with the in situ measured data over six lakes in north america the results showed an overall rmse of 14 75 cm using an out buffer of 210 m to date the validation of icesat 2 and gedi over inland waters is very limited as there were less than 2 years of icesat 2 data and 1 year of gedi data at the time of writing zhang et al 2019 utilized the icesat 2 data to monitor tibetan plateau lakes level change and found that the observations were strongly correlated with gauged measurements for lake qinghai r2 0 95 rmse 0 10 m yuan et al 2020 accessed the performance of icesat 2 altimetry data over the lakes and reservoirs with areas greater than 10 km2 in china and found icesat 2 data provided the highest accuracy among the three altimeters in terms of the relative altimetric error 0 06 m and standard deviation of along track heights 0 02 m fayad et al 2020 validated the gedi data in the eight lakes in switzerland and found the bias ranged from 0 14 to 0 10 m with a standard deviation from 0 15 to 0 32 m these mentioned studies have shown that the accuracy of icesat 1 was generally well known over inland waters however the performance of newly launched icesat 2 and gedi was still poorly understood in addition very few studies have compared the performance of three spaceborne missions which was essential for preserving the continuity of altimetry data over inland waters and for providing the opportunity to extract additional data products through the combination of measurements therefore the overall objective of this work was to assess and compare the performance of inland water level measurements derived from the three spaceborne laser altimetry platforms the specific objectives of this study are to 1 validate the three laser altimetry measurements over inland waters against the gauged water levels 2 compare the performance of three laser altimetry data over inland waters 3 analysis various factors that influence the accuracy of laser altimetry and explore the potential for monitoring inland water dynamics 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the great lakes and the lower mississippi river were used for the validation study fig 1 the former is a series of interconnected freshwater lakes in east central north america and canada spanning over 1200 km from west to east they were selected because they are the largest inland water body on earth with sufficient ground orbit coverage of the laser altimetry in addition the great lakes have from 1 to 4 cm tides but no prevalent ocean tides or high waves making it an excellent site for validation studies morris and gill 1994 furthermore a dense network of hydrological stations was deployed to record the water level providing sufficient in situ data for the evaluation the river segment considered in this study was the 400 km length lower mississippi river located between baton rouge and west pointe a la hache the river was selected because it has a dense network of in situ gauging stations in addition the widths of studied reach vary between 0 5 and 1 4 km making the assessment results transferable in many other rivers of the world 2 2 data the datasets from the three spaceborne laser altimetry missions were validated against the in situ gauged data from the hydrological stations the main characteristics and technical details of these missions were summarized in table 1 and the used gauging stations were listed in table a1 the detailed description of the datasets was provided in the following section 2 2 1 laser altimetry data icesat 1 the glas onboard the icesat 1 is the first spaceborne laser altimeter which measures the two way travel time of a pulse that is reflected by the ground at a frequency of 40 hz with two channels 532 nm and 1064 nm zwally et al 2002 the 1064 nm channel was used to measure elevation in land ice sheet sea ice and ocean abshire et al 2005 glas produces a series of approximately 70 m diameter footprints that are separated by nearly 170 m intervals along the track and 15 km across the track at the equator and 2 6 km at 80 latitude schutz et al 2005 a total of fifteen types of glas data product was produced for scientific uses and the gla14 the global land surface altimetry data product was used to obtain the inland water footprint elevations in this work the gla14 data were referenced to the topex poseidon ellipsoid containing 95 different parameters in a record of different situations in this work the data acquired from february 2003 to october 2009 were used for the validation which were downloaded from the national snow and ice data center nsidc website icesat 2 the atlas onboard icesat 2 is the 2nd generation of icesat 1 rather than using an analog full waveform system icesat 2 employed a photon counting lidar with detection sensitivities at the photon level the travel time of each detected photon is used to determine a range to the surface which when combined with satellite attitude and pointing information can be geolocated into a unique xyz location on or near the earth s surface the instrument transmits green 532 nm laser pulses at 10 khz 250 times of the icesat 1 facilitating improved along track spatial resolutions the outgoing single laser beam is split into three pairs of beams spaced approximately 3 3 km apart with a 90 m distance within the pairs each consisting of one high energy beam and one low energy beam 4 1 ratio neuenschwander et al 2020 each pulse is split by a diffractive optical element into three pairs of beams numbered by its laser spot number and orientation the relative position of the strong and weak beam depends on the orientation of the icesat 2 observatory zhang et al 2019 the laser generates overlapping footprints on the earth s surface with a diameter of 17 m spaced at 0 7 m in the ground track allowing a denser spatial sampling than its predecessor icesat 1 particularly in the along track direction neuenschwander and magruder 2019 icesat 2 mission produced geophysical products over various surface types such as land ice atl06 sea ice atl07 land vegetation atl08 atmosphere atl09 oceans atl12 and inland water atl03 atl13 in this work the atl13 version 003 was adopted which was segmented with a minimum length of 100 signal photons averaging about 100 m to monitor lakes and rivers the atl13 data from october 2018 to may 2020 were downloaded from the nsidc website which were provided in a wgs84 ellipsoidal vertical datum gedi the gedi is a full waveform lidar instrument that provides high quality measurements of the 3d structure of the earth s forests and topography between 52 n and 52 s the instrument is a geodetic class light detection and ranging lidar laser system that operates at 1064 nm and illuminates a 25 m spot a footprint on the surface the gedi is comprised of 3 lasers producing a total of 8 parallel tracks of observations each footprint is separated by 60 m along track with an across track distance of about 600 m between each of the 8 tracks the gedi expected to operate for a nominal 2 year minimum period producing 10 billion cloud free land surface observations duncanson et al 2020 although gedi is designed to advance our understanding of important carbon and water cycling processes biodiversity and habitat the precise height measurements are also of immense value for weather prediction forest management glacier and surface water monitoring and the generation of more accurate digital elevation models dubayah et al 2020 the gedi provides four level products including footprint and gridded data sets in this work the l2b data product canopy cover and vertical profile metrics acquired from march to september 2019 was used the geolocation longitude and latitude elevation elev lowestmode and acquisition time were extracted from the data product which were provided in a wgs84 ellipsoidal vertical datum 2 2 2 in situ data the in situ data were used to validate the laser altimetry derived water level measurements for the great lakes the gauged water levels at 15 selected hydrological stations were collected during 2003 2020 fig 1a the stations monitor lake water levels at 6 min intervals with reference to the international great lakes datum of 1985 igld85 the data can be downloaded from noaa website daily river levels gauged at 7 stations along the lower mississippi river were collected from 2003 to 2020 fig 1b the data were referenced to the north american vertical datum of 1988 navd88 and were available from the website of us army corps of engineers the detailed information of in situ data from 22 gauging stations was listed in table a1 3 methods 3 1 data preprocessing the laser altimetry data were preprocessed to obtain water level measurements including extraction of inland water level observations elimination of obvious anomalies and conversion of vertical reference systems the water mask was used to select the correct tracks and valid footprints falling on inland waters water masks of the study area were generated from dry season mndwi modified normalized water index images considering the 100 m segment of atl13 product an inward buffer of 100 m was applied to the water masks excluding retrievals within 100 m of the lake river shoreline in order to obtain observations that were less influenced by spatial variations of lake river level an additional selection criterion was applied for the great lakes the observations within a radius of 30 km from an available gauge station were selected the radius of 30 km was determined after comparison of three radiuses 20 30 and 50 km and it was found this radius can guarantee both sufficient altimetry observations and small fluctuations of the lake surface for the river segment the observations within 5 20 km of the gauge station were collected depending on the availability of satellite tracks the altimetry measurements were then subject to the elimination of obvious anomalies for icesat 1 gla14 the potential elevation anomalies resulting from cloud reflections and atmospheric noise during the time of data acquisition were removed using a quality control analysis based on four flags provided by nsdic li and zhao 2018 the saturation elevation correction was then applied to all available points for each icesat 1 pass over the study area for icesat 2 atl13 no processing was conducted in this step for the gedi level 2b four flags provided by goddard space flight center gsfc were used to remove erroneous and low quality data including algorithmrun flag stale return flag surface flag and sensitivity the value ranges of these flags can be referred to hofton and blair 2019 the elevation measurements were converted to a common vertical reference system the navd88 for icesat 1 the vertical datum was firstly converted from the topex ellipsoid htopex to wgs84 ellipsoid hwgs84 by hwgs84 htopex 0 707 m baghdadi et al 2011 the wgs84 ellipsoidal datum was then transformed to navd88 orthometric datum using the latest geoid height model geoid18 the relative accuracy of geoid18 to navd88 was characterized by an estimated uncertainty of 1 27 cm nationwide ngs 2020 the vertical reference of measurements in the great lakes was converted from igld85 to navd88 the difference between igld85 and navd88 heights was known as a hydraulic corrector which were included in datum transformation applications the vertical conversions from wgs84 to navd88 and from igld85 to navd88 were performed using the datum transformation tool vdatum noaa 2020 3 2 outlier removal satellite altimetry observations were still noisy even after preprocessing so it was necessary to denoise measurements to obtain accurate observations in this work a tailored outlier removal procedure proposed by li et al 2020 was adopted which was based on the works of phan et al 2012 and kleinherenbrink et al 2014 the procedures were given as follows the first step was the estimation of the mode the elevation bin where most measurements belong to the step size was set to be 1 and 2 m for the lake and river respectively these values were large enough to address the water surface slopes associated with various causes observations outside the one two meter range from the mode were considered as outliers and discarded in the second step the mean water level was calculated based on the remaining observations and the root mean square rms of residuals between the observations and the mean water level was estimated those observations were considered as outliers if the absolute differences between the observations and the mean water level were greater than 3 rms in the third step the removal process was continued by repeating the second step using the remaining observations it will stop if the number of remaining observations in a track was less than a certain number i e 5 10 3 for gedi icesat 2 and icesat 1 respectively by considering differences in along track sampling space and channel width 3 3 validation and analysis altimetry satellite water level measurements were validated against the gauged data as the satellite track did not correspond to the exact location of a gauge station the linear interpolation technique was used to derive river water levels along the river centerline the technique was employed by assuming the river slope changed uniformly as the study segment was located at the relatively flat reach of mississippi river the interpolated river water levels were used to validate the altimetry derived measurements which were obtained by averaging the satellite observations within a track for the lakes the gauged water level was directly used to validate the altimetry derived measurement the average of all satellite observations within 30 km of a gauge station four statistical metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the altimeter measurements including pearson s correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean difference md or bias and standard deviation sd these metrics were selected as the most appropriate statistic parameters that have been used in similar studies crétaux and birkett 2006 li et al 2020 to examine the influence of beam strength and acquisition time on the accuracy of water level measurements the errors of satellite observations under different conditions were analyzed in addition the mean absolute error was computed for the observations within various river widths to investigate the impact of river size on the accuracy of measurements 4 results 4 1 accuracy across the great lakes table 2 summarized the accuracy statistical metrics at the station lake and the great lakes scales fig a1 showed the comparison between the altimetry measurements and in situ data over different stations of the great lakes at the station scale the measurements of laser altimeters followed the in situ data fairly well with most r 0 90 fig a1 the accuracy of altimetry measurements varied among the great lakes lake and station scales as well as altimeters at the great lakes scale the rmse of icesat 1 icesat 2 and gedi measurements were 0 10 0 06 and 0 28 m respectively the rmse values ranged from 0 07 to 0 15 m for icesat 1 0 05 to 0 08 m for icesat 2 and 0 24 to 0 31 m for gedi at the lake scale and from 0 05 to 0 22 m from 0 04 to 0 14 m and from 0 16 to 0 36 m at the station scale in other words the accuracy of icesat 2 measurement was the highest at all scales followed by icesat 1 and then by gedi the bias values md at the great lakes scale were 0 04 0 01 and 0 10 m for icesat 1 icesat 2 and gedi respectively suggesting an underestimation of water levels by all the altimeters the corresponding bias values md of the three altimeters ranged from 0 11 to 0 m 0 05 to 0 m and 0 23 to 0 05 m at the lake scale and from 0 20 to 0 02 m 0 13 to 0 05 m and 0 32 to 0 11 m at the station scale the sd of the altimeters varied among stations lakes and the great lakes which was consistent with the results explained by the rmse indicator the rmse found on the michigan lake was the highest for icesat 1 and icesat 2 reaching up to 0 15 and 0 08 m respectively while it was the superior lake for gedi with the rmse of 0 31 m overall the laser altimetry provided unprecedented accuracies over the lakes and icesat 2 captured a more accurate lake water level than icesat 1 and gedi owing to its small footprint dense sampling and multi beams characteristics 4 2 accuracy over the lower mississippi river table 3 summarized the results of accuracy statistics over the lower mississippi river fig a2 showed the comparision of altimetry satellite data and the gauge records over the lower mississippi river the satellite observations closely followed the in situ data at each of the stations with r 0 95 fig a2 at the river scale the rmse of icesat 1 icesat 2 and gedi measurements were 0 25 0 12 and 0 40 m respectively the corresponding rmse values ranged from 0 11 to 0 36 m 0 07 to 0 21 m and 0 22 to 0 74 m at the station scale the mds of icesat 1 icesat 2 and gedi measurements at the river scale were 0 18 0 08 and 0 24 m respectively in other words all the three altimeters were underestimating the water elevation on average the md values ranged from 0 28 to 0 06 m 0 20 to 0 02 m and 0 63 to 0 15 m at the station scale the sd varied among both stations and altimeters which was consistent with the results explained by the rmse indicator in general the icesat 2 measurements had the best performance compared to the icesat 1 and gedi in the river 4 3 performance comparison fig 2 showed the comparison of accuracies of three altimeters over the lakes and the river the rmse between three altimetry measurements and in situ water levels was calculated for the great lakes and lower mississippi river based on all the observations of this study it was found that all the altimeters perform better over the lakes than that of the river the mean rmse of icesat 1 icesat 2 and gedi over the great lakes were 9 7 5 8 and 28 1 cm while those for the mississippi river were 24 8 11 7 and 39 8 cm with an accuracy improvement of 15 1 5 9 and 11 7 cm respectively this was perhaps due to the enhanced surface roughness resulting from flow induced turbulences in rivers that was absent in lakes moreover the interpolation of river water levels may introduce additional errors fig 3 a illustrated the performance comparison of strong beams and weak beams of icesat 2 for the lakes and the river for the lakes the rmse of strong beam measurements was 5 8 cm while that of weak beam was 6 5 cm an accuracy increase of 0 7 cm rmse 10 8 was observed for the river the rmse values of strong and weak beam measurements were 11 7 and 12 2 cm respectively the accuracy was improved by 0 5 cm 4 1 in terms of rmse in general the statistical indicators showed that the measurements from the strong beam performed slightly better than those from the weak beam for both the lakes and river fig 3b showed the performance comparison of the two lasers of gedi for the lakes and the river gedi s power beam measurements yielded a higher accuracy in comparison to the coverage beams the mean rmse of water level measurements from power and coverage beam were 27 8 and 31 4 cm for the lakes and 38 4 and 49 9 cm for the river the accuracy in terms of rmse was improved by 3 6 11 5 and 11 5 cm 23 0 for the lake and river respectively therefore it was recommended that the power beam should be used for water level measurement fig 3c displayed the accuracy comparison of altimetry measurements between day night acquisitions over the great lakes it was found that on average the night acquisitions were slightly more accurate than the day acquisitions for all the three altimeters to be specific the icesat 1 had the greatest differences between day and night measurements with average rmse of 11 1 and 7 8 cm respectively followed by gedi which were 28 3 and 26 9 cm whereas the icesat 2 exhibited the smallest surface water level discrepancies with rmse of 6 4 and 5 6 cm respectively fig 4 showed the correlation between the accuracy of altimetry measurements and the width of river for icesat 1 the accuracy mean absolute error reduced slightly with the increase of river width based on 46 observations while for icesat 2 and gedi the accuracy of observations increased slightly with the increase of river width however for all the altimeters poor relationship was observed between altimetry measurement accuracy and river width with r ranging from 0 351 to 0 265 from r values it seemed that the accuracy of icesat 2 was least affected by the river width followed by gedi and then by icesat 1 this corresponded well to the footprint sizes of the three altimeters therefore it may suggest that the smaller the footprints the less influenced of accuracy by the river width in general the mean absolute error varied within about 30 cm as the river width changed from 500 to 1200 m hence our results indicated there was no clear dependence of the performance on the river width 5 discussion this was the first evaluation and comparison of the performance of icesat 1 and two new missions icesat 2 and gedi over inland water bodies our encouraging results suggested that the laser altimeters were able to measure inland water levels at unprecedented accuracies with high spatial temporal resolutions in this discussion we compared the obtained results with previous studies analyzed various factors influencing the accuracies of these missions and explored the potential for monitoring inland water level dynamics 5 1 water level measurement accuracy the obtained inland water level measurement accuracies were compared with previous studies the assessment results of icesat 1 indicated an rmse of 9 7 cm a bias of 3 9 7 9 cm underestimation at the great lakes scale table 1 the accuracy was consistent with previous studies for example abdallah et al 2011 showed a bias of 4 6 11 6 cm underestimation of icesat 1 at the great lakes scale zhang et al 2011 found the rmse of icesat 1 was 0 08 m in qinghai lake china the slight discrepancy was likely due to the selection of altimetry data and different lakes in the work of abdallah et al 2011 the tracks across the entire lake were used for validation while only the observations within 30 km of a gauge station were employed in this work thus reducing the effects of water level fluctuations and lake slopes for the mississippi river the results from icesat 1 indicated a rmse of 24 8 cm a bias of 17 7 16 2 cm underestimation table 2 the obtained accuracy was in line with previous results on rivers for example urban et al 2008 found that the accuracy of icesat 1 measurements in the lower reaches of the tapajos river amazon basin was between 0 03 and 0 25 m hall et al 2012 reported an absolute vertical height error of 19 cm between icesat 1 elevation and gauge data for the mississippi river the slight differences were likely due to the different hydraulic slopes of rivers as well as data processing procedures such as outlier filtering and river water level interpolation the assessment results of icesat 2 indicated an rmse of 6 0 cm a bias of 1 0 5 0 cm underestimation at the great lakes scale table 1 the validation of icesat 2 over inland water bodies was very limited due to its recent release yuan et al 2020 evaluated icesat 2 laser altimetry data over 30 reservoirs in china however the in situ data were referenced to different vertical datum leading to the variation in the biases from 1 61 to 2 12 m therefore this work provided the first robust evaluation of icesat 2 over inland waters the validation of gedi was scarce for inland water bodies as well our results of gedi rmse 28 cm biases 10 23 cm for the great lakes were consistent with those in fayad et al 2020 who found the bias between gedi elevations and in situ data ranged from 13 8 to 9 8 cm with a standard deviation from 14 5 to 31 6 cm for the eight studied lakes in switzerland in addition we validated icesat 2 and gedi in the mississippi river however the comparison with previous studies was not possible because no validations of the two missions over rivers have been reported hence this work provided the baseline performance of icesat 2 and gedi in rivers 5 2 impact of accuracy the intensity of laser could affect the accuracy of measurement we found that the strong beams of icesat 2 performed better than the weak beams by 0 7 10 8 and 0 5 cm 4 1 for the lake and river respectively fig 3a a possible reason was that the signal photon density from the strong beams was significantly higher than that of the weak making water level measurement using the weak beam more difficult for icesat 2 the energy ratio between the strong and weak beams was approximately 4 1 and the near surface interaction phenomenon of photons emanating from the strong and weak beams may influence this difference the findings were consistent with dandabathula and rao 2020 who found the strong beams were 14 7 better than the weak beams when validating icesat 2 atl13 data against near real time gauged data over 15 reservoirs across the indian sub continent for ground measurement xing et al 2020 found that the accuracy of the strong beams was 2 6 higher than that of the weak in retrieving ground topography of forested terrain similarly the accuracy of full power beams of gedi was 11 5 3 6 cm higher than that of the covered beams in lakes and this proportion increased to 23 0 11 5 cm in the river fig 3b our finding was consistent with that of fayad et al 2020 who found that the accuracy of full power beams of gedi was 24 0 better than that of the coverage beams in lakes the acquisition time of observations may influence the measurement accuracy as well our results suggested that the nighttime acquisitions were slightly more accurate than daytime acquisitions for all the three altimeters fig 3c it was likely due to the noises caused by the solar background and atmospheric scattering this was especially the case for icesat 2 which was based on the photon counting technology the detector of this lidar system was sensitive at the single photon level which can be triggered by any returned photons whether from the reflected signal or from the solar background similar results were also reported by neuenschwander et al 2020 who found that for no snow conditions the ground elevation was more accurately measured by nighttime acquisitions therefore it was recommended that end users interested in inland water level retrievals should avoid the use of weak beam data acquired during the daytime the river size and morphology were also likely to impact the accuracy it was generally acknowledged that satellite altimetry performed better over large rivers papa et al 2012 for example zakharova et al 2020 found that the accuracy of the water level estimates from envisat environment satellite varied from 0 63 m for the ob river 2 km in width to 1 1 m for the pur river 0 5 km in width however our results did not show a clear dependence of altimetry performance on the river width fig 4 most likely due to the relatively small footprint and high along track resolution in relation to the width of river 5 3 implications for monitoring inland water level dynamics in addition to accuracy the spatial temporal resolution of the satellite altimetry mission was critical for inland water level monitoring the spatial resolution decided the size of water body that can be measured the satellite radar altimetry was initially designed to measure the sea level variations often having a footprint with a diameter of several kilometers crétaux et al 2015 for applications in inland waters it was suggested that the water body should be wider than 1000 m to be optimally retrieved by radar altimeters lettenmaier et al 2015 although recent studies have demonstrated the successful retrieval of water levels of small rivers 200 m width kuo and kao 2011 michailovsky et al 2012 sulistioadi et al 2015 biancamaria et al 2017 the processing of satellite radar observations for small water bodies remained challenging and the accuracy was poor i e rmse 0 27 to 1 07 m michailovsky et al 2012 in comparison laser altimetry has much higher spatial resolution sampling than radar altimetry this made it more suitable for observing rivers as the small footprint was less likely contaminated by the surrounding land and vegetation for example icesat 1 has been used to measure rivers with a few hundred meters wide baghdadi et al 2011 although we did not apply the laser altimetry to small rivers our results indicated that the measurement accuracy did not fully depend on the width of mississippi river fig 4 therefore it was expected that the icesat 2 and gedi can measure even smaller rivers given their smaller footprints and denser samplings the minimum width of river to be accurately measured will be examined in the next step the temporal resolution determined how often a specific inland water body can be measured a higher resolution allowed a more frequent measurement providing detailed information of water level variations liu et al 2017 investigated the potential of icesat 1 for monitoring water surface dynamics and found it can capture 60 of the variations in water level dynamics for at most 34 of the us lakes the limited temporal sampling was identified as a major factor limiting the use for water dynamics studies to compare temporal resolutions of the three altimeters the number of observations within the 30 km radius of a station was used to estimate the annual observation frequency aof for the great lakes table 4 it was found that gedi had the highest frequency with 14 80 observations per year followed by icesat 2 10 43 which were about five and four times that of icesat 1 2 45 it was noted that the aof was estimated based on the observations within 30 km radius of a station therefore much more observations and hence larger aof values could be anticipated for the great lakes indicating a bright prospect in frequent measurement of inland waters even with higher temporal resolutions icesat 2 and gedi were still not likely to fulfill some applications requiring water levels at short intervals i e daily to cope with the temporal gap the integration of multi mission altimetry was introduced and found to significantly improve the spatial temporal resolution tourian et al 2016 li et al 2020 as icesat 2 and gedi are operating simultaneously the combination of the two missions will provide temporally denser observations allowing to capture detailed cycles of water level variations overall this study demonstrated that spaceborne laser altimetry has great potentials for frequent and accurate monitoring of inland waters especially with the combination of icesat 2 and gedi missions 6 conclusion spaceborne laser altimetry has been recently used to monitor inland water level variations this study aimed to validate and compare the water level measurements derived from the newly launched laser altimeters and provide insights for monitoring inland water dynamics water level retrievals from icesat 2 and gedi as well as icesat 1 were validated against in situ data from 22 gauging stations at various scales in the great lakes and lower mississippi river the performances of three laser altimeters were compared the factors affecting the accuracy were analyzed and the potentials for monitoring inland water dynamics were explored the results showed that icesat 2 provided the unprecedented accuracy of inland water level measurement in both the great lakes and lower mississippi river followed by icesat 1 and then by gedi all the altimeters performed better over lakes than the river the analysis suggested that for all the three laser altimeters the strong beam achieved higher water level accuracies than those of the weak as the measurement using the weak beam was more difficult the nighttime acquisitions were slightly more accurate than those of the daytime due to less affected by the solar background noise and atmospheric scattering however our result indicated no clear dependence of measurement accuracy on the river width likely due to the small footprint and high along track resolution in relation to the width of river therefore we recommended that end users interested in inland water level retrievals should employ the strong beam data acquired in the nighttime this study also highlighted the great potential of satellite laser altimetry for monitoring inland water dynamics particularly with the combination of operational icesat 2 and gedi platforms as such spaceborne laser altimetry may help advance our understanding of hydrological processes and related issues of water resource and ecosystem health especially in remote data scarce regions of the world credit authorship contribution statement jin xiang methodology software

4644,satellite laser altimetry offers an opportunity to accurately measure inland water levels over the earth s surface this paper described the validation and comparison of three spaceborne missions for inland water level retrievals including the geoscience laser altimeter system glas onboard the ice cloud and land elevation satellite 1 icesat 1 as well as the newly launched advanced topographic laser altimeter system atlas onboard icesat 2 and the global ecosystem dynamics investigation gedi lidar on the international space station this study was conducted over the great lakes and lower mississippi river using in situ data from 22 gauging stations where the potential for monitoring inland water dynamics was explored the results showed that icesat 2 provided lake water level retrievals with an unprecedented accuracy rmse 0 06 m biases 0 01 0 05 m followed by icesat 1 rmse 0 10 m biases 0 04 0 10 m and then by gedi rmse 0 28 m biases 0 10 0 23 m icesat 2 also offered more accurate river water level measurements rmse 0 12 m biases 0 08 0 07 m than those of icesat 1 rmse 0 25 m biases 0 18 0 16 m and gedi rmse 0 40 m biases 0 24 0 24 m the analysis suggested that for all the altimeters the strong beam achieved higher water level accuracies than those of the weak and the nighttime acquisitions were slightly more accurate than those of the daytime however our result indicated no considerable differences between measurement accuracy and river width furthermore the analysis demonstrated their great potential in monitoring inland water dynamics especially with the combination of icesat 2 and gedi platforms this study provided a comprehensive understanding of measurement accuracies of three recent missions and recommended that end users should employ the strong beam data acquired during the nighttime for accurate water level retrievals keywords spaceborne laser altimetry icesat 2 gedi inland water level validation 1 introduction inland water plays an important role in various components of earth systems such as hydrological climatic and ecological processes pekel et al 2016 monitoring of water level variations is fundamental for the understanding of hydrological processes and for the management of water resources as well as balance of ecosystems ma et al 2020 water level has been traditionally measured in situ at selected locations with gauging stations however the deployment of spatially representative stations is insufficient on the global scale due to the cost of installation and maintenance hannah et al 2011 as well as accessibility and political issues hossain et al 2014 meanwhile the availability of global in situ stations has been decreasing in the past decades lawford et al 2013 in this context the development of new techniques for the global monitoring of water levels through satellite observations is highly desired recent satellite altimetry offers an opportunity to monitor worldwide inland water level changes there are two types of satellite altimeters the radar and the laser altimeter compared to radar altimeters laser altimeters are characterized by small footprints and high density samplings as well as high accuracies making them more suitable for inland water bodies baghdadi et al 2011 phan et al 2012 to date three spaceborne laser altimeters have been built the geoscience laser altimeter system glas onboard the ice cloud and land elevation satellite 1 icesat 1 mission launched by nasa in january 2003 schutz et al 2005 the advanced topographic laser altimeter system atlas on the follow up icesat 2 mission by nasa launched in 2018 neuenschwander et al 2020 and the global ecosystem dynamics investigation gedi lidar by nasa to fly on the international space station iss in 2019 dubayah et al 2020 although these altimeters were primarily designed for glacier sea ice and vegetation structure observation they showed potentials in inland water level measurement phan et al 2012 yuan et al 2020 fayad et al 2020 due to different data acquisition technologies and processing algorithms the laser altimetry derived elevation products may contain varying amounts of errors it is necessary to validate these products against gauged data to characterize the errors before they are employed for water level measurement much research has been conducted to assess the accuracy of icesat 1 over different inland waters around the world for example abdallah et al 2011 assessed the accuracy of icesat 1 data over the great lakes in north america and found it had an overall bias of 4 6 cm underestimation and a standard deviation of 11 6 cm at the great lakes scale zhang et al 2011 compared icesat 1 altimetry data with the gauged measurements in lake qinghai china and found a strong correlation between the two datasets r2 0 90 rmse 0 08 m baghdadi et al 2011 applied icesat 1 data to french rivers and found the rmse of water level measurements was 1 14 m for small rivers and better than 0 15 m for rivers wider than 1 5 km jarihani et al 2013 validated multiple satellite altimetry data with in situ gauged data on lake argyle and found icesat 1 provided the most accurate lake water surface elevation measurements rmse 0 04 m ye et al 2017 validated the icesat 1 glas data against in situ gauged data over the bosten lake and showed good agreement between the gauged and glas data r2 0 99 rmse 0 173 m xu et al 2020 compared icesat 1 data with the in situ measured data over six lakes in north america the results showed an overall rmse of 14 75 cm using an out buffer of 210 m to date the validation of icesat 2 and gedi over inland waters is very limited as there were less than 2 years of icesat 2 data and 1 year of gedi data at the time of writing zhang et al 2019 utilized the icesat 2 data to monitor tibetan plateau lakes level change and found that the observations were strongly correlated with gauged measurements for lake qinghai r2 0 95 rmse 0 10 m yuan et al 2020 accessed the performance of icesat 2 altimetry data over the lakes and reservoirs with areas greater than 10 km2 in china and found icesat 2 data provided the highest accuracy among the three altimeters in terms of the relative altimetric error 0 06 m and standard deviation of along track heights 0 02 m fayad et al 2020 validated the gedi data in the eight lakes in switzerland and found the bias ranged from 0 14 to 0 10 m with a standard deviation from 0 15 to 0 32 m these mentioned studies have shown that the accuracy of icesat 1 was generally well known over inland waters however the performance of newly launched icesat 2 and gedi was still poorly understood in addition very few studies have compared the performance of three spaceborne missions which was essential for preserving the continuity of altimetry data over inland waters and for providing the opportunity to extract additional data products through the combination of measurements therefore the overall objective of this work was to assess and compare the performance of inland water level measurements derived from the three spaceborne laser altimetry platforms the specific objectives of this study are to 1 validate the three laser altimetry measurements over inland waters against the gauged water levels 2 compare the performance of three laser altimetry data over inland waters 3 analysis various factors that influence the accuracy of laser altimetry and explore the potential for monitoring inland water dynamics 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the great lakes and the lower mississippi river were used for the validation study fig 1 the former is a series of interconnected freshwater lakes in east central north america and canada spanning over 1200 km from west to east they were selected because they are the largest inland water body on earth with sufficient ground orbit coverage of the laser altimetry in addition the great lakes have from 1 to 4 cm tides but no prevalent ocean tides or high waves making it an excellent site for validation studies morris and gill 1994 furthermore a dense network of hydrological stations was deployed to record the water level providing sufficient in situ data for the evaluation the river segment considered in this study was the 400 km length lower mississippi river located between baton rouge and west pointe a la hache the river was selected because it has a dense network of in situ gauging stations in addition the widths of studied reach vary between 0 5 and 1 4 km making the assessment results transferable in many other rivers of the world 2 2 data the datasets from the three spaceborne laser altimetry missions were validated against the in situ gauged data from the hydrological stations the main characteristics and technical details of these missions were summarized in table 1 and the used gauging stations were listed in table a1 the detailed description of the datasets was provided in the following section 2 2 1 laser altimetry data icesat 1 the glas onboard the icesat 1 is the first spaceborne laser altimeter which measures the two way travel time of a pulse that is reflected by the ground at a frequency of 40 hz with two channels 532 nm and 1064 nm zwally et al 2002 the 1064 nm channel was used to measure elevation in land ice sheet sea ice and ocean abshire et al 2005 glas produces a series of approximately 70 m diameter footprints that are separated by nearly 170 m intervals along the track and 15 km across the track at the equator and 2 6 km at 80 latitude schutz et al 2005 a total of fifteen types of glas data product was produced for scientific uses and the gla14 the global land surface altimetry data product was used to obtain the inland water footprint elevations in this work the gla14 data were referenced to the topex poseidon ellipsoid containing 95 different parameters in a record of different situations in this work the data acquired from february 2003 to october 2009 were used for the validation which were downloaded from the national snow and ice data center nsidc website icesat 2 the atlas onboard icesat 2 is the 2nd generation of icesat 1 rather than using an analog full waveform system icesat 2 employed a photon counting lidar with detection sensitivities at the photon level the travel time of each detected photon is used to determine a range to the surface which when combined with satellite attitude and pointing information can be geolocated into a unique xyz location on or near the earth s surface the instrument transmits green 532 nm laser pulses at 10 khz 250 times of the icesat 1 facilitating improved along track spatial resolutions the outgoing single laser beam is split into three pairs of beams spaced approximately 3 3 km apart with a 90 m distance within the pairs each consisting of one high energy beam and one low energy beam 4 1 ratio neuenschwander et al 2020 each pulse is split by a diffractive optical element into three pairs of beams numbered by its laser spot number and orientation the relative position of the strong and weak beam depends on the orientation of the icesat 2 observatory zhang et al 2019 the laser generates overlapping footprints on the earth s surface with a diameter of 17 m spaced at 0 7 m in the ground track allowing a denser spatial sampling than its predecessor icesat 1 particularly in the along track direction neuenschwander and magruder 2019 icesat 2 mission produced geophysical products over various surface types such as land ice atl06 sea ice atl07 land vegetation atl08 atmosphere atl09 oceans atl12 and inland water atl03 atl13 in this work the atl13 version 003 was adopted which was segmented with a minimum length of 100 signal photons averaging about 100 m to monitor lakes and rivers the atl13 data from october 2018 to may 2020 were downloaded from the nsidc website which were provided in a wgs84 ellipsoidal vertical datum gedi the gedi is a full waveform lidar instrument that provides high quality measurements of the 3d structure of the earth s forests and topography between 52 n and 52 s the instrument is a geodetic class light detection and ranging lidar laser system that operates at 1064 nm and illuminates a 25 m spot a footprint on the surface the gedi is comprised of 3 lasers producing a total of 8 parallel tracks of observations each footprint is separated by 60 m along track with an across track distance of about 600 m between each of the 8 tracks the gedi expected to operate for a nominal 2 year minimum period producing 10 billion cloud free land surface observations duncanson et al 2020 although gedi is designed to advance our understanding of important carbon and water cycling processes biodiversity and habitat the precise height measurements are also of immense value for weather prediction forest management glacier and surface water monitoring and the generation of more accurate digital elevation models dubayah et al 2020 the gedi provides four level products including footprint and gridded data sets in this work the l2b data product canopy cover and vertical profile metrics acquired from march to september 2019 was used the geolocation longitude and latitude elevation elev lowestmode and acquisition time were extracted from the data product which were provided in a wgs84 ellipsoidal vertical datum 2 2 2 in situ data the in situ data were used to validate the laser altimetry derived water level measurements for the great lakes the gauged water levels at 15 selected hydrological stations were collected during 2003 2020 fig 1a the stations monitor lake water levels at 6 min intervals with reference to the international great lakes datum of 1985 igld85 the data can be downloaded from noaa website daily river levels gauged at 7 stations along the lower mississippi river were collected from 2003 to 2020 fig 1b the data were referenced to the north american vertical datum of 1988 navd88 and were available from the website of us army corps of engineers the detailed information of in situ data from 22 gauging stations was listed in table a1 3 methods 3 1 data preprocessing the laser altimetry data were preprocessed to obtain water level measurements including extraction of inland water level observations elimination of obvious anomalies and conversion of vertical reference systems the water mask was used to select the correct tracks and valid footprints falling on inland waters water masks of the study area were generated from dry season mndwi modified normalized water index images considering the 100 m segment of atl13 product an inward buffer of 100 m was applied to the water masks excluding retrievals within 100 m of the lake river shoreline in order to obtain observations that were less influenced by spatial variations of lake river level an additional selection criterion was applied for the great lakes the observations within a radius of 30 km from an available gauge station were selected the radius of 30 km was determined after comparison of three radiuses 20 30 and 50 km and it was found this radius can guarantee both sufficient altimetry observations and small fluctuations of the lake surface for the river segment the observations within 5 20 km of the gauge station were collected depending on the availability of satellite tracks the altimetry measurements were then subject to the elimination of obvious anomalies for icesat 1 gla14 the potential elevation anomalies resulting from cloud reflections and atmospheric noise during the time of data acquisition were removed using a quality control analysis based on four flags provided by nsdic li and zhao 2018 the saturation elevation correction was then applied to all available points for each icesat 1 pass over the study area for icesat 2 atl13 no processing was conducted in this step for the gedi level 2b four flags provided by goddard space flight center gsfc were used to remove erroneous and low quality data including algorithmrun flag stale return flag surface flag and sensitivity the value ranges of these flags can be referred to hofton and blair 2019 the elevation measurements were converted to a common vertical reference system the navd88 for icesat 1 the vertical datum was firstly converted from the topex ellipsoid htopex to wgs84 ellipsoid hwgs84 by hwgs84 htopex 0 707 m baghdadi et al 2011 the wgs84 ellipsoidal datum was then transformed to navd88 orthometric datum using the latest geoid height model geoid18 the relative accuracy of geoid18 to navd88 was characterized by an estimated uncertainty of 1 27 cm nationwide ngs 2020 the vertical reference of measurements in the great lakes was converted from igld85 to navd88 the difference between igld85 and navd88 heights was known as a hydraulic corrector which were included in datum transformation applications the vertical conversions from wgs84 to navd88 and from igld85 to navd88 were performed using the datum transformation tool vdatum noaa 2020 3 2 outlier removal satellite altimetry observations were still noisy even after preprocessing so it was necessary to denoise measurements to obtain accurate observations in this work a tailored outlier removal procedure proposed by li et al 2020 was adopted which was based on the works of phan et al 2012 and kleinherenbrink et al 2014 the procedures were given as follows the first step was the estimation of the mode the elevation bin where most measurements belong to the step size was set to be 1 and 2 m for the lake and river respectively these values were large enough to address the water surface slopes associated with various causes observations outside the one two meter range from the mode were considered as outliers and discarded in the second step the mean water level was calculated based on the remaining observations and the root mean square rms of residuals between the observations and the mean water level was estimated those observations were considered as outliers if the absolute differences between the observations and the mean water level were greater than 3 rms in the third step the removal process was continued by repeating the second step using the remaining observations it will stop if the number of remaining observations in a track was less than a certain number i e 5 10 3 for gedi icesat 2 and icesat 1 respectively by considering differences in along track sampling space and channel width 3 3 validation and analysis altimetry satellite water level measurements were validated against the gauged data as the satellite track did not correspond to the exact location of a gauge station the linear interpolation technique was used to derive river water levels along the river centerline the technique was employed by assuming the river slope changed uniformly as the study segment was located at the relatively flat reach of mississippi river the interpolated river water levels were used to validate the altimetry derived measurements which were obtained by averaging the satellite observations within a track for the lakes the gauged water level was directly used to validate the altimetry derived measurement the average of all satellite observations within 30 km of a gauge station four statistical metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the altimeter measurements including pearson s correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean difference md or bias and standard deviation sd these metrics were selected as the most appropriate statistic parameters that have been used in similar studies crétaux and birkett 2006 li et al 2020 to examine the influence of beam strength and acquisition time on the accuracy of water level measurements the errors of satellite observations under different conditions were analyzed in addition the mean absolute error was computed for the observations within various river widths to investigate the impact of river size on the accuracy of measurements 4 results 4 1 accuracy across the great lakes table 2 summarized the accuracy statistical metrics at the station lake and the great lakes scales fig a1 showed the comparison between the altimetry measurements and in situ data over different stations of the great lakes at the station scale the measurements of laser altimeters followed the in situ data fairly well with most r 0 90 fig a1 the accuracy of altimetry measurements varied among the great lakes lake and station scales as well as altimeters at the great lakes scale the rmse of icesat 1 icesat 2 and gedi measurements were 0 10 0 06 and 0 28 m respectively the rmse values ranged from 0 07 to 0 15 m for icesat 1 0 05 to 0 08 m for icesat 2 and 0 24 to 0 31 m for gedi at the lake scale and from 0 05 to 0 22 m from 0 04 to 0 14 m and from 0 16 to 0 36 m at the station scale in other words the accuracy of icesat 2 measurement was the highest at all scales followed by icesat 1 and then by gedi the bias values md at the great lakes scale were 0 04 0 01 and 0 10 m for icesat 1 icesat 2 and gedi respectively suggesting an underestimation of water levels by all the altimeters the corresponding bias values md of the three altimeters ranged from 0 11 to 0 m 0 05 to 0 m and 0 23 to 0 05 m at the lake scale and from 0 20 to 0 02 m 0 13 to 0 05 m and 0 32 to 0 11 m at the station scale the sd of the altimeters varied among stations lakes and the great lakes which was consistent with the results explained by the rmse indicator the rmse found on the michigan lake was the highest for icesat 1 and icesat 2 reaching up to 0 15 and 0 08 m respectively while it was the superior lake for gedi with the rmse of 0 31 m overall the laser altimetry provided unprecedented accuracies over the lakes and icesat 2 captured a more accurate lake water level than icesat 1 and gedi owing to its small footprint dense sampling and multi beams characteristics 4 2 accuracy over the lower mississippi river table 3 summarized the results of accuracy statistics over the lower mississippi river fig a2 showed the comparision of altimetry satellite data and the gauge records over the lower mississippi river the satellite observations closely followed the in situ data at each of the stations with r 0 95 fig a2 at the river scale the rmse of icesat 1 icesat 2 and gedi measurements were 0 25 0 12 and 0 40 m respectively the corresponding rmse values ranged from 0 11 to 0 36 m 0 07 to 0 21 m and 0 22 to 0 74 m at the station scale the mds of icesat 1 icesat 2 and gedi measurements at the river scale were 0 18 0 08 and 0 24 m respectively in other words all the three altimeters were underestimating the water elevation on average the md values ranged from 0 28 to 0 06 m 0 20 to 0 02 m and 0 63 to 0 15 m at the station scale the sd varied among both stations and altimeters which was consistent with the results explained by the rmse indicator in general the icesat 2 measurements had the best performance compared to the icesat 1 and gedi in the river 4 3 performance comparison fig 2 showed the comparison of accuracies of three altimeters over the lakes and the river the rmse between three altimetry measurements and in situ water levels was calculated for the great lakes and lower mississippi river based on all the observations of this study it was found that all the altimeters perform better over the lakes than that of the river the mean rmse of icesat 1 icesat 2 and gedi over the great lakes were 9 7 5 8 and 28 1 cm while those for the mississippi river were 24 8 11 7 and 39 8 cm with an accuracy improvement of 15 1 5 9 and 11 7 cm respectively this was perhaps due to the enhanced surface roughness resulting from flow induced turbulences in rivers that was absent in lakes moreover the interpolation of river water levels may introduce additional errors fig 3 a illustrated the performance comparison of strong beams and weak beams of icesat 2 for the lakes and the river for the lakes the rmse of strong beam measurements was 5 8 cm while that of weak beam was 6 5 cm an accuracy increase of 0 7 cm rmse 10 8 was observed for the river the rmse values of strong and weak beam measurements were 11 7 and 12 2 cm respectively the accuracy was improved by 0 5 cm 4 1 in terms of rmse in general the statistical indicators showed that the measurements from the strong beam performed slightly better than those from the weak beam for both the lakes and river fig 3b showed the performance comparison of the two lasers of gedi for the lakes and the river gedi s power beam measurements yielded a higher accuracy in comparison to the coverage beams the mean rmse of water level measurements from power and coverage beam were 27 8 and 31 4 cm for the lakes and 38 4 and 49 9 cm for the river the accuracy in terms of rmse was improved by 3 6 11 5 and 11 5 cm 23 0 for the lake and river respectively therefore it was recommended that the power beam should be used for water level measurement fig 3c displayed the accuracy comparison of altimetry measurements between day night acquisitions over the great lakes it was found that on average the night acquisitions were slightly more accurate than the day acquisitions for all the three altimeters to be specific the icesat 1 had the greatest differences between day and night measurements with average rmse of 11 1 and 7 8 cm respectively followed by gedi which were 28 3 and 26 9 cm whereas the icesat 2 exhibited the smallest surface water level discrepancies with rmse of 6 4 and 5 6 cm respectively fig 4 showed the correlation between the accuracy of altimetry measurements and the width of river for icesat 1 the accuracy mean absolute error reduced slightly with the increase of river width based on 46 observations while for icesat 2 and gedi the accuracy of observations increased slightly with the increase of river width however for all the altimeters poor relationship was observed between altimetry measurement accuracy and river width with r ranging from 0 351 to 0 265 from r values it seemed that the accuracy of icesat 2 was least affected by the river width followed by gedi and then by icesat 1 this corresponded well to the footprint sizes of the three altimeters therefore it may suggest that the smaller the footprints the less influenced of accuracy by the river width in general the mean absolute error varied within about 30 cm as the river width changed from 500 to 1200 m hence our results indicated there was no clear dependence of the performance on the river width 5 discussion this was the first evaluation and comparison of the performance of icesat 1 and two new missions icesat 2 and gedi over inland water bodies our encouraging results suggested that the laser altimeters were able to measure inland water levels at unprecedented accuracies with high spatial temporal resolutions in this discussion we compared the obtained results with previous studies analyzed various factors influencing the accuracies of these missions and explored the potential for monitoring inland water level dynamics 5 1 water level measurement accuracy the obtained inland water level measurement accuracies were compared with previous studies the assessment results of icesat 1 indicated an rmse of 9 7 cm a bias of 3 9 7 9 cm underestimation at the great lakes scale table 1 the accuracy was consistent with previous studies for example abdallah et al 2011 showed a bias of 4 6 11 6 cm underestimation of icesat 1 at the great lakes scale zhang et al 2011 found the rmse of icesat 1 was 0 08 m in qinghai lake china the slight discrepancy was likely due to the selection of altimetry data and different lakes in the work of abdallah et al 2011 the tracks across the entire lake were used for validation while only the observations within 30 km of a gauge station were employed in this work thus reducing the effects of water level fluctuations and lake slopes for the mississippi river the results from icesat 1 indicated a rmse of 24 8 cm a bias of 17 7 16 2 cm underestimation table 2 the obtained accuracy was in line with previous results on rivers for example urban et al 2008 found that the accuracy of icesat 1 measurements in the lower reaches of the tapajos river amazon basin was between 0 03 and 0 25 m hall et al 2012 reported an absolute vertical height error of 19 cm between icesat 1 elevation and gauge data for the mississippi river the slight differences were likely due to the different hydraulic slopes of rivers as well as data processing procedures such as outlier filtering and river water level interpolation the assessment results of icesat 2 indicated an rmse of 6 0 cm a bias of 1 0 5 0 cm underestimation at the great lakes scale table 1 the validation of icesat 2 over inland water bodies was very limited due to its recent release yuan et al 2020 evaluated icesat 2 laser altimetry data over 30 reservoirs in china however the in situ data were referenced to different vertical datum leading to the variation in the biases from 1 61 to 2 12 m therefore this work provided the first robust evaluation of icesat 2 over inland waters the validation of gedi was scarce for inland water bodies as well our results of gedi rmse 28 cm biases 10 23 cm for the great lakes were consistent with those in fayad et al 2020 who found the bias between gedi elevations and in situ data ranged from 13 8 to 9 8 cm with a standard deviation from 14 5 to 31 6 cm for the eight studied lakes in switzerland in addition we validated icesat 2 and gedi in the mississippi river however the comparison with previous studies was not possible because no validations of the two missions over rivers have been reported hence this work provided the baseline performance of icesat 2 and gedi in rivers 5 2 impact of accuracy the intensity of laser could affect the accuracy of measurement we found that the strong beams of icesat 2 performed better than the weak beams by 0 7 10 8 and 0 5 cm 4 1 for the lake and river respectively fig 3a a possible reason was that the signal photon density from the strong beams was significantly higher than that of the weak making water level measurement using the weak beam more difficult for icesat 2 the energy ratio between the strong and weak beams was approximately 4 1 and the near surface interaction phenomenon of photons emanating from the strong and weak beams may influence this difference the findings were consistent with dandabathula and rao 2020 who found the strong beams were 14 7 better than the weak beams when validating icesat 2 atl13 data against near real time gauged data over 15 reservoirs across the indian sub continent for ground measurement xing et al 2020 found that the accuracy of the strong beams was 2 6 higher than that of the weak in retrieving ground topography of forested terrain similarly the accuracy of full power beams of gedi was 11 5 3 6 cm higher than that of the covered beams in lakes and this proportion increased to 23 0 11 5 cm in the river fig 3b our finding was consistent with that of fayad et al 2020 who found that the accuracy of full power beams of gedi was 24 0 better than that of the coverage beams in lakes the acquisition time of observations may influence the measurement accuracy as well our results suggested that the nighttime acquisitions were slightly more accurate than daytime acquisitions for all the three altimeters fig 3c it was likely due to the noises caused by the solar background and atmospheric scattering this was especially the case for icesat 2 which was based on the photon counting technology the detector of this lidar system was sensitive at the single photon level which can be triggered by any returned photons whether from the reflected signal or from the solar background similar results were also reported by neuenschwander et al 2020 who found that for no snow conditions the ground elevation was more accurately measured by nighttime acquisitions therefore it was recommended that end users interested in inland water level retrievals should avoid the use of weak beam data acquired during the daytime the river size and morphology were also likely to impact the accuracy it was generally acknowledged that satellite altimetry performed better over large rivers papa et al 2012 for example zakharova et al 2020 found that the accuracy of the water level estimates from envisat environment satellite varied from 0 63 m for the ob river 2 km in width to 1 1 m for the pur river 0 5 km in width however our results did not show a clear dependence of altimetry performance on the river width fig 4 most likely due to the relatively small footprint and high along track resolution in relation to the width of river 5 3 implications for monitoring inland water level dynamics in addition to accuracy the spatial temporal resolution of the satellite altimetry mission was critical for inland water level monitoring the spatial resolution decided the size of water body that can be measured the satellite radar altimetry was initially designed to measure the sea level variations often having a footprint with a diameter of several kilometers crétaux et al 2015 for applications in inland waters it was suggested that the water body should be wider than 1000 m to be optimally retrieved by radar altimeters lettenmaier et al 2015 although recent studies have demonstrated the successful retrieval of water levels of small rivers 200 m width kuo and kao 2011 michailovsky et al 2012 sulistioadi et al 2015 biancamaria et al 2017 the processing of satellite radar observations for small water bodies remained challenging and the accuracy was poor i e rmse 0 27 to 1 07 m michailovsky et al 2012 in comparison laser altimetry has much higher spatial resolution sampling than radar altimetry this made it more suitable for observing rivers as the small footprint was less likely contaminated by the surrounding land and vegetation for example icesat 1 has been used to measure rivers with a few hundred meters wide baghdadi et al 2011 although we did not apply the laser altimetry to small rivers our results indicated that the measurement accuracy did not fully depend on the width of mississippi river fig 4 therefore it was expected that the icesat 2 and gedi can measure even smaller rivers given their smaller footprints and denser samplings the minimum width of river to be accurately measured will be examined in the next step the temporal resolution determined how often a specific inland water body can be measured a higher resolution allowed a more frequent measurement providing detailed information of water level variations liu et al 2017 investigated the potential of icesat 1 for monitoring water surface dynamics and found it can capture 60 of the variations in water level dynamics for at most 34 of the us lakes the limited temporal sampling was identified as a major factor limiting the use for water dynamics studies to compare temporal resolutions of the three altimeters the number of observations within the 30 km radius of a station was used to estimate the annual observation frequency aof for the great lakes table 4 it was found that gedi had the highest frequency with 14 80 observations per year followed by icesat 2 10 43 which were about five and four times that of icesat 1 2 45 it was noted that the aof was estimated based on the observations within 30 km radius of a station therefore much more observations and hence larger aof values could be anticipated for the great lakes indicating a bright prospect in frequent measurement of inland waters even with higher temporal resolutions icesat 2 and gedi were still not likely to fulfill some applications requiring water levels at short intervals i e daily to cope with the temporal gap the integration of multi mission altimetry was introduced and found to significantly improve the spatial temporal resolution tourian et al 2016 li et al 2020 as icesat 2 and gedi are operating simultaneously the combination of the two missions will provide temporally denser observations allowing to capture detailed cycles of water level variations overall this study demonstrated that spaceborne laser altimetry has great potentials for frequent and accurate monitoring of inland waters especially with the combination of icesat 2 and gedi missions 6 conclusion spaceborne laser altimetry has been recently used to monitor inland water level variations this study aimed to validate and compare the water level measurements derived from the newly launched laser altimeters and provide insights for monitoring inland water dynamics water level retrievals from icesat 2 and gedi as well as icesat 1 were validated against in situ data from 22 gauging stations at various scales in the great lakes and lower mississippi river the performances of three laser altimeters were compared the factors affecting the accuracy were analyzed and the potentials for monitoring inland water dynamics were explored the results showed that icesat 2 provided the unprecedented accuracy of inland water level measurement in both the great lakes and lower mississippi river followed by icesat 1 and then by gedi all the altimeters performed better over lakes than the river the analysis suggested that for all the three laser altimeters the strong beam achieved higher water level accuracies than those of the weak as the measurement using the weak beam was more difficult the nighttime acquisitions were slightly more accurate than those of the daytime due to less affected by the solar background noise and atmospheric scattering however our result indicated no clear dependence of measurement accuracy on the river width likely due to the small footprint and high along track resolution in relation to the width of river therefore we recommended that end users interested in inland water level retrievals should employ the strong beam data acquired in the nighttime this study also highlighted the great potential of satellite laser altimetry for monitoring inland water dynamics particularly with the combination of operational icesat 2 and gedi platforms as such spaceborne laser altimetry may help advance our understanding of hydrological processes and related issues of water resource and ecosystem health especially in remote data scarce regions of the world credit authorship contribution statement jin xiang methodology software
