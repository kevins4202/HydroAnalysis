15105,iron sulfides based autotrophic denitrification iad is a promising technology for nitrate and phosphate removal from low c n ratio wastewater due to its cost effectiveness and low sludge production however the slow kinetics of iad compared to other sulfur based autotrophic denitrification sad processes limits its engineering application this study constructed a co electron donor fes and s0 with a volume ratio of 2 1 iron sulfur autotrophic denitrification isad biofilter and operated at as short as 1 hr hydraulic retention time hrt long term operation results showed that the superior total nitrogen and phosphate removals of the isad biofilter were 90 100 at 1 12 h hrt with the highest denitrification rate up to 960 mg l d considering low sulfate production hrt of 3 h could be the optimal condition such superior performance in the isad biofilter was achieved due to the interactions between fes and s0 which accelerated the denitrification process and maintained the acidity alkalinity balance metagenomic analysis found that the enriched nitrate dependent iron oxidizing ndfo bacteria acinetobacter and acidovorax sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra bacteria likely supported stable nitrate reduction the metabolic pathway analysis showed that completely denitrification and dnra coupled with sulfur oxidation disproportionation iron oxidation and phosphate precipitation with fes and s0 as co electron donors were responsible for the high rate nitrate and phosphate removal this study provides the potential of isad as a highly efficient post denitrification technology and sheds light on the balanced microbial s n fe transformation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fes s0 nitrate and phosphorus removal autotrophic denitrification microbial community metabolic pathway data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen and phosphorus are well known to cause the eutrophication of surface waters which pose a significant risk to the aquatic systems han et al 2023 the simultaneous removal of nitrate and phosphorus from wastewater has been a hot topic for decades trauth et al 2018 the heterotrophic denitrification process is widely adopted for nitrate removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps but it requires sufficient external organic carbon supply xu et al 2020b in this context sulfur autotrophic denitrification using elemental sulfur as the electron donor has attracted much attention for its low input and high denitrification efficiency when treating municipal wastewater with low c n ratios guo et al 2022 however high sulfate production in the s0 based autotrophic denitrification sad system is a concern and h generated in the system requires enough alkalinity to neutralize eq 1 1 5 s 0 6 no 3 2 h 2 o 5 so 4 2 3 n 2 4 h sad also shows limited phosphorus removal capacity different from sad iron autotrophic denitrification using iron sulfide minerals pyrite and pyrrhotite as the electron donors can achieve simultaneous nitrogen and phosphate removal hu et al 2020 the reactions of this process can be expressed as eqs 2 and 3 bosch et al 2012 li et al 2016 2 5 fe s 2 15 no 3 10 h 2 o 10 so 4 2 7 5 n 2 5 h 5 fe oh 3 3 10 fes 18 no 3 16 h 2 o 10 so 4 2 9 n 2 2 h 10 fe oh 3 in iron sulfides based autotrophic denitrification pad systems nitrate is reduced to nitrogen gas by iron oxidizing denitrifiers and sulfur oxidizing denitrifiers phosphorus can be effectively removed by forming precipitates with fe3 which is released from iron sulfide minerals during denitrification apart from the efficient removal of nitrate and phosphate pad can also be effective in reducing the toxicity of emerging contaminants to denitrifiers bai et al 2022 which has not been found in sad however the extremely low nitrate removal rate 61 mg l d observed in pad would limit its further application in wwtps zhang et al 2019 to improve the denitrification rate of pad a pyrrhotite sulfur system psad with pyrrhotite and s0 as the co electron donors was constructed by li et al 2020b in psad reactors sad releases h which can promote the dissolution of pyrrhotite then the nitrate removal kinetics is accelerated therefore psad should achieve a much higher nitrate removal rate than pad however the nitrate removal kinetics in psad is still much slower than that in sad how to further improve the nitrate removal kinetics in psad and how to achieve simultaneously efficient nitrate removal and low sulfate accumulation in the coupling system are worthy of exploring besides the reduced iron and sulfur substances many other elements such as si cu ca al and ni co exist in iron sulfide minerals yang et al 2017b it is hypothesized that the denitrification performance of psad may be impacted by these impurities in iron sulfide minerals jiang et al 2013 kiskira et al 2018 correspondingly the psad system mentioned above did not enrich any iron oxidizing related bacteria li et al 2020b moreover li et al 2022 reported that denitrification performance of pad was affected by the crystalline structure of iron sulfide material therefore using the chemically synthesized iron sulfide fes with determined chemical and physical properties coupled with s0 to explore the potential of nitrate removal rate of psad is reasonably necessary however no related studies have been reported in recent years 16s rdna sequencing technology has identified one important sulfur based autotrophic denitrifier i e thiobacillus in sad pad and psad systems hu et al 2020 however the key microorganisms involved in the system where both iron and sulfur are electron donors available for denitrification have not been clearly distinguished zhou et al 2022 the metabolic interactions between various functional microorganisms and the metabolic mechanisms of nitrogen sulfur and iron cycling are not clear how such interspecies interactions relate to the performance of contaminant removal remains largely unexplored thus in this study fes s0 autotrophic denitrification isad biofilter was constructed with s0 and iron sulfide fes instead of iron sulfide minerals first to explore its potential in achieving high nitrate removal rate the long term operating performance of isad was investigated using synthetic and real wastewater at different n loading rates second metagenomic sequencing was employed to understand the microbial community compositions and functions in the isad biofilter finally functional genes and metabolic pathways related to fe cycling n cycling and s cycling were assessed this study will contribute to the understanding of the isad system and develop a novel technology for high rate nitrate and phosphate removal from secondary effluent in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and inoculum iron sulfide fes fused sticks fe 60 67 s 25 was purchased from fisher scientific ireland before being used for the biofilter experiment fes was pulverized into particles of 150 µm pan et al 2022 s0 powder 99 purity with the diameter of 100 µm was purchased from sigma ireland the other reagents used in this study were analytical grade sulfur based autotrophic denitrifiers were enriched from the anaerobic sludge collected from a local wwtp in galway ireland the enrichment procedure and culturing medium have been described in our previous study yang et al 2017a and are not detailed herein the successfully enriched biomass was then used as the inoculum for the isad biofilter 2 2 long term operation of the isad biofilter one glass column internal diameter 30 mm height 330 mm was constructed as the isad biofilter fig s1 a mixture of fes and s0 powder with a volume ratio of 2 1 was added into the biofilter as biofilm substrate reasons for setting only one biofilter and choosing this volume ratio in the study were shown in the supplementary information both fes and s0 were added in the column once off with a porosity of about 18 the effective pore water volume of the biofilter was 30 0 ml as shown in the supplementary information the synthetic wastewater did not contain organic carbon but the real secondary effluent used contained low organic carbon so both types of wastewaters can be regarded as wastewater with low c n before used for the biofilter the wastewaters were purged with pure n2 for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen the operation of the biofilter were monitored periodically the rotational speed of the pump was measured every week to ensure the accuracy of the flow rate of the influent concentrations of n and p in the synthetic wastewater varied during the different phases of the biofilter operation period table 1 so as to assess the performance of the biofilter under a variety of n and p concentrations details about the inoculation method for the biofilter were shown in the supplementary information after the inoculation period the wastewater trial in the isad biofilter commenced to ensure sufficient biofilm growth phase i lasted 120 days the hydraulic retention time hrt

using a ph meter hach ph 3 equipped with a ph electrode hach lzw5011t on day 281 the solid samples were collected from sampling points 2 3 and 4 after mixing evenly the solid sample was stored in the centrifuge tubes and protected by nitrogen gas before characterization xps omicron multiprobe using a monochromised al kα source xm 1000 1486 7 ev was applied to analyze the element transformation on the surface of the solid sample sample preparation procedures for xps analysis have been described in a previous study yu et al 2020 the solid sample collected from the biofilter at the end of the trial was also used for genomic dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing 2 4 dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing genomic dna was extracted from the inoculum and solid samples collected from the biofilter at the end of the trial namely raw and isad respectively metagenomic sequencing was performed at the illumina hiseq pe100 platform the details for sequencing and taxonomic classification have been described in previous studies sun et al 2021 sequencing data obtained in this study have been submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database under accession number samn30098258 and samn30098259 methods for the visualization of the sequencing data were shown in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate removal in the isad biofilter the variation of no3 n no2 n nh4 n and tn no3 n no2 n nh4 n removal efficiency in the effluent of isad biofilter over the whole operational period 281 days is presented in fig 1 the influence of the increased n loading rate from 100 to 960 mg l d phase i v on the nitrate removal performance of the isad biofilter was investigated stoichiometric calculations based on eqs 1 3 indicated that the amount of packing materials was in great excess in relation to the total n loading so there was no need to supplement fes or s0 and the removal efficiency remained stable despite the increasing n loading during the long term operation period during phase i effluent no3 n concentrations were kept below 0 2 mg l and no no2 n was detected in the effluent tn removal efficiency was around 90 in this period when n loading rate was 100 mg l d at 12 h hrt it indicated that autotrophic denitrifiers were successfully colonized in the biofilter after the inoculation period the average effluent nh4 n concentration was 5 mg l in phase i the production of nh4 n in the isad biofilter might be ascribed to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra process it has been widely reported that nitrate can be reduced to ammonia by the dnra bacteria in autotrophic denitrification systems using iron sulfides s0 fe or fe2 as electron donors li et al 2020a the microbial community and functional gene analysis in section 3 4 confirmed this hypothesis in phase ii the influent n loading rate was increased to 160 mg l d when hrt was decreased to 6 h the sudden change of hrt resulted in the increase of effluent no3 n and no2 n concentrations in the first several days of this period because of the acclimation of microorganisms and then effluent no3 n and no2 n concentrations were decreased to be as low as those in phase i the effluent nh4 n concentrations kept decreasing to 0 this indicated that hrt regulation effectively alleviated the nh4 n production in the isad biofilter this phenomenon is similar to that reported by wang et al 2019b who suggested that a lower fe n or s n ratio should limit dnra process in phase iii the n loading rate was further increased to 320 mg l d the overall tn removal efficiency was around 100 during this period except for a period between day 180 to day 194 when tn removal efficiency was decreased to 62 because the biofilter was blocked in these days the blockage was solved by flushing the column with water and purging the pure nitrogen gas for 3 times however the microorganisms needed some time for recovery which caused the unstable results shown in fig 1 in phases iv and v the n loading rate was further increased to 480 and 960 mg l d respectively and effluent no3 n and no2 n concentrations were below 0 5 mg l table 2 summarizes the nitrogen removal rate obtained in previous studies related to sad pad and iron sulfur coupled autotrophic denitrification biofilters the nitrogen removal rate of 960 mg l d achieved in the isad biofilter was the highest among all the similar systems notably the highest nitrogen removal rate observed in the present study is also comparable with those reported in some heterotrophic denitrification systems with organic carbon as the electron donors ranging from 340 to 1230 no3 n mg l d wang et al 2021 compared to pad systems in which natural iron sulfide minerals are used as electron donors chemically synthesized fes is a more favourable electron donor for autotrophic denitrifiers in the last phase when real wastewater was treated a stable and high nitrogen removal efficiency 100 was obtained at hrt of 1 h indicating a great potential of the isad biofilter in treating domestic wastewater with low c n ratios 3 2 phosphate removal in the isad biofilter effluent phosphate concentrations and removal efficiencies of the isad biofilter over the 281 day trial are shown in fig 2 as the influent po4 3 p was 10 mg l in phase i the average effluent po4 3 p of the isad biofilter was 1 51 0 34 mg l during the first 83 days at hrt of 12 h with the po4 3 p removal efficiency between 79 3 to 91 3 from day 84 to day 119 the highest p removal efficiency reached 99 0 and the averaged effluent p concentrations were 0 29 0 09 mg l in the subsequent phases isad showed excellent p removal performance with averaged effluent p concentrations below 0 05 mg l as the influent p concentration of 3 0 mg l when treating real wastewater in phase vi p concentration in the effluent of isad biofilter was undetectable with 100 p removal efficiency at hrt of 1 h to conclude isad obtained almost 100 p removal efficiency when p loading rates were in the range of 12 mg l d 72 mg l d the excellent p removal efficiency achieved in isad biofilter can be ascribed to the coupled effects of iad and sad the dissolution of fes released fe2 to the solution and fe2 was oxidized to fe3 by autotrophic microorganisms through the denitrification process thus iad can achieve high p removal efficiency upon the start up of the biofilter however precipitates fepo4 fe2 po4 3 would cover the surface of fes inhibiting the further dissolution and oxidation of fes as a result the p removal efficiency was reduced this could be one of the reasons that p removal efficiencies decreased along with time during the first 83 days in phase i different from phosphorus removal the stable and high denitrification efficiency observed in this study indicates that nitrate reduction was not impacted by the cover of precipitates however the increased p removal efficiency after day 83 in phase i indicated that the inhibition caused by excessive precipitates was effectively relieved in the system this can be explained by the synergistic effects between sad and iad processes it is well known that sad has limited p removal capacity but h produced in the sad can promote fes dissolution producing more iron ions in the system thus continuously high p removal during the long operation period in the isad biofilter was observed xps analysis shown in fig s2 also confirms the existence of fepo4 on the surface of the packing material which indicates that p was removed from the system through forming precipitates with iron ions besides according to the results of microbial community analysis no phosphorus accumulating organisms pao were observed in the system because of no organic carbon in the influent wastewater therefore fe2 fe3 was the primary p removal mechanism in the isad biofilter isad showed superior n and p removal at low hrt 1 h compared to the traditional biological denitrification systems isad process does not need extra carbon sources leading to a low operation cost and energy which is promising for treating low c n wastewater 3 3 production of sulfur and iron compounds in the isad biofilter with fes and s0 as the electron donors for autotrophic denitrification sulfate and ferric ions are produced as the final products eq 3 fig 3 a shows the effluent sulfate production during operation when hrt was 12 h effluent sulfate concentrations fluctuated between 232 9 and 322 2 mg l with an average concentration of 270 5 21 1 mg l when hrt decreased from 12 hr to 1 hr in the subsequent phases the average effluent sulfate concentrations decreased to 221 6 23 0 mg l in phase v it was found that the lower hrt contributed to the incomplete oxidation of reduced sulfur in fes with the generation of some intermediates like polysulfides and sulfite wang et al 2022b as a result the production of effluent sulfate concentration was reduced xps peaks fig s2 also confirmed the existence of polysulfides sulfur disproportionation process was believed to produce polysulfides in the isad biofilter it was found that sad with polysulfides achieved high rate nitrogen removal qiu et al 2022 when treating real wastewater in phase vi the average sulfate production was 66 7 2 6 mg l at hrt of 1 h and influent nitrate concentration of 15 mg l the production of so4 2 is associated with the reduction of no3 according to the sad and pad processes eqs 1 3 the ratios of the stoichiometric so4 2 production mg l vs no3 n reduction mg l named as rs n should be 5 71 and 3 81 of the sad and pad respectively as shown in fig 3 b rs n was 5 42 when hrt was 12 h during the first phase which was much closer to sad it decreased to the lowest value of 4 95 when hrt was decreased to 3 h in phase iii then rs n increased when the hrt was further reduced to 2 h and 1 h s0 is the preferred electron donor over fes for the autotrophic sulfur oxidizing denitrifiers thus sad dominated in the system during the initial stage it explained the relatively higher rs n in the first phase however s0 was continuously consumed and the kinetics of pad was enhanced along with the operation period then pad developed its dominance in the system and rs n was decreased when hrt was reduced to 3 h the availability of s0 was lower due to its consumption in the first phase as a result the lowest rs n was shown in this phase when hrt was further reduced in phase iv and v the nitrate loading rate was increased accordingly under the cooperation of sob and ndfo s based and fe based autotrophic denitrification processes co contributed to the nitrate reduction in the system as a result rs n was increased again results also indicated hrt of 3 h may be the optimal condition for controlling the sulfate pollution from the perspective of engineering application the average total fe concentrations in the six phases in the effluent of isad biofilter are shown in fig 3 c the effluent total fe concentrations decreased along with the decrease of hrt the highest total fe concentration was 27 7 0 53 mg l in phase i at hrt of 12 h then it slightly decreased to 26 0 1 65 mg l when hrt was reduced to 6 h in phase ii as hrt was further reduced to 1 h at phase v the effluent total fe concentration decreased to 9 77 1 74 mg l two possible reasons caused the lower effluent total fe concentration at shorter hrts first shorter hrt of isad biofilter means that the reaction time of nitrate and fes was shorter resulting in less dissolution of fes it was found that the total fe concentration increased along with the reaction time in li s batch experiment li et al 2020b second more ferric hydr oxides were produced and precipitated on the fes surface with the decrease of hrt an increase of n loading ferric hydr oxides precipitates were found to be the main products in pad zhang et al 2019 however the production rate of ferric hydr oxides may be slower than the precipitation rate of ferric hydr oxides as a result the effluent total fe concentration became lower the lowest effluent total fe concentration of 2 60 0 20 was observed in phase vi when the real wastewater was treated the same hrt of 1 h was applied for phase v and phase vi but a much lower effluent total fe concentration was observed in phase vi it could be due to the much lower influent n and p concentrations in phase vi compared with those in phase v it was clear that less influent nitrate concentration resulted in less fes dissolution at the same reaction time a similar effluent total fe concentration 2 10 mg l was also observed in wang s study which investigated the nitrate removal in a fes2 based biofilter wang et al 2022b the low effluent total fe concentration of isad biofilter also confirmed its potential for practical application both total fe and sulfate concentrations decreased with the decrease in hrt it indicates that sulfur oxidation and iron oxidation processes could be synchronous these results demonstrated that nitrate removal was accomplished through the complicated pathways involving fe oxidation s cycle and dnra process 3 4 microbial community functional genes and metabolic pathways 3 4 1 microbial community constitution and abundance analysis fig 4 shows the relative abundances of microorganisms on the surface of packing material s0 fes collected from isad biofilter on day 281 and enriched biomass used as the inoculum on day 1 at the phylum level a class level b and genus level c as shown in fig 4 a the top three phylum of the two samples were proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes whose total relative abundances accounted for over 95 of each sample proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes accounted for 95 7 3 0 and 0 47 abundances in the raw sample respectively in the isad biofilter actinobacteria became the most dominant phylum accounting for 87 0 of the bacterial sequences proteobacteria second to actinobacteria accounting for 12 5 bacteroidetes was the lowest one of the three dominant phylum in isad biofilter only accounting for 0 36 although both proteobacteria and actinobacteria were found to be essential denitrifiers in soils palmer and horn 2012 sludge yi et al 2016 and wastewater liu et al 2021 their huge difference in relative abundances indicated that the microbial community structures of the two samples were significantly different heatmap fig 4 b shows the microbial community structure and similarities at the class level of the two samples 30 classes were identified in the raw and isad samples sordariomycetes 4 5 chitinophagia 4 4 rubrobacteria 4 3 and anaerolineae 4 2 were the predominant class in the raw sample anaerolineae was reported as a sulfur autotrophic denitrification class in xu s s0 based continuous up flowing reactor xu et al 2020a by contrast the predominant classes were chloroflexia 4 8 hydrogenophilalia 4 7 anaerolineae 4 7 and epsilonproteobacteria 4 2 in isad biofilter chloroflexia contains many denitrifying genera and exists in an autotrophic denitrification system promoted by fe2 quan et al 2020 the highest relative abundance of chloroflexia in isad biofilter indicates the possibility of fe2 in promoting nitrate removal meanwhile pu s study investigating nitrate removal in a pytite based autotrophic denitrification system found that epsilonproteobacteria was the most dominant denitrifier on the surface of pyrite after experiment pu et al 2014 the increase of epsilonproteobacteria in the isad biofilter compared with the raw sample indicated that its activity can be largely promoted with fes s0 as the electron donors our findings demonstrate that microorganisms enriched in the isad biofilter tended to form iron related functional communities when the electron donor was changed from thiosulfate to fes s0 relative abundances of the microbial community in the raw sample and isad biofilter at the genus level are presented in fig 4 c the top 20 genera of the two samples were chosen to discuss here when thiosulfate was the electron donor raw sample the dominant genera were castellaniella thiobacillus pseudomonas denitratisoma and thiomonas accounting for 27 0 13 4 10 7 7 0 and 6 6 respectively however the co presence of the two electron donors fes s0 mainly selected acinetobacter acidovorax pseudoxanthomonas variovorax and sphingopyxis with the relative abundances of 33 1 23 5 11 6 7 4 and 6 8 respectively in isad biofilter sob in raw sample such as castellaniella and thiobacillus lost their advantages in the isad biofilter although previous studies reported that thiobacillus was capable of utilizing iron compounds as electron donors for nitrate reduction bosch et al 2012 zhu et al 2019 the decreased abundance of thiobacillus observed in this study indicated that thiobacillus might be in a weak position when competing with other iron oxidizing denitrifiers besides it was found that fe2 concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 5 mm significantly inhibited thiobacillus in the s0 based autotrophic denitrification system pang and wang 2021 therefore the inhibition effects caused by high iron ions in the isad biofilter fig 3 b may contribute to the lower relative abundance of thiobacillus compared with sob dominance in the raw sample the predominant genera in isad biofilter have been characterized as the ndfo bacteria for example acinetobacter the most dominant genera in isad biofilter was increased from 0 03 to 33 1 after the 281 day operation it was also significantly enriched from less than 0 01 to 27 48 in wang s culturing media containing nitrate and fe ii wang et al 2022a meanwhile acinetobacter can tolerate high concentrations of fe ii up to 504 mg l wang et al 2022a therefore acinetobacter may be closely related to the ndfo process in the isad biofilter acidovorax belonging to the betaproteobacteria phylum took the second place in the isad biofilter several members of this genus such as acidovorax sp strain bofen1 acidovorax ebreus strain tpsy and acidovorax sp strain 2an have been characterized as the nitrate reducing fe ii oxidizer byrne bailey et al 2010 chakraborty et al 2011 pantke et al 2012 the direct enzymatic pathway and the indirect green dust mediated process were found to be the mechanism that acidovorax contributed to ndfo pantke et al 2012 since most ndfo strains require a carbon source or sustained fe ii oxidation for growth chakraborty et al 2011 the enrichment of acidovorax in isad biofilter may be benefitted from the fe2 fe3 cycle where fe2 oxidation and fe3 reduction continuously occurred in the system the dominance of iron oxidizing autotrophic denitrifiers such as acinetobacter and acidovorax induced by fe2 the product of fes dissolution could switch the metabolic model into iron based autotrophic denitrification from sulfur based denitrification in addition some dnra bacteria were also enriched in the isad biofilter hydrogenophaga a common dnra bacteria found in the biological denitrification system kutvonen et al 2015 rose from 1 04 to 2 26 in this study besides the relative abundance of stenotrophomonas rose from 3 69 to 5 16 in the isad biofilter a few strains of stenotrophomonas have been reported to participate in dnra process mergaert et al 2001 therefore hydrogenophaga and stenotrophomonas in the isad biofilter may be the key genera responsible for ammonia production in the system apart from these ndfo and dnra bacteria enriched in the isad biofilter the relative abundances of some functional microorganisms also exceeded 1 including pseudomonas 1 84 pseudoxanthomonas 11 6 and alicycliphilus 3 55 notably many stains of pseudomonas have been reported to remove nh4 n in simultaneous nitrification and denitrification systems xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 thus it may exert a key role in nh4 n removal when the influent n loading was continuously increased in the isad biofilter in addition the dominance of pseudoxanthomonas and alicycliphilus two s based denitrificans in the isad biofilter indicated their potential contributions to nitrate reduction cui et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 overall results indicated that ndfo dnra and sob jointly contributed to the superior nitrogen removal efficiency at high nitrate loads in the isad biofilter 3 4 2 functional genes related to n s and fe cycling in isad biofilter the functional genes associated with n cycling s cycling and fe cycling of the isad biofilter were annotated fig 5 a the essential genes responsible for complete denitrification including nitrate reduction narghi and napab nitrite reduction nirs and nirk nitric oxide reduction norb and norc and nitrous oxide reduction nosz were detected notably nosz gene was assumed to favor less n2o accumulation and emission in iron sulfur autotrophic denitrification systems wang et al 2019b meanwhile the isad biofilter had all of the necessary genes for the dnra process such as nirb nird and nrfa which participate in the reduction of nitrite to ammonia although nitrifiers such as pseudomonas were enriched in the isad biofilter key genes encoding nitrification were not detected in the system results showed that denitrification and dnra were the system s main n metabolic pathways which corresponds to the long term operation results described above because nitrate reduction was coupled with sulfur oxidation in the isad biofilter essential genes encoding three main sulfur metabolic pathways were found in the isad biofilter first there were five genes soxa soxx soxy soxz and soxb responsible for sulfur oxidation through the sox complex which was also the most common sulfur metabolic pathway found in sulfur based autotrophic denitrification systems li et al 2021 second all of the necessary genes associated with dissimilatory sulfate reduction and oxidation dsra dsrb apra aprb and sat were detected in this study the oxidation of s2 to so4 2 was the main sulfur metabolic pathway in the isad biofilter coupling with nitrate reduction the highest relative abundance of gene aprb encoding the oxidation of so3 2 to adenosylphosphosulfate aps suggested that the produced so3 2 can be completely oxidized according to the long term operation results there was indeed no so3 2 accumulation in the isad biofilter third several other s2 related metabolic pathways were found in the isad biofilter such as genes involved in the oxidation of s2 to sn 2 sqr and the reduction of sn 2 to s2 hydadg previous studies have reported that polysulfide induced by sulfur sulfate reduction could improve the bioavailability of sulfur thereby boosting the sulfur reduction and autotrophic denitrification rates liang et al 2016 qiu et al 2020 therefore this redox reversible pathway favoured the high nitrate removal rate in the isad biofilter besides the multiple sulfur metabolic pathways related to s2 oxidation found in this study also avoided the accumulation of hydrogen sulfide gas a common toxic by product produced in biological nitrate removal systems malhautier et al 2003 in addition to nitrogen and sulfur iron is also an essential element involved in the denitrification process in the isad biofilter three iron oxidation genes foxy ccon and cyc1 were found in the system these key genes drove the fe2 oxidation in the isad biofilter iron oxidation was reported to exert a crucial role in electron supply and transfer in autotrophic denitrification process fu et al 2014 ndfo bacteria such as acidovorax also dominated in the system these results illustrated that sulfur cycling and iron oxidation co accelerated the autotrophic denitrification rate in the isad biofilter however it was always overlooked in previous iron sulfur systems li et al 2020b zhu et al 2019 to further investigate the mechanism of the high nitrate removal rate in the isad biofilter a co occurrence network of functional microbial carrying critical genes related to the n s and fe metabolic pathways in the isad biofilter was constructed as shown in fig 5 b the top 50 genera of the raw sample and isad biofilter all harboured functional genes encoding one or more n s and fe pathways characterized in the study 39 genera gray node were enriched in the isad biofilter after the 281 d operation with only 11 genera purple node showing decreased relative abundances compared with the raw sample this indicates that functional microorganisms reformed a powerful cluster in the isad biofilter according to the new substrates provided in addition most genera 44 of 50 carried essential genes encoding three elements metabolic pathways simultaneously indicating that an active functional microbial community was formed in the isad biofilter for example acidovorax an important ndfo bacteria in isad biofilter harboured all the five pathways related to n cycling four pathways s1 s2 s6 and s7 associated with s cycling and fe ii oxidation results showed that acidovorax played a crucial role in nitrate reduction denitrification and dnra sulfate production and iron oxidation in the isad biofilter meanwhile pseudoxanthomonas the common sulfur based denitrifiers carried the genes for iron oxidation dnra and polysulfide production acinetobacter the most dominant genus in isad biofilter possessed genes coding n1 n5 and s7 pathways which indicated acinetobacter might also be responsible for dnra and polysulfide production moreover some genera showed relatively low abundances 1 in the isad biofilter but they harboured a lot of pathways of n s and fe cycling the most representative genera included hyphomicrobium 10 pathways polaromonas 12 pathways and bradyrhizobium 10 pathways they were also crucial for achieving high and stable nitrogen removal in the isad biofilter our results demonstrated that the multi pathway synergistic effects between fe and s based denitrifiers enhanced the nitrate removal in the isad biofilter 3 5 a concept model for superior nitrate and phosphate removal mechanism in isad biofilter based on the reactor performance and the corresponding microbial community and metabolism analysis the working mechanism of nitrate and phosphate removal by coupling sulfur and iron driven autotrophic denitrification in the isad biofilter is illustrated in fig 6 the h produced from the s0 based autotrophic denitrification process promoted the dissolution of fes which released fe2 and hs fe2 was then used by the ndfo bacteria such as acinetobacter and acidovorax to reduce nitrate fe3 produced from the oxidation of fe2 during the denitrification process was able to remove phosphate by precipitation the electron transition between microbial cells and iron oxide minerals for fe iii oxide reduction could be promoted by the electron shuttling compounds released from some function microorganisms such as geothrix zhou et al 2021 as a result there was a dynamic balance between fe2 and fe3 in the system simultaneously hs was utilized by the sob including pseudoxanthomonas and alicycliphilus for autotrophic denitrification and its denitrification rate was faster than s0 the lower sulfate yield of isad biofilter along with the decrease of hrt was ascribed to the generation of polysulfide as aforementioned the formation of polysulfide also accelerated the overall denitrification rate both sulfur oxidation and disproportionation coupled with nitrate reduction in isad biofilter some dnra bacteria hydrogenophaga and stenotrophomonas were responsible for reducing nitrate to ammonia through a dissimilation pathway enriched in isad biofilter but ammonia accumulation was effectively ameliorated when hrt was reduced function gene analysis indicated that collaborative denitrification communities simultaneously harbouring diverse metabolic pathways of n s and fe were formed in the isad biofilter when fes and s0 were used as co electron donors for autotrophic denitrifiers the multi pathways of n transformations involving fe oxidation s cycle and dnra resulted in the superior nitrate removal rate in the present study 4 conclusion isad biofilter achieved highly efficient nitrate and phosphate removal at low hrt when treating synthetic and real wastewater the highest nitrate removal rate was 960 mg l d and the phosphate removal efficiency was 100 at an hrt of 1 h with fes and s0 as the co electron donors at a 2 1 ratio for autotrophic denitrification a collaborative denitrification community that had diverse metabolic pathways of n s and fe were formed in the isad biofilter metagenomic analysis revealed that the superior n and p removal performance of the isad biofilter under high nitrate loads was ascribed to the multi pathway synergistic effects of the functional microbial communities involved in n s and fe cycling collectively the superior nitrate and phosphate removal performance and its mechanisms of nitrogen sulfur and iron cycling obtained in this study could provide important information for understanding the iron sulfilde autotrophic denitrification process and optimizing

15105,iron sulfides based autotrophic denitrification iad is a promising technology for nitrate and phosphate removal from low c n ratio wastewater due to its cost effectiveness and low sludge production however the slow kinetics of iad compared to other sulfur based autotrophic denitrification sad processes limits its engineering application this study constructed a co electron donor fes and s0 with a volume ratio of 2 1 iron sulfur autotrophic denitrification isad biofilter and operated at as short as 1 hr hydraulic retention time hrt long term operation results showed that the superior total nitrogen and phosphate removals of the isad biofilter were 90 100 at 1 12 h hrt with the highest denitrification rate up to 960 mg l d considering low sulfate production hrt of 3 h could be the optimal condition such superior performance in the isad biofilter was achieved due to the interactions between fes and s0 which accelerated the denitrification process and maintained the acidity alkalinity balance metagenomic analysis found that the enriched nitrate dependent iron oxidizing ndfo bacteria acinetobacter and acidovorax sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra bacteria likely supported stable nitrate reduction the metabolic pathway analysis showed that completely denitrification and dnra coupled with sulfur oxidation disproportionation iron oxidation and phosphate precipitation with fes and s0 as co electron donors were responsible for the high rate nitrate and phosphate removal this study provides the potential of isad as a highly efficient post denitrification technology and sheds light on the balanced microbial s n fe transformation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fes s0 nitrate and phosphorus removal autotrophic denitrification microbial community metabolic pathway data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen and phosphorus are well known to cause the eutrophication of surface waters which pose a significant risk to the aquatic systems han et al 2023 the simultaneous removal of nitrate and phosphorus from wastewater has been a hot topic for decades trauth et al 2018 the heterotrophic denitrification process is widely adopted for nitrate removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps but it requires sufficient external organic carbon supply xu et al 2020b in this context sulfur autotrophic denitrification using elemental sulfur as the electron donor has attracted much attention for its low input and high denitrification efficiency when treating municipal wastewater with low c n ratios guo et al 2022 however high sulfate production in the s0 based autotrophic denitrification sad system is a concern and h generated in the system requires enough alkalinity to neutralize eq 1 1 5 s 0 6 no 3 2 h 2 o 5 so 4 2 3 n 2 4 h sad also shows limited phosphorus removal capacity different from sad iron autotrophic denitrification using iron sulfide minerals pyrite and pyrrhotite as the electron donors can achieve simultaneous nitrogen and phosphate removal hu et al 2020 the reactions of this process can be expressed as eqs 2 and 3 bosch et al 2012 li et al 2016 2 5 fe s 2 15 no 3 10 h 2 o 10 so 4 2 7 5 n 2 5 h 5 fe oh 3 3 10 fes 18 no 3 16 h 2 o 10 so 4 2 9 n 2 2 h 10 fe oh 3 in iron sulfides based autotrophic denitrification pad systems nitrate is reduced to nitrogen gas by iron oxidizing denitrifiers and sulfur oxidizing denitrifiers phosphorus can be effectively removed by forming precipitates with fe3 which is released from iron sulfide minerals during denitrification apart from the efficient removal of nitrate and phosphate pad can also be effective in reducing the toxicity of emerging contaminants to denitrifiers bai et al 2022 which has not been found in sad however the extremely low nitrate removal rate 61 mg l d observed in pad would limit its further application in wwtps zhang et al 2019 to improve the denitrification rate of pad a pyrrhotite sulfur system psad with pyrrhotite and s0 as the co electron donors was constructed by li et al 2020b in psad reactors sad releases h which can promote the dissolution of pyrrhotite then the nitrate removal kinetics is accelerated therefore psad should achieve a much higher nitrate removal rate than pad however the nitrate removal kinetics in psad is still much slower than that in sad how to further improve the nitrate removal kinetics in psad and how to achieve simultaneously efficient nitrate removal and low sulfate accumulation in the coupling system are worthy of exploring besides the reduced iron and sulfur substances many other elements such as si cu ca al and ni co exist in iron sulfide minerals yang et al 2017b it is hypothesized that the denitrification performance of psad may be impacted by these impurities in iron sulfide minerals jiang et al 2013 kiskira et al 2018 correspondingly the psad system mentioned above did not enrich any iron oxidizing related bacteria li et al 2020b moreover li et al 2022 reported that denitrification performance of pad was affected by the crystalline structure of iron sulfide material therefore using the chemically synthesized iron sulfide fes with determined chemical and physical properties coupled with s0 to explore the potential of nitrate removal rate of psad is reasonably necessary however no related studies have been reported in recent years 16s rdna sequencing technology has identified one important sulfur based autotrophic denitrifier i e thiobacillus in sad pad and psad systems hu et al 2020 however the key microorganisms involved in the system where both iron and sulfur are electron donors available for denitrification have not been clearly distinguished zhou et al 2022 the metabolic interactions between various functional microorganisms and the metabolic mechanisms of nitrogen sulfur and iron cycling are not clear how such interspecies interactions relate to the performance of contaminant removal remains largely unexplored thus in this study fes s0 autotrophic denitrification isad biofilter was constructed with s0 and iron sulfide fes instead of iron sulfide minerals first to explore its potential in achieving high nitrate removal rate the long term operating performance of isad was investigated using synthetic and real wastewater at different n loading rates second metagenomic sequencing was employed to understand the microbial community compositions and functions in the isad biofilter finally functional genes and metabolic pathways related to fe cycling n cycling and s cycling were assessed this study will contribute to the understanding of the isad system and develop a novel technology for high rate nitrate and phosphate removal from secondary effluent in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and inoculum iron sulfide fes fused sticks fe 60 67 s 25 was purchased from fisher scientific ireland before being used for the biofilter experiment fes was pulverized into particles of 150 µm pan et al 2022 s0 powder 99 purity with the diameter of 100 µm was purchased from sigma ireland the other reagents used in this study were analytical grade sulfur based autotrophic denitrifiers were enriched from the anaerobic sludge collected from a local wwtp in galway ireland the enrichment procedure and culturing medium have been described in our previous study yang et al 2017a and are not detailed herein the successfully enriched biomass was then used as the inoculum for the isad biofilter 2 2 long term operation of the isad biofilter one glass column internal diameter 30 mm height 330 mm was constructed as the isad biofilter fig s1 a mixture of fes and s0 powder with a volume ratio of 2 1 was added into the biofilter as biofilm substrate reasons for setting only one biofilter and choosing this volume ratio in the study were shown in the supplementary information both fes and s0 were added in the column once off with a porosity of about 18 the effective pore water volume of the biofilter was 30 0 ml as shown in the supplementary information the synthetic wastewater did not contain organic carbon but the real secondary effluent used contained low organic carbon so both types of wastewaters can be regarded as wastewater with low c n before used for the biofilter the wastewaters were purged with pure n2 for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen the operation of the biofilter were monitored periodically the rotational speed of the pump was measured every week to ensure the accuracy of the flow rate of the influent concentrations of n and p in the synthetic wastewater varied during the different phases of the biofilter operation period table 1 so as to assess the performance of the biofilter under a variety of n and p concentrations details about the inoculation method for the biofilter were shown in the supplementary information after the inoculation period the wastewater trial in the isad biofilter commenced to ensure sufficient biofilm growth phase i lasted 120 days the hydraulic retention time hrt

the surface of the solid sample sample preparation procedures for xps analysis have been described in a previous study yu et al 2020 the solid sample collected from the biofilter at the end of the trial was also used for genomic dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing 2 4 dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing genomic dna was extracted from the inoculum and solid samples collected from the biofilter at the end of the trial namely raw and isad respectively metagenomic sequencing was performed at the illumina hiseq pe100 platform the details for sequencing and taxonomic classification have been described in previous studies sun et al 2021 sequencing data obtained in this study have been submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database under accession number samn30098258 and samn30098259 methods for the visualization of the sequencing data were shown in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate removal in the isad biofilter the variation of no3 n no2 n nh4 n and tn no3 n no2 n nh4 n removal efficiency in the effluent of isad biofilter over the whole operational period 281 days is presented in fig 1 the influence of the increased n loading rate from 100 to 960 mg l d phase i v on the nitrate removal performance of the isad biofilter was investigated stoichiometric calculations based on eqs 1 3 indicated that the amount of packing materials was in great excess in relation to the total n loading so there was no need to supplement fes or s0 and the removal efficiency remained stable despite the increasing n loading during the long term operation period during phase i effluent no3 n concentrations were kept below 0 2 mg l and no no2 n was detected in the effluent tn removal efficiency was around 90 in this period when n loading rate was 100 mg l d at 12 h hrt it indicated that autotrophic denitrifiers were successfully colonized in the biofilter after the inoculation period the average effluent nh4 n concentration was 5 mg l in phase i the production of nh4 n in the isad biofilter might be ascribed to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra process it has been widely reported that nitrate can be reduced to ammonia by the dnra bacteria in autotrophic denitrification systems using iron sulfides s0 fe or fe2 as electron donors li et al 2020a the microbial community and functional gene analysis in section 3 4 confirmed this hypothesis in phase ii the influent n loading rate was increased to 160 mg l d when hrt was decreased to 6 h the sudden change of hrt resulted in the increase of effluent no3 n and no2 n concentrations in the first several days of this period because of the acclimation of microorganisms and then effluent no3 n and no2 n concentrations were decreased to be as low as those in phase i the effluent nh4 n concentrations kept decreasing to 0 this indicated that hrt regulation effectively alleviated the nh4 n production in the isad biofilter this phenomenon is similar to that reported by wang et al 2019b who suggested that a lower fe n or s n ratio should limit dnra process in phase iii the n loading rate was further increased to 320 mg l d the overall tn removal efficiency was around 100 during this period except for a period between day 180 to day 194 when tn removal efficiency was decreased to 62 because the biofilter was blocked in these days the blockage was solved by flushing the column with water and purging the pure nitrogen gas for 3 times however the microorganisms needed some time for recovery which caused the unstable results shown in fig 1 in phases iv and v the n loading rate was further increased to 480 and 960 mg l d respectively and effluent no3 n and no2 n concentrations were below 0 5 mg l table 2 summarizes the nitrogen removal rate obtained in previous studies related to sad pad and iron sulfur coupled autotrophic denitrification biofilters the nitrogen removal rate of 960 mg l d achieved in the isad biofilter was the highest among all the similar systems notably the highest nitrogen removal rate observed in the present study is also comparable with those reported in some heterotrophic denitrification systems with organic carbon as the electron donors ranging from 340 to 1230 no3 n mg l d wang et al 2021 compared to pad systems in which natural iron sulfide minerals are used as electron donors chemically synthesized fes is a more favourable electron donor for autotrophic denitrifiers in the last phase when real wastewater was treated a stable and high nitrogen removal efficiency 100 was obtained at hrt of 1 h indicating a great potential of the isad biofilter in treating domestic wastewater with low c n ratios 3 2 phosphate removal in the isad biofilter effluent phosphate concentrations and removal efficiencies of the isad biofilter over the 281 day trial are shown in fig 2 as the influent po4 3 p was 10 mg l in phase i the average effluent po4 3 p of the isad biofilter was 1 51 0 34 mg l during the first 83 days at hrt of 12 h with the po4 3 p removal efficiency between 79 3 to 91 3 from day 84 to day 119 the highest p removal efficiency reached 99 0 and the averaged effluent p concentrations were 0 29 0 09 mg l in the subsequent phases isad showed excellent p removal performance with averaged effluent p concentrations below 0 05 mg l as the influent p concentration of 3 0 mg l when treating real wastewater in phase vi p concentration in the effluent of isad biofilter was undetectable with 100 p removal efficiency at hrt of 1 h to conclude isad obtained almost 100 p removal efficiency when p loading rates were in the range of 12 mg l d 72 mg l d the excellent p removal efficiency achieved in isad biofilter can be ascribed to the coupled effects of iad and sad the dissolution of fes released fe2 to the solution and fe2 was oxidized to fe3 by autotrophic microorganisms through the denitrification process thus iad can achieve high p removal efficiency upon the start up of the biofilter however precipitates fepo4 fe2 po4 3 would cover the surface of fes inhibiting the further dissolution and oxidation of fes as a result the p removal efficiency was reduced this could be one of the reasons that p removal efficiencies decreased along with time during the first 83 days in phase i different from phosphorus removal the stable and high denitrification efficiency observed in this study indicates that nitrate reduction was not impacted by the cover of precipitates however the increased p removal efficiency after day 83 in phase i indicated that the inhibition caused by excessive precipitates was effectively relieved in the system this can be explained by the synergistic effects between sad and iad processes it is well known that sad has limited p removal capacity but h produced in the sad can promote fes dissolution producing more iron ions in the system thus continuously high p removal during the long operation period in the isad biofilter was observed xps analysis shown in fig s2 also confirms the existence of fepo4 on the surface of the packing material which indicates that p was removed from the system through forming precipitates with iron ions besides according to the results of microbial community analysis no phosphorus accumulating organisms pao were observed in the system because of no organic carbon in the influent wastewater therefore fe2 fe3 was the primary p removal mechanism in the isad biofilter isad showed superior n and p removal at low hrt 1 h compared to the traditional biological denitrification systems isad process does not need extra carbon sources leading to a low operation cost and energy which is promising for treating low c n wastewater 3 3 production of sulfur and iron compounds in the isad biofilter with fes and s0 as the electron donors for autotrophic denitrification sulfate and ferric ions are produced as the final products eq 3 fig 3 a shows the effluent sulfate production during operation when hrt was 12 h effluent sulfate concentrations fluctuated between 232 9 and 322 2 mg l with an average concentration of 270 5 21 1 mg l when hrt decreased from 12 hr to 1 hr in the subsequent phases the average effluent sulfate concentrations decreased to 221 6 23 0 mg l in phase v it was found that the lower hrt contributed to the incomplete oxidation of reduced sulfur in fes with the generation of some intermediates like polysulfides and sulfite wang et al 2022b as a result the production of effluent sulfate concentration was reduced xps peaks fig s2 also confirmed the existence of polysulfides sulfur disproportionation process was believed to produce polysulfides in the isad biofilter it was found that sad with polysulfides achieved high rate nitrogen removal qiu et al 2022 when treating real wastewater in phase vi the average sulfate production was 66 7 2 6 mg l at hrt of 1 h and influent nitrate concentration of 15 mg l the production of so4 2 is associated with the reduction of no3 according to the sad and pad processes eqs 1 3 the ratios of the stoichiometric so4 2 production mg l vs no3 n reduction mg l named as rs n should be 5 71 and 3 81 of the sad and pad respectively as shown in fig 3 b rs n was 5 42 when hrt was 12 h during the first phase which was much closer to sad it decreased to the lowest value of 4 95 when hrt was decreased to 3 h in phase iii then rs n increased when the hrt was further reduced to 2 h and 1 h s0 is the preferred electron donor over fes for the autotrophic sulfur oxidizing denitrifiers thus sad dominated in the system during the initial stage it explained the relatively higher rs n in the first phase however s0 was continuously consumed and the kinetics of pad was enhanced along with the operation period then pad developed its dominance in the system and rs n was decreased when hrt was reduced to 3 h the availability of s0 was lower due to its consumption in the first phase as a result the lowest rs n was shown in this phase when hrt was further reduced in phase iv and v the nitrate loading rate was increased accordingly under the cooperation of sob and ndfo s based and fe based autotrophic denitrification processes co contributed to the nitrate reduction in the system as a result rs n was increased again results also indicated hrt of 3 h may be the optimal condition for controlling the sulfate pollution from the perspective of engineering application the average total fe concentrations in the six phases in the effluent of isad biofilter are shown in fig 3 c the effluent total fe concentrations decreased along with the decrease of hrt the highest total fe concentration was 27 7 0 53 mg l in phase i at hrt of 12 h then it slightly decreased to 26 0 1 65 mg l when hrt was reduced to 6 h in phase ii as hrt was further reduced to 1 h at phase v the effluent total fe concentration decreased to 9 77 1 74 mg l two possible reasons caused the lower effluent total fe concentration at shorter hrts first shorter hrt of isad biofilter means that the reaction time of nitrate and fes was shorter resulting in less dissolution of fes it was found that the total fe concentration increased along with the reaction time in li s batch experiment li et al 2020b second more ferric hydr oxides were produced and precipitated on the fes surface with the decrease of hrt an increase of n loading ferric hydr oxides precipitates were found to be the main products in pad zhang et al 2019 however the production rate of ferric hydr oxides may be slower than the precipitation rate of ferric hydr oxides as a result the effluent total fe concentration became lower the lowest effluent total fe concentration of 2 60 0 20 was observed in phase vi when the real wastewater was treated the same hrt of 1 h was applied for phase v and phase vi but a much lower effluent total fe concentration was observed in phase vi it could be due to the much lower influent n and p concentrations in phase vi compared with those in phase v it was clear that less influent nitrate concentration resulted in less fes dissolution at the same reaction time a similar effluent total fe concentration 2 10 mg l was also observed in wang s study which investigated the nitrate removal in a fes2 based biofilter wang et al 2022b the low effluent total fe concentration of isad biofilter also confirmed its potential for practical application both total fe and sulfate concentrations decreased with the decrease in hrt it indicates that sulfur oxidation and iron oxidation processes could be synchronous these results demonstrated that nitrate removal was accomplished through the complicated pathways involving fe oxidation s cycle and dnra process 3 4 microbial community functional genes and metabolic pathways 3 4 1 microbial community constitution and abundance analysis fig 4 shows the relative abundances of microorganisms on the surface of packing material s0 fes collected from isad biofilter on day 281 and enriched biomass used as the inoculum on day 1 at the phylum level a class level b and genus level c as shown in fig 4 a the top three phylum of the two samples were proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes whose total relative abundances accounted for over 95 of each sample proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes accounted for 95 7 3 0 and 0 47 abundances in the raw sample respectively in the isad biofilter actinobacteria became the most dominant phylum accounting for 87 0 of the bacterial sequences proteobacteria second to actinobacteria accounting for 12 5 bacteroidetes was the lowest one of the three dominant phylum in isad biofilter only accounting for 0 36 although both proteobacteria and actinobacteria were found to be essential denitrifiers in soils palmer and horn 2012 sludge yi et al 2016 and wastewater liu et al 2021 their huge difference in relative abundances indicated that the microbial community structures of the two samples were significantly different heatmap fig 4 b shows the microbial community structure and similarities at the class level of the two samples 30 classes were identified in the raw and isad samples sordariomycetes 4 5 chitinophagia 4 4 rubrobacteria 4 3 and anaerolineae 4 2 were the predominant class in the raw sample anaerolineae was reported as a sulfur autotrophic denitrification class in xu s s0 based continuous up flowing reactor xu et al 2020a by contrast the predominant classes were chloroflexia 4 8 hydrogenophilalia 4 7 anaerolineae 4 7 and epsilonproteobacteria 4 2 in isad biofilter chloroflexia contains many denitrifying genera and exists in an autotrophic denitrification system promoted by fe2 quan et al 2020 the highest relative abundance of chloroflexia in isad biofilter indicates the possibility of fe2 in promoting nitrate removal meanwhile pu s study investigating nitrate removal in a pytite based autotrophic denitrification system found that epsilonproteobacteria was the most dominant denitrifier on the surface of pyrite after experiment pu et al 2014 the increase of epsilonproteobacteria in the isad biofilter compared with the raw sample indicated that its activity can be largely promoted with fes s0 as the electron donors our findings demonstrate that microorganisms enriched in the isad biofilter tended to form iron related functional communities when the electron donor was changed from thiosulfate to fes s0 relative abundances of the microbial community in the raw sample and isad biofilter at the genus level are presented in fig 4 c the top 20 genera of the two samples were chosen to discuss here when thiosulfate was the electron donor raw sample the dominant genera were castellaniella thiobacillus pseudomonas denitratisoma and thiomonas accounting for 27 0 13 4 10 7 7 0 and 6 6 respectively however the co presence of the two electron donors fes s0 mainly selected acinetobacter acidovorax pseudoxanthomonas variovorax and sphingopyxis with the relative abundances of 33 1 23 5 11 6 7 4 and 6 8 respectively in isad biofilter sob in raw sample such as castellaniella and thiobacillus lost their advantages in the isad biofilter although previous studies reported that thiobacillus was capable of utilizing iron compounds as electron donors for nitrate reduction bosch et al 2012 zhu et al 2019 the decreased abundance of thiobacillus observed in this study indicated that thiobacillus might be in a weak position when competing with other iron oxidizing denitrifiers besides it was found that fe2 concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 5 mm significantly inhibited thiobacillus in the s0 based autotrophic denitrification system pang and wang 2021 therefore the inhibition effects caused by high iron ions in the isad biofilter fig 3 b may contribute to the lower relative abundance of thiobacillus compared with sob dominance in the raw sample the predominant genera in isad biofilter have been characterized as the ndfo bacteria for example acinetobacter the most dominant genera in isad biofilter was increased from 0 03 to 33 1 after the 281 day operation it was also significantly enriched from less than 0 01 to 27 48 in wang s culturing media containing nitrate and fe ii wang et al 2022a meanwhile acinetobacter can tolerate high concentrations of fe ii up to 504 mg l wang et al 2022a therefore acinetobacter may be closely related to the ndfo process in the isad biofilter acidovorax belonging to the betaproteobacteria phylum took the second place in the isad biofilter several members of this genus such as acidovorax sp strain bofen1 acidovorax ebreus strain tpsy and acidovorax sp strain 2an have been characterized as the nitrate reducing fe ii oxidizer byrne bailey et al 2010 chakraborty et al 2011 pantke et al 2012 the direct enzymatic pathway and the indirect green dust mediated process were found to be the mechanism that acidovorax contributed to ndfo pantke et al 2012 since most ndfo strains require a carbon source or sustained fe ii oxidation for growth chakraborty et al 2011 the enrichment of acidovorax in isad biofilter may be benefitted from the fe2 fe3 cycle where fe2 oxidation and fe3 reduction continuously occurred in the system the dominance of iron oxidizing autotrophic denitrifiers such as acinetobacter and acidovorax induced by fe2 the product of fes dissolution could switch the metabolic model into iron based autotrophic denitrification from sulfur based denitrification in addition some dnra bacteria were also enriched in the isad biofilter hydrogenophaga a common dnra bacteria found in the biological denitrification system kutvonen et al 2015 rose from 1 04 to 2 26 in this study besides the relative abundance of stenotrophomonas rose from 3 69 to 5 16 in the isad biofilter a few strains of stenotrophomonas have been reported to participate in dnra process mergaert et al 2001 therefore hydrogenophaga and stenotrophomonas in the isad biofilter may be the key genera responsible for ammonia production in the system apart from these ndfo and dnra bacteria enriched in the isad biofilter the relative abundances of some functional microorganisms also exceeded 1 including pseudomonas 1 84 pseudoxanthomonas 11 6 and alicycliphilus 3 55 notably many stains of pseudomonas have been reported to remove nh4 n in simultaneous nitrification and denitrification systems xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 thus it may exert a key role in nh4 n removal when the influent n loading was continuously increased in the isad biofilter in addition the dominance of pseudoxanthomonas and alicycliphilus two s based denitrificans in the isad biofilter indicated their potential contributions to nitrate reduction cui et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 overall results indicated that ndfo dnra and sob jointly contributed to the superior nitrogen removal efficiency at high nitrate loads in the isad biofilter 3 4 2 functional genes related to n s and fe cycling in isad biofilter the functional genes associated with n cycling s cycling and fe cycling of the isad biofilter were annotated fig 5 a the essential genes responsible for complete denitrification including nitrate reduction narghi and napab nitrite reduction nirs and nirk nitric oxide reduction norb and norc and nitrous oxide reduction nosz were detected notably nosz gene was assumed to favor less n2o accumulation and emission in iron sulfur autotrophic denitrification systems wang et al 2019b meanwhile the isad biofilter had all of the necessary genes for the dnra process such as nirb nird and nrfa which participate in the reduction of nitrite to ammonia although nitrifiers such as pseudomonas were enriched in the isad biofilter key genes encoding nitrification were not detected in the system results showed that denitrification and dnra were the system s main n metabolic pathways which corresponds to the long term operation results described above because nitrate reduction was coupled with sulfur oxidation in the isad biofilter essential genes encoding three main sulfur metabolic pathways were found in the isad biofilter first there were five genes soxa soxx soxy soxz and soxb responsible for sulfur oxidation through the sox complex which was also the most common sulfur metabolic pathway found in sulfur based autotrophic denitrification systems li et al 2021 second all of the necessary genes associated with dissimilatory sulfate reduction and oxidation dsra dsrb apra aprb and sat were detected in this study the oxidation of s2 to so4 2 was the main sulfur metabolic pathway in the isad biofilter coupling with nitrate reduction the highest relative abundance of gene aprb encoding the oxidation of so3 2 to adenosylphosphosulfate aps suggested that the produced so3 2 can be completely oxidized according to the long term operation results there was indeed no so3 2 accumulation in the isad biofilter third several other s2 related metabolic pathways were found in the isad biofilter such as genes involved in the oxidation of s2 to sn 2 sqr and the reduction of sn 2 to s2 hydadg previous studies have reported that polysulfide induced by sulfur sulfate reduction could improve the bioavailability of sulfur thereby boosting the sulfur reduction and autotrophic denitrification rates liang et al 2016 qiu et al 2020 therefore this redox reversible pathway favoured the high nitrate removal rate in the isad biofilter besides the multiple sulfur metabolic pathways related to s2 oxidation found in this study also avoided the accumulation of hydrogen sulfide gas a common toxic by product produced in biological nitrate removal systems malhautier et al 2003 in addition to nitrogen and sulfur iron is also an essential element involved in the denitrification process in the isad biofilter three iron oxidation genes foxy ccon and cyc1 were found in the system these key genes drove the fe2 oxidation in the isad biofilter iron oxidation was reported to exert a crucial role in electron supply and transfer in autotrophic denitrification process fu et al 2014 ndfo bacteria such as acidovorax also dominated in the system these results illustrated that sulfur cycling and iron oxidation co accelerated the autotrophic denitrification rate in the isad biofilter however it was always overlooked in previous iron sulfur systems li et al 2020b zhu et al 2019 to further investigate the mechanism of the high nitrate removal rate in the isad biofilter a co occurrence network of functional microbial carrying critical genes related to the n s and fe metabolic pathways in the isad biofilter was constructed as shown in fig 5 b the top 50 genera of the raw sample and isad biofilter all harboured functional genes encoding one or more n s and fe pathways characterized in the study 39 genera gray node were enriched in the isad biofilter after the 281 d operation with only 11 genera purple node showing decreased relative abundances compared with the raw sample this indicates that functional microorganisms reformed a powerful cluster in the isad biofilter according to the new substrates provided in addition most genera 44 of 50 carried essential genes encoding three elements metabolic pathways simultaneously indicating that an active functional microbial community was formed in the isad biofilter for example acidovorax an important ndfo bacteria in isad biofilter harboured all the five pathways related to n cycling four pathways s1 s2 s6 and s7 associated with s cycling and fe ii oxidation results showed that acidovorax played a crucial role in nitrate reduction denitrification and dnra sulfate production and iron oxidation in the isad biofilter meanwhile pseudoxanthomonas the common sulfur based denitrifiers carried the genes for iron oxidation dnra and polysulfide production acinetobacter the most dominant genus in isad biofilter possessed genes coding n1 n5 and s7 pathways which indicated acinetobacter might also be responsible for dnra and polysulfide production moreover some genera showed relatively low abundances 1 in the isad biofilter but they harboured a lot of pathways of n s and fe cycling the most representative genera included hyphomicrobium 10 pathways polaromonas 12 pathways and bradyrhizobium 10 pathways they were also crucial for achieving high and stable nitrogen removal in the isad biofilter our results demonstrated that the multi pathway synergistic effects between fe and s based denitrifiers enhanced the nitrate removal in the isad biofilter 3 5 a concept model for superior nitrate and phosphate removal mechanism in isad biofilter based on the reactor performance and the corresponding microbial community and metabolism analysis the working mechanism of nitrate and phosphate removal by coupling sulfur and iron driven autotrophic denitrification in the isad biofilter is illustrated in fig 6 the h produced from the s0 based autotrophic denitrification process promoted the dissolution of fes which released fe2 and hs fe2 was then used by the ndfo bacteria such as acinetobacter and acidovorax to reduce nitrate fe3 produced from the oxidation of fe2 during the denitrification process was able to remove phosphate by precipitation the electron transition between microbial cells and iron oxide minerals for fe iii oxide reduction could be promoted by the electron shuttling compounds released from some function microorganisms such as geothrix zhou et al 2021 as a result there was a dynamic balance between fe2 and fe3 in the system simultaneously hs was utilized by the sob including pseudoxanthomonas and alicycliphilus for autotrophic denitrification and its denitrification rate was faster than s0 the lower sulfate yield of isad biofilter along with the decrease of hrt was ascribed to the generation of polysulfide as aforementioned the formation of polysulfide also accelerated the overall denitrification rate both sulfur oxidation and disproportionation coupled with nitrate reduction in isad biofilter some dnra bacteria hydrogenophaga and stenotrophomonas were responsible for reducing nitrate to ammonia through a dissimilation pathway enriched in isad biofilter but ammonia accumulation was effectively ameliorated when hrt was reduced function gene analysis indicated that collaborative denitrification communities simultaneously harbouring diverse metabolic pathways of n s and fe were formed in the isad biofilter when fes and s0 were used as co electron donors for autotrophic denitrifiers the multi pathways of n transformations involving fe oxidation s cycle and dnra resulted in the superior nitrate removal rate in the present study 4 conclusion isad biofilter achieved highly efficient nitrate and phosphate removal at low hrt when treating synthetic and real wastewater the highest nitrate removal rate was 960 mg l d and the phosphate removal efficiency was 100 at an hrt of 1 h with fes and s0 as the co electron donors at a 2 1 ratio for autotrophic denitrification a collaborative denitrification community that had diverse metabolic pathways of n s and fe were formed in the isad biofilter metagenomic analysis revealed that the superior n and p removal performance of the isad biofilter under high nitrate loads was ascribed to the multi pathway synergistic effects of the functional microbial communities involved in n s and fe cycling collectively the superior nitrate and phosphate removal performance and its mechanisms of nitrogen sulfur and iron cycling obtained in this study could provide important information for understanding the iron sulfilde autotrophic denitrification process and optimizing

15106,in a hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactor h2 mbfr the biofilm thickness is considered to be one of the most important factors for denitrification thick biofilms in mbfrs are known for low removal fluxes owing to their resistance to substrate transport in this study the h2 mbfr was operated under various loading rates of oxyanions such as no3 n so4 s and clo4 at an h2 flux of 1 06 e eq m2 d the experiment was initiated with no3 n so4 s and clo4 loadings of 0 464 0 026 and 0 211 e eq m2 d respectively at 20 c under the most stressful conditions the loading rates increased simultaneously to 1 911 0 869 and 0 108 e eq m2 d respectively at 10 c we observed improved performance in significantly thicker biofilms approximately 2 7 cm compared to previous studies using a denitrifying h2 mbfr for 120 days shock oxyanion loadings led to a decrease in total nitrogen tn removal by 20 to 30 but tn removal returned to 100 within a few days similarly complete denitrification was observed even at 10 c the protective function and microbial diversity of the thick biofilm may allow stable denitrification despite stress imposing conditions in the microbial community analysis heterotrophs were dominant and acetogens accounted for 11 of the biofilm metagenomic results showed a high abundance of functional genes involved in organic carbon metabolism and homoacetogenesis owing to the presence of organic compounds produced by acetogens and autotrophs heterotrophic denitrification may occur simultaneously with autotrophic denitrification as a result the total removal flux of oxyanions 1 84 e eq m2 d far exceeded the h2 flux 1 06 e eq m2 d thus the large accumulation of biofilms could contribute to good resilience and enhanced removal fluxes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane biofilm reactor denitrification performance resilience biofilm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction although water covers three quarters of the earth s surface only 0 5 of it is directly accessible for human use gude 2017 and on the other hand population and water demand are growing ercin and hoekstra 2014 furthermore approximately 80 of wastewater is discharged into the environment without proper treatment deteriorating groundwater quality chen et al 2020 and increasing threats to human health and a sustainable human society mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 among the leading challenges to groundwater quality is nitrate no3 which originates from fertilizers and discharges from septic tanks sewage and animal manure lockhart et al 2013 palaniappan et al 2010 due to its adverse effects on human health e g methemoglobinemia in infants and cancer risk nitrate concentrations in drinking water is regulated worldwide huno et al 2018 rivett et al 2008 nitrate contaminated water is most commonly treated by separation based methods such as reverse osmosis ion exchange and electrodialysis rezvani et al 2019 however these technologies have high operating costs and generate brines that present disposal problems bhatnagar et al 2010 della rocca et al 2007 in contrast biological denitrification converts nitrate to n2 gas and is considered more economical and environmentally desirable rezvani et al 2019 the hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactor h2 mbfr an emerging technology for biological denitrification martin et al 2012 nerenberg 2016 delivers hydrogen gas h2 as an electron donor via diffusion through the walls of microporous composite or non porous gas transfer membranes a denitrifying biofilm accumulates on the exterior surface of the membrane the advantages of mbfr include high specific surface area for biomass accumulation low energy consumption no need to add organic material and on demand delivery of the electron donor martin and nerenberg 2012 rittmann 2007 in particular h2 oxidizing bacteria can reduce all types of oxidized contaminants rittmann 2007 because most groundwater in addition to no3 contains other oxyanions such as nitrite no2 perchlorate clo4 and sulfate so4 2 zhao et al 2014 h2 mbfrs can be advantageous for simultaneous reduction in addition the mbfr is regarded as a competitive technology for full scale groundwater treatment rittmann et al 2004 because only stoichiometric amounts of h2 are consumed during no3 removal rittmann 2007 despite significant research in past on mbfr denitrification a crucial understanding of the biofilm characteristics remains veiled previous mbfr studies have shown that biofilm accumulation needs to be maintained within an optimal range nerenberg 2016 zhou et al 2019 a small amount of biofilm results in insufficiently rapid reaction kinetics on the other hand a large biofilm leads to excessive head loss without affecting the reaction kinetics and increases mass transfer resistance martin and nerenberg 2012 although controlling biofilm accumulation is important what constitutes optimal accumulation and how to obtain it is poorly defined for denitrifying h2 mbfrs lee and rittmann 2000 adopted the biofilm thickness of 179 μm whereas celemer et al 2008 observed thicknesses greater than 1500 μm furthermore the modeling studies suggested the optimal thickness as 120 μm martin et al 2013 or 650 μm jiang et al 2020 once a biofilm is established denitrification can be affected by electron acceptor loading and temperature the two factors that often vary in influent water song et al 2012 a sudden change in acceptor loading or the distribution among several acceptors can destabilize the performance mora et al 2003 and a sudden change in temperature can alter biochemical reaction rates zhou et al 2018 a large accumulation of biofilms can buffer the microbial community from disruptions yin et al 2019 but the resilience of biofilms has not been systematically investigated the composition of microbial community is also related to the denitrification performance the ecological base of microbial community in an mbfr is a group of h2 oxidizing autotrophs that utilize inorganic carbon mostly bicarbonate as their carbon source these autotrophs generate soluble microbial products smp which are organic compounds released from substrate metabolism and biomass decay azami et al 2012 and are organic electron donors that support heterotrophic bacteria since an mbfr biofilm always harbors heterotrophs that can contribute to reducing nitrate and other electron acceptors ontiveros valencia et al 2018 h2 will not be the sole electron donor in h2 mbfrs but the impact of organic donors has rarely been elucidated to investigate these important but poorly studied factors we evaluated the impact of mbfr denitrification on biofilm characteristics after long term operation with changes in operating conditions a thick biofilm of approximately 2 7 cm in diameter accumulated rapidly owing to the protective characteristics of the thick biofilm microorganisms in the biofilm seemed to adapt and resist stressful conditions in addition the thick biofilm enabled growth of acetogens that produced organic electron donors beyond the smp and heterotrophic denitrifiers may have contributed to the enhancement of electron acceptor removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of synthetic groundwater and inoculation table s1 presents the chemical composition of the feed water which is based on synthetic groundwater nerenberg et al 2002 depending on the operating conditions the nano3 concentration varied from 29 1 to 212 5 mg l corresponding to 4 8 to 35 mg n l the degree of contamination depends on local characteristics but can be as high as 70 mg n l obeidat et al 2007 therefore the nitrogen concentration in this study was within a reasonable range the ph of the prepared feedwater was set at 7 2 activated sludge from an anoxic tank at the jungnang wastewater treatment plant 37 33 29 9 n 127 03 54 9 e seoul south korea was used as the inoculum the activated sludge was diluted to 500 mg l suspended solids ss using the baseline composition of the synthetic groundwater prior to inoculating the h2 mbfr 2 2 laboratory scale experimental setup fig 1 shows the schematic representation of the h2 mbfr experimental setup a membrane module was placed inside a 288 ml acrylic housing 3 5 cm diameter 30 cm length the module contained 100 non porous polysulfone hollow fiber gas transfer membranes airlane cheongju si south korea the outer and inner diameters of the membranes were 400 μm and 260 μm respectively based on the method of tang et al 2012 the h2 permeability of the membrane was measured to be 9 75 10 7 m3 h2 m2 d which was used to calculate the h2 flux the feed water was prepared daily and fed using a peristatic pump cole parmer masterflex illinois united states at a specified constant flow rate and the effluent was collected for analysis water within the mbfr was recirculated at a flow rate of 800 ml min using a gear pump cole parmer masterflex illinois united states to mix the liquid in the reactor the recirculation flow rate was measured using a ball flow meter dwyer michigan township united states the temperature of the reactor was maintained at a specified value by circulating water from a thermo controlled water bath through the outer jacket of the reactor the pressure of the h2 gas delivered from a cylinder of pure h2 sinyang oxygen seoul south korea was controlled by a regulator and monitored by pressure gauges at the inlet and outlet of the membrane modules inoculation was carried out in batches whereas long term operation was performed with continuous flow 2 3 chemical analyses the effluent was filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter advantec tokyo japan before measurement of no3 n so4 s and clo4 concentrations no3 n concentrations were measured using a spectrometer hach dr 5000 colorado united states following the manufacturer s instructions so4 s and clo4

flow rate dissolved oxygen o2 was assumed to be saturated approximately 8 mg l and the effluent was assumed to contain no o2 because of its complete reduction in mbfr tang et al 2012 2 4 calculations

initiate biofilm accumulation on the membrane s outer surface we recirculated the medium with the inoculum 500 mg ss l at a flow rate of 0 8 l min for 5 days under this flow condition the bulk biomass recirculated through the reactor without sedimentation h2 was supplied to the membrane lumen at an absolute pressure of 1 02 bar the h2 pressure was determined by a preliminary test in which the biomass was well attached to the membrane surfaces during this phase the no3 n concentration was maintained at 70 100 mg n l by supplementing it with nitrate as it was reduced by denitrification after the 5 day acclimation and biofilm accumulation period we removed the suspended biomass by flushing the mbfr with the feed medium 2 5 2 long term experiment continuous flow mode after inoculation the denitrification performance was stabilized for approximately 30 days to keep it close to 100 during this period the ph of the effluent was 9 5 presumably due to denitrification which raises ph rust et al 2000 although this value was high in the optimum ph range for denitrification albina et al 2019 no specific measures were taken because almost complete nitrogen removal was achieved after stabilization we evaluated the influence of the oxyanion loading rate and feed temperature on denitrification table 1 summarizes the operating conditions of the four phases the effect of shock loading was investigated by increasing the loading rate either individually or simultaneously for each oxyanion the loading rates ranged from mild to high loads exceeding the h2 flux in addition the biofilm was exposed from 20 c to 10 c to evaluate the effect of low temperatures phase 1 evaluated the influence on denitrification of the loading rates of oxyanions no3 n clo4 and so4 s in sub phases 1 1 to 1 3 the loading rates of no3 n and clo4 increased up to 0 813 and 0 052 e eq m2 d respectively with increasing influent concentrations during sub phase 1 4 the so4 s loading rate increased stepwise from 0 198 to 0 816 e eq m2 d by decreasing the hydraulic retention time hrt whereas the loading rates of no3 n and clo4 remained constant by decreasing their influent concentrations during phase 2 the temperature was decreased in a stepwise manner from 20 c to 10 c keeping the oxyanion loadings the same as in phase 1 1 during phase 3 the loading rates of all the oxyanions simultaneously increased while maintaining a constant temperature of 10 c finally phase 4 tested the performance consistency by returning to the initial condition i e phase 1 1 all phase changes occurred after the denitrification efficiency had reached a steady state 2 6 biofilm sampling and microbial analysis microbial community analysis was performed using seed sludge and biofilm samples collected at the end of the reactor operation from the seed sludge 2 ml of biomass samples were collected biomass samples were then harvested by centrifugation at 13 000 x g for 10 min in the case of the biofilm sample after dismantling the reactor at the end of phase 4 the membrane module with the biofilm was immersed in liquid nitrogen community dna was extracted directly from the two samples using the dneasy powersoil pro kit qiagen solana beach ca usa following the manufacturer s protocol the extracted dna was quantified using a nanodrop nd 1000 instrument nanodrop technologies delaware united states and stored at 80 c until use to analyze the microbial community structures in the biomass samples v4 region 515f 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnvgggtwtcta at 3 of 16s rrna gene based paired end sequencing 2 151 bp was conducted using the illumina hiseq platform illumina san diego usa at macrogen seoul south korea retrieved sequences were analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology 2 qiime 2 software bolyen et al 2019 following previously described methods lee et al 2022 briefly raw sequences with low quality scores were filtered out using trimmomatic v0 39 bolger et al 2014 with the following parameters leading 3 trailing 3 minlen 36 and slidingwindow 4 15 the q2 vsearch algorithm was used to merge the paired end sequences using the deblur algorithm the read pairs were denoised and dereplicated and chimeric sequences were removed from the dataset amplicon sequence variants asvs were extracted from the dereplicated sequence dataset representative 16s rrna gene sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups using the qiime2 naive bayes classifier trained on 99 operational taxonomic units asvs taxonomic assignment was performed using the silva rrna database v138 quast et al 2012 furthermore the genomic dna of the biofilm was used for metagenomic analysis to explore microbial functionality the detailed methods are described in the supplementary material photographs of the biofilm were taken with a camera built into a mobile phone samsung galaxy s10 and used to estimate the dimensions of the biofilm cross section using imagej software wayne rasband national institutes of health united states 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal patterns of multiple electron acceptor according to phases fig 2 shows membrane loading rates and removal percentages through all operating phases a thick dotted line separates each phase and a thin dotted line divides the sections within a phase although not shown in the fig 2 the h2 flux was kept at 1 06 e eq m2 d calculated according to a previous study tang et al 2012 by maintaining the h2 pressure at 1 7 bar during phase 1 the no3 n and so4 s loading rates influenced denitrification in phase 1 1 no3 and total nitrogen tn removal was almost 100 on day 10 start of phase 1 2 having higher no3 n loading the no3 n removal flux failed to match the increased loading resulting in a decrease in tn removal from 99 to 75 however denitrification increased over a few days and returned to 100 by day 20 phase 1 3 involved a small increase in clo4 loading which had no impact on denitrification or clo4 removal phase 1 4 showed stepwise increase in the so4 s loading the first three increase had no impact on denitrification the 32 decrease in denitrification on day 41 was due to malfunction of the recirculation pump the system then recovered to its original status after tubing replacement on day 53 the so4 s loading rate increased to its highest value of 0 87 e eq m2 d although the removal flux of no3 n remained stable tn removal decreased by 10 because of the accumulation of no2 n lower temperature during phase 2 did not upset the long term denitrification performance on day 70 the temperature decreased from 20 c to 17 c phase 2 2 and tn removal decreased from 99 to 76 but recovered rapidly interestingly the tn removal remained stable at 99 despite further reduction to 15 c phase 2 3 and 10 c phase 2 4 respectively phase 3 imposed the most stressful conditions an extreme limit test by increasing the surface loading rate of all oxyanions while maintaining the temperature at 10 c in phase 3 2 when the no3 n loading rate alone exceeded the maximum h2 flux by 50 i e 2 e eq m2 d tn removal decreased to 40 although it gradually increased to 80 in phase 4 the operating conditions of phase 1 1 were restored compared with phase 1 1 removal of so4 s and clo4 was greater in phase 4 probably owing to the accumulation of more biofilm during phases 1 2 and 3 figure s3 shows the changes in biofilm appearance over time at the beginning of operation the biofilm was accompanied by individual flocs that were loosely attached to it over time the biofilm itself thickened and became a biomass clump overall the deterioration and recovery of oxyanion removal occurred in a similar pattern in phases 1 2 1 4 2 2 and 3 2 this similarity is based on their reduction through the oxidation of a common electron donor h2 and interactions among the electron acceptors have been studied previously zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 zhao et al 2011 ziv el and rittmann 2009 previous studies have reported that electron donor competition affects the mutual removal flux between the electron acceptors however under our experimental conditions loading of the other oxyanions had little effect on the denitrification efficiency which was significantly reduced by a high no3 n shock loading but recovered in a few days fig 3 compares e eq removal fluxes e eq m2 d for all electron acceptors of all phases the oxyanion loadings were fluctuated by changes in concentration and hrt for each phase the maximum h2 flux had the same value throughout which is 1 06 e eq m2 d black circles until phase 3 1 the maximum e eq flux was greater than the sum of removal fluxes however in phase 3 2 the total removal flux 1 84 e eq m2 d was 74 greater than the maximum h2 flux this result suggests that denitrification did not completely recover because of the electron limitation nonetheless it is driven by electron donors other than h2 for example oxidation of organic substrates or biomass resulting in excessive electron consumption zhao et al 2011 observed similar results where the removal flux of oxyanions 0 234 e eq m2 d exceeded the h2 flux 0 21 e eq m2 d when h2 was limited they suggested that these results may be caused by facultative denitrifiers using organic microbial products therefore the microbial community and functionality of the biofilm were further investigated and the results are discussed in section 3 3 3 2 resilience of denitrification although a decrease in denitrification performance was observed several times during the long term operation the system showed rapid recovery fig 4 illustrates that denitrification was resilient in the face of stress as tn removal recovered to nearly 100 within a few days after each stress condition was imposed the graphs in fig 4 are separately extracted sections in fig 2 where denitrification performance is degraded in all graphs day 2 corresponds to the time when environmental changes such as shock loadings pump malfunctions and temperature decrease occurred a two fold increase in the no3 n loading rate fig 4 a led to a decline in tn removal to 75 but tn removal completely recovered in only six days a smaller decrease and faster recovery occurred with an increase in the so4 s loading failure of the recirculation pump fig 4 b showed that only 3 days were required for recovery decreasing the temperature fig 4 c led to a response similar to that of doubling the no3 n loading remarkably a smaller decrease and faster recovery trend was observed with decreasing temperature as a result tn removal was stable at approximately 100 even when the temperature was lowered to 10 c in the extreme limit condition fig 4 d the performance did not fully recover but a clear recovery trend occurred over approximately 15 d previous studies on biological water treatment processes other than mbfr systems have addressed the relevance of resilience contributing to reliable system operation sukias et al 2018 suggested a method to quantify resilience in wetland denitrifying bioreactors and santillan et al 2020 tested the effect of organic loading on nitrifying performance in the activated sludge process the favorable resilience of h2 mbfrs for denitrification observed in this study might be attributed to its physical thickness which is discussed in section 3 4 3 3 characteristics of microbial community in biofilms to compare the representative metabolic functions related to the genera observed in the seed sludge and biofilm microbial taxa were divided into 12 functional clusters fig 5 based on previously reported functional characteristics tables s2 and s3 based on the analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences microorganisms with a relative abundance ra greater than 0 5 at the genus level were used for taxonomic breakdown most microorganisms in the seed sludge belong to the heterotrophic denitrifying group and account for 51 3 of the microbial population bowman 2014 fu et al 2020 han et al 2019 mcilroy and nielsen 2014 oh et al 2019 rosenberg et al 2014 saddler and bradbury 2001 teixeira and merquior 2014 wang et al 2019 willems 2014 among denitrifiers bacteria in the family rhodocyclaceae and genus dechloromonas are known to perform perchlorate reduction han et al 2019 oren 2014 for the rest the group containing both heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifiers accounted for 7 7 of the microbial community leonardo et al 2014 on and zhang 2014 oren 2014 and nitrifying bacteria accounted for 9 0 baskaran et al 2020 cai et al 2020 daims 2014 kämpfer 2011 willems 2014 xuemei and zhang 2014 these results suggest that the metabolism of the seed sludge population might be mainly involved in heterotrophic nitrogen removal on the other hand microorganisms in the biofilm were divided into more diverse groups the denitrifying group in the biofilm contained 63 4 of all 16s rrna sequences bernardet and bowman 2015 han et al 2019 mao et al 2014 mohapatra et al 2018 oren 2014 orlygsson and kristjansson 2014 pujalte et al 2014 schleifer 2009 willems 2014 willems and gillis 2015 sulfur related microorganisms accounted for 12 1 of the 16s rrna sequences except for thiobacterales which performs sulfur oxidation these microorganisms are responsible for sulfur compound reduction galushko and kuever 2015 mustapha et al 2020 smii et al 2015 stackebrandt 2014 interestingly 11 0 of the sequences contained acidogenic bacteria known to produce acetate propionate and formate daniel r brown et al 2010 liechty et al 2020 norris et al 2015 ontiveros valencia et al 2013 ueki et al 2006 compared with the seed sludge the biofilm showed a lower abundance of heterotrophs fig 5 this was probably because h2 and hco3 were exogenously supplied as electron donors and carbon sources respectively nevertheless many microorganisms in biofilms still contain heterotrophs or mixotrophs their organic substrates could have come from three sources the first possible sources are natural biopolymers produced by all microorganisms smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps ontiveros valencia et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 explained that h2 oxidizing bacteria produce smp which encourages the growth of smp oxidizing bacteria in the mbfr ontiveros valencia et al 2018 reported that when h2 was severely restricted heterotrophic denitrifiers became dominant in an mbfr merkey et al 2009 modeled the growth of heterotrophs in the mbfr based on their utilization of the smp generated by h2 oxidizing autotrophs second readily biodegradable substrates such acetate might have been produced by h2 oxidizing acetogens in particular the order thermoanaerobacterales and genus treponema include homo acetogenic bacteria that synthesize acetate autotrophically from h2 and co2 2co2 4h2 ch3cooh 2h2o norris et al 2015 third the biofilm s active biomass could have been the electron donor via endogenous respiration ezechi et al 2015 to provide metagenomic evidence of oxyanion reduction by heterotrophs together with autotrophs the functionality of the microbial community in the biofilm was analyzed focusing on h2 oxidation oxyanion reduction organic carbon metabolism and homoacetogenesis fig 6 although there were differences in gene abundance target genes were observed in all pathways of interest the results revealed that oxyanions could be reduced through h2 oxidation by autotrophs but also by heterotrophs using organic substrates additionally the presence of genes involved in organic carbon metabolism indicated the possibility of using macromolecular organic matter such as smp eps or decayed biomass in particular genes in all pathways of homoacetogenesis might have resulted in acetate production by homoacetogens the metagenomic results supported that oxyanions could be reduced by heterotrophs as well as autotrophs thus the biofilm community structure and the fact that the electron equivalent flux was larger than the maximum h2 delivery flux fig 3 support that h2 was not the sole electron donor in the h2 mbfr particularly in phase 3 2 which had a very high electron acceptor loading of over 15 days because h2 was the only exogenous electron donor the long term operation of the h2 mbfr with an electron equivalent flux larger than the maximum h2 flux would not have been possible nevertheless the large accumulation of biofilm and enrichment of acetogens could lead to the short term generation of significant endogenous electron donors and a substantial population of heterotrophs were probably able to utilize the organic donors 3 4 implication of a physically thick biofilm table 2 compares the biofilm thickness reported in the literature to the values we measured at the end of our experiments in other studies biofilm thicknesses ranged from hundreds to thousands of micrometers in mbfr experiments on the other hand the cross section of our biofilm was elliptical with major and minor axes of 3 8 cm and 1 9 cm respectively figure s4 the major axis exceeded the inner diameter of the reactor 3 5 cm because the biofilm was deformed into an elliptical shape when the module was placed on the plate when the cross sectional area was converted to a circle the diameter was approximately 2 7 cm this physical thickness was approximated through cross sectional photographs but this value in centimeters was 10 to 100 fold greater than those found in other studies listed in table 2 table 3 compares the maximum nitrate removal fluxes normalized by h2 pressure for a range of denitrifying h2 mbfr studies including our study the reason for presenting normalized removal fluxes was to exclude the effect of the h2 pressure except for the study by terada et al al 2006 with 4 4 g n m2 d bar the normalized nitrate removal flux in our study was relatively high 2 7 g n m2 d bar although detailed operating conditions were different in each study this indicates that our physically thick biofilm did not affect denitrification performance thick biofilms are known to provide lower removal fluxes because they act as barriers for substrate diffusion celmer et al celmer et al 2008 found a lower denitrification performance in thick biofilms which they assumed was due to the higher eps content in thick biofilms impeding substrate diffusion instead in this study the thick biofilm might contribute to the resilience of the biofilm to stressful conditions due to its microbial diversity to the best of our knowledge there have been no previous studies on microbial diversity or resilience due to thick biofilms in mbfrs however microbial metabolic diversity is known to render biofilms resilient to environmental disturbances feng et al 2017 philippot et al 2021 a thick biofilm provides reserve biomass that can be activated when metabolic activity is slowed down in normally most active zone yin et al 2019 furthermore an increase in biofilm thickness creates new ecological niches yuan et al 2021 that can harbor h2 oxidizing acetogens slow growing sulfate reducers and heterotrophs that utilize smp eps or biomass as electron donors donlan 2002 merkey et al 2009 therefore a thick biofilm may enable microorganisms to resist environmental changes such as shock loads and low temperatures and provide the biofilm with endogenous electron donors further quantitative studies are needed to support these key findings in other words it is necessary to verify the relationship between biofilm growth profiles and resilience nevertheless these results are expected to provide new implications in that thick biofilms in h2 mbfrs may enable their resilient operation contrary to previous reports 4 conclusions a h2 mbfr active in denitrification developed an especially thick biofilm with an approximate diameter of 2 7 cm under stable operating conditions the biofilm was able to achieve nearly 100 denitrification and tn removal with a high no3 n removal flux up to 1 8 e eq n m2 d more

15106,in a hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactor h2 mbfr the biofilm thickness is considered to be one of the most important factors for denitrification thick biofilms in mbfrs are known for low removal fluxes owing to their resistance to substrate transport in this study the h2 mbfr was operated under various loading rates of oxyanions such as no3 n so4 s and clo4 at an h2 flux of 1 06 e eq m2 d the experiment was initiated with no3 n so4 s and clo4 loadings of 0 464 0 026 and 0 211 e eq m2 d respectively at 20 c under the most stressful conditions the loading rates increased simultaneously to 1 911 0 869 and 0 108 e eq m2 d respectively at 10 c we observed improved performance in significantly thicker biofilms approximately 2 7 cm compared to previous studies using a denitrifying h2 mbfr for 120 days shock oxyanion loadings led to a decrease in total nitrogen tn removal by 20 to 30 but tn removal returned to 100 within a few days similarly complete denitrification was observed even at 10 c the protective function and microbial diversity of the thick biofilm may allow stable denitrification despite stress imposing conditions in the microbial community analysis heterotrophs were dominant and acetogens accounted for 11 of the biofilm metagenomic results showed a high abundance of functional genes involved in organic carbon metabolism and homoacetogenesis owing to the presence of organic compounds produced by acetogens and autotrophs heterotrophic denitrification may occur simultaneously with autotrophic denitrification as a result the total removal flux of oxyanions 1 84 e eq m2 d far exceeded the h2 flux 1 06 e eq m2 d thus the large accumulation of biofilms could contribute to good resilience and enhanced removal fluxes graphical abstract

three quarters of the earth s surface only 0 5 of it is directly accessible for human use gude 2017 and on the other hand population and water demand are growing ercin and hoekstra 2014 furthermore approximately 80 of wastewater is discharged into the environment without proper treatment deteriorating groundwater quality chen et al 2020 and increasing threats to human health and a sustainable human society mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 among the leading challenges to groundwater quality is nitrate no3 which originates from fertilizers and discharges from septic tanks sewage and animal manure lockhart et al 2013 palaniappan et al 2010 due to its adverse effects on human health e g methemoglobinemia in infants and cancer risk nitrate concentrations in drinking water is regulated worldwide huno et al 2018 rivett et al 2008 nitrate contaminated water is most commonly treated by separation based methods such as reverse osmosis ion exchange and electrodialysis rezvani et al 2019 however these technologies have high operating costs and generate brines that present disposal problems bhatnagar et al 2010 della rocca et al 2007 in contrast biological denitrification converts nitrate to n2 gas and is considered more economical and environmentally desirable rezvani et al 2019 the hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactor h2 mbfr an emerging technology for biological denitrification martin et al 2012 nerenberg 2016 delivers hydrogen gas h2 as an electron donor via diffusion through the walls of microporous composite or non porous gas transfer membranes a denitrifying biofilm accumulates on the exterior surface of the membrane the advantages of mbfr include high specific surface area for biomass accumulation low energy consumption no need to add organic material and on demand delivery of the electron donor martin and nerenberg 2012 rittmann 2007 in particular h2 oxidizing bacteria can reduce all types of oxidized contaminants rittmann 2007 because most groundwater in addition to no3 contains other oxyanions such as nitrite no2 perchlorate clo4 and sulfate so4 2 zhao et al 2014 h2 mbfrs can be advantageous for simultaneous reduction in addition the mbfr is regarded as a competitive technology for full scale groundwater treatment rittmann et al 2004 because only stoichiometric amounts of h2 are consumed during no3 removal rittmann 2007 despite significant research in past on mbfr denitrification a crucial understanding of the biofilm characteristics remains veiled previous mbfr studies have shown that biofilm accumulation needs to be maintained within an optimal range nerenberg 2016 zhou et al 2019 a small amount of biofilm results in insufficiently rapid reaction kinetics on the other hand a large biofilm leads to excessive head loss without affecting the reaction kinetics and increases mass transfer resistance martin and nerenberg 2012 although controlling biofilm accumulation is important what constitutes optimal accumulation and how to obtain it is poorly defined for denitrifying h2 mbfrs lee and rittmann 2000 adopted the biofilm thickness of 179 μm whereas celemer et al 2008 observed thicknesses greater than 1500 μm furthermore the modeling studies suggested the optimal thickness as 120 μm martin et al 2013 or 650 μm jiang et al 2020 once a biofilm is established denitrification can be affected by electron acceptor loading and temperature the two factors that often vary in influent water song et al 2012 a sudden change in acceptor loading or the distribution among several acceptors can destabilize the performance mora et al 2003 and a sudden change in temperature can alter biochemical reaction rates zhou et al 2018 a large accumulation of biofilms can buffer the microbial community from disruptions yin et al 2019 but the resilience of biofilms has not been systematically investigated the composition of microbial community is also related to the denitrification performance the ecological base of microbial community in an mbfr is a group of h2 oxidizing autotrophs that utilize inorganic carbon mostly bicarbonate as their carbon source these autotrophs generate soluble microbial products smp which are organic compounds released from substrate metabolism and biomass decay azami et al 2012 and are organic electron donors that support heterotrophic bacteria since an mbfr biofilm always harbors heterotrophs that can contribute to reducing nitrate and other electron acceptors ontiveros valencia et al 2018 h2 will not be the sole electron donor in h2 mbfrs but the impact of organic donors has rarely been elucidated to investigate these important but poorly studied factors we evaluated the impact of mbfr denitrification on biofilm characteristics after long term operation with changes in operating conditions a thick biofilm of approximately 2 7 cm in diameter accumulated rapidly owing to the protective characteristics of the thick biofilm microorganisms in the biofilm seemed to adapt and resist stressful conditions in addition the thick biofilm enabled growth of acetogens that produced organic electron donors beyond the smp and heterotrophic denitrifiers may have contributed to the enhancement of electron acceptor removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of synthetic groundwater and inoculation table s1 presents the chemical composition of the feed water which is based on synthetic groundwater nerenberg et al 2002 depending on the operating conditions the nano3 concentration varied from 29 1 to 212 5 mg l corresponding to 4 8 to 35 mg n l the degree of contamination depends on local characteristics but can be as high as 70 mg n l obeidat et al 2007 therefore the nitrogen concentration in this study was within a reasonable range the ph of the prepared feedwater was set at 7 2 activated sludge from an anoxic tank at the jungnang wastewater treatment plant 37 33 29 9 n 127 03 54 9 e seoul south korea was used as the inoculum the activated sludge was diluted to 500 mg l suspended solids ss using the baseline composition of the synthetic groundwater prior to inoculating the h2 mbfr 2 2 laboratory scale experimental setup fig 1 shows the schematic representation of the h2 mbfr experimental setup a membrane module was placed inside a 288 ml acrylic housing 3 5 cm diameter 30 cm length the module contained 100 non porous polysulfone hollow fiber gas transfer membranes airlane cheongju si south korea the outer and inner diameters of the membranes were 400 μm and 260 μm respectively based on the method of tang et al 2012 the h2 permeability of the membrane was measured to be 9 75 10 7 m3 h2 m2 d which was used to calculate the h2 flux the feed water was prepared daily and fed using a peristatic pump cole parmer masterflex illinois united states at a specified constant flow rate and the effluent was collected for analysis water within the mbfr was recirculated at a flow rate of 800 ml min using a gear pump cole parmer masterflex illinois united states to mix the liquid in the reactor the recirculation flow rate was measured using a ball flow meter dwyer michigan township united states the temperature of the reactor was maintained at a specified value by circulating water from a thermo controlled water bath through the outer jacket of the reactor the pressure of the h2 gas delivered from a cylinder of pure h2 sinyang oxygen seoul south korea was controlled by a regulator and monitored by pressure gauges at the inlet and outlet of the membrane modules inoculation was carried out in batches whereas long term operation was performed with continuous flow 2 3 chemical analyses the effluent was filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter advantec tokyo japan before measurement of no3 n so4 s and clo4 concentrations no3 n concentrations were measured using a spectrometer hach dr 5000 colorado united states following the manufacturer s instructions so4 s and clo4 were assayed by ion chromatography thermo scientific dionex ics 1100 waltham united states equipped with an as ag 16 column dionex ionpac a 22 mm naoh solution was used as the eluent at a 1 0 ml min flow rate dissolved oxygen o2 was assumed to be saturated approximately 8 mg l and the effluent was assumed to contain no o2 because of its complete reduction in mbfr tang et al 2012 2 4 calculations

initiate biofilm accumulation on the membrane s outer surface we recirculated the medium with the inoculum 500 mg ss l at a flow rate of 0 8 l min for 5 days under this flow condition the bulk biomass recirculated through the reactor without sedimentation h2 was supplied to the membrane lumen at an absolute pressure of 1 02 bar the h2 pressure was determined by a preliminary test in which the biomass was well attached to the membrane surfaces during this phase the no3 n concentration was maintained at 70 100 mg n l by supplementing it with nitrate as it was reduced by denitrification after the 5 day acclimation and biofilm accumulation period we removed the suspended biomass by flushing the mbfr with the feed medium 2 5 2 long term experiment continuous flow mode after inoculation the denitrification performance was stabilized for approximately 30 days to keep it close to 100 during this period the ph of the effluent was 9 5 presumably due to denitrification which raises ph rust et al 2000 although this value was high in the optimum ph range for denitrification albina et al 2019 no specific measures were taken because almost complete nitrogen removal was achieved after stabilization we evaluated the influence of the oxyanion loading rate and feed temperature on denitrification table 1 summarizes the operating conditions of the four phases the effect of shock loading was investigated by increasing the loading rate either individually or simultaneously for each oxyanion the loading rates ranged from mild to high loads exceeding the h2 flux in addition the biofilm was exposed from 20 c to 10 c to evaluate the effect of low temperatures phase 1 evaluated the influence on denitrification of the loading rates of oxyanions no3 n clo4 and so4 s in sub phases 1 1 to 1 3 the loading rates of no3 n and clo4 increased up to 0 813 and 0 052 e eq m2 d respectively with increasing influent concentrations during sub phase 1 4 the so4 s loading rate increased stepwise from 0 198 to 0 816 e eq m2 d by decreasing the hydraulic retention time hrt whereas the loading rates of no3 n and clo4 remained constant by decreasing their influent concentrations during phase 2 the temperature was decreased in a stepwise manner from 20 c to 10 c keeping the oxyanion loadings the same as in phase 1 1 during phase 3 the loading rates of all the oxyanions simultaneously increased while maintaining a constant temperature of 10 c finally phase 4 tested the performance consistency by returning to the initial condition i e phase 1 1 all phase changes occurred after the denitrification efficiency had reached a steady state 2 6 biofilm sampling and microbial analysis microbial community analysis was performed using seed sludge and biofilm samples collected at the end of the reactor operation from the seed sludge 2 ml of biomass samples were collected biomass samples were then harvested by centrifugation at 13 000 x g for 10 min in the case of the biofilm sample after dismantling the reactor at the end of phase 4 the membrane module with the biofilm was immersed in liquid nitrogen community dna was extracted directly from the two samples using the dneasy powersoil pro kit qiagen solana beach ca usa following the manufacturer s protocol the extracted dna was quantified using a nanodrop nd 1000 instrument nanodrop technologies delaware united states and stored at 80 c until use to analyze the microbial community structures in the biomass samples v4 region 515f 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnvgggtwtcta at 3 of 16s rrna gene based paired end sequencing 2 151 bp was conducted using the illumina hiseq platform illumina san diego usa at macrogen seoul south korea retrieved sequences were analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology 2 qiime 2 software bolyen et al 2019 following previously described methods lee et al 2022 briefly raw sequences with low quality scores were filtered out using trimmomatic v0 39 bolger et al 2014 with the following parameters leading 3 trailing 3 minlen 36 and slidingwindow 4 15 the q2 vsearch algorithm was used to merge the paired end sequences using the deblur algorithm the read pairs were denoised and dereplicated and chimeric sequences were removed from the dataset amplicon sequence variants asvs were extracted from the dereplicated sequence dataset representative 16s rrna gene sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups using the qiime2 naive bayes classifier trained on 99 operational taxonomic units asvs taxonomic assignment was performed using the silva rrna database v138 quast et al 2012 furthermore the genomic dna of the biofilm was used for metagenomic analysis to explore microbial functionality the detailed methods are described in the supplementary material photographs of the biofilm were taken with a camera built into a mobile phone samsung galaxy s10 and used to estimate the dimensions of the biofilm cross section using imagej software wayne rasband national institutes of health united states 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal patterns of multiple electron acceptor according to phases fig 2 shows membrane loading rates and removal percentages through all operating phases a thick dotted line separates each phase and a thin dotted line divides the sections within a phase although not shown in the fig 2 the h2 flux was kept at 1 06 e eq m2 d calculated according to a previous study tang et al 2012 by maintaining the h2 pressure at 1 7 bar during phase 1 the no3 n and so4 s loading rates influenced denitrification in phase 1 1 no3 and total nitrogen tn removal was almost 100 on day 10 start of phase 1 2 having higher no3 n loading the no3 n removal flux failed to match the increased loading resulting in a decrease in tn removal from 99 to 75 however denitrification increased over a few days and returned to 100 by day 20 phase 1 3 involved a small increase in clo4 loading which had no impact on denitrification or clo4 removal phase 1 4 showed stepwise increase in the so4 s loading the first three increase had no impact on denitrification the 32 decrease in denitrification on day 41 was due to malfunction of the recirculation pump the system then recovered to its original status after tubing replacement on day 53 the so4 s loading rate increased to its highest value of 0 87 e eq m2 d although the removal flux of no3 n remained stable tn removal decreased by 10 because of the accumulation of no2 n lower temperature during phase 2 did not upset the long term denitrification performance on day 70 the temperature decreased from 20 c to 17 c phase 2 2 and tn removal decreased from 99 to 76 but recovered rapidly interestingly the tn removal remained stable at 99 despite further reduction to 15 c phase 2 3 and 10 c phase 2 4 respectively phase 3 imposed the most stressful conditions an extreme limit test by increasing the surface loading rate of all oxyanions while maintaining the temperature at 10 c in phase 3 2 when the no3 n loading rate alone exceeded the maximum h2 flux by 50 i e 2 e eq m2 d tn removal decreased to 40 although it gradually increased to 80 in phase 4 the operating conditions of phase 1 1 were restored compared with phase 1 1 removal of so4 s and clo4 was greater in phase 4 probably owing to the accumulation of more biofilm during phases 1 2 and 3 figure s3 shows the changes in biofilm appearance over time at the beginning of operation the biofilm was accompanied by individual flocs that were loosely attached to it over time the biofilm itself thickened and became a biomass clump overall the deterioration and recovery of oxyanion removal occurred in a similar pattern in phases 1 2 1 4 2 2 and 3 2 this similarity is based on their reduction through the oxidation of a common electron donor h2 and interactions among the electron acceptors have been studied previously zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 zhao et al 2011 ziv el and rittmann 2009 previous studies have reported that electron donor competition affects the mutual removal flux between the electron acceptors however under our experimental conditions loading of the other oxyanions had little effect on the denitrification efficiency which was significantly reduced by a high no3 n shock loading but recovered in a few days fig 3 compares e eq removal fluxes e eq m2 d for all electron acceptors of all phases the oxyanion loadings were fluctuated by changes in concentration and hrt for each phase the maximum h2 flux had the same value throughout which is 1 06 e eq m2 d black circles until phase 3 1 the maximum e eq flux was greater than the sum of removal fluxes however in phase 3 2 the total removal flux 1 84 e eq m2 d was 74 greater than the maximum h2 flux this result suggests that denitrification did not completely recover because of the electron limitation nonetheless it is driven by electron donors other than h2 for example oxidation of organic substrates or biomass resulting in excessive electron consumption zhao et al 2011 observed similar results where the removal flux of oxyanions 0 234 e eq m2 d exceeded the h2 flux 0 21 e eq m2 d when h2 was limited they suggested that these results may be caused by facultative denitrifiers using organic microbial products therefore the microbial community and functionality of the biofilm were further investigated and the results are discussed in section 3 3 3 2 resilience of denitrification although a decrease in denitrification performance was observed several times during the long term operation the system showed rapid recovery fig 4 illustrates that denitrification was resilient in the face of stress as tn removal recovered to nearly 100 within a few days after each stress condition was imposed the graphs in fig 4 are separately extracted sections in fig 2 where denitrification performance is degraded in all graphs day 2 corresponds to the time when environmental changes such as shock loadings pump malfunctions and temperature decrease occurred a two fold increase in the no3 n loading rate fig 4 a led to a decline in tn removal to 75 but tn removal completely recovered in only six days a smaller decrease and faster recovery occurred with an increase in the so4 s loading failure of the recirculation pump fig 4 b showed that only 3 days were required for recovery decreasing the temperature fig 4 c led to a response similar to that of doubling the no3 n loading remarkably a smaller decrease and faster recovery trend was observed with decreasing temperature as a result tn removal was stable at approximately 100 even when the temperature was lowered to 10 c in the extreme limit condition fig 4 d the performance did not fully recover but a clear recovery trend occurred over approximately 15 d previous studies on biological water treatment processes other than mbfr systems have addressed the relevance of resilience contributing to reliable system operation sukias et al 2018 suggested a method to quantify resilience in wetland denitrifying bioreactors and santillan et al 2020 tested the effect of organic loading on nitrifying performance in the activated sludge process the favorable resilience of h2 mbfrs for denitrification observed in this study might be attributed to its physical thickness which is discussed in section 3 4 3 3 characteristics of microbial community in biofilms to compare the representative metabolic functions related to the genera observed in the seed sludge and biofilm microbial taxa were divided into 12 functional clusters fig 5 based on previously reported functional characteristics tables s2 and s3 based on the analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences microorganisms with a relative abundance ra greater than 0 5 at the genus level were used for taxonomic breakdown most microorganisms in the seed sludge belong to the heterotrophic denitrifying group and account for 51 3 of the microbial population bowman 2014 fu et al 2020 han et al 2019 mcilroy and nielsen 2014 oh et al 2019 rosenberg et al 2014 saddler and bradbury 2001 teixeira and merquior 2014 wang et al 2019 willems 2014 among denitrifiers bacteria in the family rhodocyclaceae and genus dechloromonas are known to perform perchlorate reduction han et al 2019 oren 2014 for the rest the group containing both heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifiers accounted for 7 7 of the microbial community leonardo et al 2014 on and zhang 2014 oren 2014 and nitrifying bacteria accounted for 9 0 baskaran et al 2020 cai et al 2020 daims 2014 kämpfer 2011 willems 2014 xuemei and zhang 2014 these results suggest that the metabolism of the seed sludge population might be mainly involved in heterotrophic nitrogen removal on the other hand microorganisms in the biofilm were divided into more diverse groups the denitrifying group in the biofilm contained 63 4 of all 16s rrna sequences bernardet and bowman 2015 han et al 2019 mao et al 2014 mohapatra et al 2018 oren 2014 orlygsson and kristjansson 2014 pujalte et al 2014 schleifer 2009 willems 2014 willems and gillis 2015 sulfur related microorganisms accounted for 12 1 of the 16s rrna sequences except for thiobacterales which performs sulfur oxidation these microorganisms are responsible for sulfur compound reduction galushko and kuever 2015 mustapha et al 2020 smii et al 2015 stackebrandt 2014 interestingly 11 0 of the sequences contained acidogenic bacteria known to produce acetate propionate and formate daniel r brown et al 2010 liechty et al 2020 norris et al 2015 ontiveros valencia et al 2013 ueki et al 2006 compared with the seed sludge the biofilm showed a lower abundance of heterotrophs fig 5 this was probably because h2 and hco3 were exogenously supplied as electron donors and carbon sources respectively nevertheless many microorganisms in biofilms still contain heterotrophs or mixotrophs their organic substrates could have come from three sources the first possible sources are natural biopolymers produced by all microorganisms smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps ontiveros valencia et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 explained that h2 oxidizing bacteria produce smp which encourages the growth of smp oxidizing bacteria in the mbfr ontiveros valencia et al 2018 reported that when h2 was severely restricted heterotrophic denitrifiers became dominant in an mbfr merkey et al 2009 modeled the growth of heterotrophs in the mbfr based on their utilization of the smp generated by h2 oxidizing autotrophs second readily biodegradable substrates such acetate might have been produced by h2 oxidizing acetogens in particular the order thermoanaerobacterales and genus treponema include homo acetogenic bacteria that synthesize acetate autotrophically from h2 and co2 2co2 4h2 ch3cooh 2h2o norris et al 2015 third the biofilm s active biomass could have been the electron donor via endogenous respiration ezechi et al 2015 to provide metagenomic evidence of oxyanion reduction by heterotrophs together with autotrophs the functionality of the microbial community in the biofilm was analyzed focusing on h2 oxidation oxyanion reduction organic carbon metabolism and homoacetogenesis fig 6 although there were differences in gene abundance target genes were observed in all pathways of interest the results revealed that oxyanions could be reduced through h2 oxidation by autotrophs but also by heterotrophs using organic substrates additionally the presence of genes involved in organic carbon metabolism indicated the possibility of using macromolecular organic matter such as smp eps or decayed biomass in particular genes in all pathways of homoacetogenesis might have resulted in acetate production by homoacetogens the metagenomic results supported that oxyanions could be reduced by heterotrophs as well as autotrophs thus the biofilm community structure and the fact that the electron equivalent flux was larger than the maximum h2 delivery flux fig 3 support that h2 was not the sole electron donor in the h2 mbfr particularly in phase 3 2 which had a very high electron acceptor loading of over 15 days because h2 was the only exogenous electron donor the long term operation of the h2 mbfr with an electron equivalent flux larger than the maximum h2 flux would not have been possible nevertheless the large accumulation of biofilm and enrichment of acetogens could lead to the short term generation of significant endogenous electron donors and a substantial population of heterotrophs were probably able to utilize the organic donors 3 4 implication of a physically thick biofilm table 2 compares the biofilm thickness reported in the literature to the values we measured at the end of our experiments in other studies biofilm thicknesses ranged from hundreds to thousands of micrometers in mbfr experiments on the other hand the cross section of our biofilm was elliptical with major and minor axes of 3 8 cm and 1 9 cm respectively figure s4 the major axis exceeded the inner diameter of the reactor 3 5 cm because the biofilm was deformed into an elliptical shape when the module was placed on the plate when the cross sectional area was converted to a circle the diameter was approximately 2 7 cm this physical thickness was approximated through cross sectional photographs but this value in centimeters was 10 to 100 fold greater than those found in other studies listed in table 2 table 3 compares the maximum nitrate removal fluxes normalized by h2 pressure for a range of denitrifying h2 mbfr studies including our study the reason for presenting normalized removal fluxes was to exclude the effect of the h2 pressure except for the study by terada et al al 2006 with 4 4 g n m2 d bar the normalized nitrate removal flux in our study was relatively high 2 7 g n m2 d bar although detailed operating conditions were different in each study this indicates that our physically thick biofilm did not affect denitrification performance thick biofilms are known to provide lower removal fluxes because they act as barriers for substrate diffusion celmer et al celmer et al 2008 found a lower denitrification performance in thick biofilms which they assumed was due to the higher eps content in thick biofilms impeding substrate diffusion instead in this study the thick biofilm might contribute to the resilience of the biofilm to stressful conditions due to its microbial diversity to the best of our knowledge there have been no previous studies on microbial diversity or resilience due to thick biofilms in mbfrs however microbial metabolic diversity is known to render biofilms resilient to environmental disturbances feng et al 2017 philippot et al 2021 a thick biofilm provides reserve biomass that can be activated when metabolic activity is slowed down in normally most active zone yin et al 2019 furthermore an increase in biofilm thickness creates new ecological niches yuan et al 2021 that can harbor h2 oxidizing acetogens slow growing sulfate reducers and heterotrophs that utilize smp eps or biomass as electron donors donlan 2002 merkey et al 2009 therefore a thick biofilm may enable microorganisms to resist environmental changes such as shock loads and low temperatures and provide the biofilm with endogenous electron donors further quantitative studies are needed to support these key findings in other words it is necessary to verify the relationship between biofilm growth profiles and resilience nevertheless these results are expected to provide new implications in that thick biofilms in h2 mbfrs may enable their resilient operation contrary to previous reports 4 conclusions a h2 mbfr active in denitrification developed an especially thick biofilm with an approximate diameter of 2 7 cm under stable operating conditions the biofilm was able to achieve nearly 100 denitrification and tn removal with a high no3 n removal flux up to 1 8 e eq n m2 d more importantly the biofilm was resilient against imposed stresses that is increased loading rates of no3 n so4 s and clo4 along with decreased temperature to 10 c although h2 and co2 were the sole exogenous sources of electron donors and carbon respectively the biofilm contained a range of heterotrophic bacteria in denitrification perchlorate reduction sulfate reduction and acetogenesis heterotrophs may utilize organic compounds derived from homo acetogenesis smp eps or biomass decay the biofilm s good resilience and high diversity could be attributed to the physically thick biofilm

study we fabricated feed spacers to improve md efficiency by alleviating the polarisation effects first a 3d printed spacer design was optimised to show superior performance amongst the others tested then to further enhance spacer performance we incorporated highly thermally stable carbon nanofillers including carbon nanotubes cnt and graphene in the fabrication of filaments for 3d printing all the fabricated spacers had a degree of engineered multi scale roughness which was relatively high compared to that of the polylactic acid pla spacer control the use of nanomaterial incorporated spacers increased the mean permeate flux significantly compared to the pla spacer 27 1 l m2h lmh a 43 and 75 increase when using the 1 graphene incorporated spacer 38 9 lmh and 2 cnt incorporated spacer 47 5 lmh respectively this could be attributed to the locally enhanced turbulence owing to the multi scale roughness formed on the spacer which further increased the vaporisation rate through the membrane interestingly only the cnt embedded spacer markedly reduced the ion permeation through the membrane which may be due to the effective reduction of cp this further decreased with increasing cnt concentration confirming that the cnt spacer can simultaneously reduce the cp and tp effects in the md process finally we successfully proved that the multi scale roughness of the spacer surface induces micromixing near the membrane walls which can improve the md performance via computational fluid dynamics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 3d printing

1 introduction membrane distillation md a high salinity brine water treatment technique uses a hydrophobic membrane in this process the membrane acts as a barrier between the liquid feed water and vapour generated by the temperature difference between hot and cold water it passes through a dry hydrophobic membrane to produce freshwater the md process can perfectly theoretically reject ions macromolecules colloids and cells al obaidani et al 2008 thomas et al 2017 fortunato et al 2018 however this process has not yet been fully commercialised for large scale industries due to problems that remain to be solved during the process of md heat and mass are transferred through the hydrophobic membrane therefore the process is sensitive to polarisation effects including both temperature and concentration polarisation tp and cp martı nez dı ez and vázquez gonzález 1999 kuang et al 2019 tp occurs because of the limited heat transfer in the thermal boundary layer which is hot side as the feed is in direct contact with the membrane alsaadi et al 2014 this results in a lower temperature gradient between membrane surfaces resulting in a reduction in flux manawi et al 2014 on the feed side a higher solute concentration in the boundary layer near the membrane surface causes cp bahmanyar et al 2012 this can reduce the flux in the distillation process and further accumulate foulants on the membrane surface which can lead to membrane fouling or scaling chen et al 2004 therefore several researchers have studied methods to enhance md performance by reducing cp and tp hence advanced

2020 have been actively researched to mitigate the tp anvari et al 2020 however the membranes used in the md process are difficult to improve because they require several properties i high hydrophobicity ii high permeability iii high mechanical strength iv high thermal stability v high chemical resistance and vi a narrow pore size distribution khayet et al 2005 lee et al 2018 moreover because the currently developed md membranes have almost reached the critical point of mass transfer a significant increase in membrane performance is unlikely with membrane development lee et al 2018 therefore many studies have recently focused on flow promoters such as spacers in an attempt to improve the md performance by increasing the convective heat transfer and reducing the tp coefficient in the feed channel thomas et al 2018 castillo et al 2019 tan et al 2019 thomas et al 2019 2021 ve et al 2021 ni et al 2022 feed spacers are generally used to i separate the membranes creating channels and ii promote fluid mixing in a membrane module in the md process this acts as a promoter of turbulence that disturbs the temperature and concentration boundary layer near the membrane surface thereby improving membrane performance gurreri et al 2014 taamneh and bataineh 2017 the shape configuration diameter and number of feed spacer filaments have been reported to influence spacer performance thomas et al 2018 castillo et al 2019 thomas et al 2019 2021 ve et al 2021 ni et al 2022 most currently used spacers are made of low cost polymeric materials e g polypropylene and few studies have changed the material of the spacers in the md process table s1 ang et al 2019 tan et al 2019 thomas et al 2021 in these studies the spacers were coated with nanoparticles or metals however the coating layer peeled off easily during the md operation resulting in a reduction in the md performance for this reason research on long lasting spacers is needed to improve efficiency even during long term operation or reuse therefore the method that involves embedding nanoparticles in spacer fabrication is preferred over the coating method in recent years three dimensional 3d printing has been widely used in manufacturing to create various designs that cannot be synthesised using conventional technologies siddiqui et al 2016 castillo et al 2019 thomas et al 2019 tijing et al 2020 the advantage of 3d printing technology is its layer by layer manufacturing configuration this makes it easy to create almost any complex geometry at different scales which enables the rapid creation of finished goods bogue 2013 attaran 2017 3d printing uses a wide variety of materials such as plastics resins rubbers ceramics glass concrete and metals fused filament fabrication fff 3d printers are widely used because they can print most filament type thermoplastic materials using this technology this study aimed to create a nanofiller embedded spacer that can easily embed nanofillers into filaments by simple mixing lee et al 2016 amongst the many candidate nanofillers we tested two classes of carbon nanomaterials carbon nanotube cnt and graphene these are interesting candidates for use as additives in spacers because they exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivities and mechanical strengths however graphene has a two dimensional 2d structure and cnt has a 3d structure compared to flat structured graphene cnt do not disperse well due to their cylindrical structural characteristics therefore it is expected to have different effects on the improvement of md performance by spacers for these reasons we hypothesise that embedding carbon nanofillers can strongly improve the material properties of weak plastic spacers reduce the polarisation effects and improve the md process performance in addition cnt and graphene show different mechanisms in the spacer the objective of this study was to increase the md efficiency using carbon nanomaterial embedded spacers and to investigate their mechanisms in md performance enhancement herein we provide an easy approach for fabricating nanofiller embedded spacers using an fff 3d printer to evaluate this hypothesis the impact of embedding nanofillers on a 3d printed spacer surface namely on morphology hydrophobicity and surface roughness was examined using an optical microscope scanning electron microscope sem contact angle and 3d laser microscope we then performed direct contact membrane distillation dcmd to specifically evaluate the efficiency of unembedded and embedded nanofiller spacers with the same geometry next computational fluid dynamics cfd was used to investigate the hydrodynamics and heat and mass transfer within a spacer filled feed channel depending on the spacer type to elucidate the performance discrepancy between the different spacers used in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed spacer 2 1 1 filaments in this study the 3d printing filaments used were commercial filaments for a poly lactic acid pla spacer and fabricated filaments for nanofiller embedded spacers using a filament extruder filibot h400 fordentech republic of korea to prepare the nanofiller embedded filaments poly lactic acid pla pellets pla pellet total corbion netherlands were mixed with carbon nanofillers including cnt bt1003m lg chemical republic of korea and graphene sigma aldrich usa by shaking several times together in a bottle subsequently a well mixed pellet containing carbon nanofillers was injected into the filament extruder filaments were produced at 230 250 c 250 c for the cnt filament and 230 c for the graphene filament 2 1 2 3d printed feed spacer we produced feed spacer designs using the fusion 360 version 2020 computer aided design cad software autodesk ca usa to optimize the feed spacer design we varied the angle of feed spacer crossing angle of the filament to 45 and 90 the thickness of spacer to 0 5 0 7 and 1 0 mm and the arrangement of filament interval to 1 2 3 and 4 mm the designs were 3d printed using a fused filament fabrication fff 3d printer ender 3 pro creality china all of the spacers were printed at a size of 10 4 cm and then cut to 6 0 1 5 cm for md operation 2 1 3 characterization of spacer to observe the morphology of the spacer an optical microscope dn 10a samwon scientific republic of korea was used using the optical microscope the surface of the spacer was examined without any treatment and images of the spacer surface were captured at a magnification of 100 a laser scanning confocal microscope ols 5000 olympus japan was used to obtain the three dimensional morphology and measure the multiscale roughness of the spacer surface the surface roughness was reported as the average value of ra values of six readings taken at different points on the spacer surface at a magnification of 5 the hydrophobicity of the spacer was tested using a contact angle analyser phoenix10 seo republic of korea the water contact angle wca was determined using a 1 μl deionised di water droplet on a spacer filament using a micropipette the reported wca measurements represent the average of five readings taken at different locations on the sample to ensure values representative of the entire sample as reported by li et al 2021 the relationship between wca and surface roughness was analysed using the cassie baxter equation the equation is taken from previous studies ramiasa et al 2014 wang et al 2020 cos θ r e a l f 1 cos θ s s 1 1 where θ r e a l is the contact angle of the cassie contact angle and θ s s is the contact angle of the smooth surface when the f 1 solid on surface fraction is less than 1 the measured surface is called the established cassie baxter surface 2 2 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd experimental set up the md module was composed of poly methyl methacrylate plastic and the module channel dimensions were 0 015 0 065 0 002 m l w h the md tests were performed using a 0 22 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf durapore germany hydrophobic membrane the main characteristics of the md membranes are summarised in table s2 the feed was comprised of a solution of 35 g l sodium chloride nacl daejung republic of korea which was prepared by dissolving 35 g l nacl in di water fig 1 shows the laboratory scale dcmd setup the feed temperature was maintained at 60 c using a hot plate rct basic ika germany with a temperature sensor pt 1000 60 ika germany the permeate temperature was maintained at 19 5 0 5 c by using a chiller rw3 0525 jeio tech republic of korea the feed solution was continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer to prevent the feed solution from crystallisation and sedimentation the weight of the permeate was recorded on a computer every minute using an electronic balance pr4202kr e ohaus usa the flow rates of both the feed and permeate solution sides were controlled at 0 5 l min lpm using two gear pumps ems 4000 ems tech republic of korea before starting the md test di water was circulated for 30 min to stabilise the flux all md tests were operated for 1 h using 35 g l nacl feed solution the conductivity of the permeate water was measured using a conductivity metre hi9033 hanna instruments usa to measure the ion rejection efficiency ire our measured the feed conductivity was 65 0 ms cm at 60 c 62 4 ms cm at 20 c after completing the test the conductivity of the feed solution and permeate water was measured to check the penetration of ions from the feed to the permeate side all tests were repeated at least three times the ire was calculated as the increase in the permeate ion concentration over time permeate flux j l m2h lmh was calculated using the following equation j q a t where q is the permeated water volume l a is the effective area of the membrane m2 and t is time h 2 3 multiphysics simulation of a spacer filled feed channel in dcmd computational simulations were performed to investigate the fluid dynamics and heat and mass transfer within a 2d feed channel for the md steady state simulations for laminar incompressible and newtonian flows were performed under a wide range of water and salt permanence parameters an aqueous nacl solution was selected as the feed solution which was similar to the experimental feed solution fig 2 illustrates the fluid domain of the 2d md feed channel where several circular filaments are directly in contact with semi permeable membrane walls with an even spacing of lf the filament radii are half of the channel height hc so that the two layers of filaments tightly fit the channel height the entrance and exit of the feed stream are placed 2 lf away from the first and last filaments at the bottom from the experimental measurements shown in the next section the major morphological feature of cnt embedded spacers differentiated from pla spacers was found to be surface roughness because it is difficult to realistically mimic the observed surface morphology of the rough cnt embedded spacers a cogwheel shape was assumed to represent the rough cnt embedded spacers instead with the height of the teeth being the surface roughness measured in the experiments 44 μm was chosen to represent the roughest filaments to reduce the computational burden we omitted a permeate channel because it can be assumed that the permeate concentration and temperature remain relatively constant along the channel compared to those in the feed channel because of the high salt rejection and direct condensation in dcmd nonetheless water and salt fluxes through membranes which are dependant on the differences in vapour pressures and salt concentrations between the feed and permeate sides can be considered via the mechanistic model of water vapour and salt permeation imposed at the membrane wall boundaries the mathematical expressions of water and salt fluxes were prescribed at the top and bottom membranes so that permeating water and salt fluxes could be calculated as a function of the wall temperature and concentration a constant flow velocity uin nacl concentration cin and temperature tin were imposed at the inlet of the 2d channel the walls of the spacer filaments were assumed to be non slip and insulated details of the governing equations for momentum heat and mass transfer and boundary conditions can be found in section a 2 of the supporting information along with the simulation conditions and computational setup the simulation conditions were chosen based on the experimental setup in this work and the membrane properties in existing studies table s4 in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 spacer design optimization in this study spacer design was optimised based on mean permeate flux mpf and ion rejection efficiency ire three different factors were considered for 3d printed pla spacers i crossing angle of the spacer filament ii spacer thickness and iii arrangement interval of the filament fig 3 shows the mpf and ire of the md tested with differently fabricated feed spacers as expected mpf and ire with spacers were higher than those without spacers owing to the reduction of cp and tp on the membrane surface 3 1 1 crossing angles of spacer filament fig 3 a shows the mpf and permeate ion concentrations according to the crossing angles of the spacer filament fig s1 compares the designs of 90 and 45 spacers the crossing angles of the spacer filaments did not affect mpf however the permeate ion concentration with the 45 spacer was much lower than that with the 90 spacer this indicates that compared to the 90 spacer the 45 spacer significantly disrupted the cp on the membrane surface resulting in better ire in 45 spacer than 90 spacer flow velocity is faster and a lot of turbulence is formed whigh improved ire alsaadi et al 2014 3 1 2 thickness of spacer as shown in fig 3 b mpf increased with increasing the thickness of spacer from 0 5 mm to 1 0 mm the permeate ion concentration was also lower with thicker spacers 0 5 mm to 1 0 mm this implies that thicker spacers 0 5 mm to 1 0 mm resulted in less cp this is because thicker spacer can generate more turbulence near the membrane surface than thinner spacer owing to larger contact area with feed water therefore the ire improvement of thicker spacers 0 5 mm to 1 0 mm implies that thicker spacers were able to reduce the cp by forming more turbulence and reducing the thickness of boundary layer 3 1 3 arrangement interval of the filament the md performance according to the spacer filament arrangement interval 1 4 mm is shown in fig 3 c the effective area of the membrane was smaller with a narrower spacer filament arrangement interval therefore a spacer with a wider arrangement interval of the filament resulted in a higher transfer of water while a spacer with a narrower arrangement interval of the spacer filaments presented a higher mpf in contrast the permeate ion concentration increased as the spacer filament arrangement interval increased this indicates that the narrow arrangement interval of the spacer filaments creates a large amount of turbulence and transfers a small amount of water but controls the cp well in this study the 4 mm spacer was chosen as the best design as the narrow arrangement interval of the filament was more expensive and resulted in a lower degree of water penetration the optimal spacer design was chosen in terms of a high mpf low permeate ion concentration high water production and low fabrication cost similarly a cfd study of spacer geometries by yazan et al reported that a crossing angle of 45 exhibited the best performance taamneh and bataineh 2017 therefore the optimal spacer design is a 45 crossing angle of the spacer filament 1 0 mm thickness of spacer and 4 mm arrangement interval of the filament fig 3 d this design has been continuously used for the fabrication of other feed spacers 3 2 change in spacer surface 3 2 1 morphology of spacer fig 4 shows the surface morphology difference of spacers before and after adding nanofillers e g graphene cnt the surface of the pla spacer was relatively smooth fig 4 a the 1 graphene spacer also presented smooth surface fig 4 b however the 1 cnt spacer fig 4 c showed a greatly rougher structure than the pla or 1 graphene spacers fig 4 d shows the surface of the 2 cnt spacer which had the bumpiest and roughest surface amongst the spacers fabricated as reported by ngoma et al the surface became roughest at high cnt concentrations because of the aggregation effects which is a common feature of the cnt ngoma et al 2021 3 2 2 surface roughness and hydrophobicity of spacer surface table 1 shows the relationship between the roughness and wca of spacers fabricated under different conditions the order of measuring wca of all the carbon nanofillers embedded spacers surface 2 cnt spacer 96 4 3 4 1 graphene spacer 75 2 2 9 1 cnt spacer 72 3 2 0 0 5 cnt spacer 71 9 0 4 0 5 graphene spacer 71 8 1 3 pla spacer 65 0 0 2 the wca of 2 cnt embedded 3d printed spacer increased sharply to 96 4 indicating that surface hydrophobicity was increased greatly by the cnt aggregation effects on the spacer surface based on the measured wca the cassie baxter equation was calculated where θ r e a l is the wca for the carbon nanofiller embedded spacers and θ s s is the wca of the pla spacer the calculation indicated that all carbon nanofiller embedded spacers f 1 was below 1 therefore the carbon nanofiller embedded spacers are the cassie baxter surface in the pla spacer f 1 was 1 the 2 cnt spacer exhibited the lowest f 1 of 0 62 the 0 5 and 1 cnt spacers and 0 5 graphene spacer had similar f 1 values namely 0 92 0 91 and 0 93 respectively the f 1 of 1 graphene spacer was 0 88 a decrease in f 1 indicates that the trapped air ratio at the surface increases and the surface density decreases indicating that the roughness increases wang et al 2020 therefore according to cassie baxter equation the roughness of the spacers was as follows 0 5 graphene spacer 0 5 cnt spacer 1 cnt spacer 1 graphene spacer 2 cnt spacer this implies that if the concentration of each carbon nanofiller increases the roughness increases in particular the roughness of 2 cnt spacer will be higher than that of the other spacers according to the results of the measured surface roughness of the spacers the 2 cnt embedded spacer showed the highest micro scale surface roughness 44 18 2 μm compared to pla spacer without nanofillers 13 5 1 9 μm as can be seen from the optimal microscope image of 2 cnt spacer fig 4 d a bumpy micro morphological pattern was observed on the surface this means that the cnt aggregation occurring at a concentration of cnt over 2 affects the bumpy roughness of the spacer surface in addition the 1 cnt spacer and the 2 cnt spacer showed high standard deviations of 12 6 μm and 18 2 μm respectively indicating that the 1 and 2 cnt spacers had multiscale roughness of varying degrees the graphene embedded spacers showed a roughness standard deviation similar to that of the pla spacer however micro scale roughness increased in the following order 1 cnt spacer 25 2 12 6 μm 0 5 cnt spacer 12 2 5 3 μm 1 graphene spacer 5 3 3 9 μm 0 5 graphene spacer 5 0 1 3 μm in here cnt with 3d particle structure showed a rough surface due to aggregation but graphene with 2d structure was well dispersed and no surface change fig 5 a shows the correlation between surface roughness and f 1 as previously stated in practice the lower f 1 the higher the roughness of the spacer surface this means that embedding carbon nanofillers in the spacer results in multi scale roughness owing to the addition of carbon nanofillers forming a cassie baxter surface on the spacer surface in addition the values of wca tended to be similar to those of roughness and the higher the roughness the higher the wca fig 5 b the spacer hydrophobicity was the highest when the roughness on the spacer increased to 44 18 2 μm this indicates that embedding carbon nanofillers in the spacer increases the surface roughness by increasing the trapped air ratio on the surface furthermore it increases the hydrophobicity of the spacer surface fig 5 b therefore surface roughness plays a key role in determining the hydrophobicity of the spacer surface 3 3 performance of rough spacers 3 3 1 md efficiency depending spacer roughness the use of a spacer increased the mpf compared to md operation without a spacer fig 6 then the use of carbon nanofiller embedded spacers was found to result in an improved mpf compared to the use of the pla spacer in the absence of a spacer only membrane mpf was 15 9 4 9 lmh the pla spacer 27 1 2 4 lmh resulted in a 171 increase in mpf compared to no spacer this means that spacers promote fluid mixing in the membrane module taamneh and bataineh 2017 thereby increasing the efficiency of the md process the 1 graphene spacer achieved an mpf of 38 9 2 8 lmh which is 143 more than the pla spacer furthermore 1 and 2 cnt spacers achieved better mpf performances than the pla spacer 113 and 175 higher respectively the 2 cnt spacer showed the best performance with the highest mpf of 47 5 2 4 lmh the order of mpf was as follows 2 cnt spacer 47 5 2 4 lmh 1 graphene spacer 38 9 2 8 lmh 1 cnt spacer 30 6 2 0 lmh pla spacer 27 1 2 4 lmh no spacer only membrane 15 9 4 9 lmh in terms of surface roughness table 1 mpf performance tended to similar with the surface roughness 2 cnt spacer 1 graphene spacer 1 cnt spacer pla spacer of the spacer fig 5 c the reason why the rough surface spacer made the higher flux is that the rough surface interrupted feed flow and created turbulence if the flow velocity near the membrane surface is increased by turbulence generated on rough surface the flux can be improved this indicates that a rougher surface spacer could improve the mpf performance in the md process and suggests that a rough spacer surface can cause more turbulence and improve the efficiency of the md process in addition a suitable roughness is expected to increase the efficiency further moreover the use of a spacer was found to enhance the ire presumably owing to the reduction in cp fig 6 the permeate ion concentration was found to decrease in the following order no spacer only membrane used 19 54 3 3 μs cm pla spacer 3 0 1 3 μs cm 1 graphene spacer 2 97 0 1 μs cm 1 cnt spacer 0 9 0 6 μs cm 2 cnt spacer 0 13 0 4 μs cm ire was above 97 when spacers were used however it is impossible to operate for a long time without controlling the cp the cp must be controlled in the md process because it allows for long term operation without membrane contamination and increases the life of the membrane cp causes membrane wetting and a high concentration near the membrane surface and feed water passes through the membrane reducing the ire therefore the cp is related to the ire graphene embedded spacer had relatively smooth surface while cnt embedded spacer had bumpy surface as cnt showed aggregation effects fig 4 which is probably due to their different dispersion states this study showed that the cnt embedded spacer with multi scale roughness increased both mpf and ire but the change in physical properties and increase in hydrophobicity due to graphene increase the mpf but not ire since graphene and cnts share the same chemistry we consider that both graphene and cnt embedded spacers should have similar characteristics except surface roughness so these results indicate that an increased spacer surface roughness promotes membrane surface turbulence and convective mass transfer near the membrane surface as reported by the previous study lee et al 2018 high flow velocity increased mpf and reduced polarization effects due to increased local mass transfer near the membrane surfaces this suggests that only the cnt embedded spacer can control the cp effect during the md process our results are consistent with the reported findings that the rough surface spacers exhibit high local velocity and consequently enhanced convective mass transfer thereby mitigating the polarization effects and improving the mpf and ire 3 3 2 effect of cnt spacer on md performance fig 7 shows the mpf and permeate ion concentration in the md operation using spacers fabricated at different cnt concentrations mpf was found to increase as the cnt concentration increased from 0 to 0 5 then the mpf of the spacer of 0 5 1 cnt concentration seemed to decrease as the cnt concentration increased however the 2 cnt spacer achieved the highest mpf fig 7 shows the mpf and permeate ion concentration in the md operation with spacers fabricated at different cnt concentrations the mpf increased as the cnt concentration increased from 0 to 0 5 then the mpf of the spacer embedded 0 5 1 cnt concentration seemed to decrease as the cnt concentration increased however the 2 cnt spacer achieved the highest mpf permeate ion concentration seemed to increase as the concentration of cnts increased from 0 to 0 25 but decreased as the concentration of cnts increased from 0 25 to 2 complete ion rejection was achieved with the 2 cnt overall the ire increased as a function of the cnt concentration this indicates that the cnt containing spacer effectively reduced the cp effect table 2 shows the mpf wca and roughness as a function of cnt concentration overall both the wca and roughness increased as the cnt concentration increased in particular the higher the cnt concentration the higher the standard deviation of the spacer surface roughness this means that cnt promotes multi scale roughness by creating different roughness sizes on the spacer surface multi scale roughness refers to roughness on various scales from mirco to nano so it appears high standard deviation it creates irregular turbulences and some of them forms high voltage turbulence it increases flow rate nearby membrane surface and reduces polarization effects due to reducing of boundary layer consequently multi scale roughness can improve mrf in our results the mpf increased as the roughness increased but decreased at some cnt concentrations the 0 25 0 75 cnt spacer showed no difference in the roughness but only a change in the standard deviation of the roughness however the 0 75 cnt spacer had a smaller standard deviation of roughness than the 0 25 and 0 5 cnt spacers corresponding to a lower mpf in particular wca and the roughness of the 2 cnts increased suddenly with a high standard deviation of roughness this is in agreement with the highest mpf of 2 cnt spacer and indicates that the enhancement in mpf can be mainly attributed to the increased multi scale roughness 3 4 computational fluid dynamics cfd 3 4 1 average water and salt fluxes under a range of water and salt permeances fig 8 shows average water and salt fluxes for the membrane area coloured in red in fig 2 over a wide range of water and salt permeances fig 8 a and b shows the results of simulations with varied water permeance 0 5 10 7 to 2 0 10 6 kg m2 s pa and fixed salt permeance 1 10 10 m s when evaluating the differences between the cnt free and cnt embedded spacers it was hypothesized that surface roughness would affect the micro hydrodynamics near the membrane surfaces leading to enhanced micro mixing that can mitigate tp this hypothesis was made based on the experimental observations shown in table 2 at high cnt concentrations of 1 a marked increase in surface roughness and mean water flux was observed on the other hand at low cnt concentrations surface roughness and mean water flux did not exhibit distinct trends after considering the measurement errors as shown in fig 8 a and b the average water flux increased from approximately 22 to 55 lmh for both smooth and rough spacers in contrast the salt fluxes did not exhibit a marked variation with an increased water permeance i e 1 5 10 5 kg m2 h to 1 9 10 5 kg m2 h this is because the main driving force of water permeation through membranes in dcmd is the difference in vapour pressure between the feed and permeate streams derived from the temperature gradients a slight increase in the calculated salt fluxes with increasing water permeance was attributed to the cp aggravated by the enhanced water flux pla spacers achieved approximately 30 lmh fig 6 which can be equivalently achieved with a water permeance of 7 10 6 to 8 10 6 kg m2 s pa the average water fluxes obtained from the multiphysics simulation are also in the reported order of magnitude alkhudhiri et al 2012 from 1 to 63 kg m2 h which were experimentally measured depending on the feed concentration temperature and velocity fig 8 c and d show the average water and salt fluxes respectively with the water permeance fixed at 8 10 7 kg m2 s pa and the salt permeance varied over a range of 1 10 10 m s to 1 10 9 m s salt fluxes were found to rise linearly with salt permeance from 1 64 10 5 kg m2 hr to 1 64 10 4 kg m2 hr whereas water fluxes remain unchanged with varying salt permeance increasing salt permeation was found to negligibly affect water fluxes under the selected simulation conditions because md membranes can achieve almost 100 rejection in other words even the highest salt permeance chosen in this study tended to 100 salt rejection this can be observed from the calculated permeate concentrations shown in fig s2 a and b in the supporting information as well as the experimental results in fig 7 the conductivity of the permeate measured in the experiments was translated to the nacl concentration via a calibration relation as reported in the literature aldalbahi et al 2017 our experiments demonstrate that permeate concentrations range between 6 8 10 5 g l and 3 67 10 3 g l depending on the spacer type while the computational simulations achieved 3 5 10 4 to 5 2 10 3 g l which is found at the upper end of the experimental measurements in addition the trends of a decreasing permeate concentration with an increasing cnt content in the spacers can be related to our simulation results demonstrating that the permeate concentration for smooth spacers is predicted to be higher than that for rough spacers most importantly the performances of the smooth and rough filaments were comparable in terms of water and salt fluxes there were only negligible differences in the computed results between the two spacers as shown in fig 8 a and c the average water fluxes with rough filaments were higher by 0 6 1 4 than those with smooth filaments over the range of varied permeance parameters this is qualitatively in agreement with our experimental results where the cnt embedded spacers outperformed pla spacers although the performance disparity between the two spacers predicted by the current computational approach can be said to be almost negligible the present work is an initial attempt to investigate the mechanisms of flux enhancement via surface roughness induced micromixing in the presence of cnt embedded spacers using a simplistic approach with several assumptions first the simulation domains were in 2d and were unable to fully describe the hydrodynamics present within an actual spacer filled channel second the increased hydrophobicity of spacers with high cnt content was not accounted for which could be critical in dcmd as shown in table 2 there was a significant jump in contact angle from 1 cnt spacer to 2 cnt spacer finally the membrane material and permeate channel which influence the calculation of heat transfer and temperature distributions were omitted in this study according a recent paper ansari et al 2023 different shapes detachment of spacer filaments improved the water flux and tp coefficient in particular cnts are known to exhibit excellent thermal conductivity which may help mitigate the tp despite the underestimation of the performance improvement of rough spacers in multiphysics simulations a qualitative analysis of the simulation results provides insight into the effects of surface roughness under dcmd conditions which is discussed in the following sections 3 4 2 spatial distributions of flow velocity temperature and concentration fig 9 displays velocity fields obtained from the multiphysics simulation at water permeance of 2 10 6 kg m2 s pa which are almost independent of water permeance due to the trivial value of water permeation velocity compared to bulk flow velocity i e 0 064 m s of inlet velocity vs 1 5 10 5 m s of peak permeation velocity as shown in fig 9 a and b the flow becomes stabilized and appears to be periodic after the fourth filament at the bottom wall differences in flow behaviours between smooth and rough filaments are shown in more in detail in fig 9 c f both spacers accompany flow recirculation and stagnation in the areas confined by spacers and membrane walls however the size of flow recirculation for the two scenarios is slightly different as shown in the velocity vector plots in fig 9 e and f the recirculation region in the smooth filaments shown in fig 9 e appears to be thinner and more stretched than that in the rough filaments this is attributed to a more disturbed flow near the rough spacer surfaces as shown in fig 10 c and d which could potentially enhance fluid mixing furthermore it can be expected that corrugated surfaces create tiny hollow rooms between the spacer surface and membrane walls while supporting a sheet of membranes which could be beneficial for mitigating tp and cp the temperature and concentration distributions obtained from the multiphysics simulations are shown in fig 10 for a more distinct visualisation of tp and cp the simulation scenario with the highest water permeance 2 10 6 kg m2 s pa was selected polarisation phenomena were observed in both temperature and concentration distributions albeit to different degrees the polarisation regions were consistent with the recirculation zones shown in fig 9 the minimum wall temperatures in the smooth and rough filaments were similar at approximately 31 c fig s4 in supporting information cold spots mainly appeared in the vicinity of the spacer membrane contact in both spacers for concentration distributions polarised areas had a concentration up to four times larger than the bulk concentration that is the wall concentration increased as high as 144 g l near the sharp edge of the spacer membrane contact point owing to the differences in micromixing that occur adjacent to the spacer surfaces the shapes of the polarised regions were formed differently this can be observed more clearly in the axial temperature and concentration profiles shown in fig s4 in the supporting information 3 4 3 water and salt fluxes along the membrane walls the axial variations in the water and salt fluxes are presented in fig 11 first the values of fluxes for both smooth and rough spacers did not differ significantly although there are small discrepancies in peak values then the trends of axial water fluxes tended to vary noticeably in each cycle whereas the salt fluxes were rather flat the positions of the peak water flux coincided with the lowered tp for example comparing fig 10 a and b with fig 11 b the back of the bottom filaments exhibited a small polarised area higher temperature area fig 10 a for smooth spacers and water flux peaks appeared at the corresponding positions fig 11 b fig 11 can be used to understand the results of average water and salt fluxes shown in fig 8 the predicted water and salt fluxes for smooth and rough spacers in fig 11 a and b were approximately the same except for minor variations near the centres of spacer filaments the rough spacers had higher water fluxes at the first filament cycle than the smooth spacers contributing to the higher averaged flux as shown in fig 8 the shape of flux curves also indicates that the front of spacer filaments in the positive axial direction had aggravated tp and cp compared to the back of filaments in the negative axial direction which coincides with the shape of stagnation zone depicted in fig 9 e and f further results on concentration and temperature at the top and bottom membranes are shown in fig s4 which exhibited similar patterns to water and salt fluxes respectively 4 conclusions this study showed that md performance could be improved using carbon nanofiller embedded spacers and that the surface roughness of spacers could induce micromixing near the membrane surfaces via experiments and cfd simulations the key results of this study are summarised as follows in terms of mpf and ire spacer design has been pre optimized to following conditions a 45 crossing angle of the spacer filament a 1 0 mm thickness of spacer and a 4 mm arrangement interval of the filament the surface of the carbon nanofiller embedded spacers became a cassie baxter surface and was rougher than pristine spacers in addition the surface roughness was found to be linked to the hydrophobicity of the spacer surface the carbon nanofiller embedded spacer showed a more hydrophobic surface the highest roughness and hydrophobicity were achieved by 2 cnt spacer wca and roughness are 96 4 3 4 and 64 1 8 4 μm respectively the higher the surface roughness the higher the flux with a roughness of 64 1 8 4 μm the spacer achieved the highest mpf performance although carbon fillers increased the mpf graphene did not improve the ire and only cnt improved the ire performance in the md process embedding the cnt the increased wca on the spacer surface and cnt spacer increased ire from the concentration of cnt above 0 5 the best ire performance was achieved using the 2 cnt spacer further research on the ire improvement cp control mechanism of cnt embedded spacers is required preliminary cfd simulations demonstrated that flow could be more disturbed by micro mixing in the rough spacers than in the smooth spacers which could potentially be related to the mitigated tp and cp these simulation results indicate that the mpf was enhanced owing to the increased surface roughness caused by cnt which could affect the tp and cp declaration of competing

15107,membrane distillation md transfers heat and mass simultaneously through a hydrophobic membrane hence it is sensitive to both concentration and temperature polarisation cp and tp effects in this study we fabricated feed spacers to improve md efficiency by alleviating the polarisation effects first a 3d printed spacer design was optimised to show superior performance amongst the others tested then to further enhance spacer performance we incorporated highly thermally stable carbon nanofillers including carbon nanotubes cnt and graphene in the fabrication of filaments for 3d printing all the fabricated spacers had a degree of engineered multi scale roughness which was relatively high compared to that of the polylactic acid pla spacer control the use of nanomaterial incorporated spacers increased the mean permeate flux significantly compared to the pla spacer 27 1 l m2h lmh a 43 and 75 increase when using the 1 graphene incorporated spacer 38 9 lmh and 2 cnt incorporated spacer 47 5 lmh respectively this could be attributed to the locally enhanced turbulence owing to the multi scale roughness formed on the spacer which further increased the vaporisation rate through the membrane interestingly only the cnt embedded spacer markedly reduced the ion permeation through the membrane which may be due to the effective reduction of cp this further decreased with increasing cnt concentration confirming that the cnt spacer can simultaneously reduce the cp and tp effects in the md process finally we successfully proved that the multi scale roughness of the spacer surface induces micromixing near the membrane walls which can improve the md performance via computational fluid dynamics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 3d printing

1 introduction membrane distillation md a high salinity brine water treatment technique uses a hydrophobic membrane in this process the membrane acts as a barrier between the liquid feed water and vapour generated by the temperature difference between hot and cold water it passes through a dry hydrophobic membrane to produce freshwater the md process can perfectly theoretically reject ions macromolecules colloids and cells al obaidani et al 2008 thomas et al 2017 fortunato et al 2018 however this process has not yet been fully commercialised for large scale industries due to problems that remain to be solved during the process of md heat and mass are transferred through the hydrophobic membrane therefore the process is sensitive to polarisation effects including both temperature and concentration polarisation tp and cp martı nez dı ez and vázquez gonzález 1999 kuang et al 2019 tp occurs because of the limited heat transfer in the thermal boundary layer which is hot side as the feed is in direct contact with the membrane alsaadi et al 2014 this results in a lower temperature gradient between membrane surfaces resulting in a reduction in flux manawi et al 2014 on the feed side a higher solute concentration in the boundary layer near the membrane surface causes cp bahmanyar et al 2012 this can reduce the flux in the distillation process and further accumulate foulants on the membrane surface which can lead to membrane fouling or scaling chen et al 2004 therefore several researchers have studied methods to enhance md performance by reducing cp and tp hence advanced

2020 have been actively researched to mitigate the tp anvari et al 2020 however the membranes used in the md process are difficult to improve because they require several properties i high hydrophobicity ii high permeability iii high mechanical strength iv high thermal stability v high chemical resistance and vi a narrow pore size distribution khayet et al 2005 lee et al 2018 moreover because the currently developed md membranes have almost reached the critical point of mass transfer a significant increase in membrane performance is unlikely with membrane development lee et al 2018 therefore many studies have recently focused on flow promoters such as spacers in an attempt to improve the md performance by increasing the convective heat transfer and reducing the tp coefficient in the feed channel thomas et al 2018 castillo et al 2019 tan et al 2019 thomas et al 2019 2021 ve et al 2021 ni et al 2022 feed spacers are generally used to i separate the membranes creating channels and ii promote fluid mixing in a membrane module in the md process this acts as a promoter of turbulence that disturbs the temperature and concentration boundary layer near the membrane surface thereby improving membrane performance gurreri et al 2014 taamneh and bataineh 2017 the shape configuration diameter and number of feed spacer filaments have been reported to influence spacer performance thomas et al 2018 castillo et al 2019 thomas et al 2019 2021 ve et al 2021 ni et al 2022 most currently used spacers are made of low cost polymeric materials e g polypropylene and few studies have changed the material of the spacers in the md process table s1 ang et al 2019 tan et al 2019 thomas et al 2021 in these studies the spacers were coated with nanoparticles or metals however the coating layer peeled off easily during the md operation resulting in a reduction in the md performance for this reason research on long lasting spacers is needed to improve efficiency even during long term operation or reuse therefore the method that involves embedding nanoparticles in spacer fabrication is preferred over the coating method in recent years three dimensional 3d printing has been widely used in manufacturing to create various designs that cannot be synthesised using conventional technologies siddiqui et al 2016 castillo et al 2019 thomas et al 2019 tijing et al 2020 the advantage of 3d printing technology is its layer by layer manufacturing configuration this makes it easy to create almost any complex geometry at different scales which enables the rapid creation of finished goods bogue 2013 attaran 2017 3d printing uses a wide variety of materials such as plastics resins rubbers ceramics glass concrete and metals fused filament fabrication fff 3d printers are widely used because they can print most filament type thermoplastic materials using this technology this study aimed to create a nanofiller embedded spacer that can easily embed nanofillers into filaments by simple mixing lee et al 2016 amongst the many candidate nanofillers we tested two classes of carbon nanomaterials carbon nanotube cnt and graphene these are interesting candidates for use as additives in spacers because they exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivities and mechanical strengths however graphene has a two dimensional 2d structure and cnt has a 3d structure compared to flat structured graphene cnt do not disperse well due to their cylindrical structural characteristics therefore it is expected to have different effects on the improvement of md performance by spacers for these reasons we hypothesise that embedding carbon nanofillers can strongly improve the material properties of weak plastic spacers reduce the polarisation effects and improve the md process performance in addition cnt and graphene show different mechanisms in the spacer the objective of this study was to increase the md efficiency using carbon nanomaterial embedded spacers and to investigate their mechanisms in md performance enhancement herein we provide an easy approach for fabricating nanofiller embedded spacers using an fff 3d printer to evaluate this hypothesis the impact of embedding nanofillers on a 3d printed spacer surface namely on morphology hydrophobicity and surface roughness was examined using an optical microscope scanning electron microscope sem contact angle and 3d laser microscope we then performed direct contact membrane distillation dcmd to specifically evaluate the efficiency of unembedded and embedded nanofiller spacers with the same geometry next computational fluid dynamics cfd was used to investigate the hydrodynamics and heat and mass transfer within a spacer filled feed channel depending on the spacer type to elucidate the performance discrepancy between the different spacers used in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed spacer 2 1 1 filaments in this study the 3d printing filaments used were commercial filaments for a poly lactic acid pla spacer and fabricated filaments for nanofiller embedded spacers using a filament extruder filibot h400 fordentech republic of korea to prepare the nanofiller embedded filaments poly lactic acid pla pellets pla pellet total corbion netherlands were mixed with carbon nanofillers including cnt bt1003m lg chemical republic of korea and graphene sigma aldrich usa by shaking several times together in a bottle subsequently a well mixed pellet containing carbon nanofillers was injected into the filament extruder filaments were produced at 230 250 c 250 c for the cnt filament and 230 c for the graphene filament 2 1 2 3d printed feed spacer we produced feed spacer designs using the fusion 360 version 2020 computer aided design cad software autodesk ca usa to optimize the feed spacer design we varied the angle of feed spacer crossing angle of the filament to 45 and 90 the thickness of spacer to 0 5 0 7 and 1 0 mm and the arrangement of filament interval to 1 2 3 and 4 mm the designs were 3d printed using a fused filament fabrication fff 3d printer ender 3 pro creality china all of the spacers were printed at a size of 10 4 cm and then cut to 6 0 1 5 cm for md operation 2 1 3 characterization of spacer to observe the morphology of the spacer an optical microscope dn 10a samwon scientific republic of korea was used using the optical microscope the surface of the spacer was examined without any treatment and images of the spacer surface were captured at a magnification of 100 a laser scanning confocal microscope ols 5000 olympus japan was used to obtain the three dimensional morphology and measure the multiscale roughness of the spacer surface the surface roughness was reported as the average value of ra values of six readings taken at different points on the spacer surface at a magnification of 5 the hydrophobicity of the spacer was tested using a contact angle analyser phoenix10 seo republic of korea the water contact angle wca was determined using a 1 μl deionised di water droplet on a spacer filament using a micropipette the reported wca measurements represent the average of five readings taken at different locations on the sample to ensure values representative of the entire sample as reported by li et al 2021 the relationship between wca and surface roughness was analysed using the cassie baxter equation the equation is taken from previous studies ramiasa et al 2014 wang et al 2020 cos θ r e a l f 1 cos θ s s 1 1 where θ r e a l is the contact angle of the cassie contact angle and θ s s is the contact angle of the smooth surface when the f 1 solid on surface fraction is less than 1 the measured surface is called the established cassie baxter surface 2 2 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd experimental set up the md module was composed of poly methyl methacrylate plastic and the module channel dimensions were 0 015 0 065 0 002 m l w h the md tests were performed using a 0 22 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf durapore germany hydrophobic membrane the main characteristics of the md membranes are summarised in table s2 the feed was comprised of a solution of 35 g l sodium chloride nacl daejung republic of korea which was prepared by dissolving 35 g l nacl in di water fig 1 shows the laboratory scale dcmd setup the feed temperature was maintained at 60 c using a hot plate rct basic ika germany with a temperature sensor pt 1000 60 ika germany the permeate temperature was maintained at 19 5 0 5 c by using a chiller rw3 0525 jeio tech republic of korea the feed solution was continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer to prevent the feed solution from crystallisation and sedimentation the weight of the permeate was recorded on a computer every minute using an electronic balance pr4202kr e ohaus usa the flow rates of both the feed and permeate solution sides were controlled at 0 5 l min lpm using two gear pumps ems 4000 ems tech republic of korea before starting the md test di water was circulated for 30 min to stabilise the flux all md tests were operated for 1 h using 35 g l nacl feed solution the conductivity of the permeate water was measured using a conductivity metre hi9033 hanna instruments usa to measure the ion rejection efficiency ire our measured the feed conductivity was 65 0 ms cm at 60 c 62 4 ms cm at 20 c after completing the test the conductivity of the feed solution and permeate water was measured to check the penetration of ions from the feed to the permeate side all tests were repeated at least three times the ire was calculated as the increase in the permeate ion concentration over time permeate flux j l m2h lmh was calculated using the following equation j q a t where q is the permeated water volume l a is the effective area of the membrane m2 and t is time h 2 3 multiphysics simulation of a spacer filled feed channel in dcmd computational simulations were performed to investigate the fluid dynamics and heat and mass transfer within a 2d feed channel for the md steady state simulations for laminar incompressible and newtonian flows were performed under a wide range of water and salt permanence parameters an aqueous nacl solution was selected as the feed solution which was similar to the experimental feed solution fig 2 illustrates the fluid domain of the 2d md feed channel where several circular filaments are directly in contact with semi permeable membrane walls with an even spacing of lf the filament radii are half of the channel height hc so that the two layers of filaments tightly fit the channel height the entrance and exit of the feed stream are placed 2 lf away from the first and last filaments at the bottom from the experimental measurements shown in the next section the major morphological feature of cnt embedded spacers differentiated from pla spacers was found to be surface roughness because it is difficult to realistically mimic the observed surface morphology of the rough cnt embedded spacers a cogwheel shape was assumed to represent the rough cnt embedded spacers instead with the height of the teeth being the surface roughness measured in the experiments 44 μm was chosen to represent the roughest filaments to reduce the computational burden we omitted a permeate channel because it can be assumed that the permeate concentration and temperature remain relatively constant along the channel compared to those in the feed channel because of the high salt rejection and direct condensation in dcmd nonetheless water and salt fluxes through membranes which are dependant on the differences in vapour pressures and salt concentrations between the feed and permeate sides can be considered via the mechanistic model of water vapour and salt permeation imposed at the membrane wall boundaries the mathematical expressions of water and salt fluxes were prescribed at the top and bottom membranes so that permeating water and salt fluxes could be calculated as a function of the wall temperature and concentration a constant flow velocity uin nacl concentration cin and temperature tin were imposed at the inlet of the 2d channel the walls of the spacer filaments were assumed to be non slip and insulated details of the governing equations for momentum heat and mass transfer and boundary conditions can be found in section a 2 of the supporting information along with the simulation conditions and computational setup the simulation conditions were chosen based on the experimental setup in this work and the membrane properties in existing studies table s4 in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 spacer design optimization in this study spacer design was optimised based on mean permeate flux mpf and ion rejection efficiency ire three different factors were considered for 3d printed pla spacers i crossing angle of the spacer filament ii spacer thickness and iii arrangement interval of the filament fig 3 shows the mpf and ire of the md tested with differently fabricated feed spacers as expected mpf and ire with spacers were higher than those without spacers owing to the reduction of cp and tp on the membrane surface 3 1 1 crossing angles of spacer filament fig 3 a shows the mpf and permeate ion concentrations according to the crossing angles of the spacer filament fig s1 compares the designs of 90 and 45 spacers the crossing angles of the spacer filaments did not affect mpf however the permeate ion concentration with the 45 spacer was much lower than that with the 90 spacer this indicates that compared to the 90 spacer the 45 spacer significantly disrupted the cp on the membrane surface resulting in better ire in 45 spacer than 90 spacer flow velocity is faster and a lot of turbulence is formed whigh improved ire alsaadi et al 2014 3 1 2 thickness of spacer as shown in fig 3 b mpf increased with increasing the thickness of spacer from 0 5 mm to 1 0 mm the permeate ion concentration was also lower with thicker spacers 0 5 mm to 1 0 mm this implies that thicker spacers 0 5 mm to 1 0 mm resulted in less cp this is because thicker spacer can generate more turbulence near the membrane surface than thinner spacer owing to larger contact area with feed water therefore the ire improvement of thicker spacers 0 5 mm to 1 0 mm implies that thicker spacers were able to reduce the cp by forming more turbulence and reducing the thickness of boundary layer 3 1 3 arrangement interval of the filament the md performance according to the spacer filament arrangement interval 1 4 mm is shown in fig 3 c the effective area of the membrane was smaller with a narrower spacer filament arrangement interval therefore a spacer with a wider arrangement interval of the filament resulted in a higher transfer of water while a spacer with a narrower arrangement interval of the spacer filaments presented a higher mpf in contrast the permeate ion concentration increased as the spacer filament arrangement interval increased this indicates that the narrow arrangement interval of the spacer filaments creates a large amount of turbulence and transfers a small amount of water but controls the cp well in this study the 4 mm spacer was chosen as the best design as the narrow arrangement interval of the filament was more expensive and resulted in a lower degree of water penetration the optimal spacer design was chosen in terms of a high mpf low permeate ion concentration high water production and low fabrication cost similarly a cfd study of spacer geometries by yazan et al reported that a crossing angle of 45 exhibited the best performance taamneh and bataineh 2017 therefore the optimal spacer design is a 45 crossing angle of the spacer filament 1 0 mm thickness of spacer and 4 mm arrangement interval of the filament fig 3 d this design has been continuously used for the fabrication of other feed spacers 3 2 change in spacer surface 3 2 1 morphology of spacer fig 4 shows the surface morphology difference of spacers before and after adding nanofillers e g graphene cnt the surface of the pla spacer was relatively smooth fig 4 a the 1 graphene spacer also presented smooth surface fig 4 b however the 1 cnt spacer fig 4 c showed a greatly rougher structure than the pla or 1 graphene spacers fig 4 d shows the surface of the 2 cnt spacer which had the bumpiest and roughest surface amongst the spacers fabricated as reported by ngoma et al the surface became roughest at high cnt concentrations because of the aggregation effects which is a common feature of the cnt ngoma et al 2021 3 2 2 surface roughness and hydrophobicity of spacer surface table 1 shows the relationship between the roughness and wca of spacers fabricated under different conditions the order of measuring wca of all the carbon nanofillers embedded spacers surface 2 cnt spacer 96 4 3 4 1 graphene spacer 75 2 2 9 1 cnt spacer 72 3 2 0 0 5 cnt spacer 71 9 0 4 0 5 graphene spacer 71 8 1 3 pla spacer 65 0 0 2 the wca of 2 cnt embedded 3d printed spacer increased sharply to 96 4 indicating that surface hydrophobicity was increased greatly by the cnt aggregation effects on the spacer surface based on the measured wca the cassie baxter equation was calculated where θ r e a l is the wca for the carbon nanofiller embedded spacers and θ s s is the wca of the pla spacer the calculation indicated that all carbon nanofiller embedded spacers f 1 was below 1 therefore the carbon nanofiller embedded spacers are the cassie baxter surface in the pla spacer f 1 was 1 the 2 cnt spacer exhibited the lowest f 1 of 0 62 the 0 5 and 1 cnt spacers and 0 5 graphene spacer had similar f 1 values namely 0 92 0 91 and 0 93 respectively the f 1 of 1 graphene spacer was 0 88 a decrease in f 1 indicates that the trapped air ratio at the surface increases and the surface density decreases indicating that the roughness increases wang et al 2020 therefore according to cassie baxter equation the roughness of the spacers was as follows 0 5 graphene spacer 0 5 cnt spacer 1 cnt spacer 1 graphene spacer 2 cnt spacer this implies that if the concentration of each carbon nanofiller increases the roughness increases in particular the roughness of 2 cnt spacer will be higher than that of the other spacers according to the results of the measured surface roughness of the spacers the 2 cnt embedded spacer showed the highest micro scale surface roughness 44 18 2 μm compared to pla spacer without nanofillers 13 5 1 9 μm as can be seen from the optimal microscope image of 2 cnt spacer fig 4 d a bumpy micro morphological pattern was observed on the surface this means that the cnt aggregation occurring at a concentration of cnt over 2 affects the bumpy roughness of the spacer surface in addition the 1 cnt spacer and the 2 cnt spacer showed high standard deviations of 12 6 μm and 18 2 μm respectively indicating that the 1 and 2 cnt spacers had multiscale roughness of varying degrees the graphene embedded spacers showed a roughness standard deviation similar to that of the pla spacer however micro scale roughness increased in the following order 1 cnt spacer 25 2 12 6 μm 0 5 cnt spacer 12 2 5 3 μm 1 graphene spacer 5 3 3 9 μm 0 5 graphene spacer 5 0 1 3 μm in here cnt with 3d particle structure showed a rough surface due to aggregation but graphene with 2d structure was well dispersed and no surface change fig 5 a shows the correlation between surface roughness and f 1 as previously stated in practice the lower f 1 the higher the roughness of the spacer surface this means that embedding carbon nanofillers in the spacer results in multi scale roughness owing to the addition of carbon nanofillers forming a cassie baxter surface on the spacer surface in addition the values of wca tended to be similar to those of roughness and the higher the roughness the higher the wca fig 5 b the spacer hydrophobicity was the highest when the roughness on the spacer increased to 44 18 2 μm this indicates that embedding carbon nanofillers in the spacer increases the surface roughness by increasing the trapped air ratio on the surface furthermore it increases the hydrophobicity of the spacer surface fig 5 b therefore surface roughness plays a key role in determining the hydrophobicity of the spacer surface 3 3 performance of rough spacers 3 3 1 md efficiency depending spacer roughness the use of a spacer increased the mpf compared to md operation without a spacer fig 6 then the use of carbon nanofiller embedded spacers was found to result in an improved mpf compared to the use of the pla spacer in the absence of a spacer only membrane mpf was 15 9 4 9 lmh the pla spacer 27 1 2 4 lmh resulted in a 171 increase in mpf compared to no spacer this means that spacers promote fluid mixing in the membrane module taamneh and bataineh 2017 thereby increasing the efficiency of the md process the 1 graphene spacer achieved an mpf of 38 9 2 8 lmh which is 143 more than the pla spacer furthermore 1 and 2 cnt spacers achieved better mpf performances than the pla spacer 113 and 175 higher respectively the 2 cnt spacer showed the best performance with the highest mpf of 47 5 2 4 lmh the order of mpf was as follows 2 cnt spacer 47 5 2 4 lmh 1 graphene spacer 38 9 2 8 lmh 1 cnt spacer 30 6 2 0 lmh pla spacer 27 1 2 4 lmh no spacer only membrane 15 9 4 9 lmh in terms of surface roughness table 1 mpf performance tended to similar with the surface roughness 2 cnt spacer 1 graphene spacer 1 cnt spacer pla spacer of the spacer fig 5 c the reason why the rough surface spacer made the higher flux is that the rough surface interrupted feed flow and created turbulence if the flow velocity near the membrane surface is increased by turbulence generated on rough surface the flux can be improved this indicates that a rougher surface spacer could improve the mpf performance in the md process and suggests that a rough spacer surface can cause more turbulence and improve the efficiency of the md process in addition a suitable roughness is expected to increase the efficiency further moreover the use of a spacer was found to enhance the ire presumably owing to the reduction in cp fig 6 the permeate ion concentration was found to decrease in the following order no spacer only membrane used 19 54 3 3 μs cm pla spacer 3 0 1 3 μs cm 1 graphene spacer 2 97 0 1 μs cm 1 cnt spacer 0 9 0 6 μs cm 2 cnt spacer 0 13 0 4 μs cm ire was above 97 when spacers were used however it is impossible to operate for a long time without controlling the cp the cp must be controlled in the md process because it allows for long term operation without membrane contamination and increases the life of the membrane cp causes membrane wetting and a high concentration near the membrane surface and feed water passes through the membrane reducing the ire therefore the cp is related to the ire graphene embedded spacer had relatively smooth surface while cnt embedded spacer had bumpy surface as cnt showed aggregation effects fig 4 which is probably due to their different dispersion states this study showed that the cnt embedded spacer with multi scale roughness increased both mpf and ire but the change in physical properties and increase in hydrophobicity due to graphene increase the mpf but not ire since graphene and cnts share the same chemistry we consider that both graphene and cnt embedded spacers should have similar characteristics except surface roughness so these results indicate that an increased spacer surface roughness promotes membrane surface turbulence and convective mass transfer near the membrane surface as reported by the previous study lee et al 2018 high flow velocity increased mpf and reduced polarization effects due to increased local mass transfer near the membrane surfaces this suggests that only the cnt embedded spacer can control the cp effect during the md process our results are consistent with the reported findings that the rough surface spacers exhibit high local velocity and consequently enhanced convective mass transfer thereby mitigating the polarization effects and improving the mpf and ire 3 3 2 effect of cnt spacer on md performance fig 7 shows the mpf and permeate ion concentration in the md operation using spacers fabricated at different cnt concentrations mpf was found to increase as the cnt concentration increased from 0 to 0 5 then the mpf of the spacer of 0 5 1 cnt concentration seemed to decrease as the cnt concentration increased however the 2 cnt spacer achieved the highest mpf fig 7 shows the mpf and permeate ion concentration in the md operation with spacers fabricated at different cnt concentrations the mpf increased as the cnt concentration increased from 0 to 0 5 then the mpf of the spacer embedded 0 5 1 cnt concentration seemed to decrease as the cnt concentration increased however the 2 cnt spacer achieved the highest mpf permeate ion concentration seemed to increase as the concentration of cnts increased from 0 to 0 25 but decreased as the concentration of cnts increased from 0 25 to 2 complete ion rejection was achieved with the 2 cnt overall the ire increased as a function of the cnt concentration this indicates that the cnt containing spacer effectively reduced the cp effect table 2 shows the mpf wca and roughness as a function of cnt concentration overall both the wca and roughness increased as the cnt concentration increased in particular the higher the cnt concentration the higher the standard deviation of the spacer surface roughness this means that cnt promotes multi scale roughness by creating different roughness sizes on the spacer surface multi scale roughness refers to roughness on various scales from mirco to nano so it appears high standard deviation it creates irregular turbulences and some of them forms high voltage turbulence it increases flow rate nearby membrane surface and reduces polarization effects due to reducing of boundary layer consequently multi scale roughness can improve mrf in our results the mpf increased as the roughness increased but decreased at some cnt concentrations the 0 25 0 75 cnt spacer showed no difference in the roughness but only a change in the standard deviation of the roughness however the 0 75 cnt spacer had a smaller standard deviation of roughness than the 0 25 and 0 5 cnt spacers corresponding to a lower mpf in particular wca and the roughness of the 2 cnts increased suddenly with a high standard deviation of roughness this is in agreement with the highest mpf of 2 cnt spacer and indicates that the enhancement in mpf can be mainly attributed to the increased multi scale roughness 3 4 computational fluid dynamics cfd 3 4 1 average water and salt fluxes under a range of water and salt permeances fig 8 shows average water and salt fluxes for the membrane area coloured in red in fig 2 over a wide range of water and salt permeances fig 8 a and b shows the results of simulations with varied water permeance 0 5 10 7 to 2 0 10 6 kg m2 s pa and fixed salt permeance 1 10 10 m s when evaluating the differences between the cnt free and cnt embedded spacers it was hypothesized that surface roughness would affect the micro hydrodynamics near the membrane surfaces leading to enhanced micro mixing that can mitigate tp this hypothesis was made based on the experimental observations shown in table 2 at high cnt concentrations of 1 a marked increase in surface roughness and mean water flux was observed on the other hand at low cnt concentrations surface roughness and mean water flux did not exhibit distinct trends after considering the measurement errors as shown in fig 8 a and b the average water flux increased from approximately 22 to 55 lmh for both smooth and rough spacers in contrast the salt fluxes did not exhibit a marked variation with an increased water permeance i e 1 5 10 5 kg m2 h to 1 9 10 5 kg m2 h this is because the main driving force of water permeation through membranes in dcmd is the difference in vapour pressure between the feed and permeate streams derived from the temperature gradients a slight increase in the calculated salt fluxes with increasing water permeance was attributed to the cp aggravated by the enhanced water flux pla spacers achieved approximately 30 lmh fig 6 which can be equivalently achieved with a water permeance of 7 10 6 to 8 10 6 kg m2 s pa the average water fluxes obtained from the multiphysics simulation are also in the reported order of magnitude alkhudhiri et al 2012 from 1 to 63 kg m2 h which were experimentally measured depending on the feed concentration temperature and velocity fig 8 c and d show the average water and salt fluxes respectively with the water permeance fixed at 8 10 7 kg m2 s pa and the salt permeance varied over a range of 1 10 10 m s to 1 10 9 m s salt fluxes were found to rise linearly with salt permeance from 1 64 10 5 kg m2 hr to 1 64 10 4 kg m2 hr whereas water fluxes remain unchanged with varying salt permeance increasing salt permeation was found to negligibly affect water fluxes under the selected simulation conditions because md membranes can achieve almost 100 rejection in other words even the highest salt permeance chosen in this study tended to 100 salt rejection this can be observed from the calculated permeate concentrations shown in fig s2 a and b in the supporting information as well as the experimental results in fig 7 the conductivity of the permeate measured in the experiments was translated to the nacl concentration via a calibration relation as reported in the literature aldalbahi et al 2017 our experiments demonstrate that permeate concentrations range between 6 8 10 5 g l and 3 67 10 3 g l depending on the spacer type while the computational simulations achieved 3 5 10 4 to 5 2 10 3 g l which is found at the upper end of the experimental measurements in addition the trends of a decreasing permeate concentration with an increasing cnt content in the spacers can be related to our simulation results demonstrating that the permeate concentration for smooth spacers is predicted to be higher than that for rough spacers most importantly the performances of the smooth and rough filaments were comparable in terms of water and salt fluxes there were only negligible differences in the computed results between the two spacers as shown in fig 8 a and c the average water fluxes with rough filaments were higher by 0 6 1 4 than those with smooth filaments over the range of varied permeance parameters this is qualitatively in agreement with our experimental results where the cnt embedded spacers outperformed pla spacers although the performance disparity between the two spacers predicted by the current computational approach can be said to be almost negligible the present work is an initial attempt to investigate the mechanisms of flux enhancement via surface roughness induced micromixing in the presence of cnt embedded spacers using a simplistic approach with several assumptions first the simulation domains were in 2d and were unable to fully describe the hydrodynamics present within an actual spacer filled channel second the increased hydrophobicity of spacers with high cnt content was not accounted for which could be critical in dcmd as shown in table 2 there was a significant jump in contact angle from 1 cnt spacer to 2 cnt spacer finally the membrane material and permeate channel which influence the calculation of heat transfer and temperature distributions were omitted in this study according a recent paper ansari et al 2023 different shapes detachment of spacer filaments improved the water flux and tp coefficient in particular cnts are known to exhibit excellent thermal conductivity which may help mitigate the tp despite the underestimation of the performance improvement of rough spacers in multiphysics simulations a qualitative analysis of the simulation results provides insight into the effects of surface roughness under dcmd conditions which is discussed in the following sections 3 4 2 spatial distributions of flow velocity temperature and concentration fig 9 displays velocity fields obtained from the multiphysics simulation at water permeance of 2 10 6 kg m2 s pa which are almost independent of water permeance due to the trivial value of water permeation velocity compared to bulk flow velocity i e 0 064 m s of inlet velocity vs 1 5 10 5 m s of peak permeation velocity as shown in fig 9 a and b the flow becomes stabilized and appears to be periodic after the fourth filament at the bottom wall differences in flow behaviours between smooth and rough filaments are shown in more in detail in fig 9 c f both spacers accompany flow recirculation and stagnation in the areas confined by spacers and membrane walls however the size of flow recirculation for the two scenarios is slightly different as shown in the velocity vector plots in fig 9 e and f the recirculation region in the smooth filaments shown in fig 9 e appears to be thinner and more stretched than that in the rough filaments this is attributed to a more disturbed flow near the rough spacer surfaces as shown in fig 10 c and d which could potentially enhance fluid mixing furthermore it can be expected that corrugated surfaces create tiny hollow rooms between the spacer surface and membrane walls while supporting a sheet of membranes which could be beneficial for mitigating tp and cp the temperature and concentration distributions obtained from the multiphysics simulations are shown in fig 10 for a more distinct visualisation of tp and cp the simulation scenario with the highest water permeance 2 10 6 kg m2 s pa was selected polarisation phenomena were observed in both temperature and concentration distributions albeit to different degrees the polarisation regions were consistent with the recirculation zones shown in fig 9 the minimum wall temperatures in the smooth and rough filaments were similar at approximately 31 c fig s4 in supporting information cold spots mainly appeared in the vicinity of the spacer membrane contact in both spacers for concentration distributions polarised areas had a concentration up to four times larger than the bulk concentration that is the wall concentration increased as high as 144 g l near the sharp edge of the spacer membrane contact point owing to the differences in micromixing that occur adjacent to the spacer surfaces the shapes of the polarised regions were formed differently this can be observed more clearly in the axial temperature and concentration profiles shown in fig s4 in the supporting information 3 4 3 water and salt fluxes along the membrane walls the axial variations in the water and salt fluxes are presented in fig 11 first the values of fluxes for both smooth and rough spacers did not differ significantly although there are small discrepancies in peak values then the trends of axial water fluxes tended to vary noticeably in each cycle whereas the salt fluxes were rather flat the positions of the peak water flux coincided with the lowered tp for example comparing fig 10 a and b with fig 11 b the back of the bottom filaments exhibited a small polarised area higher temperature area fig 10 a for smooth spacers and water flux peaks appeared at the corresponding positions fig 11 b fig 11 can be used to understand the results of average water and salt fluxes shown in fig 8 the predicted water and salt fluxes for smooth and rough spacers in fig 11 a and b were approximately the same except for minor variations near the centres of spacer filaments the rough spacers had higher water fluxes at the first filament cycle than the smooth spacers contributing to the higher averaged flux as shown in fig 8 the shape of flux curves also indicates that the front of spacer filaments in the positive axial direction had aggravated tp and cp compared to the back of filaments in the negative axial direction which coincides with the shape of stagnation zone depicted in fig 9 e and f further results on concentration and temperature at the top and bottom membranes are shown in fig s4 which exhibited similar patterns to water and salt fluxes respectively 4 conclusions this study showed that md performance could be improved using carbon nanofiller embedded spacers and that the surface roughness of spacers could induce micromixing near the membrane surfaces via experiments and cfd simulations the key results of this study are summarised as follows in terms of mpf and ire spacer design has been pre optimized to following conditions a 45 crossing angle of the spacer filament a 1 0 mm thickness of spacer and a 4 mm arrangement interval of the filament the surface of the carbon nanofiller embedded spacers became a cassie baxter surface and was rougher than pristine spacers in addition the surface roughness was found to be linked to the hydrophobicity of the spacer surface the carbon nanofiller embedded spacer showed a more hydrophobic surface the highest roughness and hydrophobicity were achieved by 2 cnt spacer wca and roughness are 96 4 3 4 and 64 1 8 4 μm respectively the higher the surface roughness the higher the flux with a roughness of 64 1 8 4 μm the spacer achieved the highest mpf performance although carbon fillers increased the mpf graphene did not improve the ire and only cnt improved the ire performance in the md process embedding the cnt the increased wca on the spacer surface and cnt spacer increased ire from the concentration of cnt above 0 5 the best ire performance was achieved using the 2 cnt spacer further research on the ire improvement cp control mechanism of cnt embedded spacers is required preliminary cfd simulations demonstrated that flow could be more disturbed by micro mixing in the rough spacers than in the smooth spacers which could potentially be related to the mitigated tp and cp these simulation results indicate that the mpf was enhanced owing to the increased surface roughness caused by cnt which could affect the tp and cp declaration of competing

15108,wastewater surveillance is a passive and efficient way to monitor the spread of infectious diseases in large populations and high transmission areas such as prek 12 schools infections caused by respiratory viruses in school aged children are likely underreported particularly because many children may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic wastewater monitoring of sars cov 2 has been studied extensively and primarily by sampling at centralized wastewater treatment plants and there are limited studies on sars cov 2 in prek 12 school wastewater similarly wastewater detections of influenza have only been reported in wastewater treatment plant and university manhole samples here we present the results of a 17 month wastewater monitoring program for sars cov 2 n 2176 samples and influenza a and b n 1217 samples in 51 prek 12 schools we show that school wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 rna were strongly associated with covid 19 cases in schools and community positivity rates and that influenza detections in school wastewater were significantly associated with citywide influenza diagnosis rates results were communicated back to schools and local communities to enable mitigation strategies to stop the spread and direct resources such as testing and vaccination clinics this study demonstrates that school wastewater surveillance is reflective of local infections at several population levels and plays a crucial role in the detection and mitigation of outbreaks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based epidemiology sars cov 2 influenza prek 12 schools covid 19 data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction schools are a known source of respiratory viral outbreaks in communities wang et al 2014 the large number of students and staff in close proximity to one another makes schools a high risk area and enables the transmission of infectious diseases murray et al 2021 consequently the onset of school sessions are correlated with acute respiratory infections especially among students ages 5 17 temte et al 2019 this correlation is also seen among other age groups suggesting secondary transmission within student households temte et al 2019 covid 19 outbreaks in schools created increases in secondary transmission and in turn school closures that may have led to negative effects on student learning and increased strain on families falk et al 2021 national center for immunization and respiratory diseases ncird division of viral diseases 2020 tomasik et al 2021 influenza outbreaks are also common in schools with prek 12 children facing the highest age based influenza attack rate of approximately 30 heymann et al 2009 wang et al 2014 school transmission of influenza and sars cov 2 not only affects school aged children and their families but is also associated with community wide outbreaks chao et al 2010 chernozhukov et al 2021 rapid detection of these viruses in schools can provide the time needed to initiate measures to mitigate transmission precautions such as contact tracing and isolation of close contacts are associated with reductions in transmission of sars cov 2 and influenza but require ample time for implementation sinha et al 2021 wang et al 2014 the ability to quickly recognize the onset of potential outbreaks in schools is crucial in preventing further spread into the community clinical testing has traditionally been used to monitor respiratory viral outbreaks such as influenza and sars cov 2 however compiling testing data from various health care facilities such as clinics hospitals and emergency rooms to obtain an accurate incidence estimate is time consuming and can allow the virus more time to proliferate throughout the community lu et al 2018 additionally clinical surveillance metrics only capture a fraction of infections this issue is exacerbated by infected individuals with asymptomatic or mild cases that do not seek medical care under ascertainment as well as underreporting due to non reportable at home tests and atypical presentations that lead to misdiagnoses bivins et al 2020 mccarthy et al 2020 rader et al 2022 wolfe et al 2022 under ascertainment is a relevant problem in schools because children with covid 19 may be more likely than adults to be asymptomatic or to have a mild case making it less likely that their infection will be detected using clinical methods falk et al 2021 ludvigsson 2020 national center for immunization and respiratory diseases ncird division of viral diseases 2020 in contrast wastewater surveillance is a passive efficient and relatively fast method that overcomes many of the challenges faced by clinical diagnostic testing wastewater information is not biased by differences in access to testing resources or by health seeking behavior olesen et al 2021 wastewater surveillance s pooled sample strategy allows for the simultaneous and rapid sampling of large groups of people bibby et al 2021 d aoust et al 2021 larsen and wigginton 2020 sutton et al 2022 wastewater viral concentrations for both influenza and sars cov 2 have been shown to correlate with community wide clinical diagnostic trends al duroobi et al 2021 bethel et al 2021 kaya et al 2022 layton et al 2022 mercier et al 2022 peccia et al 2020 using wastewater surveillance can enable the detection of infection outbreaks where clinical data is not able to rapidly detect mao et al 2020 wu et al 2022 in addition to monitoring large populations by sampling at centralized wastewater treatment plants wastewater monitoring has also been applied to monitor individual facilities and buildings previous studies detected sars cov 2 in the wastewater of facilities such as nursing homes universities and hospitals gibas et al 2021 scott et al 2021 spurbeck et al 2021 in a study monitoring nursing home wastewater a positive wastewater detection of sars cov 2 occurred when only one out of sixty residents were positive for covid 19 spurbeck et al 2021 additionally a university based study detected asymptomatic cases that were not otherwise identified by the campus monitoring program gibas et al 2021 school wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 has shown a correlation between wastewater viral concentrations of sars cov 2 in schools and community cases of covid 19 castro gutierrez et al 2022 therefore school wastewater monitoring could serve as building level surveillance with the ability to identify infections within the facility and reflect the infection burden of the larger community that the school serves crowe et al 2021 while there are a limited number of studies on wastewater monitoring of sars cov 2 in prek 12 school settings castro gutierrez et al 2022 crowe et al 2021 fielding miller et al 2021 no previous studies have expanded school monitoring to include other respiratory viruses such as influenza influenza and respiratory syncytial virus rsv are also shed in stool and are detectable in wastewater akbari et al 2017 al khatib et al 2021 chan et al 2011 heijnen and medema 2011 hirose et al 2016 hughes et al 2022 to et al 2010 von linstow et al 2006 only two studies to date have applied wastewater surveillance for influenza and they demonstrated its ability to detect community outbreaks by monitoring wastewater treatment plants or manholes that serve 10 000 people mercier et al 2022 wolfe et al 2022 here we expand on wastewater disease surveillance for respiratory viruses in prek 12 school settings we quantified sars cov 2 and influenza a in the wastewater of 51 prek 12 schools across houston over a 17 month period we compared wastewater detections to available diagnostic pcr testing data performed at the schools as well as community zip code level positivity rates for covid 19 and citywide syndromic surveillance data on influenza we show that wastewater monitoring is an effective pooled sample monitoring strategy that reflects the prevalence of infection in the school as well as the surrounding community we describe how the information was communicated to the schools and used by the houston health department for targeted vaccination campaigns 2 methods 2 1 selection of schools samples were obtained from 51 prek 12 schools across houston texas from december 7th 2020 to may 9th 2022 the schools included 39 elementary schools and early childhood centers 5 middle schools 5 high schools and 2 combined grade level schools enrollment information for each school is provided in table s1 these schools were categorized as high risk schools based on zip code level covid positivity rates vaccination rates and covid 19 community vulnerability index ccvi the location of the schools within houston is shown in fig 1 and they were clustered in three groups north southwest and southeast based on driving routes for sample pickup 2 2 sample collection wastewater samples were collected once a week using refrigerated time weighted composite autosamplers located in or adjacent to the school manholes the composite samplers drew from manholes that only received wastewater from the selected schools with no contributions from other sources on sample collection days the composite samplers were programmed to collect 250 ml every 15 min between the hours of 6am and 12pm this ensured that samples were fresh and not stored in an autosampler for more than a few hours once a week team members from the houston health department collected and delivered the school wastewater samples to rice university for processing and analysis samples were kept on ice during transport and stored at 4 c in the laboratory the wastewater samples were aliquoted into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and were concentrated within 24 h of collection the 17 month sampling campaign for sars cov 2 spanned from december 7th 2020 to may 9th 2022 and we added influenza a and b quantification on september 27th 2021 for a total of 7 months of influenza analysis over the entire study period 2176 samples were analyzed for sars cov 2 and 1217 samples were analyzed for influenza 2 3 concentration extraction and quantification of sars cov 2 and influenza a and b wastewater samples were concentrated using an ha filtration and bead beating method as previously described laturner et al 2021 lou et al 2022 between december 7th 2020 and january 25 2021 rna extraction was performed using the maxwell 48 rsc automated platform as8500 promega and the modified protocol for the maxwell rsc purefood gmo and authentication kit as1600 promega beginning february 1st 2021 and for the remainder of the study period the chemagic prime viral dna rna 300 kit h96 chemagic cmg 1433 perkinelmer was used for rna extraction as described by lou et al 2022 we performed a head to head comparison of sars cov 2 concentrations using maxwell and chemagic extraction methods to determine an adjustment factor for converting maxwell concentration levels to chemagic levels detailed in supplemental material sections s1 4 and s2 3 the concentrations of sars cov 2 n1 and n2 genes and influenza a and b were quantified using a one step rt ddpcr assay rt ddpcr was completed using the qx200 autodg droplet digital pcr system bio rad and a c1000 thermal cycler bio rad sars cov 2 and influenza quantifications require identical thermal cycler conditions so rt ddpcr was often performed for sars cov 2 and influenza simultaneously additional details on maxwell rna extraction primers and probes assay setup and thermal cycling conditions are also available in the supplemental material detailed protocols for concentration factor calculations rt ddpcr thermal cycler conditions limit of detection lod rt ddpcr reaction compositions and quality control measures are as described previously lou et al 2022 2 4 classification of results as positive negative or inconclusive each wastewater sample was processed as two concentration replicates and we classified the sample as either positive negative or inconclusive for sars cov 2 and influenza a and b using the following logic for sars cov 2 there were 4 sars cov 2 measurements for each sample n1 and n2 for each concentration replicate when 3 measurements were above lod samples were called positive for sars cov 2 when no measurements were greater than the lod samples were called negative for sars cov 2 in cases with only 1 or 2 measurements greater than the lod the samples were called inconclusive for influenza results were based on a single target measurement for 2 concentration replicates for each sample for both influenza a and b when the 2 measurements for influenza a were greater than the lod the samples were determined to be positive for influenza a when neither measurement was greater than the lod the samples were identified as negative for influenza a in cases with 1 measurement greater than the lod and 1 measurement below the samples were deemed inconclusive this logic was also applied for influenza b analysis 2 5 clinical testing of individuals for sars cov 2 at schools the houston health department carried out a sars cov 2 pcr testing program for consenting students and staff at 259 prek 12 schools 46 of which were part of this study s school wastewater monitoring program consenting participants n 3213 participants were offered free pcr testing weekly but could choose to opt out up to 12 weeks of diagnostic testing data was obtained from the schools and an average of 9 3 weeks of data per school was gathered across all 46 sites over the course of the testing program the weekly positivity rates positive tests divided by total tests performed for each school were provided by the houston health department the specimen collection dates were used to aggregate the clinical testing results by school week monday friday the pcr diagnostic testing data for each school was compared to the measured concentrations of sars cov 2 in its wastewater samples collected the same week all procedures involving human participants were approved by the institutional review board irb fy2020 300 modeling of covid19 lab test results in space and times and were performed in accordance with applicable guidelines 2 6 aggregated zip code school wastewater and pcr data we used imputation to replace wastewater measurements below the limit of detection the imputed values were set as the maximum between the actual observed value and half the lod here the lod was assumed to be 2556 copies l which corresponds to the approximate concentration of 3 positive droplets per reaction well the wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 of schools within the same zip code were aggregated by averaging the n1 and n2 measurements of each school after imputation and taking the average of those measurements across schools in the same zip code covid 19 diagnostic pcr testing results were extracted from the houston electronic disease surveillance system hedss and included persons located within one of the 105 houston area zip codes test records were deduplicated by person by specimen date such that if a person was tested multiple times in a single day they were counted only once for that day and if a person tested across multiple days they were counted once per each of those days results were aggregated by specimen date and the daily positivity rate was calculated as the number of persons with a positive test divided by the number of persons pcr tested the daily positivity rates of all schools in the same zip code collected within the same week were averaged to obtain weekly zip code positivity rates 2 7 citywide influenza rates syndromic surveillance was used to determine a citywide percentage of discharge diagnosis influenza from reporting healthcare facilities including hospitals emergency departments community and school based clinics and surgery centers to obtain the percentage of visits with a discharge diagnosis of influenza the houston health department s electronic syndromic surveillance system for the early notification of community based epidemics essence was searched for the number of visits with an influenza related code in the discharge diagnosis regardless of influenza strain this number was then divided by the number of total visits in essence and multiplied by 100 all visits were filtered by zip code and or county to only include patients from the houston harris county area we chose to compare discharge diagnosis influenza rates as opposed to influenza like illness ilis rates because of the abundance of similar respiratory viruses such as sars cov 2 and rsv that were likely contributing to ili rates counts were aggregated by week sunday to saturday 2 8 statistical analysis we used r for all data analyses our code for these analyses is available at https github com hou wastewater epi org school wastewater surveillance since the sars cov 2 positivity rates at the schools were all very low or zero we transformed the positivity rate measurement into a binary 0 for zero positivity rate 1 for positive positivity rate variable we used this binary variable as our dependent variable in a logistic regression model with the log wastewater concentration on the associated date as the independent variable using logistic regression we estimated the effect of the wastewater concentration on the probability of a nonzero number of positive cases that week we used linear regression to model the effect of wastewater concentration on the positivity rate at the zip code level for sars cov 2 we explored various regression models including addition of random effects components for each replicate but ultimately chose the simple linear model for its combination of good model fit and interpretability for influenza we used linear regression to model the relationship between the citywide rate of influenza and the school influenza wastewater detection rates we used the proportion of the 51 schools with a positive detection of influenza in a given week as our independent variable with the citywide rate of visits diagnosed with influenza as the dependent variable 3 results 3 1 school wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 rna were representative of covid 19 cases in schools we collected 2176 school wastewater samples over a 17 month period we assayed 2176 samples for sars cov 2 and 1217 samples for influenza a and b of the 2176 samples assayed for sars cov 2 22 3 486 were positive 9 1 197 were inconclusive and 68 6 1493 were below the limit of detection of the positive samples wastewater concentrations averaged 141 248 10th percentile 3293 90th percentile 226 617 copies l there was no relationship between wastewater concentration and school enrollment numbers fig 2 b fig 3 shows the distribution of weekly sars cov 2 detections in 51 prek 12 schools over the study period pcr diagnostic testing was completed at selected sites to examine the relationship between wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 in schools and school covid 19 cases only 13 weeks of diagnostic pcr testing data from the schools was collected and the majority of the school pcr positivity rates were zero 71 further the pcr testing program was not mandatory and thus the testing results were not comprehensive despite these limitations we observed a significant positive relationship between school wastewater concentrations for sars cov 2 and the probability of a non zero sars cov 2 positivity rate at the school fig 4 β1 1 14 p 0 0001 in other words schools with a 10 times higher sars cov 2 wastewater concentration have an estimated 3 1 times higher odds of a positive test result based on the results of the logistic regression model 3 2 school wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 rna were representative of community positivity rates for sars cov 2 we compared school wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 to the positivity rate of the zip code that they are located in this was performed by averaging the wastewater sars cov 2 concentrations of the schools located in the same zip code and using linear regression to model the effect of the averaged school wastewater concentration on the zip code positivity rate at the zip code level fig 5 the wastewater concentrations were significant predictors of zip code positivity rates fig 5 β1 0 05 p 0 0001 the regression model estimates an expected increase of 0 05 in the zip code positivity rate for every 1 unit increase in log sars cov 2 copies per liter this positive association indicates that school wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 rna were representative of community positivity rates of sars cov 2 3 3 influenza a detections in school wastewater were representative of citywide influenza rates detections of influenza a rna in school wastewater were compared to the citywide rates of discharge diagnosed influenza of the 1217 wastewater samples assayed for influenza a and b none were positive for influenza b for influenza a 2 6 32 of samples were positive 1 6 19 were inconclusive and 95 8 1166 were below the limit of detection fig 6 shows detections of influenza a in school wastewater over the course of the study period of the positive samples for influenza a wastewater concentrations averaged 31 570 10th percentile 1929 90th percentile 58 300 copies l the wastewater concentrations of influenza a were generally lower than the positive sars cov 2 concentrations fig s1 this pattern remained consistent when concentrations of sars cov 2 and influenza a were compared across grade levels fig s2 citywide rates of visits with a discharge diagnosis of influenza over the study period are shown in fig 7 a a linear regression model revealed a significant positive relationship between the proportion of schools with a positive wastewater detection and the citywide rate of visits with a discharge diagnosis of influenza fig 7b β1 0 128 p 0 0001 these results indicate that influenza detections in school wastewater were representative of citywide influenza diagnosis rates 4 discussion our findings indicate that wastewater can be used to passively monitor respiratory viruses in schools without requiring participants to engage in health seeking behaviors unlike other passive surveillance systems based on clinical testing we show that wastewater detections of sars cov 2 were consistent with reported cases within the school and community positivity rates and influenza detections were consistent with citywide influenza diagnosis rates wastewater monitoring can offer valuable insight into school outbreaks and enable timely mitigation strategies that decrease the likelihood of secondary transmission into the students families and communities targeted mitigation strategies include identifying positive individuals through diagnostic testing vaccinations and masking in schools and local communities wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 and influenza is especially crucial in prek 12 schools as many infected children have asymptomatic or mild cases and do not seek medical attention or diagnostic testing likely leading to an underreporting of infections zimmermann and curtis 2021 the ability to identify these cases is crucial in preventing the spread of outbreaks as prek 12 schools are often areas of high transmission for respiratory viruses and other pathogens ghani et al 2010 glatman freedman et al 2012 murray et al 2021 this wastewater monitoring process is flexible and can be modified to detect various pathogens that are shed in stool and urine with relative ease school wastewater monitoring s ability to passively reflect community infections is critical in detecting and preventing the spread of future outbreaks here we expand on the findings of the limited number of studies that have investigated sars cov 2 in prek 12 school wastewater by performing a 17 month school wastewater surveillance program that spans three different covid 19 waves in houston driven by the alpha delta and omicron variants at 51 prek 12 schools resulting in 2176 samples crowe et al 2021 performed a 5 week pilot investigation of three k 12 schools that supplemented saliva based pcr testing with environmental samples from wastewater surfaces and indoor air crowe et al 2021 sars cov 2 was detected in school wastewater for 12 of the 14 85 7 individual school weeks that also experienced positive pcr test results this generally consistent relationship between sars cov 2 wastewater detections and clinical diagnostic testing is similar to the association found in our study our study found a significant positive relationship between school wastewater sars cov 2 concentration and the probability of a school s nonzero positivity rate based on nasal based pcr testing fig 4 β1 1 14 p 0 0001 fielding miller et al 2021 identified associations between positive school wastewater detections of sars cov 2 and positive school cases of covid 19 fielding miller et al 2021 they sampled nine k 12 schools over the course of 12 weeks totaling 447 samples weekly diagnostic testing was offered to students and staff and 67 of positive cases identified by this testing were associated with a positive wastewater detection of sars cov 2 castro gutierrez et al 2022 analyzed 296 samples for sars cov 2 over a 9 week wastewater monitoring study of 16 schools castro gutierrez et al 2022 they detected sars cov 2 in 47 3 of wastewater samples they reported a significant positive correlation between school wastewater weekly positivity rates and community covid 19 cases pearson s correlation coefficient 0 33 p 0 01 when school wastewater rates led community cases by two weeks we also extended the wastewater surveillance of influenza into prek 12 schools for the first time we monitored influenza a and b concentrations in the wastewater of 51 prek 12 schools over the course of 7 months n 1217 samples while no other studies to date have implemented influenza wastewater surveillance in prek 12 schools a limited number of previous studies have demonstrated the ability to detect community influenza outbreaks using wastewater mercier et al 2022 wolfe et al 2022 one study investigated two separate influenza a outbreaks in universities university of michigan and stanford university by comparing the universities influenza a wastewater concentrations to clinical data gathered from university health services and student athlete surveillance respectively wolfe et al 2022 the concentrations of influenza a in the university of michigan s wastewater ranged from nondetect to 2 63 104 copies g with a median of 1 03 104 copies g stanford university wastewater concentrations of influenza ranged from nondetect to 1 27 105 copies g with nondetect as the median the average influenza a concentration in our study on a per mass basis 3 16 101 copies ml where mass of 1 ml 1 g was comparable to the levels reported in their study even though wastewater concentrations are a function of the number of infected individuals in the community we observed concentration levels at similar orders of magnitude to results from previous studies wolfe et al s results indicated that wastewater concentrations of influenza a were strongly associated with the 5 day smoothed incidence rate of influenza a at both universities university of michigan τ 0 58 p 10 7 n 45 and stanford university τ 0 67 p 10 14 n 43 similarly our study examined the relationship between the proportion of schools with a positive influenza wastewater detection and the citywide percentage of visits with discharge diagnosed influenza fig 7b β1 0 128 p 0 0001 mercier et al 2022 also compared influenza a and b concentrations in neighborhood wastewater and citywide primary clarified sludge with pcr test rates mercier et al 2022 they reported a strong positive association when the citywide primary sludge influenza concentrations led the pcr rates by 17 days r 0 97 p 0 05 n 14 they also detected influenza a in 60 n 79 of all samples a much higher detection rate than observed in this study 2 6 this difference in detection rates could be due to differences in community influenza rates influenza rna concentrations in primary clarified sludge versus raw wastewater and or sampling at centralized wastewater treatment plant versus at manholes that capture wastewater from individual schools additionally these studies measured influenza a in solid fractions as opposed to liquid fractions providing evidence that influenza a partitions to solids mercier et al 2022 wolfe et al 2022 this could lead to variability in detection rates as inhibition may differentially impact the recoveries of influenza from the liquid and solid fractions consistent across all of these studies and our work is that wastewater detections of influenza reflected clinical infection rates future research should investigate factors that impact influenza recovery from both the liquid and solid fractions of wastewater samples as well as optimization of sampling schemes for public health interventions the findings of our wastewater monitoring program were reported back to the schools and used by the houston health department to target interventions in the local communities every week the sars cov 2 and influenza school wastewater results were communicated to each school s point of contact typically the nurse and or principal this line of communication assisted with identifying positive covid 19 and influenza cases and enabled the timely implementation of mitigation strategies in the case of a positive school wastewater detection of sars cov 2 the houston health department assessed the school s covid 19 history and its current covid 19 status they prioritized any cases in need of contact tracing that had not yet been reached in the case of a covid 19 outbreak in a school the health department planned an intervention and scheduled an enhanced site visit within 24 72 h houston health department maintained active outreach with the school s point of contact to ensure daily reporting and distributed isolation and quarantine letters to cases and contacts as needed the houston health department hhd also used data from the wastewater monitoring program to create the hhd weekly influenza reports these reports were shared internally with houston health department leadership the texas department of state health services dshs local and nearby counties and jurisdictions and rice university leadership additionally the houston health department published the reports on their website for public viewing weekly wastewater monitoring results were also shared with the community through sars cov 2 zip code fact sheets and the city of houston sars cov 2 wastewater monitoring dashboard covidwwtp spatialstudieslab org the fact sheets provided the sars cov 2 wastewater detection status for every school in the given zip code as well as information on community covid 19 vaccination rates these fact sheets were part of a houston health department initiative to use schools as a springboard into the community to encourage vaccinations the health department hosted free influenza and covid 19 vaccine clinics for communities based on the results of the school wastewater monitoring program while there are many advantages to school wastewater monitoring there are still limitations wastewater is a complex matrix that is affected by environmental factors that are not always identified leading to inherent variability and uncertainties pulicharla et al 2021 this can make it difficult to determine how directly wastewater concentrations reflect the number of infected individuals some infections are likely missed due to low viral loads in the wastewater that are either not obtained by sampling or are lower than the limit of detection cdc 2022 toilet use behavior in schools is also a source of variability that impacts the likelihood of detecting infected individuals at school via wastewater monitoring additionally the aggregation of school positivity rates from pcr testing which was performed over several days could lead to discrepancies when compared to wastewater data which was analyzed one day per week most of the clinical testing was completed the same day that the wastewater was sampled however some testing was performed on other days of the week to accommodate the schools and testing teams the relative timing of pcr and wastewater testing data trends is an area that requires further investigation and could be informed by fecal shedding distributions for each virus and their variants fecal shedding of influenza and specifically whether influenza infects intestinal cells and is consequently shed in the feces is not well established however some studies suggest that swallowed nasopharyngeal secretions that contain influenza or the dissemination of influenza through the blood chan et al 2011 result in influenza in the intestinal tract influenza may bind to colonic epithelial cells via an influenza virus receptor sialic acid α 2 3 gal and thus explain the process by which influenza is shed in the feces pinsky et al 2010 previous studies investigated the proportion of influenza infected individuals that shed the virus fecally chan et al 2011 hirose et al 2016 hirose et al 2016 found influenza a or influenza b rna in the feces of 36 4 of influenza a or influenza b infected individuals respectively hirose et al 2016 a similar study detected influenza a in the feces of 47 1 of influenza a infected individuals chan et al 2011 these results suggest that while not all individuals infected with influenza shed the virus fecally a substantial proportion of infected individuals do thus enabling the use of wastewater surveillance additionally sars cov 2 and influenza can be shed through other bodily secretions such as sputum and mucus and can in turn enter the wastewater system through this route future research is needed to investigate these limitations as well as other factors such as how fecal shedding rates for sars cov 2 and influenza differ between school aged children and the general population and could in turn affect the comparability of results between the groups further investigations could also examine how vaccination rates affect school wastewater detection results and could determine if schools with higher student vaccination rates experience lower concentrations of sars cov 2 and influenza in their wastewater 5 conclusions the results of this study show that prek 12 school wastewater levels of sars cov 2 and influenza a were reflective of school community and citywide infections school wastewater measurements can complement clinical disease surveillance by providing a pooled sample that is not dependent on symptoms or health seeking behavior prek 12 schools are especially critical surveillance locations as they are sources of high transmission and their outbreaks can lead to further spread into local communities monitoring of other diseases common to school aged children via wastewater surveillance could be implemented to reduce the burden of disease on communities and the number of schooldays missed due to illness declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

15108,wastewater surveillance is a passive and efficient way to monitor the spread of infectious diseases in large populations and high transmission areas such as prek 12 schools infections caused by respiratory viruses in school aged children are likely underreported particularly because many children may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic wastewater monitoring of sars cov 2 has been studied extensively and primarily by sampling at centralized wastewater treatment plants and there are limited studies on sars cov 2 in prek 12 school wastewater similarly wastewater detections of influenza have only been reported in wastewater treatment plant and university manhole samples here we present the results of a 17 month wastewater monitoring program for sars cov 2 n 2176 samples and influenza a and b n 1217 samples in 51 prek 12 schools we show that school wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 rna were strongly associated with covid 19 cases in schools and community positivity rates and that influenza detections in school wastewater were significantly associated with citywide influenza diagnosis rates results were communicated back to schools and local communities to enable mitigation strategies to stop the spread and direct resources such as testing and vaccination clinics this study demonstrates that school wastewater surveillance is reflective of local infections at several population levels and plays a crucial role in the detection and mitigation of outbreaks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based epidemiology sars cov 2 influenza prek 12 schools covid 19 data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction schools are a known source of respiratory viral outbreaks in communities wang et al 2014 the large number of students and staff in close proximity to one another makes schools a high risk area and enables the transmission of infectious diseases murray et al 2021 consequently the onset of school sessions are correlated with acute respiratory infections especially among students ages 5 17 temte et al 2019 this correlation is also seen among other age groups suggesting secondary transmission within student households temte et al 2019 covid 19 outbreaks in schools created increases in secondary transmission and in turn school closures that may have led to negative effects on student learning and increased strain on families falk et al 2021 national center for immunization and respiratory diseases ncird division of viral diseases 2020 tomasik et al 2021 influenza outbreaks are also common in schools with prek 12 children facing the highest age based influenza attack rate of approximately 30 heymann et al 2009 wang et al 2014 school transmission of influenza and sars cov 2 not only affects school aged children and their families but is also associated with community wide outbreaks chao et al 2010 chernozhukov et al 2021 rapid detection of these viruses in schools can provide the time needed to initiate measures to mitigate transmission precautions such as contact tracing and isolation of close contacts are associated with reductions in transmission of sars cov 2 and influenza but require ample time for implementation sinha et al 2021 wang et al 2014 the ability to quickly recognize the onset of potential outbreaks in schools is crucial in preventing further spread into the community clinical testing has traditionally been used to monitor respiratory viral outbreaks such as influenza and sars cov 2 however compiling testing data from various health care facilities such as clinics hospitals and emergency rooms to obtain an accurate incidence estimate is time consuming and can allow the virus more time to proliferate throughout the community lu et al 2018 additionally clinical surveillance metrics only capture a fraction of infections this issue is exacerbated by infected individuals with asymptomatic or mild cases that do not seek medical care under ascertainment as well as underreporting due to non reportable at home tests and atypical presentations that lead to misdiagnoses bivins et al 2020 mccarthy et al 2020 rader et al 2022 wolfe et al 2022 under ascertainment is a relevant problem in schools because children with covid 19 may be more likely than adults to be asymptomatic or to have a mild case making it less likely that their infection will be detected using clinical methods falk et al 2021 ludvigsson 2020 national center for immunization and respiratory diseases ncird division of viral diseases 2020 in contrast wastewater surveillance is a passive efficient and relatively fast method that overcomes many of the challenges faced by clinical diagnostic testing wastewater information is not biased by differences in access to testing resources or by health seeking behavior olesen et al 2021 wastewater surveillance s pooled sample strategy allows for the simultaneous and rapid sampling of large groups of people bibby et al 2021 d aoust et al 2021 larsen and wigginton 2020 sutton et al 2022 wastewater viral concentrations for both influenza and sars cov 2 have been shown to correlate with community wide clinical diagnostic trends al duroobi et al 2021 bethel et al 2021 kaya et al 2022 layton et al 2022 mercier et al 2022 peccia et al 2020 using wastewater surveillance can enable the detection of infection outbreaks where clinical data is not able to rapidly detect mao et al 2020 wu et al 2022 in addition to monitoring large populations by sampling at centralized wastewater treatment plants wastewater monitoring has also been applied to monitor individual facilities and buildings previous studies detected sars cov 2 in the wastewater of facilities such as nursing homes universities and hospitals gibas et al 2021 scott et al 2021 spurbeck et al 2021 in a study monitoring nursing home wastewater a positive wastewater detection of sars cov 2 occurred when only one out of sixty residents were positive for covid 19 spurbeck et al 2021 additionally a university based study detected asymptomatic cases that were not otherwise identified by the campus monitoring program gibas et al 2021 school wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 has shown a correlation between wastewater viral concentrations of sars cov 2 in schools and community cases of covid 19 castro gutierrez et al 2022 therefore school wastewater monitoring could serve as building level surveillance with the ability to identify infections within the facility and reflect the infection burden of the larger community that the school serves crowe et al 2021 while there are a limited number of studies on wastewater monitoring of sars cov 2 in prek 12 school settings castro gutierrez et al 2022 crowe et al 2021 fielding miller et al 2021 no previous studies have expanded school monitoring to include other respiratory viruses such as influenza influenza and respiratory syncytial virus rsv are also shed in stool and are detectable in wastewater akbari et al 2017 al khatib et al 2021 chan et al 2011 heijnen and medema 2011 hirose et al 2016 hughes et al 2022 to et al 2010 von linstow et al 2006 only two studies to date have applied wastewater surveillance for influenza and they demonstrated its ability to detect community outbreaks by monitoring wastewater treatment plants or manholes that serve 10 000 people mercier et al 2022 wolfe et al 2022 here we expand on wastewater disease surveillance for respiratory viruses in prek 12 school settings we quantified sars cov 2 and influenza a in the wastewater of 51 prek 12 schools across houston over a 17 month period we compared wastewater detections to available diagnostic pcr testing data performed at the schools as well as community zip code level positivity rates for covid 19 and citywide syndromic surveillance data on influenza we show that wastewater monitoring is an effective pooled sample monitoring strategy that reflects the prevalence of infection in the school as well as the surrounding community we describe how the information was communicated to the schools and used by the houston health department for targeted vaccination campaigns 2 methods 2 1 selection of schools samples were obtained from 51 prek 12 schools across houston texas from december 7th 2020 to may 9th 2022 the schools included 39 elementary schools and early childhood centers 5 middle schools 5 high schools and 2 combined grade level schools enrollment information for each school is provided in table s1 these schools were categorized as high risk schools based on zip code level covid positivity rates vaccination rates and covid 19 community vulnerability index ccvi the location of the schools within houston is shown in fig 1 and they were clustered in three groups north southwest and southeast based on driving routes for sample pickup 2 2 sample collection wastewater samples were collected once a week using refrigerated time weighted composite autosamplers located in or adjacent to the school manholes the composite samplers drew from manholes that only received wastewater from the selected schools with no contributions from other sources on sample collection days the composite samplers were programmed to collect 250 ml every 15 min between the hours of 6am and 12pm this ensured that samples were fresh and not stored in an autosampler for more than a few hours once a week team members from the houston health department collected and delivered the school wastewater samples to rice university for processing and analysis samples were kept on ice during transport and stored at 4 c in the laboratory the wastewater samples were aliquoted into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and were concentrated within 24 h of collection the 17 month sampling campaign for sars cov 2 spanned from december 7th 2020 to may 9th 2022 and we added influenza a and b quantification on september 27th 2021 for a total of 7 months of influenza analysis over the entire study period 2176 samples were analyzed for sars cov 2 and 1217 samples were analyzed for influenza 2 3 concentration extraction and quantification of sars cov 2 and influenza a and b wastewater samples were concentrated using an ha filtration and bead beating method as previously described laturner et al 2021 lou et al 2022 between december 7th 2020 and january 25 2021 rna extraction was performed using the maxwell 48 rsc automated platform as8500 promega and the modified protocol for the maxwell rsc purefood gmo and authentication kit as1600 promega beginning february 1st 2021 and for the remainder of the study period the chemagic prime viral dna rna 300 kit h96 chemagic cmg 1433 perkinelmer was used for rna extraction as described by lou et al 2022 we performed a head to head comparison of sars cov 2 concentrations using maxwell and chemagic extraction methods to determine an adjustment factor for converting maxwell concentration levels to chemagic levels detailed in supplemental material sections s1 4 and s2 3 the concentrations of sars cov 2 n1 and n2 genes and influenza a and b were quantified using a one step rt ddpcr assay rt ddpcr was completed using the qx200 autodg droplet digital pcr system bio rad and a c1000 thermal cycler bio rad sars cov 2 and influenza quantifications require identical thermal cycler conditions so rt ddpcr was often performed for sars cov 2 and influenza simultaneously additional details on maxwell rna extraction primers and probes assay setup and thermal cycling conditions are also available in the supplemental material detailed protocols for concentration factor calculations rt ddpcr thermal cycler conditions limit of detection lod rt ddpcr reaction compositions and quality control measures are as described previously lou et al 2022 2 4 classification of results as positive negative or inconclusive each wastewater sample was processed as two concentration replicates and we classified the sample as either positive negative or inconclusive for sars cov 2 and influenza a and b using the following logic for sars cov 2 there were 4 sars cov 2 measurements for each sample n1 and n2 for each concentration replicate when 3 measurements were above lod samples were called positive for sars cov 2 when no measurements were greater than the lod samples were called negative for sars cov 2 in cases with only 1 or 2 measurements greater than the lod the samples were called inconclusive for influenza results were based on a single target measurement for 2 concentration replicates for each sample for both influenza a and b when the 2 measurements for influenza a were greater than the lod the samples were determined to be positive for influenza a when neither measurement was greater than the lod the samples were identified as negative for influenza a in cases with 1 measurement greater than the lod and 1 measurement below the samples were deemed inconclusive this logic was also applied for influenza b analysis 2 5 clinical testing of individuals for sars cov 2 at schools the houston health department carried out a sars cov 2 pcr testing program for consenting students and staff at 259 prek 12 schools 46 of which were part of this study s school wastewater monitoring program consenting participants n 3213 participants were offered free pcr testing weekly but could choose to opt out up to 12 weeks of diagnostic testing data was obtained from the schools and an average of 9 3 weeks of data per school was gathered across all 46 sites over the course of the testing program the weekly positivity rates positive tests divided by total tests performed for each school were provided by the houston health department the specimen collection dates were used to aggregate the clinical testing results by school week monday friday the pcr diagnostic testing data for each school was compared to the measured concentrations of sars cov 2 in its wastewater samples collected the same week all procedures involving human participants were approved by the institutional review board irb fy2020 300 modeling of covid19 lab test results in space and times and were performed in accordance with applicable guidelines 2 6 aggregated zip code school wastewater and pcr data we used imputation to replace wastewater measurements below the limit of detection the imputed values were set as the maximum between the actual observed value and half the lod here the lod was assumed to be 2556 copies l which corresponds to the approximate concentration of 3 positive droplets per reaction well the wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 of schools within the same zip code were aggregated by averaging the n1 and n2 measurements of each school after imputation and taking the average of those measurements across schools in the same zip code covid 19 diagnostic pcr testing results were extracted from the houston electronic disease surveillance system hedss and included persons located within one of the 105 houston area zip codes test records were deduplicated by person by specimen date such that if a person was tested multiple times in a single day they were counted only once for that day and if a person tested across multiple days they were counted once per each of those days results were aggregated by specimen date and the daily positivity rate was calculated as the number of persons with a positive test divided by the number of persons pcr tested the daily positivity rates of all schools in the same zip code collected within the same week were averaged to obtain weekly zip code positivity rates 2 7 citywide influenza rates syndromic surveillance was used to determine a citywide percentage of discharge diagnosis influenza from reporting healthcare facilities including hospitals emergency departments community and school based clinics and surgery centers to obtain the percentage of visits with a discharge diagnosis of influenza the houston health department s electronic syndromic surveillance system for the early notification of community based epidemics essence was searched for the number of visits with an influenza related code in the discharge diagnosis regardless of influenza strain this number was then divided by the number of total visits in essence and multiplied by 100 all visits were filtered by zip code and or county to only include patients from the houston harris county area we chose to compare discharge diagnosis influenza rates as opposed to influenza like illness ilis rates because of the abundance of similar respiratory viruses such as sars cov 2 and rsv that were likely contributing to ili rates counts were aggregated by week sunday to saturday 2 8 statistical analysis we used r for all data analyses our code for these analyses is available at https github com hou wastewater epi org school wastewater surveillance since the sars cov 2 positivity rates at the schools were all very low or zero we transformed the positivity rate measurement into a binary 0 for zero positivity rate 1 for positive positivity rate variable we used this binary variable as our dependent variable in a logistic regression model with the log wastewater concentration on the associated date as the independent variable using logistic regression we estimated the effect of the wastewater concentration on the probability of a nonzero number of positive cases that week we used linear regression to model the effect of wastewater concentration on the positivity rate at the zip code level for sars cov 2 we explored various regression models including addition of random effects components for each replicate but ultimately chose the simple linear model for its combination of good model fit and interpretability for influenza we used linear regression to model the relationship between the citywide rate of influenza and the school influenza wastewater detection rates we used the proportion of the 51 schools with a positive detection of influenza in a given week as our independent variable with the citywide rate of visits diagnosed with influenza as the dependent variable 3 results 3 1 school wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 rna were representative of covid 19 cases in schools we collected 2176 school wastewater samples over a 17 month period we assayed 2176 samples for sars cov 2 and 1217 samples for influenza a and b of the 2176 samples assayed for sars cov 2 22 3 486 were positive 9 1 197 were inconclusive and 68 6 1493 were below the limit of detection of the positive samples wastewater concentrations averaged 141 248 10th percentile 3293 90th percentile 226 617 copies l there was no relationship between wastewater concentration and school enrollment numbers fig 2 b fig 3 shows the distribution of weekly sars cov 2 detections in 51 prek 12 schools over the study period pcr diagnostic testing was completed at selected sites to examine the relationship between wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 in schools and school covid 19 cases only 13 weeks of diagnostic pcr testing data from the schools was collected and the majority of the school pcr positivity rates were zero 71 further the pcr testing program was not mandatory and thus the testing results were not comprehensive despite these limitations we observed a significant positive relationship between school wastewater concentrations for sars cov 2 and the probability of a non zero sars cov 2 positivity rate at the school fig 4 β1 1 14 p 0 0001 in other words schools with a 10 times higher sars cov 2 wastewater concentration have an estimated 3 1 times higher odds of a positive test result based on the results of the logistic regression model 3 2 school wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 rna were representative of community positivity rates for sars cov 2 we compared school wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 to the positivity rate of the zip code that they are located in this was performed by averaging the wastewater sars cov 2 concentrations of the schools located in the same zip code and using linear regression to model the effect of the averaged school wastewater concentration on the zip code positivity rate at the zip code level fig 5 the wastewater concentrations were significant predictors of zip code positivity rates fig 5 β1 0 05 p 0 0001 the regression model estimates an expected increase of 0 05 in the zip code positivity rate for every 1 unit increase in log sars cov 2 copies per liter this positive association indicates that school wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 rna were representative of community positivity rates of sars cov 2 3 3 influenza a detections in school wastewater were representative of citywide influenza rates detections of influenza a rna in school wastewater were compared to the citywide rates of discharge diagnosed influenza of the 1217 wastewater samples assayed for influenza a and b none were positive for influenza b for influenza a 2 6 32 of samples were positive 1 6 19 were inconclusive and 95 8 1166 were below the limit of detection fig 6 shows detections of influenza a in school wastewater over the course of the study period of the positive samples for influenza a wastewater concentrations averaged 31 570 10th percentile 1929 90th percentile 58 300 copies l the wastewater concentrations of influenza a were generally lower than the positive sars cov 2 concentrations fig s1 this pattern remained consistent when concentrations of sars cov 2 and influenza a were compared across grade levels fig s2 citywide rates of visits with a discharge diagnosis of influenza over the study period are shown in fig 7 a a linear regression model revealed a significant positive relationship between the proportion of schools with a positive wastewater detection and the citywide rate of visits with a discharge diagnosis of influenza fig 7b β1 0 128 p 0 0001 these results indicate that influenza detections in school wastewater were representative of citywide influenza diagnosis rates 4 discussion our findings indicate that wastewater can be used to passively monitor respiratory viruses in schools without requiring participants to engage in health seeking behaviors unlike other passive surveillance systems based on clinical testing we show that wastewater detections of sars cov 2 were consistent with reported cases within the school and community positivity rates and influenza detections were consistent with citywide influenza diagnosis rates wastewater monitoring can offer valuable insight into school outbreaks and enable timely mitigation strategies that decrease the likelihood of secondary transmission into the students families and communities targeted mitigation strategies include identifying positive individuals through diagnostic testing vaccinations and masking in schools and local communities wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 and influenza is especially crucial in prek 12 schools as many infected children have asymptomatic or mild cases and do not seek medical attention or diagnostic testing likely leading to an underreporting of infections zimmermann and curtis 2021 the ability to identify these cases is crucial in preventing the spread of outbreaks as prek 12 schools are often areas of high transmission for respiratory viruses and other pathogens ghani et al 2010 glatman freedman et al 2012 murray et al 2021 this wastewater monitoring process is flexible and can be modified to detect various pathogens that are shed in stool and urine with relative ease school wastewater monitoring s ability to passively reflect community infections is critical in detecting and preventing the spread of future outbreaks here we expand on the findings of the limited number of studies that have investigated sars cov 2 in prek 12 school wastewater by performing a 17 month school wastewater surveillance program that spans three different covid 19 waves in houston driven by the alpha delta and omicron variants at 51 prek 12 schools resulting in 2176 samples crowe et al 2021 performed a 5 week pilot investigation of three k 12 schools that supplemented saliva based pcr testing with environmental samples from wastewater surfaces and indoor air crowe et al 2021 sars cov 2 was detected in school wastewater for 12 of the 14 85 7 individual school weeks that also experienced positive pcr test results this generally consistent relationship between sars cov 2 wastewater detections and clinical diagnostic testing is similar to the association found in our study our study found a significant positive relationship between school wastewater sars cov 2 concentration and the probability of a school s nonzero positivity rate based on nasal based pcr testing fig 4 β1 1 14 p 0 0001 fielding miller et al 2021 identified associations between positive school wastewater detections of sars cov 2 and positive school cases of covid 19 fielding miller et al 2021 they sampled nine k 12 schools over the course of 12 weeks totaling 447 samples weekly diagnostic testing was offered to students and staff and 67 of positive cases identified by this testing were associated with a positive wastewater detection of sars cov 2 castro gutierrez et al 2022 analyzed 296 samples for sars cov 2 over a 9 week wastewater monitoring study of 16 schools castro gutierrez et al 2022 they detected sars cov 2 in 47 3 of wastewater samples they reported a significant positive correlation between school wastewater weekly positivity rates and community covid 19 cases pearson s correlation coefficient 0 33 p 0 01 when school wastewater rates led community cases by two weeks we also extended the wastewater surveillance of influenza into prek 12 schools for the first time we monitored influenza a and b concentrations in the wastewater of 51 prek 12 schools over the course of 7 months n 1217 samples while no other studies to date have implemented influenza wastewater surveillance in prek 12 schools a limited number of previous studies have demonstrated the ability to detect community influenza outbreaks using wastewater mercier et al 2022 wolfe et al 2022 one study investigated two separate influenza a outbreaks in universities university of michigan and stanford university by comparing the universities influenza a wastewater concentrations to clinical data gathered from university health services and student athlete surveillance respectively wolfe et al 2022 the concentrations of influenza a in the university of michigan s wastewater ranged from nondetect to 2 63 104 copies g with a median of 1 03 104 copies g stanford university wastewater concentrations of influenza ranged from nondetect to 1 27 105 copies g with nondetect as the median the average influenza a concentration in our study on a per mass basis 3 16 101 copies ml where mass of 1 ml 1 g was comparable to the levels reported in their study even though wastewater concentrations are a function of the number of infected individuals in the community we observed concentration levels at similar orders of magnitude to results from previous studies wolfe et al s results indicated that wastewater concentrations of influenza a were strongly associated with the 5 day smoothed incidence rate of influenza a at both universities university of michigan τ 0 58 p 10 7 n 45 and stanford university τ 0 67 p 10 14 n 43 similarly our study examined the relationship between the proportion of schools with a positive influenza wastewater detection and the citywide percentage of visits with discharge diagnosed influenza fig 7b β1 0 128 p 0 0001 mercier et al 2022 also compared influenza a and b concentrations in neighborhood wastewater and citywide primary clarified sludge with pcr test rates mercier et al 2022 they reported a strong positive association when the citywide primary sludge influenza concentrations led the pcr rates by 17 days r 0 97 p 0 05 n 14 they also detected influenza a in 60 n 79 of all samples a much higher detection rate than observed in this study 2 6 this difference in detection rates could be due to differences in community influenza rates influenza rna concentrations in primary clarified sludge versus raw wastewater and or sampling at centralized wastewater treatment plant versus at manholes that capture wastewater from individual schools additionally these studies measured influenza a in solid fractions as opposed to liquid fractions providing evidence that influenza a partitions to solids mercier et al 2022 wolfe et al 2022 this could lead to variability in detection rates as inhibition may differentially impact the recoveries of influenza from the liquid and solid fractions consistent across all of these studies and our work is that wastewater detections of influenza reflected clinical infection rates future research should investigate factors that impact influenza recovery from both the liquid and solid fractions of wastewater samples as well as optimization of sampling schemes for public health interventions the findings of our wastewater monitoring program were reported back to the schools and used by the houston health department to target interventions in the local communities every week the sars cov 2 and influenza school wastewater results were communicated to each school s point of contact typically the nurse and or principal this line of communication assisted with identifying positive covid 19 and influenza cases and enabled the timely implementation of mitigation strategies in the case of a positive school wastewater detection of sars cov 2 the houston health department assessed the school s covid 19 history and its current covid 19 status they prioritized any cases in need of contact tracing that had not yet been reached in the case of a covid 19 outbreak in a school the health department planned an intervention and scheduled an enhanced site visit within 24 72 h houston health department maintained active outreach with the school s point of contact to ensure daily reporting and distributed isolation and quarantine letters to cases and contacts as needed the houston health department hhd also used data from the wastewater monitoring program to create the hhd weekly influenza reports these reports were shared internally with houston health department leadership the texas department of state health services dshs local and nearby counties and jurisdictions and rice university leadership additionally the houston health department published the reports on their website for public viewing weekly wastewater monitoring results were also shared with the community through sars cov 2 zip code fact sheets and the city of houston sars cov 2 wastewater monitoring dashboard covidwwtp spatialstudieslab org the fact sheets provided the sars cov 2 wastewater detection status for every school in the given zip code as well as information on community covid 19 vaccination rates these fact sheets were part of a houston health department initiative to use schools as a springboard into the community to encourage vaccinations the health department hosted free influenza and covid 19 vaccine clinics for communities based on the results of the school wastewater monitoring program while there are many advantages to school wastewater monitoring there are still limitations wastewater is a complex matrix that is affected by environmental factors that are not always identified leading to inherent variability and uncertainties pulicharla et al 2021 this can make it difficult to determine how directly wastewater concentrations reflect the number of infected individuals some infections are likely missed due to low viral loads in the wastewater that are either not obtained by sampling or are lower than the limit of detection cdc 2022 toilet use behavior in schools is also a source of variability that impacts the likelihood of detecting infected individuals at school via wastewater monitoring additionally the aggregation of school positivity rates from pcr testing which was performed over several days could lead to discrepancies when compared to wastewater data which was analyzed one day per week most of the clinical testing was completed the same day that the wastewater was sampled however some testing was performed on other days of the week to accommodate the schools and testing teams the relative timing of pcr and wastewater testing data trends is an area that requires further investigation and could be informed by fecal shedding distributions for each virus and their variants fecal shedding of influenza and specifically whether influenza infects intestinal cells and is consequently shed in the feces is not well established however some studies suggest that swallowed nasopharyngeal secretions that contain influenza or the dissemination of influenza through the blood chan et al 2011 result in influenza in the intestinal tract influenza may bind to colonic epithelial cells via an influenza virus receptor sialic acid α 2 3 gal and thus explain the process by which influenza is shed in the feces pinsky et al 2010 previous studies investigated the proportion of influenza infected individuals that shed the virus fecally chan et al 2011 hirose et al 2016 hirose et al 2016 found influenza a or influenza b rna in the feces of 36 4 of influenza a or influenza b infected individuals respectively hirose et al 2016 a similar study detected influenza a in the feces of 47 1 of influenza a infected individuals chan et al 2011 these results suggest that while not all individuals infected with influenza shed the virus fecally a substantial proportion of infected individuals do thus enabling the use of wastewater surveillance additionally sars cov 2 and influenza can be shed through other bodily secretions such as sputum and mucus and can in turn enter the wastewater system through this route future research is needed to investigate these limitations as well as other factors such as how fecal shedding rates for sars cov 2 and influenza differ between school aged children and the general population and could in turn affect the comparability of results between the groups further investigations could also examine how vaccination rates affect school wastewater detection results and could determine if schools with higher student vaccination rates experience lower concentrations of sars cov 2 and influenza in their wastewater 5 conclusions the results of this study show that prek 12 school wastewater levels of sars cov 2 and influenza a were reflective of school community and citywide infections school wastewater measurements can complement clinical disease surveillance by providing a pooled sample that is not dependent on symptoms or health seeking behavior prek 12 schools are especially critical surveillance locations as they are sources of high transmission and their outbreaks can lead to further spread into local communities monitoring of other diseases common to school aged children via wastewater surveillance could be implemented to reduce the burden of disease on communities and the number of schooldays missed due to illness declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

15109,1 4 dioxane is a drinking water contaminant of emerging concern because conventional and many advanced drinking water treatment technologies are ineffective for 1 4 dioxane removal cost effective technologies for the removal of 1 4 dioxane at drinking water relevant concentrations are needed in this research a gravity fed cometabolic biofiltration system was developed to degrade 1 4 dioxane that was spiked into coagulated settled surface water at a concentration of 10 µg l objectives were to determine whether cometabolic degradation of trace levels of 1 4 dioxane can be sustained using n butane as primary substrate and whether filter media properties and empty bed contact time ebct affect biofiltration efficiency a mixed culture of bacteria derived from the cape fear river basin and previously enriched using isobutane served as inoculum for biologically active filters two granular activated carbons gacs with different grain sizes and one carbonaceous resin were used as attachment media and n butane served as the primary substrate for biologically active filters non inoculated controls with the same media were evaluated in parallel to distinguish between biological and adsorptive removals of 1 4 dioxane for the duration of the pilot study 3 months 1 4 dioxane was degraded in inoculated biofilters receiving n butane in control filters containing larger and smaller grain gac 1 4 dioxane broke through completely within 750 and 1250 bed volumes respectively corresponding to 15 to 30 days of operation at an ebct of 30 min 1 4 dioxane removal increased with increasing ebct in all biologically active filters at an ebct of 30 min the biologically active gac filter containing the larger grain gac removed on average 87 of 1 4 dioxane at pseudo steady state when the hydraulic loading rate was decreased to achieve an overall ebct of 60 min 1 4 dioxane was removed to 1 µg l in the biologically active gac filter containing the larger grain gac activity based labeling showed the presence of catalytically active monooxygenases in backwash water from biologically active filters that degraded 1 4 dioxane amplicon sequencing results showed that while taxa shifted after the initial inoculation of biologically active filters taxa in biologically active filters remained more similar to the inoculum than those in the non inoculated control filters overall results of this research demonstrate that cometabolic degradation of 1 4 dioxane at trace levels is possible for extended periods of time in inoculated biofilters that receive n butane as primary substrate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofiltration cometabolism adsorption emerging contaminants data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane is a contaminant of emerging concern that is widely detected in both surface and ground water throughout the united states and other countries an et al 2014 stepien et al 2014 sun et al 2016 u s environmental protection agency 2017b karges et al 2018 the u s epa has classified 1 4 dioxane as a likely human carcinogen by all routes of exposure and an excess one in a million cancer risk is associated with a lifetime consumption of drinking water containing 0 35 µg l 1 4 dioxane u s environmental protection agency 2017a 1 4 dioxane was the second most frequently detected compound in samples analyzed for u s epa s third unregulated contaminant monitoring rule u s environmental protection agency 2017b although no federal drinking water standard exists for 1 4 dioxane in the united states some states have developed their own guidance or regulations with action levels as low as 0 25 µg l mcelroy et al 2019 1 4 dioxane has high water solubility a low henry s law constant is relatively resistant to biodegradation and does not sorb well to activated carbon as a result traditional water treatment methods are ineffective for removal of 1 4 dioxane u s environmental protection agency 2017a mcelroy et al 2019 which makes reaching treatment goals difficult while advanced oxidation is effective for treatment of 1 4 dioxane it is high in chemical and energy costs and also has the potential to produce undesirable oxidation byproducts mcelroy et al 2019 bacteria that can metabolize 1 4 dioxane as a sole source of carbon and energy are known inoue et al 2016 2018 he et al 2018 ramos et al 2022 but metabolic degradation rates are typically slow unless 1 4 dioxane concentrations reach high milligram per liter concentrations mahendra and alvarez cohen 2006 cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane in the presence of a primary growth substrate is feasible at lower concentrations with cometabolic degradation rates expected to exceed metabolic degradation rates at 1 4 dioxane concentrations below 400 µg l barajas rodriguez and freedman 2018 laboratory studies have shown that diverse aerobic hydrocarbon oxidizing bacteria can cometabolize 1 4 dioxane at trace levels and that this activity can be attributed to soluble diiron monooxygenase sdimo enzymes zenker et al 1999 lippincott et al 2015 da silva et al 2018 deng et al 2018 he et al 2018 yamamoto et al 2018 rolston et al 2019 mcelroy 2020 biofiltration with and without substrate addition is a known treatment method for other drinking water contaminants gao et al 2010 salazar et al 2012 zearley and summers 2012 ma et al 2018 for example n pentane fed and n hexane fed cometabolic biofilters have been used to degrade methy tert butyl ether dupasquier et al 2002 salazar et al 2012 also biotrickling filters fed with tetrahydrofuran and mineral media showed promise for cometabolic 1 4 dioxane biodegradation with removals ranging from 93 to 95 over a 15 minute contact time zenker et al 2004 recent experiments with slow sand filtration have also shown limited average 56 1 4 dioxane removal from effluent of residential septic systems lee et al 2021 however alkane fed biofilters have not previously been considered for 1 4 dioxane the overarching objective of this research was to develop a pilot scale biofiltration system for the treatment of 1 4 dioxane at drinking water relevant concentrations specific objectives were to determine whether cometabolic degradation of trace levels of 1 4 dioxane can be sustained using n butane as a primary substrate and whether filter media properties and empty bed contact time affect biofilter efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals chemicals used in this study and their sources are provided in the supplemental information text s1 2 2 influent water coagulated and settled reservoir water which served as the influent to full scale biofilters at the d e benton drinking water treatment plant benton wtp garner nc was used as the source of influent water for the pilot scale biofilters water was filtered through a 5 µm filter cartridge mcmaster carr to remove suspended solids and minimize the need for filter backwashes nitrogen and phosphorus were added at the concentrations required to support mineralization of all added n butane plus the typical total organic carbon removed in the full scale biofilters by including 0 076 by volume minimal media work by others has shown the importance of nutrient availability with cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane rolston et al 2019 text s1 1 provides details of minimal media preparation 1 4 dioxane was added at 10 µg l to the influent water by first creating a concentrated stock in the required volume of minimal media then adding it into the feed tank prior to adding the cartridge filtered water measured influent 1 4 dioxane concentrations ranged from 8 9 to 11 7 µg l mean 10 7 µg l standard deviation 0 7 µg l 2 3 biofilter design pilot filters were installed at the benton wtp 2 3 1 biofilter construction and operation biofilters were constructed with clear schedule 80 pvc 2 54 cm inside diameter mcmaster carr elmhurst il with 2 filter segments in a lead lag configuration effluent from both lead and lag filters was raised 5 cm above the top of the filter medium to ensure that no low pressure zones were formed which can lead to air binding of the filters a schematic view of the filter setup along with a photo of all filters is shown in fig 1 filters were checked daily for stored water height water flow gas flow in active filters and condition of peristaltic tubing biological filters were inoculated using a previously enriched culture from a river water sample collected from the haw river cape fear river basin nc near the bynum bridge and fed n butane as the primary substrate the culture was originally enriched using isobutane but isobutane was not used as the primary substrate in the biofilters because of concerns about potential production of tert butyl alcohol during metabolism of isobutane mcelroy 2020 biological metabolism of n butane is not anticipated to result in the production of tert butyl alcohol si text s2 3 details of biofilter construction inoculation of biologically active filters and feeding methods are provided in si text s2 liquid feed was provided using a peristaltic pump at 9 9 ml min filter to achieve a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 1 28 m h for filters fed with n butane 1 v v n butane in air was provided to biologically active filters at a flow rate of 1 ml minute 1 04 0 16 ml min at a hlr of 1 28 m h this feeding scheme resulted in a calculated aqueous concentration of 0 5 0 6 mg l n butane into both the lead and lag filter this concentration represents a 55 1 ratio of substrate n butane to cosubstrate 1 4 dioxane mass and is near the middle of previously used feed ratios with tetrahydrofuran and 1 4 dioxane in a cometabolic trickling filter zenker et al 2004 at the end of 2 5 months of operation flow rates were turned down 50 to determine the impact of extended contact time on 1 4 dioxane removal oxygen demand was calculated for consumption of n butane and typical total organic carbon removal in full scale wtp biofilters to ensure aerobic conditions were maintained dissolved oxygen concentration was verified twice during filter operation using a dissolved oxygen meter ysi environmental 550 aerobic conditions were found with effluent aqueous oxygen concentrations of 6 2 0 4 and 6 7 0 3 mg l in biologically active and control filters respectively 2 3 2 filter media three media of varying adsorptive capacity and grain size were considered in this study two granular activated carbons gacs and one carbonaceous resin known for its high 1 4 dioxane capacity table 1 for each media one biologically active filter and one control filter were operated to understand adsorptive removal of 1 4 dioxane and background organic matter and to distinguish between biotic and abiotic 1 4 dioxane removals biologically active filters were inoculated and provided n butane as the primary substrate while control filters were neither inoculated nor fed primary substrate 2 3 3 sampling sampling ports were placed at 16 cm intervals to monitor four separate contact times in each filter at a hlr of 1 28 m h ebcts were 7 5 15 22 5 and 30 min details of sampling methods are provided in si text s2

per filter section details are provided in si text s2 7 with each backwash the first 700 ml of backwash water was stored in a sealed glass container at 4 c until processed for either dna sequence analysis or activity based labeling samples were processed as quickly as possible after backwashing the maximum hold time was 6 days details are provided in si text s2 8 through text s2 10 2 3 5 proprietary substrate and alternative substrate feed methods a proprietary substrate ps was initially considered using a third 4 12 gac filter setup but it was found to be unsuccessful for cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane select samples are shown in the activity based labeling results to avoid modifying images from polyacrylamide gel analyses also as with many pilot scale projects after the system was operated at initial design conditions additional operating modes were considered that included changes to the substrate feeding methods because these changes caused stability issues the results of these changes are not presented in this work except for some data included in the activity based labeling section to avoid modifying images from polyacrylamide gel analyses 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 1 4 dioxane 1 4 dioxane concentrations were measured for influent water and selected sampling ports during each sampling event 1 4 dioxane samples were preserved according to epa method 524 3 and measured by gas chromatography 7890b agilent santa clara ca and tandem mass spectrometry 7010 agilent santa clara ca heated purge and trap teledyne tekmar mason oh was used for preconcentration of 1 4 dioxane and 1 4 dioxane was quantified using isotope dilution based on a previously developed method sun et al 2016 the quantification range for 1 4 dioxane was from 0 25 to 150 µg l 2 4 2 dissolved organic carbon doc and uv254 doc was measured for influent water and selected sampling ports during each sampling event samples were filtered with 0 45 μm binder free glass fiber filters whatman preserved with 0 5 ml of 1 1 ortho phosphoric acid per 40 ml and measured for non purgeable doc using a toc vscn shimadzu analyzer with a calibration range of 0 2 mg l to 20 mg l for each doc sample an unpreserved aliquot was analyzed for ultraviolet absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm uv254 using a 1 cm quartz cuvette table 2 provides typical values for influent doc and uv254 2 4 3 alkalinity ph and temperature alkalinity was measured for an aliquot of influent water following each tank refill by titration with 0 2 n sulfuric acid measurements of ph for influent water and biofilter effluents were completed on every sampling day temperature was measured every sampling day for influent water lead filter effluents and lag filter effluents the pilot filter area was heated with large ceiling mounted heaters the lead filters which were mounted higher than the lag filters were sometimes slightly warmer than the lag filters table 2 provides typical values for alkalinity ph and temperature 3 results 3 1 1 4 dioxane removal in control filters because new media were used in all filters at the start of the pilot study the adsorptive removal of 1 4 dioxane could be evaluated in control filters results from control filters provide the first known data set for adsorptive 1 4 dioxane removal from coagulated surface water breakthrough curves for 1 4 dioxane are shown in fig 2 in which the effluent concentration of 1 4 dioxane shown as a percentage of the influent 1 4 dioxane concentration is plotted as a function of bed volumes of water treated at each ebct 7 5 15 22 5 30 min 1 4 dioxane breakthrough for the filter containing the 4 12 gac began within 40 bed volumes and 30 breakthrough was reached at 102 10 bed volumes for the 22 5 and 30 min ebct sampling ports for the 12 40 gac 1 4 dioxane breakthrough began at 350 bed volumes and 30 breakthrough was reached at 470 50 bed volumes depending on the ebct considered for the resin breakthrough began at 1600 bed volumes and 30 breakthrough was reached at 4180 1180 bed volumes depending on the ebct considered for the 7 5 minute ebct 30 breakthrough was reached after 5570 bed volumes a value that was larger than the later that obtained at ebcts of 15 to 30 min at which 30 breakthrough was reached after at 3712 890 bed volumes these results are likely a consequence of media mixing during filter backwash the resin filters required frequent backwashing and the controls were backwashed after 630 1380 2260 and 2880 bv rapid breakthrough of 1 4 dioxane in gac has been shown previously for groundwater and 30 breakthrough of 1 4 dioxane with various gac media occurred between 200 and 850 bed volumes treated summers et al 2014 for the 12 40 gac our result 470 bed volumes treated at 30 breakthrough closely matched that obtained for a similar but slightly larger 8 30 mesh re agglomerated sub bituminous coal based gac for which 30 breakthrough occurred at 420 bed volumes summers et al 2014 the smaller grain size of our 12 40 gac may have yielded favorable adsorption kinetics in our study but this benefit could have been counter balanced by the higher dissolved organic matter dom content of the surface water in our study toc 1 4 mg l compared to the groundwater toc 0 5 mg l in summers et al 2014 for our lignite based 4 12 gac 30 breakthrough of 1 4 dioxane occurred earlier 102 10 bed volumes than for the lignite based gac used in summers et al summers et al 2014 the grain size for our lignite based gac was larger than that used by summers et al 2014 which would have resulted in slower adsorption kinetics in our study also the higher dom content of the surface water studied here may have exacerbated early breakthrough of 1 4 dioxane compared to the prior groundwater study relative to the tested gacs the carbonaceous resin exhibited a substantially longer service life most likely because the pore structure of the carbonaceous resin was designed to adsorb 1 4 dioxane this pore structure also led to less removal of dom fig 5 and thus may have decreased adsorption competition and or pore blockage preserving more of the resin s adsorption capacity for 1 4 dioxane 3 2 1 4 dioxane removal in biologically active filters biologically active 4 12 and 12 40 gac filters continuously removed 1 4 dioxane throughout the study duration and reached pseudo steady state removals after complete breakthrough of 1 4 dioxane was reached in the control gac filters at an ebct of 30 min a service time of 3 months corresponds to approximately 4000 bed volumes treated pseudo steady state removals by biologically active 4 12 and 12 40 gac filters were 69 9 and 54 11 respectively at the 7 5 minute ebct and 87 5 and 65 7 respectively at the 30 minute ebct fig 3 after breakthrough began in the resin filter removal in the biologically active filter continuously exceeded that of the control filter for all filters treatment effectiveness increased with increasing filter bed depths corresponding with higher ebcts as will be further discussed in section 3 4 the lowest effluent 1 4 dioxane concentration i e the highest removal percentage was obtained with the 4 12 gac that had the lowest adsorptive capacity for 1 4 dioxane it is likely this higher treatment effectiveness is related to the greater penetration of n butane into the filter bed containing the larger grain gac and or a reduced backwash frequency that was required for the larger grain medium over the first 3 months of operation the resin biologically active 12 40 gac and 4 12 gac required overall nine six and one backwashes respectively for the corresponding control filters four two and zero backwashes were required stored water heights were used to determine backwash requirements for each filter figure s5 the initial 1 4 dioxane breakthrough for all control and biologically active filters is shown in figure s8 at an ebct of 30 min while results suggest that initial breakthrough is similar for biologically active and control filters the impact of biological activity becomes apparent after control filters begin to break through results for the 4 12 gac filters suggest that biological activity was contributing to removal within 40 bed volumes for other filters the onset of biological enhancement became apparent later because the media exhibited larger adsorption capacities for 1 4 dioxane 250 300 bv for 12 40 gac 1500 bv for the carbonaceous resin 3 3 impact of empty bed contact time on treatment of 1 4 dioxane four ebcts were evaluated by using sampling ports located at bed depths of 16 and 32 cm in both the lead and lag filters these bed depths corresponded to ebcts of 7 5 15 22 5 and 30 min with a hlr of 1 28 m h treatment of 1 4 dioxane in both the lead and lag segments of the biologically active gac showed a distinct pattern of efficient removal in the top half of the filter segment followed by essentially no removal through the bottom half of the filter segment after the adsorptive capacity of the media was depleted fig 4 for resin filters 1 4 dioxane removal progressed throughout the filter bed although with higher efficiency at the top half of each biologically active filter segment the bottom half of both the lead and lag resin filters contributed to 1 4 dioxane removal because the adsorption capacity of the resin had not yet been exhausted during this sampling event the higher treatment at the top of each filter column is likely the result of at least two factors first because substrate had to be fed as a gas it is likely that substrate penetration into the filter beds was limited suggesting that 1 4 dioxane degrading microorganisms grew primarily near the top of each filter segment second the method of inoculation which included recirculating inoculum in downflow mode through the filter could have resulted in a higher starting concentration of 1 4 dioxane degrading bacteria at the top of each filter segment growth at the top of each filter segment nearest to the substrate was noticeably higher than lower sections of each filter segment figure s9 observing limited treatment at greater filter depths when using a gaseous substrate agrees with prior research that assessed cometabolism of nitrosamines with propane fed consortia in a biofilter mikkelson et al 2015 if increased treatment were desired either decreasing flow rates to increase contact time in the more biologically active sections of the filters or increasing the number of gas feed locations could be explored to assess the first option we decreased the hlr to the filters by 50 to 0 64 m h after 3 months of operation as a result ebcts doubled to 15 30 45 and 60 min at an ebct of 60 min 1 4 dioxane degradation increased to 94 and 83 in the 4 12 gac and 12 40 gac filters respectively table 3 typically the result of reducing hydraulic loading for systems with biological activity is that the fractional overall removal of contaminants will increase while the total mass of contaminant removed will decrease grady et al 2011 this is a consequence of various factors including diffusion boundary layer thicknesses shear and deposition of bacteria and residence time in the reactor as the hlr is decreased diffusion boundary layer thickness will increase slowing any diffusion controlled reaction biofilm thickness at the top of the filter column will increase due to lower shear and deposition rates but this will also result in an overall lower activity in the biofilm due to increased community age and decreased access to nutrients and or electron acceptors and less biofilm colonization deep into the filter grady et al 2011 flemming et al 2016 nonetheless for biological reactors the net result of a reduced hlr will be an overall increase in fractional removal because of the longer residence time that is available for biological reactions to take place this effect was evident in our results for example at the effluent of the lead 4 12 gac filter average 1 4 dioxane removals were 70 and 90 at hlrs of 1 28 m h and 0 64 m h respectively while removal percentages were higher at the lower hlr the mass of 1 4 dioxane that could be removed per unit time at a hlr of 0 64 m h was only 64 of that removed at a hlr of 1 28 m h it should be noted that less 1 4 dioxane was degraded in the lag gac filters than in the lead gac filters table 3 the lower biodegradation percentage may be a result of the n butane feeding system design which first supplied the lead filter and then the lag filter it is possible that n butane consumption in the lead filter led to a n butane concentration in the lag filter that was lower than originally calculated from henry s law and verified prior to inoculation of the filters figure s3 it is also possible that the reaction rate between short chain alkane monooxygenase and 1 4 dioxane was slower at the lower 1 4 dioxane concentrations in the lag filter 3 4 doc uv254 removal and filter effluent turbidity dissolved organic carbon doc removal was similar for both biologically active and control filters for all media types fig 5 doc breakthrough varied among media with earliest breakthrough for the resin followed by the 4 12 mesh gac and finally the 12 40 mesh gac control filters were operated without inoculation or n butane substrate feed but received non chlorinated influent therefore over time controls filters likely became biologically active with native heterotrophic bacteria and were able to degrade some doc a fraction of the influent doc is expected to be biodegradable by heterotrophic bacteria which would have been seeded from the influent water and were likely present in all filters also dissolved n butane in the sample would not be anticipated to contribute to doc concentrations measured as non purgeable organic carbon because of its high volatility overall results showed similar removals of doc in biologically active and control filters fig 5 these results suggest that inoculating filters and feeding n butane did not negatively impact their long term ability to remove doc uv254 breakthrough curves were similar to those obtained for figure s10 effluent turbidity was measured twice on two separate days and was also found to be similar for control and biologically active filters overall effluent from the 4 12 mesh gac filters exhibited the highest turbidity 0 25 0 03 ntu while the effluent from the resin and 12 40 mesh gac filters exhibited lower turbidity 0 18 0 03 ntu these results suggest that media selection impacts effluent doc and turbidity levels and needs to be considered for overall process optimization 3 5 activity based labeling of catalytically active monooxygenases bacteria expressing different hydrocarbon oxidizing sdimos including short chain alkane monooxygenase scam tetrahydrofuran monooxygenase thfmo and a recently described alkane oxidizing toluene monooxygenase tmo have been shown to degrade low µg l concentrations of 1 4 dioxane deng et al 2018 deng et al 2020 these enzymes are also all known to be inhibited by alkynes and can therefore potentially be detected by activity based labeling abl approaches using diyne probes bennett et al 2016 to probe for the presence of catalytically active monooxygenases in the filters abl analyses were conducted as described in si text s2 10 on samples of biological material collected during backwash of biologically active and control filters figs 6 and 7 show the fluorescently labeled polypeptides and corresponding total protein staining patterns detected following sds page analyses of these samples the active site containing subunits of monooxygenases are the expected molecular targets of the abl approach used in this study and all of the known 1 4 dioxane degrading sdimos have alpha hydroxylase subunits within the mass range of 63 59 kda with the alpha hydroxylase subunit of scam having a predicted mass of 59 kda chen 2016 the apparent masses of the major fluorescent polypeptides observed in our abl analysis figs 6 and 7 were 95 63 59 42 and 22 kda lanes 2 4 and 7 of fig 6 and lanes 2 3 and 7 8 of fig 7 our results therefore suggest that microorganisms expressing scam may be present in the backwash samples collected from biologically active filters that were able to remove 1 4 dioxane a role of the detected monooxygenases in 1 4 dioxane biodegradation detected is supported by the fact that these polypeptides were not detected in backwash water samples collected from control filters that lacked 1 4 dioxane degrading activity lanes 9 10 of fig 6 and lane 10 of fig 7 additional work is needed to identify the labeled polypeptides observed in figs 6 and 7 at the amino acid sequence level 3 6 16s rrna amplicon sequencing profiling results 16s rrna amplicon sequencing was used to understand differences in taxa for biologically active and control filters throughout the pilot study dna was extracted from backwash samples and analyzed using 16s amplicon sequencing bray curtis non dimensional analysis of 16s rrna amplicon sequencing results shows two distinct groupings in the filter backwash water samples one corresponding to biologically active filters and one corresponding to control filters fig 8 samples from biologically active filters are separated from the inoculum but more like the inoculum than the control filter samples active and control filters both appear to follow a trend with time as both samples move in the same direction over time after the beginning of the experiment this trend could be related to indigenous bacteria present in the filter influent water lag active filters also appear to maintain more similarity to the inoculum than lead filters as shown by lag filters always being on the left side closer to inoculum in paired lead lag sets this could be a result of the lead filter protecting the lag filter from colonizing bacteria details of taxa present in these samples are provided in figure s11 these results show that mycobacterium and variovorax are enriched in the inoculum and that mycobacterium was present in backwash samples from biologically active filters at levels that were higher than in backwash samples from control filters analyzed throughout the pilot study although variovorax strains have not previously been identified as 1 4 dioxane degradaing strains multiple mycobacterium strains are known to not only grow on gaseous alkanes such as n butane but have also been shown to cometabolically degrade 1 4 dioxane mcelroy et al 2019 7 discussion this study demonstrated that abl can be used to detect catalytically active monooxygenases in samples from biologically active filters that were degrading 1 4 dioxane thus abl could offer an approach to detect and potentially quantify active microorganisms capable of cometabolic degradation of 1 4 dioxane in biofilters this approach also has the added benefit that it detects catalytically active monooxygenases and therefore focuses on expressed enzymes rather than the potential for expression as measured by qpcr based approaches future research should be directed at using mass spectral analyses to identify the labeled polypeptides detected by abl at the molecular level this approach could provide important insights into which monooxygenases are expressed by n butane biostimulated cultures and are therefore likely responsible for initiating 1 4 dioxane biodegradation similarly 16s amplicon sequencing was found to show marked differences in taxonomy in filter backwash water samples from biologically active and control filters which may be useful to probe maintenance of 1 4 dioxane degrading bacteria in biofilters to further improve 1 4 dioxane treatment efficiency alternative biofilter designs could be explored that 1 increase exposure to the primary substrate by feeding n butane to multiple shorter column segments 2 increase contact time and or 3 rely on an alternative primary substrate that is more water soluble to optimize treated water quality a biofilter design could be explored with larger grain gac in the lead filter and smaller grain gac or carbonaceous resin in the lag filter the results of this study suggest that if only one medium were used a tradeoff would have to be made between 1 4 dioxane cometabolism and removal of doc uv254 and turbidity one limitation of this research was that we could not describe 1 4 dioxane biodegradation results with mathematical models this limitation was partly a result of our inability to measure biomass in our biofilters during the pilot study and partly due to lack of information on kinetic constants for the cometabolic degradation of 1 4 dioxane for our microbial consortium additional research focusing on the primary substrate and larger scale filters that allow biofilm sampling could provide data suitable for mathematical model parameterization also higher feed concentrations of 1 4 dioxane may permit the determination of degradation intermediates and products and or conduct a mass balance 8 conclusions in this research biofilters inoculated with a mixed culture enriched from a local river cometabolically degraded 1 4 dioxane that was spiked at a concentration of 10 µg l into coagulated and settled reservoir water treatment effectiveness for 1 4 dioxane was maintained in biologically active filters fed with n butane as the primary substrate for over 3 months biologically active filters containing large and medium size gac maintained 1 4 dioxane removals of 87 and 65 respectively at an ebct of 30 min removal of 1 4 dioxane increased to 94 and 83 respectively when the hlr was decreased by 50 leading to a 60 min ebct 1 4 dioxane degradation in biologically active filters containing carbonaceous resin exceeded that in the corresponding control filters while the beginning of 1 4 dioxane breakthrough in biologically active filters was controlled by the adsorptive capacity of the filter media long term treatment in biologically active filters was most effective for the gac with the largest grain size and the lowest adsorption capacity results suggest that treatment effectiveness may depend more on primary substrate access and backwash frequency than adsorption capacity of the filter media results also suggest that increasing the number of biologically active zones and or contact time in biologically active zones of cometabolically active filters can increase 1 4 dioxane degradation in control filters containing gac 1 4 dioxane broke through quickly the carbonaceous resin exhibited the largest adsorptive capacity for 1 4 dioxane and the control reached 30 breakthrough after 4180 1180 bed volumes of water were treated depending on the ebct considered another important finding is that inoculating and adding n butane as a substrate did not negatively impact doc removal suggesting that existing biofilters may be able to be modified to cometabolically degrade 1 4 dioxane while maintaining their doc removal capacity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15109,1 4 dioxane is a drinking water contaminant of emerging concern because conventional and many advanced drinking water treatment technologies are ineffective for 1 4 dioxane removal cost effective technologies for the removal of 1 4 dioxane at drinking water relevant concentrations are needed in this research a gravity fed cometabolic biofiltration system was developed to degrade 1 4 dioxane that was spiked into coagulated settled surface water at a concentration of 10 µg l objectives were to determine whether cometabolic degradation of trace levels of 1 4 dioxane can be sustained using n butane as primary substrate and whether filter media properties and empty bed contact time ebct affect biofiltration efficiency a mixed culture of bacteria derived from the cape fear river basin and previously enriched using isobutane served as inoculum for biologically active filters two granular activated carbons gacs with different grain sizes and one carbonaceous resin were used as attachment media and n butane served as the primary substrate for biologically active filters non inoculated controls with the same media were evaluated in parallel to distinguish between biological and adsorptive removals of 1 4 dioxane for the duration of the pilot study 3 months 1 4 dioxane was degraded in inoculated biofilters receiving n butane in control filters containing larger and smaller grain gac 1 4 dioxane broke through completely within 750 and 1250 bed volumes respectively corresponding to 15 to 30 days of operation at an ebct of 30 min 1 4 dioxane removal increased with increasing ebct in all biologically active filters at an ebct of 30 min the biologically active gac filter containing the larger grain gac removed on average 87 of 1 4 dioxane at pseudo steady state when the hydraulic loading rate was decreased to achieve an overall ebct of 60 min 1 4 dioxane was removed to 1 µg l in the biologically active gac filter containing the larger grain gac activity based labeling showed the presence of catalytically active monooxygenases in backwash water from biologically active filters that degraded 1 4 dioxane amplicon sequencing results showed that while taxa shifted after the initial inoculation of biologically active filters taxa in biologically active filters remained more similar to the inoculum than those in the non inoculated control filters overall results of this research demonstrate that cometabolic degradation of 1 4 dioxane at trace levels is possible for extended periods of time in inoculated biofilters that receive n butane as primary substrate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofiltration cometabolism adsorption emerging contaminants data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane is a contaminant of emerging concern that is widely detected in both surface and ground water throughout the united states and other countries an et al 2014 stepien et al 2014 sun et al 2016 u s environmental protection agency 2017b karges et al 2018 the u s epa has classified 1 4 dioxane as a likely human carcinogen by all routes of exposure and an excess one in a million cancer risk is associated with a lifetime consumption of drinking water containing 0 35 µg l 1 4 dioxane u s environmental protection agency 2017a 1 4 dioxane was the second most frequently detected compound in samples analyzed for u s epa s third unregulated contaminant monitoring rule u s environmental protection agency 2017b although no federal drinking water standard exists for 1 4 dioxane in the united states some states have developed their own guidance or regulations with action levels as low as 0 25 µg l mcelroy et al 2019 1 4 dioxane has high water solubility a low henry s law constant is relatively resistant to biodegradation and does not sorb well to activated carbon as a result traditional water treatment methods are ineffective for removal of 1 4 dioxane u s environmental protection agency 2017a mcelroy et al 2019 which makes reaching treatment goals difficult while advanced oxidation is effective for treatment of 1 4 dioxane it is high in chemical and energy costs and also has the potential to produce undesirable oxidation byproducts mcelroy et al 2019 bacteria that can metabolize 1 4 dioxane as a sole source of carbon and energy are known inoue et al 2016 2018 he et al 2018 ramos et al 2022 but metabolic degradation rates are typically slow unless 1 4 dioxane concentrations reach high milligram per liter concentrations mahendra and alvarez cohen 2006 cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane in the presence of a primary growth substrate is feasible at lower concentrations with cometabolic degradation rates expected to exceed metabolic degradation rates at 1 4 dioxane concentrations below 400 µg l barajas rodriguez and freedman 2018 laboratory studies have shown that diverse aerobic hydrocarbon oxidizing bacteria can cometabolize 1 4 dioxane at trace levels and that this activity can be attributed to soluble diiron monooxygenase sdimo enzymes zenker et al 1999 lippincott et al 2015 da silva et al 2018 deng et al 2018 he et al 2018 yamamoto et al 2018 rolston et al 2019 mcelroy 2020 biofiltration with and without substrate addition is a known treatment method for other drinking water contaminants gao et al 2010 salazar et al 2012 zearley and summers 2012 ma et al 2018 for example n pentane fed and n hexane fed cometabolic biofilters have been used to degrade methy tert butyl ether dupasquier et al 2002 salazar et al 2012 also biotrickling filters fed with tetrahydrofuran and mineral media showed promise for cometabolic 1 4 dioxane biodegradation with removals ranging from 93 to 95 over a 15 minute contact time zenker et al 2004 recent experiments with slow sand filtration have also shown limited average 56 1 4 dioxane removal from effluent of residential septic systems lee et al 2021 however alkane fed biofilters have not previously been considered for 1 4 dioxane the overarching objective of this research was to develop a pilot scale biofiltration system for the treatment of 1 4 dioxane at drinking water relevant concentrations specific objectives were to determine whether cometabolic degradation of trace levels of 1 4 dioxane can be sustained using n butane as a primary substrate and whether filter media properties and empty bed contact time affect biofilter efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals chemicals used in this study and their sources are provided in the supplemental information text s1 2 2 influent water coagulated and settled reservoir water which served as the influent to full scale biofilters at the d e benton drinking water treatment plant benton wtp garner nc was used as the source of influent water for the pilot scale biofilters water was filtered through a 5 µm filter cartridge mcmaster carr to remove suspended solids and minimize the need for filter backwashes nitrogen and phosphorus were added at the concentrations required to support mineralization of all added n butane plus the typical total organic carbon removed in the full scale biofilters by including 0 076 by volume minimal media work by others has shown the importance of nutrient availability with cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane rolston et al 2019 text s1 1 provides details of minimal media preparation 1 4 dioxane was added at 10 µg l to the influent water by first creating a concentrated stock in the required volume of minimal media then adding it into the feed tank prior to adding the cartridge filtered water measured influent 1 4 dioxane concentrations ranged from 8 9 to 11 7 µg l mean 10 7 µg l standard deviation 0 7 µg l 2 3 biofilter design pilot filters were installed at the benton wtp 2 3 1 biofilter construction and operation biofilters were constructed with clear schedule 80 pvc 2 54 cm inside diameter mcmaster carr elmhurst il with 2 filter segments in a lead lag configuration effluent from both lead and lag filters was raised 5 cm above the top of the filter medium to ensure that no low pressure zones were formed which can lead to air binding of the filters a schematic view of the filter setup along with a photo of all filters is shown in fig 1 filters were checked daily for stored water height water flow gas flow in active filters and condition of peristaltic tubing biological filters were inoculated using a previously enriched culture from a river water sample collected from the haw river cape fear river basin nc near the bynum bridge and fed n butane as the primary substrate the culture was originally enriched using isobutane but isobutane was not used as the primary substrate in the biofilters because of concerns about potential production of tert butyl alcohol during metabolism of isobutane mcelroy 2020 biological metabolism of n butane is not anticipated to result in the production of tert butyl alcohol si text s2 3 details of biofilter construction inoculation of biologically active filters and feeding methods are provided in si text s2 liquid feed was provided using a peristaltic pump at 9 9 ml min filter to achieve a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 1 28 m h for filters fed with n butane 1 v v n butane in air was provided to biologically active filters at a flow rate of 1 ml minute 1 04 0 16 ml min at a hlr of 1 28 m h this feeding scheme resulted in a calculated aqueous concentration of 0 5 0 6 mg l n butane into both the lead and lag filter this concentration represents a 55 1 ratio of substrate n butane to cosubstrate 1 4 dioxane mass and is near the middle of previously used feed ratios with tetrahydrofuran and 1 4 dioxane in a cometabolic trickling filter zenker et al 2004 at the end of 2 5 months of operation flow rates were turned down 50 to determine the impact of extended contact time on 1 4 dioxane removal oxygen demand was calculated for consumption of n butane and typical total organic carbon removal in full scale wtp biofilters to ensure aerobic conditions were maintained dissolved oxygen concentration was verified twice during filter operation using a dissolved oxygen meter ysi environmental 550 aerobic conditions were found with effluent aqueous oxygen concentrations of 6 2 0 4 and 6 7 0 3 mg l in biologically active and control filters respectively 2 3 2 filter media three media of varying adsorptive capacity and grain size were considered in this study two granular activated carbons gacs and one carbonaceous resin known for its high 1 4 dioxane capacity table 1 for each media one biologically active filter and one control filter were operated to understand adsorptive removal of 1 4 dioxane and background organic matter and to distinguish between biotic and abiotic 1 4 dioxane removals biologically active filters were inoculated and provided n butane as the primary substrate while control filters were neither inoculated nor fed primary substrate 2 3 3 sampling sampling ports were placed at 16 cm intervals to monitor four separate contact times in each filter at a hlr of 1 28 m h ebcts were 7 5 15 22 5 and 30 min details of sampling methods are provided in si text s2

per filter section details are provided in si text s2 7 with each backwash the first 700 ml of backwash water was stored in a sealed glass container at 4 c until processed for either dna sequence analysis or activity based labeling samples were processed as quickly as possible after backwashing the maximum hold time was 6 days details are provided in si text s2 8 through text s2 10 2 3 5 proprietary substrate and alternative substrate feed methods a proprietary substrate ps was initially considered using a third 4 12 gac filter setup but it was found to be unsuccessful for cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane select samples are shown in the activity based labeling results to avoid modifying images from polyacrylamide gel analyses also as with many pilot scale projects after the system was operated at initial design conditions additional operating modes were considered that included changes to the substrate feeding methods because these changes caused stability issues the results of these changes are not presented in this work except for some data included in the activity based labeling section to avoid modifying images from polyacrylamide gel analyses 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 1 4 dioxane 1 4 dioxane concentrations were measured for influent water and selected sampling ports during each sampling event 1 4 dioxane samples were preserved according to epa method 524 3 and measured by gas chromatography 7890b agilent santa clara ca and tandem mass spectrometry 7010 agilent santa clara ca heated purge and trap teledyne tekmar mason oh was used for preconcentration of 1 4 dioxane and 1 4 dioxane was quantified using isotope dilution based on a previously developed method sun et al 2016 the quantification range for 1 4 dioxane was from 0 25 to 150 µg l 2 4 2 dissolved organic carbon doc and uv254 doc was measured for influent water and selected sampling ports during each sampling event samples were filtered with 0 45 μm binder free glass fiber filters whatman preserved with 0 5 ml of 1 1 ortho phosphoric acid per 40 ml and measured for non purgeable doc using a toc vscn shimadzu analyzer with a calibration range of 0 2 mg l to 20 mg l for each doc sample an unpreserved aliquot was analyzed for ultraviolet absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm uv254 using a 1 cm quartz cuvette table 2 provides typical values for influent doc and uv254 2 4 3 alkalinity ph and temperature alkalinity was measured for an aliquot of influent water following each tank refill by titration with 0 2 n sulfuric acid measurements of ph for influent water and biofilter effluents were completed on every sampling day temperature was measured every sampling day for influent water lead filter effluents and lag filter effluents the pilot filter area was heated with large ceiling mounted heaters the lead filters which were mounted higher than the lag filters were sometimes slightly warmer than the lag filters table 2 provides typical values for alkalinity ph and temperature 3 results 3 1 1 4 dioxane removal in control filters because new media were used in all filters at the start of the pilot study the adsorptive removal of 1 4 dioxane could be evaluated in control filters results from control filters provide the first known data set for adsorptive 1 4 dioxane removal from coagulated surface water breakthrough curves for 1 4 dioxane are shown in fig 2 in which the effluent concentration of 1 4 dioxane shown as a percentage of the influent 1 4 dioxane concentration is plotted as a function of bed volumes of water treated at each ebct 7 5 15 22 5 30 min 1 4 dioxane breakthrough for the filter containing the 4 12 gac began within 40 bed volumes and 30 breakthrough was reached at 102 10 bed volumes for the 22 5 and 30 min ebct sampling ports for the 12 40 gac 1 4 dioxane breakthrough began at 350 bed volumes and 30 breakthrough was reached at 470 50 bed volumes depending on the ebct considered for the resin breakthrough began at 1600 bed volumes and 30 breakthrough was reached at 4180 1180 bed volumes depending on the ebct considered for the 7 5 minute ebct 30 breakthrough was reached after 5570 bed volumes a value that was larger than the later that obtained at ebcts of 15 to 30 min at which 30 breakthrough was reached after at 3712 890 bed volumes these results are likely a consequence of media mixing during filter backwash the resin filters required frequent backwashing and the controls were backwashed after 630 1380 2260 and 2880 bv rapid breakthrough of 1 4 dioxane in gac has been shown previously for groundwater and 30 breakthrough of 1 4 dioxane with various gac media occurred between 200 and 850 bed volumes treated summers et al 2014 for the 12 40 gac our result 470 bed volumes treated at 30 breakthrough closely matched that obtained for a similar but slightly larger 8 30 mesh re agglomerated sub bituminous coal based gac for which 30 breakthrough occurred at 420 bed volumes summers et al 2014 the smaller grain size of our 12 40 gac may have yielded favorable adsorption kinetics in our study but this benefit could have been counter balanced by the higher dissolved organic matter dom content of the surface water in our study toc 1 4 mg l compared to the groundwater toc 0 5 mg l in summers et al 2014 for our lignite based 4 12 gac 30 breakthrough of 1 4 dioxane occurred earlier 102 10 bed volumes than for the lignite based gac used in summers et al summers et al 2014 the grain size for our lignite based gac was larger than that used by summers et al 2014 which would have resulted in slower adsorption kinetics in our study also the higher dom content of the surface water studied here may have exacerbated early breakthrough of 1 4 dioxane compared to the prior groundwater study relative to the tested gacs the carbonaceous resin exhibited a substantially longer service life most likely because the pore structure of the carbonaceous resin was designed to adsorb 1 4 dioxane this pore structure also led to less removal of dom fig 5 and thus may have decreased adsorption competition and or pore blockage preserving more of the resin s adsorption capacity for 1 4 dioxane 3 2 1 4 dioxane removal in biologically active filters biologically active 4 12 and 12 40 gac filters continuously removed 1 4 dioxane throughout the study duration and reached pseudo steady state removals after complete breakthrough of 1 4 dioxane was reached in the control gac filters at an ebct of 30 min a service time of 3 months corresponds to approximately 4000 bed volumes treated pseudo steady state removals by biologically active 4 12 and 12 40 gac filters were 69 9 and 54 11 respectively at the 7 5 minute ebct and 87 5 and 65 7 respectively at the 30 minute ebct fig 3 after breakthrough began in the resin filter removal in the biologically active filter continuously exceeded that of the control filter for all filters treatment effectiveness increased with increasing filter bed depths corresponding with higher ebcts as will be further discussed in section 3 4 the lowest effluent 1 4 dioxane concentration i e the highest removal percentage was obtained with the 4 12 gac that had the lowest adsorptive capacity for 1 4 dioxane it is likely this higher treatment effectiveness is related to the greater penetration of n butane into the filter bed containing the larger grain gac and or a reduced backwash frequency that was required for the larger grain medium over the first 3 months of operation the resin biologically active 12 40 gac and 4 12 gac required overall nine six and one backwashes respectively for the corresponding control filters four two and zero backwashes were required stored water heights were used to determine backwash requirements for each filter figure s5 the initial 1 4 dioxane breakthrough for all control and biologically active filters is shown in figure s8 at an ebct of 30 min while results suggest that initial breakthrough is similar for biologically active and control filters the impact of biological activity becomes apparent after control filters begin to break through results for the 4 12 gac filters suggest that biological activity was contributing to removal within 40 bed volumes for other filters the onset of biological enhancement became apparent later because the media exhibited larger adsorption capacities for 1 4 dioxane 250 300 bv for 12 40 gac 1500 bv for the carbonaceous resin 3 3 impact of empty bed contact time on treatment of 1 4 dioxane four ebcts were evaluated by using sampling ports located at bed depths of 16 and 32 cm in both the lead and lag filters these bed depths corresponded to ebcts of 7 5 15 22 5 and 30 min with a hlr of 1 28 m h treatment of 1 4 dioxane in both the lead and lag segments of the biologically active gac showed a distinct pattern of efficient removal in the top half of the filter segment followed by essentially no removal through the bottom half of the filter segment after the adsorptive capacity of the media was depleted fig 4 for resin filters 1 4 dioxane removal progressed throughout the filter bed although with higher efficiency at the top half of each biologically active filter segment the bottom half of both the lead and lag resin filters contributed to 1 4 dioxane removal because the adsorption capacity of the resin had not yet been exhausted during this sampling event the higher treatment at the top of each filter column is likely the result of at least two factors first because substrate had to be fed as a gas it is likely that substrate penetration into the filter beds was limited suggesting that 1 4 dioxane degrading microorganisms grew primarily near the top of each filter segment second the method of inoculation which included recirculating inoculum in downflow mode through the filter could have resulted in a higher starting concentration of 1 4 dioxane degrading bacteria at the top of each filter segment growth at the top of each filter segment nearest to the substrate was noticeably higher than lower sections of each filter segment figure s9 observing limited treatment at greater filter depths when using a gaseous substrate agrees with prior research that assessed cometabolism of nitrosamines with propane fed consortia in a biofilter mikkelson et al 2015 if increased treatment were desired either decreasing flow rates to increase contact time in the more biologically active sections of the filters or increasing the number of gas feed locations could be explored to assess the first option we decreased the hlr to the filters by 50 to 0 64 m h after 3 months of operation as a result ebcts doubled to 15 30 45 and 60 min at an ebct of 60 min 1 4 dioxane degradation increased to 94 and 83 in the 4 12 gac and 12 40 gac filters respectively table 3 typically the result of reducing hydraulic loading for systems with biological activity is that the fractional overall removal of contaminants will increase while the total mass of contaminant removed will decrease grady et al 2011 this is a consequence of various factors including diffusion boundary layer thicknesses shear and deposition of bacteria and residence time in the reactor as the hlr is decreased diffusion boundary layer thickness will increase slowing any diffusion controlled reaction biofilm thickness at the top of the filter column will increase due to lower shear and deposition rates but this will also result in an overall lower activity in the biofilm due to increased community age and decreased access to nutrients and or electron acceptors and less biofilm colonization deep into the filter grady et al 2011 flemming et al 2016 nonetheless for biological reactors the net result of a reduced hlr will be an overall increase in fractional removal because of the longer residence time that is available for biological reactions to take place this effect was evident in our results for example at the effluent of the lead 4 12 gac filter average 1 4 dioxane removals were 70 and 90 at hlrs of 1 28 m h and 0 64 m h respectively while removal percentages were higher at the lower hlr the mass of 1 4 dioxane that could be removed per unit time at a hlr of 0 64 m h was only 64 of that removed at a hlr of 1 28 m h it should be noted that less 1 4 dioxane was degraded in the lag gac filters than in the lead gac filters table 3 the lower biodegradation percentage may be a result of the n butane feeding system design which first supplied the lead filter and then the lag filter it is possible that n butane consumption in the lead filter led to a n butane concentration in the lag filter that was lower than originally calculated from henry s law and verified prior to inoculation of the filters figure s3 it is also possible that the reaction rate between short chain alkane monooxygenase and 1 4 dioxane was slower at the lower 1 4 dioxane concentrations in the lag filter 3 4 doc uv254 removal and filter effluent turbidity dissolved organic carbon doc removal was similar for both biologically active and control filters for all media types fig 5 doc breakthrough varied among media with earliest breakthrough for the resin followed by the 4 12 mesh gac and finally the 12 40 mesh gac control filters were operated without inoculation or n butane substrate feed but received non chlorinated influent therefore over time controls filters likely became biologically active with native heterotrophic bacteria and were able to degrade some doc a fraction of the influent doc is expected to be biodegradable by heterotrophic bacteria which would have been seeded from the influent water and were likely present in all filters also dissolved n butane in the sample would not be anticipated to contribute to doc concentrations measured as non purgeable organic carbon because of its high volatility overall results showed similar removals of doc in biologically active and control filters fig 5 these results suggest that inoculating filters and feeding n butane did not negatively impact their long term ability to remove doc uv254 breakthrough curves were similar to those obtained for figure s10 effluent turbidity was measured twice on two separate days and was also found to be similar for control and biologically active filters overall effluent from the 4 12 mesh gac filters exhibited the highest turbidity 0 25 0 03 ntu while the effluent from the resin and 12 40 mesh gac filters exhibited lower turbidity 0 18 0 03 ntu these results suggest that media selection impacts effluent doc and turbidity levels and needs to be considered for overall process optimization 3 5 activity based labeling of catalytically active monooxygenases bacteria expressing different hydrocarbon oxidizing sdimos including short chain alkane monooxygenase scam tetrahydrofuran monooxygenase thfmo and a recently described alkane oxidizing toluene monooxygenase tmo have been shown to degrade low µg l concentrations of 1 4 dioxane deng et al 2018 deng et al 2020 these enzymes are also all known to be inhibited by alkynes and can therefore potentially be detected by activity based labeling abl approaches using diyne probes bennett et al 2016 to probe for the presence of catalytically active monooxygenases in the filters abl analyses were conducted as described in si text s2 10 on samples of biological material collected during backwash of biologically active and control filters figs 6 and 7 show the fluorescently labeled polypeptides and corresponding total protein staining patterns detected following sds page analyses of these samples the active site containing subunits of monooxygenases are the expected molecular targets of the abl approach used in this study and all of the known 1 4 dioxane degrading sdimos have alpha hydroxylase subunits within the mass range of 63 59 kda with the alpha hydroxylase subunit of scam having a predicted mass of 59 kda chen 2016 the apparent masses of the major fluorescent polypeptides observed in our abl analysis figs 6 and 7 were 95 63 59 42 and 22 kda lanes 2 4 and 7 of fig 6 and lanes 2 3 and 7 8 of fig 7 our results therefore suggest that microorganisms expressing scam may be present in the backwash samples collected from biologically active filters that were able to remove 1 4 dioxane a role of the detected monooxygenases in 1 4 dioxane biodegradation detected is supported by the fact that these polypeptides were not detected in backwash water samples collected from control filters that lacked 1 4 dioxane degrading activity lanes 9 10 of fig 6 and lane 10 of fig 7 additional work is needed to identify the labeled polypeptides observed in figs 6 and 7 at the amino acid sequence level 3 6 16s rrna amplicon sequencing profiling results 16s rrna amplicon sequencing was used to understand differences in taxa for biologically active and control filters throughout the pilot study dna was extracted from backwash samples and analyzed using 16s amplicon sequencing bray curtis non dimensional analysis of 16s rrna amplicon sequencing results shows two distinct groupings in the filter backwash water samples one corresponding to biologically active filters and one corresponding to control filters fig 8 samples from biologically active filters are separated from the inoculum but more like the inoculum than the control filter samples active and control filters both appear to follow a trend with time as both samples move in the same direction over time after the beginning of the experiment this trend could be related to indigenous bacteria present in the filter influent water lag active filters also appear to maintain more similarity to the inoculum than lead filters as shown by lag filters always being on the left side closer to inoculum in paired lead lag sets this could be a result of the lead filter protecting the lag filter from colonizing bacteria details of taxa present in these samples are provided in figure s11 these results show that mycobacterium and variovorax are enriched in the inoculum and that mycobacterium was present in backwash samples from biologically active filters at levels that were higher than in backwash samples from control filters analyzed throughout the pilot study although variovorax strains have not previously been identified as 1 4 dioxane degradaing strains multiple mycobacterium strains are known to not only grow on gaseous alkanes such as n butane but have also been shown to cometabolically degrade 1 4 dioxane mcelroy et al 2019 7 discussion this study demonstrated that abl can be used to detect catalytically active monooxygenases in samples from biologically active filters that were degrading 1 4 dioxane thus abl could offer an approach to detect and potentially quantify active microorganisms capable of cometabolic degradation of 1 4 dioxane in biofilters this approach also has the added benefit that it detects catalytically active monooxygenases and therefore focuses on expressed enzymes rather than the potential for expression as measured by qpcr based approaches future research should be directed at using mass spectral analyses to identify the labeled polypeptides detected by abl at the molecular level this approach could provide important insights into which monooxygenases are expressed by n butane biostimulated cultures and are therefore likely responsible for initiating 1 4 dioxane biodegradation similarly 16s amplicon sequencing was found to show marked differences in taxonomy in filter backwash water samples from biologically active and control filters which may be useful to probe maintenance of 1 4 dioxane degrading bacteria in biofilters to further improve 1 4 dioxane treatment efficiency alternative biofilter designs could be explored that 1 increase exposure to the primary substrate by feeding n butane to multiple shorter column segments 2 increase contact time and or 3 rely on an alternative primary substrate that is more water soluble to optimize treated water quality a biofilter design could be explored with larger grain gac in the lead filter and smaller grain gac or carbonaceous resin in the lag filter the results of this study suggest that if only one medium were used a tradeoff would have to be made between 1 4 dioxane cometabolism and removal of doc uv254 and turbidity one limitation of this research was that we could not describe 1 4 dioxane biodegradation results with mathematical models this limitation was partly a result of our inability to measure biomass in our biofilters during the pilot study and partly due to lack of information on kinetic constants for the cometabolic degradation of 1 4 dioxane for our microbial consortium additional research focusing on the primary substrate and larger scale filters that allow biofilm sampling could provide data suitable for mathematical model parameterization also higher feed concentrations of 1 4 dioxane may permit the determination of degradation intermediates and products and or conduct a mass balance 8 conclusions in this research biofilters inoculated with a mixed culture enriched from a local river cometabolically degraded 1 4 dioxane that was spiked at a concentration of 10 µg l into coagulated and settled reservoir water treatment effectiveness for 1 4 dioxane was maintained in biologically active filters fed with n butane as the primary substrate for over 3 months biologically active filters containing large and medium size gac maintained 1 4 dioxane removals of 87 and 65 respectively at an ebct of 30 min removal of 1 4 dioxane increased to 94 and 83 respectively when the hlr was decreased by 50 leading to a 60 min ebct 1 4 dioxane degradation in biologically active filters containing carbonaceous resin exceeded that in the corresponding control filters while the beginning of 1 4 dioxane breakthrough in biologically active filters was controlled by the adsorptive capacity of the filter media long term treatment in biologically active filters was most effective for the gac with the largest grain size and the lowest adsorption capacity results suggest that treatment effectiveness may depend more on primary substrate access and backwash frequency than adsorption capacity of the filter media results also suggest that increasing the number of biologically active zones and or contact time in biologically active zones of cometabolically active filters can increase 1 4 dioxane degradation in control filters containing gac 1 4 dioxane broke through quickly the carbonaceous resin exhibited the largest adsorptive capacity for 1 4 dioxane and the control reached 30 breakthrough after 4180 1180 bed volumes of water were treated depending on the ebct considered another important finding is that inoculating and adding n butane as a substrate did not negatively impact doc removal suggesting that existing biofilters may be able to be modified to cometabolically degrade 1 4 dioxane while maintaining their doc removal capacity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
