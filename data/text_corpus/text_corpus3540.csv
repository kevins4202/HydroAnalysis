17700,hexachlorocyclohexanes hchs are widespread and persistent environmental pollutants which cause heavy contamination in soil sediment and groundwater an anaerobic consortium which was enriched on β hch using a soil sample from a contaminated area of a former pesticide factory was capable to transform α β γ and δ hch via tetrachlorocyclohexene isomers stoichiometrically to benzene and chlorobenzene the carbon and chlorine isotope enrichment factors εc and εcl of the dehalogenation of the four isomers ranged from 1 9 0 3 to 6 4 0 7 and from 1 6 0 2 to 3 2 0 6 respectively and the correlation of δ37cl and δ13c λ values of the four isomers ranged from 1 1 0 1 to 2 4 0 2 the evaluation of λ and the apparent kinetic isotope effects akie for carbon and chlorine may lead to the hypothesis that the two eliminated chlorine atoms of α and γ hch were in axial positions the same as for the β hch conformer which has six chlorine atoms in axial positions after ring flip the dichloroelimination of δ hch resulted in distinct akie and λ values as one chlorine atom is in axial whereas the other chlorine atoms are in the equatorial positions significant chlorine and carbon isotope fractionations of hch isomers were observed in the samples from a contaminated aquifer bitterfeld germany the 37cl 35cl and 13c 12c isotope fractionation patterns of hch isomers from laboratory experiments were used diagnostically in a model to characterize microbial dichloroelimination in the field study the comparison of isotope fractionation patterns indicates that the transformation of hch isomers at the field was mainly governed by microbial dichloroelimination transformation graphical abstract image 1 keywords reductive dichloroelimination β hch chlorine isotope

lal et al 2006 sang et al 1999 later γ hch the isomer possessing insecticidal toxicity was purified from technical hch and merchandised as lindane nagata et al 2007 slade 1945 vijgen et al 2011 the production and application of technical hch and lindane resulted in two main contamination types 1 massive point source contaminations from open air stockpiles and uncontained dumping of chemical waste during production and 2 diffuse pollution from the application of the pesticide according to estimates there are still 1 7 4 8 million tons of hch present in the environment worldwide vijgen 2006 vijgen et al 2019 once released into the environment hch can enter and accumulate in food chains and thus have adverse effects on human health by causing respiratory dysfunction and carcinogenesis for example caicedo et al 2011 pesce et al 2008 salam and das 2012 wu et al 2019a therefore there is an urgent need to evaluate hch contaminations in the environment microbial degradation of hch is one of the major mechanisms leading to a sustainable restoration of contaminated sites to date more than 30 aerobic strains were successfully isolated showing the ability to degrade hch lal et al 2010 additionally several studies demonstrated that hch could also be transformed under anoxic conditions using complex undefined conditions e g submerged soil macrae et al 1967 soil slurry bachmann et al 1988 sewage sludge buser and mueller 1995 methanogenic condition middeldorp et al 1996 as well as anaerobic digestion ad systems lian et al 2018 however only a few studies reported microorganisms for the dehalogenation of single hch isomers and described α and γ hch degradation because β and δ hch were found to be relatively more stable lal et al 2010 in 2005 van doesburg et al reported a co culture dehalobacter sp with sedimentibacter sp for the transformation of β hch van doesburg et al 2005 recently dehalococcoides mccartyi strains were shown to be capable of the reductive dehalogenation of γ hch α hch and δ hch while the transformation of β hch was not significant bashir et al 2018 kaufhold et al 2013 thus reports on anaerobic cultures able to transform hch under anoxic conditions are limited especially for β and δ hch transformation benzene and chlorobenzene cb were the final products in hch anaerobic transformation in the above mentioned studies thus the detected benzene and cb in hch contaminated field sites indicate anaerobic transformation as important processes in natural attenuation feidieker et al 1995 heidrich et al 2004 wycisk et al 2003 the evaluation of transformation pathways at contaminated field sites and the quantification of biodegradation during remediation efforts require assessment concepts beyond hch

evaluation of halogenated organic contaminants transformation in the environment nijenhuis and richnow 2016 many studies presented me csia for the characterization of different halogenated contaminants in groundwater e g chlorinated ethenes and polychlorinated phenols aeppli et al 2013 badin et al 2014 palau et al 2017 wiegert et al 2012 2013 for the evaluation of hch transformation stable carbon isotope analysis was applied in aquifers bashir et al 2015 liu et al 2017 recently me csia analysis of hch was applied for elucidating the transformation reactions of hchs in food webs wu et al 2019b to apply me csia for evaluation of biotransformation at field sites isotope enrichment factors of different elements εe are needed which can be obtained from laboratory reference experiments with pure or enrichment cultures previous studies reported the carbon isotope analysis of α and γ hch in anaerobic metabolic processes e g by dehalococcoides mccartyi and co metabolic processes e g by desulfococcus multivorans badea et al 2009 2011 bashir et al 2018 and in methanogenic bioreactors lian et al 2018 recently we reported the dual isotope c cl analysis for characterizing the reductive dechlorination of α and γ hch by two d mccartyi strains and an enrichment culture liu et al 2020 thus far enrichment factors for evaluating the anaerobic degradation of β and δ hch in field studies have not been reported in the literature yet this poses a major bottleneck for the application of csia to evaluate the transformation of different hch isomers in the environment in this study an anaerobic culture enriched in β hch was investigated for the transformation of four hch isomers α β γ and δ dual isotope c cl fractionation was examined and carbon and chlorine isotope enrichment factors were determined for the four hch isomers subsequently the reaction mechanisms of the four main hch isomers were characterized and compared by evaluation of the dual element slope λ and apparent kinetic stable isotope effects akie in addition the carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation were compared to previous enrichment and pure culture studies liu et al 2020 to analyze the variability of isotope fractionation of dehaloelimination reactions finally chlorine isotope compositions of hch were analyzed for groundwater samples from a previous study which already investigated the carbon isotope compositions liu et al 2017 and dual element isotope analysis λ was employed to elucidate the reaction mechanisms by taking advantage of multi element isotope fractionation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals α hch β hch γ hch δ hch benzene and cb were purchased from sigma aldrich germany n hexane analytical purity 99 was purchased from carl roth germany 2 2 soil sample a soil sample from the contaminated area of the former wuhan pesticide factory wuhan china was collected at 20 30 cm depth transported in plastic bags and stored at 4 c until further processing in this factory hchs ddts and chlorobenzenes were produced from 1959 to 1987 2 3 groundwater samples the groundwater samples from a large hch contamination located in bitterfeld germany were selected for chlorine isotope analysis liu et al 2017 2 4 cultivation experiment 2 4 1 pre cultivation experiments the pre cultivation experiments were divided into two major steps 1 a culture able to transform β hch was enriched 2 the β hch degrading culture was used to transform α γ and δ hch isomers minimal medium mm was prepared as described previously kaufhold et al 2013 five serum bottles 240 ml were prepared with 100 ml mm and flushed with 70 n2 30 co2 for 15 min to remove oxygen then the bottles were closed air tight and autoclaved after amendment supporting information si 1 bottles were re opened in an anoxic glove box and 1 g of soil was added as inoculum to each bottle thereafter the bottles were closed with teflon coated stoppers and sealed gastight hydrogen 0 5 bar overpressure and acetate 1 ml 1 26 g 50 ml were used as electron donor and carbon source respectively three bottles were spiked with β hch 300 μl 0 1 m in acetone serving as the electron acceptor two bottles without β hch were used as controls to monitor any background of benzene and cb all bottles were incubated at 30 c when the sum of benzene and cb concentration reached a level of 300 μm 1 ml of the culture suspension was transferred to fresh medium spiked with 300 μl β hch after the sixth transfer the enriched β hch degrading culture was tested for the ability to degrade other isomers α γ and δ hch using the same concentration as used for β hch 2 4 2 fractionation experiments after the transformation of the four hch isomers by the enrichment culture was successfully demonstrated four sets of fractionation experiments with single hch isomers were conducted with the initial concentration of 30 μm for α γ δ hch and 2 5 μm for β hch one experimental set up consisted of 18 bottles including two abiotic controls without inoculation the progress of transformation was analyzed by the formation of benzene and cb at different extents of hch transformation 5 ml of a saturated sodium sulfate solution acidified with sulfuric acid ph 1 was added to stop the microbial activity hchs and metabolites were extracted by adding 2 ml n hexane including an internal standard 15 μm α hch served as an internal standard for γ and δ hch experiments δ hch was used as the internal standard for α and β hch experiments for extraction the bottles were shaken at 120 rpm and 10 c for at least 4 h 2 5 chemical and isotopic analysis the concentration of benzene and cb were measured by gas chromatography an agilent 6890 series gas chromatograph gc agilent technologies palo alto usa equipped

hch concentrations all samples were measured three times and the uncertainty of analysis was typically smaller than 0 3 2 6 stable isotope analysis isotope enrichment factors εe were derived with the simplified rayleigh equation 1 ln δ t 1 δ 0 1 ε e l n c t c 0 where δt and δ0 are the carbon δ13c or chlorine δ37cl isotope compositions at a given point in time t and at the beginning of the reaction 0 respectively e represents the element c or cl ct c0 is the residual fraction of the substrate εe is the enrichment factor which can be obtained from the slope of the linear regression of ln ct c0 vs ln δt 1 δ0 1 the εe is reported with a 95 confidence interval ci the δ13c and δ37cl values from fractionation experiments were correlated to obtain the λ value used for the characterization of the c

is the number of reactive positions and z is the number of indistinguishable reactive positions resulting in intramolecular competition 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of hch isomers an enrichment culture was derived from contaminated soil by amending it with β hch after six transfers with β hch as the electron acceptor the enrichment culture was analyzed for the dechlorination of α γ and δ hch isomers the complete transformation of α β γ and δ hch 300 μm for each isomer indicated by the sum of benzene and chlorobenzene produced took about 120 75 150 and 210 days respectively si fig s1 the different transformation times for the individual hch isomers indicated that the transformation processes were isomer specific isomer specific transformation rates were also found previously as α and γ hch were transformed relatively faster than β and δ hch bashir et al 2018 brahmaprakash et al 1985 buser and mueller 1995 jagnow et al 1977 macrae et al 1967 middeldorp et al 1996 2005 quintero et al 2005 van doesburg et al 2005 in the presented study the transformation of β hch did not show any obvious lag phase compared with the other three isomers si fig s1 this could be the result of the pre cultivation six initial transfers which was solely performed with β hch thus corresponding dehalogenases were already activated similar as observed in the dehalogenation of chlorinated ethenes by an enrichment culture liang et al 2015 the different transformation rates of the isomers may indicate the presence of different dehalogenases with different activity as suggested in a previous report on the transformation of chlorinated ethenes liang et al 2015 tetrachlorocyclohexene tecch isomers each having specific retention times were identified by gc ms as the most likely first intermediate in the transformation of individual hch isomers due to lack of standards tecch isomers could not be characterized further the formation of tecch provides evidence that the initial degradation step was a dichloroelimination reaction similar to a previous observation for an enrichment culture and two dehalococcoides mccartyi strains liu et al 2020 the anaerobic transformation of α hch enantiomers was not accompanied by obvious enantioselectivity fig s2 which is in agreement with previous studies badea et al 2011 liu et al 2020 3 2 c and cl isotope fractionation of the hch isomers 3 2 1 isotope fractionation a significant carbon isotope enrichment was observed for all hch isomers the transformation resulted in identical εc of 4 2 0 5 and 4 1 0 4 for α hch and α h ch respectively fig 1 and fig s3 and no enantiomer specific transformation was observed the εc for γ and bulk α hch were 3 6 0 4 and 4 2 0 4 a similar range as reported in previous studies for the anaerobic transformation of the respective hch isomer table 1 α hch from 2 4 0 4 to 3 7 0 8 γ hch from 3 2 0 2 to 5 5 0 8 badea et al 2009 2011 bashir et al 2018 lian et al 2018 liu et al 2020 the carbon isotope enrichment of β hch and δ hch resulted in εc of 1 9 0 3 and 6 4 0 7 respectively thus far no reports are available for the isotope enrichment of β and δ hch in comparison to the εc of α and γ hch the isotope enrichment of β hch was weaker whereas for δ hch the carbon isotope enrichment was stronger chlorine isotope enrichment was observed for all hch isomers during the transformation by the enrichment culture fig 1 the derived εcl values were 2 1 0 3 for α hch 1 6 0 2 for β hch 3 2 0 6 for γ hch and 2 3 0 3 for δ hch consequently εcl of α and γ hch were also in a similar range compared to the previous study table 1 α hch from 1 4 0 3 to 1 8 0 2 γ hch from 2 9 0 4 to 3 3 0 4 liu et al 2020 as compared to carbon isotope fractionation the εcl of δ hch was similar to the value of α and γ hch while the value of β hch was relatively lower 3 2 2 akie for the akie calculations of α and γ hch different scenarios were extensively discussed elsewhere liu et al 2020 the spatial orientations axial and equatorial of the chlorine atoms determine the different physical and chemical properties of the isomers thus we exclude the consideration that all the chlorine atoms are chemically equivalent in this study the akie values were calculated based on the following scenarios a considering that the cleavage of two c cl bonds occurs in two consecutive steps stepwise bond cleavage and b considering that the cleavage of two c cl bonds occurs in a single step concerted bond cleavage the akie calculations of α and γ hch were based on the assumption that only chlorines with the trans diaxial configuration in the main conformers are active fig 2 for β hch all chlorine atoms of each possible conformation are orientated in the same direction equatorial or axial fig 2 and are considered to have an equal reactivity in case of the conformers of δ hch only one chlorine atom is in a different orientation compared to the other five ones fig 2 therefore akie calculations of δ hch considered two cases 1 the chlorine atom with a different orientation is not involved in the reaction which means the two vicinal reactive chlorine atoms belong to the five ones with the same orientation fig 2 bonds with red color 2 the chlorine atom with a different orientation is involved in the reaction and therefore the vicinal reactive chlorine atoms possess a different orientation fig 2 bonds with blue color the values of n z x and akie values of different scenarios are summarized in table 2 the akie values for α and γ hch were compared with the values reported in a previous study liu et al 2020 both akiec and akiecl are similar to the previously reported values which indicates a similar bond cleavage since there are no reports of akie values for the anaerobic transformation of β and δ hch available the akie values were compared with reference values reported for the abiotic stepwise dichloroelimination of chlorinated ethane by cr ii fe 0 and cu fe mixture table 2 lollar et al 2010 rosell et al 2019 the akiec stepwise of δ hch 1 040 0 005 is higher than the reference values which makes a stepwise bond cleavage unlikely and suggests a concerted bond cleavage for β hch it is not possible to exclude one specific bond cleavage as both akiec and akiecl are in the range of the reference values from stepwise dichloroelimination 3 3 carbon chlorine bond cleavage of hch isomers the λ values for α β γ and δ hch were determined with 1 9 0 1 1 3 0 1 1 1 0 1 and 2 4 0 2 respectively table 1 fig 1 the λ values of α and γ hch are in agreement with a previous study α hch from 1 7 0 2 to 2 0 0 3 γ hch from 1 1 0 3 to 1 2 0 1 liu et al 2020 consequently it can be assumed that the reductive dichloroelimination of α and γ hch observed in this study were similar to the transformation of α and γ hch by d mccartyi strains liu et al 2020 the λ value for β hch is similar to the value of γ hch indicating an elimination of the chlorine atoms in axial positions which is only possible for the β hch conformer having all chlorine atoms in axial positions fig 2 additionally this result is in line with a recent report of qiao and colleagues qiao et al 2020 which proposed that the chlorine atoms of β hch were in axial positions during dichloroelimination by flipping the carbon ring fig 2 in addition it is also possible that there are special enzymes which can catalyse the transformation of β hch with all chlorine atoms in equatorial positions leading to the same isotope effect as for γ hch transformation the λ value for δ hch was different from other isomers which is mainly caused by the relatively higher carbon isotope enrichment this also indicates that the bond cleavage of δ hch is different from other isomers the akiec akiecl was proposed as a probe to characterize the reaction mechanisms ji et al 2017 the application of akiec akiecl is similar to the concept of λ λ εc εcl but cancel out the effect of intramolecular competition for the transformation of α and γ hch similar akiec akiecl values α hch 1 006 0 002 γ hch 1 002 0 003 table 2 were observed which additionally are in the same range as the akiec akiecl values for the dichloroelimination of α and γ hch by d mccartyi strains from 1 003 0 002 to 1 005 0 002 liu et al 2020 this result supports a similar reaction mechanism for the transformation of α and γ hch which most likely follows an elimination of two vicinal chlorines in axial positions as reported previously liu et al 2020 qiao et al 2020 the akiec akiecl of β hch 1 002 0 002 is identical with the value for γ hch 1 002 0 003 which also supports the results derived from λ value evaluation that dichloroelimination of β and γ hch were similar for δ hch two cases were considered which are identical to those considered for the calculation of akies in case 1 the dichloroelimination mechanism of δ hch is similar to the mechanism of β hch the vicinal reacting chlorines have the same orientation accordingly it is expected the akiec akiecl values should be similar however this is not the case as akiec akiecl were 1 020 0 004 for δ hch and 1 002 0 002 for β hch which suggests differences in c cl bond cleavage consequently it is reasonable to assume that the dichloroelimination of δ hch follows the reaction mechanism proposed in case 2 here the reacting vicinal chlorines possess a different orientation fig 2 in the blue color one chlorine atom is in axial position whereas the other chlorine atom is in equatorial position thus a different mode of bond cleavage is proposed for δ hch compared to the dichloroelimination of α β and γ hch in which both chlorine atoms are in axial or equatorial positions our findings suggest that the initial reaction mechanism of δ hch dichloroelimination is different from a mechanism reported recently which proposed that the two chlorine atoms are eliminated in the axial positions qiao et al 2020 additionally also the ratio of the formed products benzene and mcb varied significantly from the ratio reported by qiao and colleagues 0 3 in this study 0 06 0 02 in the study of qiao et al qiao et al 2020 which indicates different reaction mechanisms the carbon and chlorine isotope fractionations of hch isomers during the transformation by different cultures even from geographically distinct locations e g germany and china show remarkably similar fractionation patterns fig 3 the λ values of enrichment and pure cultures show a very similar correlation of chlorine and carbon isotope fractionation indicating similar dehalogenation mechanisms and providing support for the opinion that the fractionation factors can be used for characterizing anaerobic transformation of hch at field sites 3 4 evaluation of hch biotransformation in groundwater samples groundwater samples from a previous study liu et al 2017 in which the four hch isomers have been detected were analyzed for cl isotopes si table s1 me csia was applied to evaluate the in situ transformation mechanisms of α β γ and δ hch the concentrations of the four hch isomers varied from 1 86 to 242 μg l for α hch 0 13 44 μg l for β hch 0 02 236 μg l for γ hch and 0 44 264 μg l for δ hch in comparison to the isotope composition of the source which is represented by the muck sample from the highly contaminated area liu et al 2017 both carbon and chlorine isotope enrichment was observed in all investigated samples si table s1 generally the chlorine isotope enrichment for γ and α hch δδ37cl up to 3 8 was relatively higher than the enrichment for β and δ hch δδ37cl up to 1 9 si table s2 in order to characterize the in situ transformation pathways the dual c cl isotope values obtained for the six field samples from bitterfeld germany are compared to the isotope fractionation patterns predicted by the data from laboratory studies for hch dichloroelimination fig 3 for α hch all samples fall in a narrow range indicating that the transformation process observed in the field follows a similar dichloroelimination process as observed by the investigated cultures fig 3a for γ hch two samples q1 and t2 fall out of the correlation describing dichloroelimination of the investigated cultures fig 3c this may indicate the presence of a different process involved in the transformation at this field locations e g aerobic degradation these two samples q1 and t2 showed strong enantiomer fractionation of α hch which is typical for aerobic degradation bashir et al 2013 liu et al 2019 enantiomer fractionation is usually not observed during anaerobic transformation liu et al 2020 thus aerobic degradation may have contributed to α hch at the locations q1 and t2 e g in other parts of the aquifer and or during transport however we cannot exclude the possibility of other anaerobic processes as α hch enantiomer selectivity was also observed in a biogas reactor lian et al 2019 for β and δ hch fig 3 b and d the similar isotope enrichment patterns indicate similar microbial transformation processes in laboratory and field samples i e dichloroelimination for β hch however there are only two samples within the 95 prediction band that describe microbial dichloroelimination fig 3b in the case of δ hch the dual isotope patterns of groundwater samples are similar to laboratory results although q1 and t2 were at the edge of the prediction band fig 3d however further studies focusing on multiple isotope analysis including the investigation of anaerobic and aerobic microbial transformation processes and chemical reactions for hch transformation are necessary for a detailed evaluation of the observed isotope effects in field samples in summary our study supports that the transformation of hch isomers at contaminated field sites can be characterized by me csia further field campaigns are needed to validate the application of me csia for identifying different transformation pathways 4 conclusion our study demonstrates that me csia can be applied to characterize the anaerobic dichloroelimination of the hch isomers using the correlation of carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation data λ the determined akie values are consistent with a concerted bond cleavage which is in line with previous studies the similarity of carbon and chlorine isotope enrichment factors compared to previous reports suggests that csia can be applied robustly for field studies our study gives a model for evaluating in situ transformation of α β γ and δ hch by using me csia declaration of competing interest the authors

17700,hexachlorocyclohexanes hchs are widespread and persistent environmental pollutants which cause heavy contamination in soil sediment and groundwater an anaerobic consortium which was enriched on β hch using a soil sample from a contaminated area of a former pesticide factory was capable to transform α β γ and δ hch via tetrachlorocyclohexene isomers stoichiometrically to benzene and chlorobenzene the carbon and chlorine isotope enrichment factors εc and εcl of the dehalogenation of the four isomers ranged from 1 9 0 3 to 6 4 0 7 and from 1 6 0 2 to 3 2 0 6 respectively and the correlation of δ37cl and δ13c λ values of the four isomers ranged from 1 1 0 1 to 2 4 0 2 the evaluation of λ and the apparent kinetic isotope effects akie for carbon and chlorine may lead to the hypothesis that the two eliminated chlorine atoms of α and γ hch were in axial positions the same as for the β hch conformer which has six chlorine atoms in axial positions after ring flip the dichloroelimination of δ hch resulted in distinct akie and λ values as one chlorine atom is in axial whereas the other chlorine atoms are in the equatorial positions significant chlorine and carbon isotope fractionations of hch isomers were observed in the samples from a contaminated aquifer bitterfeld germany the 37cl 35cl and 13c 12c isotope fractionation patterns of hch isomers from

reported microorganisms for the dehalogenation of single hch isomers and described α and γ hch degradation because β and δ hch were found to be relatively more stable lal et al 2010 in 2005 van doesburg et al reported a co culture dehalobacter sp with sedimentibacter sp for the transformation of β hch van doesburg et al 2005 recently dehalococcoides mccartyi strains were shown to be capable of the reductive dehalogenation of γ hch α hch and δ hch while the transformation of β hch was not significant bashir et al 2018 kaufhold et al 2013 thus reports on anaerobic cultures able to transform hch under anoxic conditions are limited especially for β and δ hch transformation benzene and chlorobenzene cb were the final products in hch anaerobic transformation in the above mentioned studies thus the detected benzene and cb in hch contaminated field sites indicate anaerobic transformation as important processes in natural attenuation feidieker et al 1995 heidrich et al 2004 wycisk et al 2003 the evaluation of transformation pathways at contaminated field sites and the quantification of biodegradation during remediation efforts require assessment concepts beyond hch concentration analysis alone langenhoff et al 2013 phillips et al 2006 rubinos et al 2007 multi element compound specific isotope analysis me csia has been proposed for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of halogenated organic contaminants transformation in the environment nijenhuis and richnow 2016 many studies presented me csia for the characterization of different halogenated contaminants in groundwater e g chlorinated ethenes and polychlorinated phenols aeppli et al 2013 badin et al 2014 palau et al 2017 wiegert et al 2012 2013 for the evaluation of hch transformation stable carbon isotope analysis was applied in aquifers bashir et al 2015 liu et al 2017 recently me csia analysis of hch was applied for elucidating the transformation reactions of hchs in food webs wu et al 2019b to apply me csia for evaluation of biotransformation at field sites isotope enrichment factors of different elements εe are needed which can be obtained from laboratory reference experiments with pure or enrichment cultures previous studies reported the carbon isotope analysis of α and γ hch in anaerobic metabolic processes e g by dehalococcoides mccartyi and co metabolic processes e g by desulfococcus multivorans badea et al 2009 2011 bashir et al 2018 and in methanogenic bioreactors lian et al 2018 recently we reported the dual isotope c cl analysis for characterizing the reductive dechlorination of α and γ hch by two d mccartyi strains and an enrichment culture liu et al 2020 thus far enrichment factors for evaluating the anaerobic degradation of β and δ hch in field studies have not been reported in the literature yet this poses a major bottleneck for the application of csia to evaluate the transformation of different hch isomers in the environment in this study an anaerobic culture enriched in β hch was investigated for the transformation of four hch isomers α β γ and δ dual isotope c cl fractionation was examined and carbon and chlorine isotope enrichment factors were determined for the four hch isomers subsequently the reaction mechanisms of the four main hch isomers were characterized and compared by evaluation of the dual element slope λ and apparent kinetic stable isotope effects akie in addition the carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation were compared to previous enrichment and pure culture studies liu et al 2020 to analyze the variability of isotope fractionation of dehaloelimination reactions finally chlorine isotope compositions of hch were analyzed for groundwater samples from a previous study which already investigated the carbon isotope compositions liu et al 2017 and dual element isotope analysis λ was employed to elucidate the reaction mechanisms by taking advantage of multi element isotope fractionation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals α hch β hch γ hch δ hch benzene and cb were purchased from sigma aldrich germany n hexane analytical purity 99 was purchased from carl roth germany

processing in this factory hchs ddts and chlorobenzenes were produced from 1959 to 1987 2 3 groundwater samples the groundwater samples from a large hch contamination located in bitterfeld germany were selected for chlorine isotope analysis liu et al 2017 2 4 cultivation experiment 2 4 1 pre cultivation experiments the pre cultivation experiments were divided into two major steps 1 a culture able to transform β hch was enriched 2 the β hch degrading culture was used to transform α γ and δ hch isomers minimal medium mm was prepared as described previously kaufhold et al 2013 five serum bottles 240 ml were prepared with 100 ml mm and flushed with 70 n2 30 co2 for 15 min to remove oxygen then the bottles were closed air tight and autoclaved after amendment supporting information si 1 bottles were re opened in an anoxic glove box and 1 g of soil was added as inoculum to each bottle thereafter the bottles were closed with teflon coated stoppers and sealed gastight hydrogen 0 5 bar overpressure and acetate 1 ml 1 26 g 50 ml were used as electron donor and carbon source respectively three bottles were spiked with β hch 300 μl 0 1 m in acetone serving as the electron acceptor two bottles without β hch were used as controls to monitor any background of benzene and cb all bottles were incubated at 30 c when the sum of benzene and cb concentration reached a level of 300 μm 1 ml of the culture suspension was transferred to fresh medium spiked with 300 μl β hch after the sixth transfer the enriched β hch degrading culture was tested for the ability to degrade other isomers α γ and δ hch using the same concentration as used for β hch 2 4 2 fractionation experiments after the transformation of the four hch isomers by the enrichment culture was successfully demonstrated four sets of fractionation experiments with single hch isomers were conducted with the initial concentration of 30 μm for α γ δ hch and 2 5 μm for β hch one experimental set up consisted of 18 bottles including two abiotic controls without inoculation the progress of transformation was analyzed by the formation of benzene and cb at different extents of hch transformation 5 ml of a saturated sodium sulfate solution acidified with sulfuric acid ph 1 was added to stop the microbial activity hchs and metabolites were extracted by adding 2 ml n hexane including an internal standard 15 μm α hch served as an internal standard for γ and δ hch experiments δ hch was used as the internal standard for α and β hch experiments for extraction the bottles were shaken at 120 rpm and 10 c for at least 4

hch concentrations all samples were measured three times and the uncertainty of analysis was typically smaller than 0 3 2 6 stable isotope analysis isotope enrichment factors εe were derived with the simplified rayleigh equation 1 ln δ t 1 δ 0 1 ε e l n c t c 0 where δt and δ0 are the carbon δ13c or chlorine δ37cl isotope compositions at a given point in time t and at the beginning of the reaction 0 respectively e represents the element c or cl ct c0 is the residual fraction of the substrate εe is the enrichment factor which can be obtained from the slope of the linear regression of ln ct c0 vs ln δt 1 δ0 1 the εe is reported with a 95 confidence interval ci the δ13c and δ37cl values from fractionation experiments were correlated to obtain the λ value used for the characterization of the c

is the number of reactive positions and z is the number of indistinguishable reactive positions resulting in intramolecular competition 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of hch isomers an enrichment culture was derived from contaminated soil by amending it with β hch after six transfers with β hch as the electron acceptor the enrichment culture was analyzed for the dechlorination of α γ and δ hch isomers the complete transformation of α β γ and δ hch 300 μm for each isomer indicated by the sum of benzene and chlorobenzene produced took about 120 75 150 and 210 days respectively si fig s1 the different transformation times for the individual hch isomers indicated that the transformation processes were isomer specific isomer specific transformation rates were also found previously as α and γ hch were transformed relatively faster than β and δ hch bashir et al 2018 brahmaprakash et al 1985 buser and mueller 1995 jagnow et al 1977 macrae et al 1967 middeldorp et al 1996 2005 quintero et al 2005 van doesburg et al 2005 in the presented study the transformation of β hch did not show any obvious lag phase compared with the other three isomers si fig s1 this could be the result of the pre cultivation six initial transfers which was solely performed with β hch thus corresponding dehalogenases were already activated similar as observed in the dehalogenation of chlorinated ethenes by an enrichment culture liang et al 2015 the different transformation rates of the isomers may indicate the presence of different dehalogenases with different activity as suggested in a previous report on the transformation of chlorinated ethenes liang et al 2015 tetrachlorocyclohexene tecch isomers each having specific retention times were identified by gc ms as the most likely first intermediate in the transformation of individual hch isomers due to lack of standards tecch isomers could not be characterized further the formation of tecch provides evidence that the initial degradation step was a dichloroelimination reaction similar to a previous observation for an enrichment culture and two dehalococcoides mccartyi strains liu et al 2020 the anaerobic transformation of α hch enantiomers was not accompanied by obvious enantioselectivity fig s2 which is in agreement with previous studies badea et al 2011 liu et al 2020 3 2 c and cl isotope fractionation of the hch isomers 3 2 1 isotope fractionation a significant carbon isotope enrichment was observed for all hch isomers the transformation resulted in identical εc of 4 2 0 5 and 4 1 0 4 for α hch and α h ch respectively fig 1 and fig s3 and no enantiomer specific transformation was observed the εc for γ and bulk α hch were 3 6 0 4 and 4 2 0 4 a similar range as reported in previous studies for the anaerobic transformation of the respective hch isomer table 1 α hch from 2 4 0 4 to 3 7 0 8 γ hch from 3 2 0 2 to 5 5 0 8 badea et al 2009 2011 bashir et al 2018 lian et al 2018 liu et al 2020 the carbon isotope enrichment of β hch and δ hch resulted in εc of 1 9 0 3 and 6 4 0 7 respectively thus far no reports are available for the isotope enrichment of β and δ hch in comparison to the εc of α and γ hch the isotope enrichment of β hch was weaker whereas for δ hch the carbon isotope enrichment was stronger chlorine isotope enrichment was observed for all hch isomers during the transformation by the enrichment culture fig 1 the derived εcl values were 2 1 0 3 for α hch 1 6 0 2 for β hch 3 2 0 6 for γ hch and 2 3 0 3 for δ hch consequently εcl of α and γ hch were also in a similar range compared to the previous study table 1 α hch from 1 4 0 3 to 1 8 0 2 γ hch from 2 9 0 4 to 3 3 0 4 liu et al 2020 as compared to carbon isotope fractionation the εcl of δ hch was similar to the value of α and γ hch while the value of β hch was relatively lower 3 2 2 akie for the akie calculations of α and γ hch different scenarios were extensively discussed elsewhere liu et al 2020 the spatial orientations axial and equatorial of the chlorine atoms determine the different physical and chemical properties of the isomers thus we exclude the consideration that all the chlorine atoms are chemically equivalent in this study the akie values were calculated based on the following scenarios a considering that the cleavage of two c cl bonds occurs in two consecutive steps stepwise bond cleavage and b considering that the cleavage of two c cl bonds occurs in a single step concerted bond cleavage the akie calculations of α and γ hch were based on the assumption that only chlorines with the trans diaxial configuration in the main conformers are active fig 2 for β hch all chlorine atoms of each possible conformation are orientated in the same direction equatorial or axial fig 2 and are considered to have an equal reactivity in case of the conformers of δ hch only one chlorine atom is in a different orientation compared to the other five ones fig 2 therefore akie calculations of δ hch considered two cases 1 the chlorine atom with a different orientation is not involved in the reaction which means the two vicinal reactive chlorine atoms belong to the five ones with the same orientation fig 2 bonds with red color 2 the chlorine atom with a different orientation is involved in the reaction and therefore the vicinal reactive chlorine atoms possess a different orientation fig 2 bonds with blue color the values of n z x and akie values of different scenarios are summarized in table 2 the akie values for α and γ hch were compared with the values reported in a previous study liu et al 2020 both akiec and akiecl are similar to the previously reported values which indicates a similar bond cleavage since there are no reports of akie values for the anaerobic transformation of β and δ hch available the akie values were compared with reference values reported for the abiotic stepwise dichloroelimination of chlorinated ethane by cr ii fe 0 and cu fe mixture table 2 lollar et al 2010 rosell et al 2019 the akiec stepwise of δ hch 1 040 0 005 is higher than the reference values which makes a stepwise bond cleavage unlikely and suggests a concerted bond cleavage for β hch it is not possible to exclude one specific bond cleavage as both akiec and akiecl are in the range of the reference values from stepwise dichloroelimination 3 3 carbon chlorine bond cleavage of hch isomers the λ values for α β γ and δ hch were determined with 1 9 0 1 1 3 0 1 1 1 0 1 and 2 4 0 2 respectively table 1 fig 1 the λ values of α and γ hch are in agreement with a previous study α hch from 1 7 0 2 to 2 0 0 3 γ hch from 1 1 0 3 to 1 2 0 1 liu et al 2020 consequently it can be assumed that the reductive dichloroelimination of α and γ hch observed in this study were similar to the transformation of α and γ hch by d mccartyi strains liu et al 2020 the λ value for β hch is similar to the value of γ hch indicating an elimination of the chlorine atoms in axial positions which is only possible for the β hch conformer having all chlorine atoms in axial positions fig 2 additionally this result is in line with a recent report of qiao and colleagues qiao et al 2020 which proposed that the chlorine atoms of β hch were in axial positions during dichloroelimination by flipping the carbon ring fig 2 in addition it is also possible that there are special enzymes which can catalyse the transformation of β hch with all chlorine atoms in equatorial positions leading to the same isotope effect as for γ hch transformation the λ value for δ hch was different from other isomers which is mainly caused by the relatively higher carbon isotope enrichment this also indicates that the bond cleavage of δ hch is different from other isomers the akiec akiecl was proposed as a probe to characterize the reaction mechanisms ji et al 2017 the application of akiec akiecl is similar to the concept of λ λ εc εcl but cancel out the effect of intramolecular competition for the transformation of α and γ hch similar akiec akiecl values α hch 1 006 0 002 γ hch 1 002 0 003 table 2 were observed which additionally are in the same range as the akiec akiecl values for the dichloroelimination of α and γ hch by d mccartyi strains from 1 003 0 002 to 1 005 0 002 liu et al 2020 this result supports a similar reaction mechanism for the transformation of α and γ hch which most likely follows an elimination of two vicinal chlorines in axial positions as reported previously liu et al 2020 qiao et al 2020 the akiec akiecl of β hch 1 002 0 002 is identical with the value for γ hch 1 002 0 003 which also supports the results derived from λ value evaluation that dichloroelimination of β and γ hch were similar for δ hch two cases were considered which are identical to those considered for the calculation of akies in case 1 the dichloroelimination mechanism of δ hch is similar to the mechanism of β hch the vicinal reacting chlorines have the same orientation accordingly it is expected the akiec akiecl values should be similar however this is not the case as akiec akiecl were 1 020 0 004 for δ hch and 1 002 0 002 for β hch which suggests differences in c cl bond cleavage consequently it is reasonable to assume that the dichloroelimination of δ hch follows the reaction mechanism proposed in case 2 here the reacting vicinal chlorines possess a different orientation fig 2 in the blue color one chlorine atom is in axial position whereas the other chlorine atom is in equatorial position thus a different mode of bond cleavage is proposed for δ hch compared to the dichloroelimination of α β and γ hch in which both chlorine atoms are in axial or equatorial positions our findings suggest that the initial reaction mechanism of δ hch dichloroelimination is different from a mechanism reported recently which proposed that the two chlorine atoms are eliminated in the axial positions qiao et al 2020 additionally also the ratio of the formed products benzene and mcb varied significantly from the ratio reported by qiao and colleagues 0 3 in this study 0 06 0 02 in the study of qiao et al qiao et al 2020 which indicates different reaction mechanisms the carbon and chlorine isotope fractionations of hch isomers during the transformation by different cultures even from geographically distinct locations e g germany and china show remarkably similar fractionation patterns fig 3 the λ values of enrichment and pure cultures show a very similar correlation of chlorine and carbon isotope fractionation indicating similar dehalogenation mechanisms and providing support for the opinion that the fractionation factors can be used for characterizing anaerobic transformation of hch at field sites 3 4 evaluation of hch biotransformation in groundwater samples groundwater samples from a previous study liu et al 2017 in which the four hch isomers have been detected were analyzed for cl isotopes si table s1 me csia was applied to evaluate the in situ transformation mechanisms of α β γ and δ hch the concentrations of the four hch isomers varied from 1 86 to 242 μg l for α hch 0 13 44 μg l for β hch 0 02 236 μg l for γ hch and 0 44 264 μg l for δ hch in comparison to the isotope composition of the source which is represented by the muck sample from the highly contaminated area liu et al 2017 both carbon and chlorine isotope enrichment was observed in all investigated samples si table s1 generally the chlorine isotope enrichment for γ and α hch δδ37cl up to 3 8 was relatively higher than the enrichment for β and δ hch δδ37cl up to 1 9 si table s2 in order to characterize the in situ transformation pathways the dual c cl isotope values obtained for the six field samples from bitterfeld germany are compared to the isotope fractionation patterns predicted by the data from laboratory studies for hch dichloroelimination fig 3 for α hch all samples fall in a narrow range indicating that the transformation process observed in the field follows a similar dichloroelimination process as observed by the investigated cultures fig 3a for γ hch two samples q1 and t2 fall out of the correlation describing dichloroelimination of the investigated cultures fig 3c this may indicate the presence of a different process involved in the transformation at this field locations e g aerobic degradation these two samples q1 and t2 showed strong enantiomer fractionation of α hch which is typical for aerobic degradation bashir et al 2013 liu et al 2019 enantiomer fractionation is usually not observed during anaerobic transformation liu et al 2020 thus aerobic degradation may have contributed to α hch at the locations q1 and t2 e g in other parts of the aquifer and or during transport however we cannot exclude the possibility of other anaerobic processes as α hch enantiomer selectivity was also observed in a biogas reactor lian et al 2019 for β and δ hch fig 3 b and d the similar isotope enrichment patterns indicate similar microbial transformation processes in laboratory and field samples i e dichloroelimination for β hch however there are only two samples within the 95 prediction band that describe microbial dichloroelimination fig 3b in the case of δ hch the dual isotope patterns of groundwater samples are similar to laboratory results although q1 and t2 were at the edge of the prediction band fig 3d however further studies focusing on multiple isotope analysis including the investigation of anaerobic and aerobic microbial transformation processes and chemical reactions for hch transformation are necessary for a detailed evaluation of the observed isotope effects in field samples in summary our study supports that the transformation of hch isomers at contaminated field sites can be characterized by me csia further field campaigns are needed to validate the application of me csia for identifying different transformation pathways 4 conclusion our study demonstrates that me csia can be applied to characterize the anaerobic dichloroelimination of the hch isomers using the correlation of carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation data λ the determined akie values are consistent with a concerted bond cleavage which is in line with previous studies the similarity of carbon and chlorine isotope enrichment factors compared to previous reports suggests that csia can be applied robustly for field studies our study gives a model for evaluating in situ transformation of α β γ and δ hch by using me csia declaration of competing interest the authors

17701,the occurrence temporal variation and spatial variation of antibiotics in coastal bays and estuaries worldwide are not well documented or understood fifteen target antibiotics within the five classes of β lactams amphenicols macrolides fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides were measured during the summer and winter in the water of jiaozhou bay in china which is a semi enclosed urbanized bay fourteen antibiotics excluding tylosin were detected thus demonstrating the widespread occurrence of their residues in the bay the total antibiotic concentration ranged from 71 8 ng l 1 to 840 ng l 1 for the estuarine water which was significantly higher than that for the bay water 38 7 181 ng l 1 the antibiotic classes in the bay water were dominated by fluoroquinolones and β lactams which accounted for nearly 90 of the total antibiotic concentration in addition amoxicillin contamination was the most prominent among the 14 detected antibiotics as it accounted for 44 of the total antibiotic concentration the concentrations of amoxicillin leucomycin enrofloxacin and sulfamonomethoxine in the bay water were usually higher than those reported for coastal bays and estuaries worldwide the average total antibiotic concentration in the bay water was 84 7 ng l 1 during the summer which was significantly lower than that during the winter 129 0 ng l 1 this was mainly due to high dilution by runoff during the summer the florfenicol concentration in the bay water was significantly higher during the summer than in winter due to its higher usage in aquaculture during the summer spatially the total antibiotic concentration both summer and winter was higher in the water along the eastern coast of the bay where the population and hospital densities are high however the sum of the veterinary antibiotic concentrations was higher in the northeastern aquaculture area of the bay during the summer a risk assessment revealed that amoxicillin and enrofloxacin could pose high risks risk quotient of 1 to algae in the bay the synergic effects of pharmaceutical mixtures and the bioaccumulation of antibiotics through the food web should be considered in future studies

improving human health preventing and treating animals and plants infections promoting growth in animal farming and for therapeutic purposes and as prophylactic agents in aquaculture kummerer 2009 martinze 2008 2009 sapkota et al 2008 all of these uses have resulted in the release of large amounts of antibiotics to aquatic systems hanna et al 2018 hughes et al 2013 kummerer 2009 loos et al 2013a 2013b schwarzenbach et al 2006 it was estimated that a total of 53 800 t of antibiotics were released to rivers and waterways in china during 2013 zhang et al 2015 antibiotics are transported into estuaries and bays via rivers and streams kötke et al 2019 lei et al 2019 letsinger et al 2019 xu et al 2013 yan et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 zheng et al 2011 2012 which leads to the continental scale pollution of estuaries and bays by antibiotics and antibiotic resistant genes martinez 2008 zhu et al 2017 estuaries bays and coastal seas are focal points of human settlement and marine resource use lotze et al 2006 antibiotics released into these coastal environments pose potential health risks to coastal ecosystems as well as humans therefore the occurrence and fate of antibiotics in estuaries bays and coastal seas has drawn great attention worldwide in recent years benotti and brownawell 2007 birch et al 2015 han et al 2020 kötke et al 2019 leng et al 2020 letsinger et al 2019 li et al 2018 mezzelani et al 2018 thomas and hilton 2004 yang et al 2020 various levels of antibiotic contamination in seawater have been documented for different regions of the world the concentrations and detection frequencies dfs of antibiotic in europe were generally lower than other regions fig 1 an early study in 2002 reported the concentrations of erythromycin etm sulfamethoxazole smx and trimethoprim tmp in the surface water of a uk estuary for the first time thomas and hilton 2004 from 2009 to 2011 a global monitoring study of antibiotics was conducted in the coastal environments of different marine systems nödler et al 2014 in their work five antibiotics were determined in 153 seawater samples collected from the shorelines of europe and usa the results showed that the overall dfs for clarithromycin ctm etm roxithromycin rtm smx and tmp were all below 30 nödler et al 2014 a recent study undertaken in 2015 and 2016 indicated that a group of eight antibiotics in german estuaries and coastal waters was dominated by the sulfonamide smx which accounted for nearly 80 of the total antibiotic concentrations while the maximum concentrations for other antibiotics were less than 10 ng l 1 kötke et al 2019 in chesapeake bay usa however the highest concentrations were recorded to be 94 1 ng l 1 17 8 ng l 1 14 8 ng l 1 and 9 7 ng l 1 for norfloxacin nfx enrofloxacin efx smx and ctm respectively n 14 he et al 2019 spatial and temporal occurrences of tmp were reported for uk estuaries by letsinger et al 2019 spatially the highest concentration was detected at wastewater discharge sites while temporally the highest and lowest concentrations were during the winter and summer respectively n 38 in general the occurrence temporal variation and spatial variation of antibiotics in coastal bays and estuaries worldwide are not well reported or understood antibiotics detected in the coastal seawater of china have usually been characterized by higher concentrations and dfs in comparison to other regions fig 1 a study regarding the coastal water of bohai bay in 2008 indicated that dfs were more than 50 for smx etm ofloxacin ofx and nfx zou et al 2011 in the coastal water of liaodong bay the detectable concentrations for widely used sulfonamides smx tmp sulfadiazine sdz and sulfamonomethoxine smm were 4 3 76 8

sites with median concentrations of 2 4 ng l 1 to 60 ng l 1 zhang et al 2012 on the other hand the maximum concentrations in the off coastal water of the bohai sea and the yellow sea were 6 7 ng l 1 8 3 ng l 1 and 16 6 ng l 1 for etm smx and tmp respectively while their dfs were 100 98 and 73 zhang et al 2013 recently seven out of 13 target antibiotics were detected in the coastal waters of china lu et al 2018 the total antibiotic concentration ranged from 390 ng l 1 to 915 ng l 1 and was dominated by nfx rtm and cfx lu et al 2018 an intensive study conducted by yang et al 2020 indicated that the total concentration of pharmaceutical and personal care products including 24 antibiotics in chinese coastal waters ranged from 0 88 ng l 1 to 1194 ng l 1 and was relatively higher than that reported for korean coastal waters 9 91 442 ng l 1 therefore the widespread and continued contamination of antibiotics in the coastal waters of china are a matter of concern jiaozhou bay jzb is an urbanized semi enclosed bay located in qingdao which is a rapidly growing chinese city with intensive anthropogenic activities the occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of antibiotics in jzb are relatively unknown although r j zhang et al 2013 investigated 11 antibiotics categorized into macrolides and sulfonamides groups in jzb and the rivers that feed into it the authors found that the total concentrations of macrolides and sulfonamides ranged from 3 1 ng l 1 to 71 3 ng l 1 and 35 3 ng l 1 to 839 2 ng l 1 respectively and mainly consisting of smx tmp and etm further the concentrations of eight fluoroquinolones have been measured in the estuarine sediments of the dagu river and yang river which feed into jzb liu et al 2018 2020 the results of these studies revealed that the total concentration of fluoroquinolones ranged from 0 28 ng g 1 to 10 86 ng g 1 and that fluoroquinolones mainly originated from domestic hospital and aquaculture sewage discharges in addition ofx and oxolinic acid were also found to be predominant antibiotics in the sediment of these rivers liu et al 2018 2020 while these studies investigated macrolides sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones in jzb and the rivers feeding into it the occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of chemically diverse antibiotics in the bay water have not yet been reported accordingly the objectives of this study are to concurrently investigate the occurrence spatiotemporal change and ecological risks of widely used antibiotics in the water of jzb including five groups of antibiotics five macrolides four fluoroquinolones three sulfonamides two amphenicols and one β lactam this study represents the first attempt to simultaneously quantify a relatively large suite of antibiotics in the water of jzb at diverse locations during two seasons 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection as mentioned jzb 35 38 36 18 n 120 04 120 23 e is an urbanized semi enclosed bay

50 or l c 50 af for acute toxicity 3 pnec noec or loec af for chronic toxicity where mec and pnec refer to the measured concentrations and predicted no effect concentrations respectively the pnec values were calculated by dividing the lowest acute or chronic toxicity level by an assessment factor af for acute toxicity levels the half maximal effect concentration ec50 or the median lethal concentration lc50 was used and the af was 1000 ma et al 2017 mijangos et al 2018 xie et al 2019 for chronic toxicity levels no observed effect concentrations noec or lowest observed effect concentrations loec were used and the applied af values were 100 50 or 10 depending on the available data ec 2003 higher concentration values obtained from the summer and winter sampling for each compound at each sampling site were used as the mec values which represent the worse case scenario in accordance with the technical guidance document on risk assessment for the european union ec 2003 in our past publication a substantial amount of acute or chronic toxicity data for the selected antibiotics for non target organisms from different trophic levels algae crustacean invertebrates mollusca and fish were acquired from the ecotox database of the united states environmental protection agency us epa and are shown in the supplementary material of lei et al 2019 risk levels were classified into high risk rq 1 medium risk 0 1 rq 1 and low risk rq 0 1 biel maeso et al 2018 ec 2003 hernando et al 2006 xu et al 2013 2 6 statistical analyses the statistical analyses were performed using sas jmp statistical version 13 3 0 pro tukey s honest significant difference tests were used to examine the statistical significance at a significant level of 0 05 α 0 05 in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of the target antibiotics and comparison with other regions the dfs and concentrations of the target antibiotics were usually higher in estuarine water than in bay water table 1 the results showed that 14 out of the 15 target antibiotics except tyl were detected in the estuarine water samples while 13 antibiotics except etm h2o and tyl were detected in the seawater samples the results showed that efx nfx smm and amox were detected at all sites while ofx was detected at all estuarine sites in general the dfs of fluoroquinolones were higher than those of macrolides sulfonamides and amphenicols these results demonstrate the widespread occurrence of the target antibiotic residues excluding tyl in the bay and suggest the need for enhancing the removal of these antibiotics during municipal wastewater treatment animal husbandry waste management and aquaculture waste management within the jzb watershed all of the raw data are available in tables s7 and s8 the total target antibiotic concentrations ranged from 71 7 ng l 1 to 839 9 ng l 1 in the estuarine water which was significantly higher than those in the bay water 38 7 ng l 1 to 180 7 ng l 1 the higher dfs and concentrations of the target antibiotics in the estuarine water suggest the importance of riverine inputs as a source of antibiotics to jzb previous studies also demonstrated that riverine inputs of antibiotics are generally their major source in estuaries and bays liang et al 2013 shi et al 2014 yan et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 zheng et al 2011 zou et al 2011 in the estuarine water samples the total concentrations of amphenicols macrolides fluoroquinolones sulfonamides and ß lactam were 2 0 67 8 ng l 1 not detected nd to 81 1 ng l 1 28 2 436 7 ng l 1 1 7 119 8 ng l 1 and 34 6 786 4 ng l 1 respectively with averages of 20 1 ng l 1 24 0 ng l 1 188 5 ng l 1 22 7 ng l 1 and 173 8 ng l 1 respectively in the bay water these were nd to 25 7 ng l 1 nd to 32 2 ng l 1 15 9 94 8 ng l 1 1 2 14 7 ng l 1 and 7 8 90 9 ng l 1 respectively with averages of 5 2 ng l 1 4 2 ng l 1 49 2 ng l 1 3 8 ng l 1 and 47 6 ng l 1 respectively these results reveal that the groups of 13 antibiotics in the bay water were dominated by the classes of fluoroquinolones and β lactams which accounted for nearly 90 of the total antibiotic concentrations in addition amox contamination was the most prominent issue with respect to antibiotic pollution in the bay water and accounted for 44 of the total antibiotic concentrations the concentrations of amox lcm efx and smm in the water of jzb were usually higher than those reported for victoria bay hong kong the beibu gulf hailing bay laizhou bay and liaodong bay in china chesapeake bay in the us the persian gulf in western asia and the saronikos gulf and elefsis bay in greece alygizakis et al 2016 chen et al 2015 he et al 2019 jia et al 2011 kafaei et al 2018 minh et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 2018 fig s2 on the other hand the concentrations of ff rtm ofx cfx nfx and tmp in the bay water of jzb were generally within the range reported by previous studies for victoria bay the beibu gulf bohai bay the bohai sea hailing bay liaodong bay laizhou bay the yellow sea and yantai bay in china chesapeake bay jamaica bay and new york harbor in the us gran canaria island in spain german estuaries the persian gulf the saronikos

kotke et al 2019 letsinger et al 2019 minh et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 2013 zhang et al 2018 zou et al 2011 fig s2 however the concentrations of cap tyl atm and sdz in the water of jzb were below the corresponding loq or lod and were generally similar to those reported in previous studies for victoria bay the beibu gulf the bohai sea hailing bay liaodong bay laizhou bay the yellow sea and yantai bay in china chesapeake bay in the us the persian gulf and the saronikos gulf and elefsis bay in greece alygizakis et al 2016 chen et al 2015 he et al 2019 jia et al 2011 kafaei et al 2018 minh et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 2013 zhang et al 2018 fig s2 studies have widely investigated etm in coastal waters whereby its concentration ranged from more than one thousand in victoria bay hong kong to less than the lod in chesapeake bay the saronikos gulf and elefsis bay alygizakis et al 2016 he et al 2019 fig s2 the etm concentration in the water of jzb was below its lod 0 52 ng l 1 which is of the same order of magnitude as that for yantai bay the bohai sea and the yellow sea the saronikos gulf elefsis bay german estuaries and chesapeake bay alygizakis et al 2016 he et al 2019 kotke et al 2019 however the etm concentration in jzb was usually three orders of magnitude lower than that reported for victoria bay hong kong two orders of magnitude lower than that found in bohai bay and hailing bay in china and one order of magnitude lower than that reported for the beibu gulf and laizhou bay in china and the persian gulf chen et al 2015 kafaei et al 2018 minh et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 2018 zou et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 determined the concentrations of etm atm rtm sdz and tmp in the water of jzb in april 2010 the authors found an etm concentration that was significantly higher than that in our study but the concentrations of the other four antibiotics were generally similar to those in our study a comparison of the antibiotic concentrations in this study with those reported for other regions fig 2s further indicated that amox and fluoroquinolones ofx efx cfx and nfx were major antibiotic contaminants in the water of jzb 3 2 temporal variation of the target antibiotics temporal differences in antibiotic concentrations and compositions have been observed in previous studies which were often attributed to changes in usage and local environmental conditions cui et al 2019 letsinger et al 2019 the total concentration of antibiotics in the water of jzb in the present study was 129 0 ng l 1 during the winter dry season which was significantly higher than that during the summer wet season 84 7 ng l 1 fig 3 s the higher concentrations of antibiotics during the winter were due to a high usage and the low degradation rates of antibiotics at this time versus their dilution by high rainfall runoff during the summer loftin et al 2008 shimizu et al 2013 yan et al 2013 during the summer the bio degradation and photo degradation of antibiotics in water are usually stronger in comparison to the winter due to a higher temperature and stronger sunlight during the summer loftin et al 2008 the dagu river on the northwest coast of jzb is the largest river terminating in jzb and has an annual runoff of 7 4 108 m3 which accounts for 80 of the total annual runoff into jzb cao et al 2020 in addition the dagu river is a seasonal river with approximately 90 of its total annual runoff occurring during the summer yuan et al 2016 the total concentration of antibiotics in the water of the dagu river estuary was approximately 3 7 times higher during the winter than during the summer fig 3 hence this could be the major reason for the temporal change in the total antibiotic concentrations in the water of jzb this type of temporal change in antibiotic concentrations has been generally observed in the coastal waters of china for example in the pearl river estuary li et al 2018 liang et al 2013 xu et al 2013 the yangtze river estuary yan et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 and qinzhou bay cui et al 2019 on the other hand the moshui river baisha river lichun river and haibo river on the east coast of jzb were strongly affected by municipal effluent discharges during our study thus the temporal change in the total concentrations of antibiotics was relatively small and not noticeable fig 3 the higher total antibiotic concentration during the winter was due to the higher concentrations of fluoroquinolones ofx efx cfx and nfx fig 4 we note that amox has been found to have the largest usage for both human and veterinary purposes in china zhang et al 2015 the amox concentration in the water of jzb was similar during the winter and summer and both were the highest concentrations of the 15 antibiotics assessed fig 4 the ff concentration was much higher during the summer in comparison to the winter while efx and smm concentrations during the summer were similar to those during the winter this suggests that these antibiotics were used in aquaculture in jzb during the summer which is the rapid growth season of aquatic animals but also the period of high disease incidence hence the higher use of feed incorporated with antibiotics can lead to the higher concentrations of these compounds in waterbodies during the summer on the other hand for the antibiotics that are mainly used for humans rtm ofx nfx and tmp their concentrations were much higher during the winter in comparison to the summer this agreed with the usage pattern of humans using more antibiotics to prevent and treat diseases during the winter papageorgiou et al 2016 of the 15 antibiotics assessed cfx is used for both animal and human purposes zhang et al 2015 a considerably higher concentrations during the winter than that during the summer might indicate that cfx was mainly used for humans in qingdao city the atm rtm sdz and tmp concentrations in the water of jzb were determined in a previous study in april 2010 zhang et al 2013 and were similar to those found in the present study fig 4 however the etm concentrations reported by zhang et al were significantly higher than those measured in this study 3 3 spatial distribution of the target antibiotics the spatial distributions of the total antibiotic concentration in the bay water are illustrated in fig s4 which shows that there was a generally smaller spatial variation during the summer in comparison to the winter however the overall spatial distribution patterns were similar to each other and were characterized by a higher total antibiotic concentration along the eastern coast during the summer high runoff from the dagu river increased water mixing in the bay thus the spatial variation of the total antibiotic concentration was smaller than that during the winter as mentioned the rivers on the eastern coast were strongly affected by effluent discharges hence the total antibiotic concentrations in the estuarine waters of these rivers were 3 7 to 11 7 times higher during the summer and 1 5 to 2 7 times higher during the winter than that for the dagu river estuary fig 3 several sewage treatment plants stps and hospitals are situated along the eastern coast of jzb fig 2 in addition several aquaculture farms are located on the northeastern coast of the bay the sewage treatment rate in qingdao city was 88 3 zhang et al 2015 and approximately 5 106 t of untreated wastewater were discharged into the bay via rivers or pipes qmsb 2018 therefore treated and untreated wastewater as well as the aquaculture industry could have led to the higher concentration of total antibiotics in the water along the eastern coast zhang et al 2013 investigated the spatial distribution of the total concentration of nine antibiotics tmp smx sdm sdz etm rtm azm and ctm in the water of jzb in april 2010 and found a decreasing trend from the northeast towards the southwest this spatial distribution pattern was generally similar to that observed in the present study although the antibiotic species differed the veterinary antibiotics used in the aquaculture industry are usually used more during the summer cheng et al 2020 whereas human antibiotics are generally used more during the winter papageorgiou et al 2016 accordingly the spatial distributions were further analyzed with respect to veterinary antibiotic concentrations during the summer and human antibiotic concentrations during the winter fig 5 it is known that rtm and tmp are used more for humans zhang et al 2015 while nfx and ofx are prohibited for use in animal food maprc 2015 therefore these four antibiotics should be mainly used in humans the sum of their concentrations during the winter was higher in the southeastern part of the bay fig 5 which was consistent with the distribution of the population density around jzb as veterinary antibiotics that are not for human use zhang et al 2005 ff efx and smm can be used for aquaculture and the sum of their concentrations during the summer was higher in the northeastern aquaculture area of the bay pgsp 2012 fig 5 3 4 ecological assessment chronic exposure to trace levels of pharmaceutical mixtures may cause potential risks to aquatic organisms and human health e g antibiotic resistance and endocrine disruptive conditions to assess the potential ecological risks through exposure to antibiotics in jzb rq values for different trophic levels of aquatic organisms were calculated the ecological risks of 11 target antibiotics were assessed due to a lack of acute and chronic toxicity data for atm lcm and smm and the absence of tyl in the samples in this study the calculated rqs of antibiotics for different trophic levels of aquatic organisms algae crustacean invertebrate mollusca and fish are provided in fig 6 and table s9 the risks posed by the 11 antibiotics to crustacean and fish were low as most rq values were 0 1 algae was found to be the most sensitive aquatic organism to all 11 antibiotics except tmp for which the sensitive organism was mollusca four antibiotics amox nfx ofx and tmp may pose high risks rq 1 to the most sensitive trophic level table s9 amox and nfx could present high risks to algae at all of the sampling sites fig 6 while ofx posed a high risk to algae in estuarine water and in 36 of the seawater samples a study undertaken in the mediterranean desbiolles et al 2018 demonstrated that amox in seawater represented a potentially high risk to non target organisms from the mediterranean ecosystem in 100 of samples furthermore the high risks of nfx and ofx in our study are consistent with previous investigations chen et al 2017 jiang et al 2014 xie et al 2019 xu et al 2013 these studies reported that ofx presented a high risk to algae in the pearl river delta mariculture areas in southeast china and the coastal waters around the liaodong peninsula etm is on the watch list of the european water policy eu 2015 in this study etm h2o was only detected in estuarine water samples and its rq value was 1 0 in lichun river and haibo river 1 92 and 1 39 respectively hence etm h2o could pose a high risk to algae in these two areas accordingly special attention should be given to amox nfx ofx tmp and etm h2o due to the potential risks they pose in contrast to the five antibiotics mentioned above the rq values of ff cfx and sdz for different trophic levels were 0 1 in all samples in which they were detected fig 6 and table s9 this indicates that these antibiotics might not cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms in the study area on the other hand efx and rtm could pose medium risks to algae table s9 the rq values of efx at all sites excluding one ranged from 0 1 to 1 while the rq values of rtm were 0 1 at two estuary sites and two bay sites fig 6 further cap might pose a medium risk to algae in the three estuaries that had higher total antibiotic concentrations moshui river licun river and haibo river estuaries risk quotients act as a normalized measurements of risk thus allowing a comparison to be made between different compounds with different toxicities and exposure levels and might provide a good starting point for the prioritization of the potential risks posed by antibiotics mijangos et al 2018 however the data regarding the toxicity of antibiotics and other emerging contaminants with respect to marine species are still very scarce biel maeso et al 2018 further consideration should also be given to the possible additive or synergic effects of pharmaceutical mixtures which is still underestimated chuang et al 2019 desbiolles et al 2018 liu et al 2020 moreover the risks posed by antibiotics to aquatic species are not only directly related to their toxicity but also to their possible bioaccumulation through the food web ruhí et al 2016 zenker et al 2014 this is another important factor for further investigation and to consider in environmental risk assessment related to antibiotics 4 conclusions this study investigated 15 target antibiotics belonging to the classes of ß lactams amphenicols macrolides fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides in the water of jzb and its estuaries our results showed that 14 antibiotics were detected in the estuarine water and 13 were detected in the bay water thus demonstrating the widespread occurrence of the target antibiotic residues except for tyl in jzb the total antibiotic concentration ranged from 71 8 ng l 1 to 840 ng l 1 for the estuarine water which was significantly higher than that for the bay water 38 7 181 ng l 1 the classes of the 13 antibiotics detected in the bay water were dominated by fluoroquinolones and β lactams which accounted for nearly 90 of the total antibiotic concentration in addition amox contamination was the most prominent issue with respect to antibiotic pollution in the bay water and accounted for 44 of the total antibiotic concentration the total antibiotic concentration in the bay water was significantly higher during the winter in comparison to the summer due to a high dilution by runoff during the summer however the ff concentration in the bay water was significantly higher during the summer in comparison to the winter which was probably due to its higher usage in the aquaculture industry during the summer spatially the total antibiotic concentration was higher in the water along the eastern coast of jzb during summer and winter in comparison to other regions however the sum of the veterinary antibiotic concentrations was higher in the northeastern aquaculture area of the bay during the summer a risk assessment revealed that amox and nfx may pose high risks rq 1 to algae in jzb the synergic effects of pharmaceutical mixtures and the bioaccumulation of antibiotics through the food web should be considered in future studies author contributions shuang lu and chunye lin conducted the research kai lei guided the laboratory analysis baodong wang ming

17701,the occurrence temporal variation and spatial variation of antibiotics in coastal bays and estuaries worldwide are not well documented or understood fifteen target antibiotics within the five classes of β lactams amphenicols macrolides fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides were measured during the summer and winter in the water of jiaozhou bay in china which is a semi enclosed urbanized bay fourteen antibiotics excluding tylosin were detected thus demonstrating the widespread occurrence of their residues in the bay the total antibiotic concentration ranged from 71 8 ng l 1 to 840 ng l 1 for the estuarine water which was significantly higher than that for the bay water 38 7 181 ng l 1 the antibiotic classes in the bay water were dominated by fluoroquinolones and β lactams which accounted for nearly 90 of the total antibiotic concentration in addition amoxicillin contamination was the most prominent among the 14 detected antibiotics as it accounted for 44 of the total antibiotic concentration the concentrations of amoxicillin leucomycin enrofloxacin and sulfamonomethoxine in the bay water were usually higher than those reported for coastal bays and estuaries worldwide the average total antibiotic concentration in the bay water was 84 7 ng l 1 during the summer which was significantly lower than that during the winter 129 0 ng l 1 this was mainly due to high dilution by runoff during the summer the florfenicol concentration in the bay water was significantly higher during the summer than in winter due to its higher usage in aquaculture during the summer spatially the total antibiotic concentration both summer and winter was higher in the water along the eastern coast of the bay where the population and hospital densities are high however the sum of the veterinary antibiotic concentrations was higher in the northeastern aquaculture area of the bay during the summer a risk assessment revealed that amoxicillin and enrofloxacin could pose high risks risk quotient of 1 to algae in the bay the synergic effects of pharmaceutical mixtures and the bioaccumulation of antibiotics through the food web should be considered in future studies

which leads to the continental scale pollution of estuaries and bays by antibiotics and antibiotic resistant genes martinez 2008 zhu et al 2017 estuaries bays and coastal seas are focal points of human settlement and marine resource use lotze et al 2006 antibiotics released into these coastal environments pose potential health risks to coastal ecosystems as well as humans therefore the occurrence and fate of antibiotics in estuaries bays and coastal seas has drawn great attention worldwide in recent years benotti and brownawell 2007 birch et al 2015 han et al 2020 kötke et al 2019 leng et al 2020 letsinger et al 2019 li et al 2018 mezzelani et al 2018 thomas and hilton 2004 yang et al 2020 various levels of antibiotic contamination in seawater have been documented for different regions of the world the concentrations and detection frequencies dfs of antibiotic in europe were generally lower than other regions fig 1 an early study in 2002 reported the concentrations of erythromycin etm sulfamethoxazole smx and trimethoprim tmp in the surface water of a uk estuary for the first time thomas and hilton 2004 from 2009 to 2011 a global monitoring study of antibiotics was conducted in the coastal environments of different marine systems nödler et al 2014 in their work five antibiotics were determined in 153 seawater samples collected from the shorelines of europe and usa the results showed that the overall dfs for clarithromycin ctm etm roxithromycin rtm smx and tmp were all below 30 nödler et al 2014 a recent study undertaken in 2015 and 2016 indicated that a group of eight antibiotics in german estuaries and coastal waters was dominated by the sulfonamide smx which accounted for nearly 80 of the total antibiotic concentrations while the maximum concentrations for other antibiotics were less than 10 ng l 1 kötke et al 2019 in chesapeake bay usa however the highest concentrations were recorded to be 94 1 ng l 1 17 8 ng l 1 14 8 ng l 1 and 9 7 ng l 1 for norfloxacin nfx enrofloxacin efx smx and ctm respectively n 14 he et al 2019 spatial and temporal occurrences of tmp were reported for uk estuaries by letsinger et al 2019 spatially the highest concentration was detected at wastewater discharge sites while temporally the highest and lowest concentrations were during the winter and summer respectively n 38 in general the occurrence temporal variation and spatial variation of antibiotics in coastal bays and estuaries worldwide are not well reported or understood antibiotics detected in the coastal seawater of china have usually been characterized by higher concentrations and dfs in comparison to other regions fig 1 a study regarding the coastal water of bohai bay in 2008 indicated that dfs were more than 50 for smx etm ofloxacin ofx and nfx zou et al 2011 in the coastal water of liaodong bay the detectable concentrations for widely used sulfonamides smx tmp sulfadiazine sdz and sulfamonomethoxine smm were 4 3 76 8 ng l 1 1 4 18 2 ng l 1 0 6 9 1 ng l 1 0 6 3 3 ng l 1 in 2009 respectively jia et al 2011 for the relatively closed laizhou bay ciprofloxacin cfx efx nfx tmp smx and etm were detected at all sampling sites with median concentrations of 2 4 ng l 1 to 60 ng l 1 zhang et al 2012 on the other hand the maximum concentrations in the off coastal water of the bohai sea and the yellow sea were 6 7 ng l 1 8 3 ng l 1 and 16 6 ng l 1 for etm smx and tmp respectively while their dfs were 100 98 and 73 zhang et al 2013 recently seven out of 13 target antibiotics were detected in the coastal waters of china lu et al 2018 the total antibiotic concentration ranged from 390 ng l 1 to 915 ng l 1 and was dominated by nfx rtm and cfx lu et al 2018 an intensive study conducted by yang et al 2020 indicated that the total concentration of pharmaceutical and personal care products including 24 antibiotics in chinese coastal waters ranged from 0 88 ng l 1 to 1194 ng l 1 and was relatively higher than that reported for korean coastal waters 9 91 442 ng l 1 therefore the widespread and continued contamination of antibiotics in the coastal waters of china are a matter of concern jiaozhou bay jzb is an urbanized semi enclosed bay located in qingdao which is a rapidly growing chinese city with intensive anthropogenic activities the occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of antibiotics in jzb are relatively unknown although r j zhang et al 2013 investigated 11 antibiotics categorized into macrolides and sulfonamides groups in jzb and the rivers that feed into it the authors found that the total concentrations of macrolides and sulfonamides ranged from 3 1 ng l 1 to 71 3 ng l 1 and 35 3 ng l 1 to 839 2 ng l 1 respectively and mainly consisting of smx tmp and etm further the concentrations of eight fluoroquinolones have been measured in the estuarine sediments of the dagu river and yang river which feed into jzb liu et al 2018 2020 the results of these studies revealed that the total concentration of fluoroquinolones ranged from 0 28 ng g 1 to 10 86 ng g 1 and that fluoroquinolones mainly originated from domestic hospital and aquaculture sewage discharges in addition ofx and oxolinic acid were also found to be predominant antibiotics in the sediment of these rivers liu et al 2018 2020 while these studies investigated macrolides sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones in jzb and the rivers feeding into it the occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of chemically diverse antibiotics in the bay water have not yet been reported accordingly the objectives of this study are to concurrently investigate the occurrence spatiotemporal change and ecological risks of widely used antibiotics in the water of jzb including five groups of antibiotics five macrolides four fluoroquinolones three sulfonamides two amphenicols and one β lactam this study represents the first attempt to simultaneously quantify a relatively large suite of antibiotics in the water of jzb at diverse locations during two seasons 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection as mentioned jzb 35 38 36 18 n 120 04 120 23 e is an urbanized semi enclosed bay

of effective methods for evaluating the risk of antibiotics to aquatic organisms peng et al 2019 the rqs were calculated using eqs 1 3 ec 2003 emea 2006 chen and zhou 2014 1 rq m e c pnec 2 pnec e c 50 or l c 50 af for acute toxicity 3 pnec noec or loec af for chronic toxicity where mec and pnec refer to the measured concentrations and predicted no effect concentrations respectively the pnec values were calculated by dividing the lowest acute or chronic toxicity level by an assessment factor af for acute toxicity levels the half maximal effect concentration ec50 or the median lethal concentration lc50 was used and the af was 1000 ma et al 2017 mijangos et al 2018 xie et al 2019 for chronic toxicity levels no observed effect concentrations noec or lowest observed effect concentrations loec were used and the applied af values were 100 50 or 10 depending on the available data ec 2003 higher concentration values obtained from the summer and winter sampling for each compound at each sampling site were used as the mec values which represent the worse case scenario in accordance with the technical guidance document on risk assessment for the european union ec 2003 in our past publication a substantial amount of acute or chronic toxicity data for the selected antibiotics for non target organisms from different trophic levels algae crustacean invertebrates mollusca and fish were acquired from the ecotox database of the united states environmental protection agency us epa and are shown in the supplementary material of lei et al 2019 risk levels were classified into high risk rq 1 medium risk 0 1 rq 1 and low risk rq 0 1 biel maeso et al 2018 ec 2003 hernando et al 2006 xu et al 2013 2 6 statistical analyses the statistical analyses were performed using sas jmp statistical version 13 3 0 pro tukey s honest significant difference tests were used to examine the statistical significance at a significant level of 0 05 α 0 05 in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of the target antibiotics and comparison with other regions the dfs and concentrations of the target antibiotics were usually higher in estuarine water than in bay water table 1 the results showed that 14 out of the 15 target antibiotics except tyl were detected in the estuarine water samples while 13 antibiotics except etm h2o and tyl were detected in the seawater samples the results showed that efx nfx smm and amox were detected at all sites while ofx was detected at all estuarine sites in general the dfs of fluoroquinolones were higher than those of macrolides sulfonamides and amphenicols these results demonstrate the widespread occurrence of the target antibiotic residues excluding tyl in the bay and suggest the need for enhancing the removal of these antibiotics during municipal wastewater treatment animal husbandry waste management and aquaculture waste management within the jzb watershed all of the raw data are available in tables s7 and s8 the total target antibiotic concentrations ranged from 71 7 ng l 1 to 839 9 ng l 1 in the estuarine water which was significantly higher than those in the bay water 38 7 ng l 1 to 180 7 ng l 1 the higher dfs and concentrations of the target antibiotics in the estuarine water suggest the importance of riverine inputs as a source of antibiotics to jzb previous studies also demonstrated that riverine inputs of antibiotics are generally their major source in estuaries and bays liang et al 2013 shi et al 2014 yan et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 zheng et al 2011 zou et al 2011 in the estuarine water samples the total concentrations of amphenicols macrolides fluoroquinolones sulfonamides and ß lactam were 2 0 67 8 ng l 1 not detected nd to 81 1 ng l 1 28 2 436 7 ng l 1 1 7 119 8 ng l 1 and 34 6 786 4 ng l 1 respectively with averages of 20 1 ng l 1 24 0 ng l 1 188 5 ng l 1 22 7 ng l 1 and 173 8 ng l 1 respectively in the bay water these were nd to 25 7 ng l 1 nd to 32 2 ng l 1 15 9 94 8 ng l 1 1 2 14 7 ng l 1 and 7 8 90 9 ng l 1 respectively with averages of 5 2 ng l 1 4 2 ng l 1 49 2 ng l 1 3 8 ng l 1 and 47 6 ng l 1 respectively these results reveal that the groups of 13 antibiotics in the bay water were dominated by the classes of fluoroquinolones and β lactams which accounted for nearly 90 of the total antibiotic concentrations in addition amox contamination was the most prominent issue with respect to antibiotic pollution in the bay water and accounted for 44 of the total antibiotic concentrations the concentrations of amox lcm efx and smm in the water of jzb were usually higher than those reported for victoria bay hong kong the beibu gulf hailing bay laizhou bay and liaodong bay in china chesapeake bay in the us the persian gulf in western asia and the saronikos gulf and elefsis bay in greece alygizakis et al 2016 chen et al 2015 he et al 2019 jia et al 2011 kafaei et al 2018 minh et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 2018 fig s2 on the other hand the concentrations of ff rtm ofx cfx nfx and tmp in the bay water of jzb were generally within the range reported by previous studies for victoria bay the beibu gulf bohai bay the bohai sea hailing bay liaodong bay laizhou bay the yellow sea and yantai bay in china chesapeake bay jamaica bay and new york harbor in the us gran canaria island in spain german estuaries the persian gulf the saronikos gulf and elefsis bay in greece and uk estuaries afonso olivares et al 2013 alygizakis et al 2016 benotti et al 2007 cantwell et al 2018 chen et al 2015 he et al 2019 jia et al 2011 kafaei et al 2018 kotke et al 2019 letsinger et al 2019 minh et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 2013 zhang et al 2018 zou et al 2011 fig s2 however the concentrations of cap tyl atm and sdz in the water of jzb were below the corresponding loq or lod and were generally similar to those reported in previous studies for victoria bay the beibu gulf the bohai sea hailing bay liaodong bay laizhou bay the yellow sea and yantai bay in china chesapeake bay in the us the persian gulf and the saronikos gulf and elefsis bay in greece alygizakis et al 2016 chen et al 2015 he et al 2019 jia et al 2011 kafaei et al 2018 minh et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 2013 zhang et al 2018 fig s2 studies have widely investigated etm in coastal waters whereby its concentration ranged from more than one thousand in victoria bay hong kong to less than the lod in chesapeake bay the saronikos gulf and elefsis bay alygizakis et al 2016 he et al 2019 fig s2 the etm concentration in the water of jzb was below its lod 0 52 ng l 1 which is of the same order of magnitude as that for yantai bay the bohai sea and the yellow sea the saronikos gulf elefsis bay german estuaries and chesapeake bay alygizakis et al 2016 he et al 2019 kotke et al 2019 however the etm concentration in jzb was usually three orders of magnitude lower than that reported for victoria bay hong kong two orders of magnitude lower than that found in bohai bay and hailing bay in china and one order of magnitude lower than that reported for the beibu gulf and laizhou bay in china and the persian gulf chen et al 2015 kafaei et al 2018 minh et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 2018 zou et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 determined the concentrations of etm atm rtm sdz and tmp in the water of jzb in april 2010 the authors found an etm concentration that was significantly higher than that in our study but the concentrations of the other four antibiotics were generally similar to those in our study a comparison of the antibiotic concentrations in this study with those reported for other regions fig 2s further indicated that amox and fluoroquinolones ofx efx cfx and nfx were major antibiotic contaminants in the water of jzb 3 2 temporal variation of the target antibiotics temporal differences in antibiotic concentrations and compositions have been observed in previous studies which were often attributed to changes in usage and local environmental conditions cui et al 2019 letsinger et al 2019 the total concentration of antibiotics in the water of jzb in the present study was 129 0 ng l 1 during the winter dry season which was significantly higher than that during the summer wet season 84 7 ng l 1 fig 3 s the higher concentrations of antibiotics during the winter were due to a high usage and the low degradation rates of antibiotics at this time versus their dilution by high rainfall runoff during the summer loftin et al 2008 shimizu et al 2013 yan et al 2013 during the summer the bio degradation and photo degradation of antibiotics in water are usually stronger in comparison to the winter due to a higher temperature and stronger sunlight during the summer loftin et al 2008 the dagu river on the northwest coast of jzb is the largest river terminating in jzb and has an annual runoff of 7 4 108 m3 which accounts for 80 of the total annual runoff into jzb cao et al 2020 in addition the dagu river is a seasonal river with approximately 90 of its total annual runoff occurring during the summer yuan et al 2016 the total concentration of antibiotics in the water of the dagu river estuary was approximately 3 7 times higher during the winter than during the summer fig 3 hence this could be the major reason for the temporal change in the total antibiotic concentrations in the water of jzb this type of temporal change in antibiotic concentrations has been generally observed in the coastal waters of china for example in the pearl river estuary li et al 2018 liang et al 2013 xu et al 2013 the yangtze river estuary yan et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 and qinzhou bay cui et al 2019 on the other hand the moshui river baisha river lichun river and haibo river on the east coast of jzb were strongly affected by municipal effluent discharges during our study thus the temporal change in the total concentrations of antibiotics was relatively small and not noticeable fig 3 the higher total antibiotic concentration during the winter was due to the higher concentrations of fluoroquinolones ofx efx cfx and nfx fig 4 we note that amox has been found to have the largest usage for both human and veterinary purposes in china zhang et al 2015 the amox concentration in the water of jzb was similar during the winter and summer and both were the highest concentrations of the 15 antibiotics assessed fig 4 the ff concentration was much higher during the summer in comparison to the winter while efx and smm concentrations during the summer were similar to those during the winter this suggests that these antibiotics were used in aquaculture in jzb during the summer which is the rapid growth season of aquatic animals but also the period of high disease incidence hence the higher use of feed incorporated with antibiotics can lead to the higher concentrations of these compounds in waterbodies during the summer on the other hand for the antibiotics that are mainly used for humans rtm ofx nfx and tmp their concentrations were much higher during the winter in comparison to the summer this agreed with the usage pattern of humans using more antibiotics to prevent and treat diseases during the winter papageorgiou et al 2016 of the 15 antibiotics assessed cfx is used for both animal and human purposes zhang et al 2015 a considerably higher concentrations during the winter than that during the summer might indicate that cfx was mainly used for humans in qingdao city the atm rtm sdz and tmp concentrations in the water of jzb were determined in a previous study in april 2010 zhang et al 2013 and were similar to those found in the present study fig 4 however the etm concentrations reported by zhang et al were significantly higher than those measured in this study 3 3 spatial distribution of the target antibiotics the spatial distributions of the total antibiotic concentration in the bay water are illustrated in fig s4 which shows that there was a generally smaller spatial variation during the summer in comparison to the winter however the overall spatial distribution patterns were similar to each other and were characterized by a higher total antibiotic concentration along the eastern coast during the summer high runoff from the dagu river increased water mixing in the bay thus the spatial variation of the total antibiotic concentration was smaller than that during the winter as mentioned the rivers on the eastern coast were strongly affected by effluent discharges hence the total antibiotic concentrations in the estuarine waters of these rivers were 3 7 to 11 7 times higher during the summer and 1 5 to 2 7 times higher during the winter than that for the dagu river estuary fig 3 several sewage treatment plants stps and hospitals are situated along the eastern coast of jzb fig 2 in addition several aquaculture farms are located on the northeastern coast of the bay the sewage treatment rate in qingdao city was 88 3 zhang et al 2015 and approximately 5 106 t of untreated wastewater were discharged into the bay via rivers or pipes qmsb 2018 therefore treated and untreated wastewater as well as the aquaculture industry could have led to the higher concentration of total antibiotics in the water along the eastern coast zhang et al 2013 investigated the spatial distribution of the total concentration of nine antibiotics tmp smx sdm sdz etm rtm azm and ctm in the water of jzb in april 2010 and found a decreasing trend from the northeast towards the southwest this spatial distribution pattern was generally similar to that observed in the present study although the antibiotic species differed the veterinary antibiotics used in the aquaculture industry are usually used more during the summer cheng et al 2020 whereas human antibiotics are generally used more during the winter papageorgiou et al 2016 accordingly the spatial distributions were further analyzed with respect to veterinary antibiotic concentrations during the summer and human antibiotic concentrations during the winter fig 5 it is known that rtm and tmp are used more for humans zhang et al 2015 while nfx and ofx are prohibited for use in animal food maprc 2015 therefore these four antibiotics should be mainly used in humans the sum of their concentrations during the winter was higher in the southeastern part of the bay fig 5 which was consistent with the distribution of the population density around jzb as veterinary antibiotics that are not for human use zhang et al 2005 ff efx and smm can be used for aquaculture and the sum of their concentrations during the summer was higher in the northeastern aquaculture area of the bay pgsp 2012 fig 5 3 4 ecological assessment chronic exposure to trace levels of pharmaceutical mixtures may cause potential risks to aquatic organisms and human health e g antibiotic resistance and endocrine disruptive conditions to assess the potential ecological risks through exposure to antibiotics in jzb rq values for different trophic levels of aquatic organisms were calculated the ecological risks of 11 target antibiotics were assessed due to a lack of acute and chronic toxicity data for atm lcm and smm and the absence of tyl in the samples in this study the calculated rqs of antibiotics for different trophic levels of aquatic organisms algae crustacean invertebrate mollusca and fish are provided in fig 6 and table s9 the risks posed by the 11 antibiotics to crustacean and fish were low as most rq values were 0 1 algae was found to be the most sensitive aquatic organism to all 11 antibiotics except tmp for which the sensitive organism was mollusca four antibiotics amox nfx ofx and tmp may pose high risks rq 1 to the most sensitive trophic level table s9 amox and nfx could present high risks to algae at all of the sampling sites fig 6 while ofx posed a high risk to algae in estuarine water and in 36 of the seawater samples a study undertaken in the mediterranean desbiolles et al 2018 demonstrated that amox in seawater represented a potentially high risk to non target organisms from the mediterranean ecosystem in 100 of samples furthermore the high risks of nfx and ofx in our study are consistent with previous investigations chen et al 2017 jiang et al 2014 xie et al 2019 xu et al 2013 these studies reported that ofx presented a high risk to algae in the pearl river delta mariculture areas in southeast china and the coastal waters around the liaodong peninsula etm is on the watch list of the european water policy eu 2015 in this study etm h2o was only detected in estuarine water samples and its rq value was 1 0 in lichun river and haibo river 1 92 and 1 39 respectively hence etm h2o could pose a high risk to algae in these two areas accordingly special attention should be given to amox nfx ofx tmp and etm h2o due to the potential risks they pose in contrast to the five antibiotics mentioned above the rq values of ff cfx and sdz for different trophic levels were 0 1 in all samples in which they were detected fig 6 and table s9 this indicates that these antibiotics might not cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms in the study area on the other hand efx and rtm could pose medium risks to algae table s9 the rq values of efx at all sites excluding one ranged from 0 1 to 1 while the rq values of rtm were 0 1 at two estuary sites and two bay sites fig 6 further cap might pose a medium risk to algae in the three estuaries that had higher total antibiotic concentrations moshui river licun river and haibo river estuaries risk quotients act as a normalized measurements of risk thus allowing a comparison to be made between different compounds with different toxicities and exposure levels and might provide a good starting point for the prioritization of the potential risks posed by antibiotics mijangos et al 2018 however the data regarding the toxicity of antibiotics and other emerging contaminants with respect to marine species are still very scarce biel maeso et al 2018 further consideration should also be given to the possible additive or synergic effects of pharmaceutical mixtures which is still underestimated chuang et al 2019 desbiolles et al 2018 liu et al 2020 moreover the risks posed by antibiotics to aquatic species are not only directly related to their toxicity but also to their possible bioaccumulation through the food web ruhí et al 2016 zenker et al 2014 this is another important factor for further investigation and to consider in environmental risk assessment related to antibiotics 4 conclusions this study investigated 15 target antibiotics belonging to the classes of ß lactams amphenicols macrolides fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides in the water of jzb and its estuaries our results showed that 14 antibiotics were detected in the estuarine water and 13 were detected in the bay water thus demonstrating the widespread occurrence of the target antibiotic residues except for tyl in jzb the total antibiotic concentration ranged from 71 8 ng l 1 to 840 ng l 1 for the estuarine water which was significantly higher than that for the bay water 38 7 181 ng l 1 the classes of the 13 antibiotics detected in the bay water were dominated by fluoroquinolones and β lactams which accounted for nearly 90 of the total antibiotic concentration in addition amox contamination was the most prominent issue with respect to antibiotic pollution in the bay water and accounted for 44 of the total antibiotic concentration the total antibiotic concentration in the bay water was significantly higher during the winter in comparison to the summer due to a high dilution by runoff during the summer however the ff concentration in the bay water was significantly higher during the summer in comparison to the winter which was probably due to its higher usage in the aquaculture industry during the summer spatially the total antibiotic concentration was higher in the water along the eastern coast of jzb during summer and winter in comparison to other regions however the sum of the veterinary antibiotic concentrations was higher in the northeastern aquaculture area of the bay during the summer a risk assessment revealed that amox and nfx may pose high risks rq 1 to algae in jzb the synergic effects of pharmaceutical mixtures and the bioaccumulation of

17702,rapid biomolecular observation in model indicator organisms has been considered as a potential predictor of water pollution from chronic and trace toxicants this study evaluated the use of daphnia magna metabolomic measurements as indicators for exposure to reproductive endocrine disruptors by using the model juvenile hormone analogue fenoxycarb because d magna reproduction controls metabolic regulation the reproduction stage was also carefully considered in metabolic observations and data analysis to examine differences comparisons of metabolite abundance regulation between 1 and 12 days of fenoxycarb exposure were performed to investigate the predictability of the sub chronic 12 days adverse impacts on reproduction and metabolic regulation based on acute 1 day metabolic observations anova simultaneous component analysis asca detected reversed patterns in direction of time course metabolite abundance regulation with fenoxycarb exposure for example decreases in the abundances of leucine asparagine methionine and isoleucine which then changed to increases were observed with time during fenoxycarb exposures the reversed regulation pattern was observed at the last reproduction stage stage 3 exclusively pearson correlation analysis showed that correlations of pairwise metabolites were disrupted with fenoxycarb exposure similar to asca data normalization based on the reproduction stage improved the detectability of significant correlations the disruption on ambient metabolite regulation patterns and pairwise metabolite correlations was consistently observed with both 1 and 12 days of fenoxycarb exposures for sets of select metabolites the observed regulatory disruptions to these specific metabolites suggest altered oogenesis as the affected metabolites and the specific reproduction stage are related to successful oogenesis this study demonstrates that d magna metabolic dysregulation is a predictor of water contamination by endocrine disrupting compounds the high predictability of sub chronic 12 days endocrine disruption was confirmed based on acute 1 day metabolic observations furthermore integration of the reproduction cycle information in d magna metabolomics was validated by observing a reproduction stage specific dysregulation in metabolite abundance regulation which was not observable from the broader data analysis consequently this study confirms the potential for establishing a quantitative relationship between water quality and indicator species metabolic observations additionally it was found that constraining variables relevant to toxicity mechanisms of interest such as the reproduction stage is a key consideration for extraction of ecologically meaningful information in environmental metabolomics graphical abstract image 1 keywords environmental metabolomics reproductive cycle fenoxycarb 1 introduction reproduction is an ecologically critical biological function of aquatic organisms because the inhibition of reproduction differentiates population dynamics of the organism and its preys and predators kidd et al 2014 detection of reproduction impairment due to aquatic pollutant exposure typically requires at least a full sexual maturation period or reproduction cycle which is 2 3 days in traditional chemical risk assessment bioassays barata et al 1999 2004 2007 barata and baird 2000 dzialowski et al 2006 otherwise the concept of adverse outcome pathways aop suggests that chronic reproduction toxicity is predictable based on early biomolecular observations allen et al 2014 in the aop framework molecular initiating events mies represent the initial key stimulations of toxicant exposure to receiving organisms such as binding to specific molecular receptors doering et al 2016 mies subsequently lead to downstream molecular events that consequently result in adverse outcomes to targeted organs allen et al 2014 therefore matching the molecular responses occurring after the mies with chronic reproduction toxicity enables the discover of biomolecular indicators for reproductive endocrine disruption metabolites are under tight regulation within living organisms and the regulation changes in abundance and connectivity reflect phenotypical and biomolecular changes carrari et al 2006 eckel mahan et al 2012 smilowitz et al 2013 furthermore metabolic changes reflect shifts in environmental conditions making the metabolic measurement indicators highly sensitive to surrounding environmental changes taylor et al 2018 thus metabolic profiles potentially link and predict upstream mies and downstream physiological changes within the aop concept with high sensitivity in response to pollutant exposures taylor et al 2016 wagner et al 2019 by using daphnia magna one of the most frequently used model organisms in aquatic pollutant exposure bownik 2017 a recent study evidenced the rapid and sensitive contrast ability at hourly scales between standard and sub standard water qualities jeong and simpson 2019a potential of whole metabolome based prediction for chronic reproduction inhibition in d magna has been proposed by relating the magnitudes of offspring reduction and metabolomic variance in chronic toxicant exposures taylor et al 2016 2018 however consistent observation of identical metabolic dysregulation on individual metabolite abundances has not been reported among studies from acute and chronic exposures to the reproduction impairing toxicants taylor et al 2016 2018 constraining biological and environmental variables in exposure studies using living organisms is critical for interpreting the observed responses to specific toxicants weber 1991 a recent d magna study established the important factors including different stages of the reproduction cycle and the resulting contribution to metabolic variation jeong and simpson 2019b the finding supports a d magna transcriptomic study that showed a reproduction stage dependency of molecular regulation campos et al 2018 it was suggested that the reproduction cycle should be considered in exposure study designs which will facilitate higher contrast capability by minimizing the metabolic variation jeong and simpson 2019b the reproduction cycle repeats for the entire lifespan in d magna ebert 2005 and accounting for the differential reproduction stage is critical for d magna metabolomic studies especially when investigating the toxicity of endocrine disruptors which target reproduction processes dang et al 2012 kang et al 2014 it has been reported that hormone activity varied across reproduction stage martin creuzburg et al 2007 which further supports the importance of the reproduction cycle as hormones are targets of endocrine disruptors to the best of our knowledge no d magna comparative metabolomics study has investigated responses with exposure to endocrine disruptors and accounted for differential reproduction stages in these observations and data analysis this study aims to determine the validity of d magna metabolomic observations in predicting endocrine disruptor exposure within the context of metabolic variance from the reproduction cycle fenoxycarb a carbamate insecticide is a model endocrine disruptor and results in reproduction inhibition in non targeted aquatic invertebrates including daphnia tatarazako et al 2003 the observed environmental concentrations of fenoxycarb ranges from 25 to 700 ng l charizopoulos and papadopoulou mourkidou 1999 kim et al 2017 spycher et al 2018 and is within the concentration range whereof the reported effective concentrations to daphnia 10 1000 ng l tatarazako et al 2003 fenoxycarb mimics juvenile hormones in d magna gourmelon and ahtiainen 2007 and juvenile hormones are associated with regulation of multiple biological molecules and related functions miyakawa et al 2018 therefore we used fenoxycarb as the model endocrine disruptor for exposure experiments and hypothesized that endocrine disruption caused by fenoxycarb influences the regulation of individual metabolites in d magna to investigate whether the reproduction cycle and time dependent metabolic variance factor into the study design improves observations and statistical outcome reproduction stages were scaled and time course abundances of 51 individual metabolites were quantified these measured metabolites included amino acids nucleotides neurotransmitters and carbohydrates and were chosen based on published quantification methods jeong and simpson 2019b zhou and yin 2016 a previous study which measured 51 metabolites revealed that metabolic regulation differed with reproduction stages jeong and simpson 2019b in this study acute and sub chronic exposures for 1 and 12 days were performed and metabolic profiles of the exposed daphnids were monitored with inclusion of reproduction stage scaling to determine the predictability of the 12 days effects from the 1 day metabolic responses offspring production assays were performed before the metabolic profiling experiments to select a range of effective fenoxycarb concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 daphnia magna culturing d magna used in the present study was purchased from ward science and have been cultured consistently based on environmental canada and united states environmental protection agency guidelines environment canada 2002 weber 1991 population density was controlled at 35 daphnids per litre of culture media before the neonates were transferred to individual containers for exposure experiments the culture media was prepared by adding caso4 mgso4 kcl nahco3 vitamin b12 and selenium into deionized water 120 mg l of caso4 192 mg l of nahco3 120 mg l of mgso4 8 0 mg l of kcl 2 μg l of vitamin b12 and 2 μg l of selenium environment canada 2002 weber 1991 temperature was maintained at 22 1 5 c and light dark period was controlled at a ratio of 16 8 h chlorella vulgaris was fed daily as a nutrient source and the feeding and media renewal were performed daily and bi daily respectively 2 2 fenoxycarb exposures for reproduction impairment measurement and metabolic profiling fenoxycarb 98 0 was purchased from sigma aldrich canada and used to prepare the fenoxycarb stock solutions for exposure experiments for the exposures to observe fenoxycarb concentration dependent changes in offspring production 12 days of exposure was performed using neonate daphnids less than 24 h old with a control and 5 nominal concentrations of fenoxycarb of 3 125 12 5 50 200 and 800 ng l the exposures and control were replicated eight times the working stock and exposure solutions of fenoxycarb were prepared by dissolving fenoxycarb powder into d magna culture media ethanol 99 9 commercial alcohols inc was used as a solvent to fully dissolve fenoxycarb into stock solutions and the final ethanol concentration in the 12 days exposure for reproduction impairment measurement was matched at 0 00004 v v which is far lower than no observed effect concentrations cowgill and milazzo 1991 fenoxycarb at a concentration of 50 ng l was used in 1 and 12 day exposure experiments for the d magna metabolic profiling 50 ng l fenoxycarb was chosen based on the range of concentrations resulting in offspring number reduction from a separate 12 day exposure test the exposure experiment for metabolic profiling consisted of acute 1 day and sub chronic 12 days fenoxycarb exposures with one pure media control fenoxycarb stock solution was prepared by dissolving fenoxycarb powder into ethanol and the stock solution was diluted with culture media final ethanol concentrations in fenoxycarb exposure solutions and a control solution was maintained at 0 000005 v v for metabolic profiling exposures in the exposures for metabolite profiling nominal concentration of 50 fenoxycarb ng l the stability of dissolved fenoxycarb in the culture media solutions was measured continuously the reason for using stock solution in the fenoxycarb stability measurement was that the use of actual exposure solution had limitations in fenoxycarb quantification and extraction with the low concentration of fenoxycarb and the small solution volume per exposure fenoxycarb concentration dissolved in the stock solutions which was 1000 times diluted for the final exposure solution generation was quantified in exposure condition by using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms during the 12 days exposure period details are provided in the supplementary information measured fenoxycarb concentrations ranged from 45 472 to 55 628 μg l which confirmed the high stability of dissolved fenoxycarb in d magna media and with exposure conditions table s1 for the metabolic exposure experiments individual neonate d magna less than 24 h old were randomly collected from the culture and transferred into 30 ml vials for the sub chronic exposure the individual neonates transferred were maintained in the containers with fenoxycarb solution for 12 days for the acute exposure individual neonate daphnids were maintained in the containers with pure media solution for 11 days and subsequently with fenoxycarb solution for 1 day controls were maintained alongside the fenoxycarb exposures under the same conditions for 12 days fenoxycarb exposure periods were selected using adult d magna to measure rapid metabolic response 1 day exposure and using neonates to simulate chronic exposure 12 days united states environmental protection agency 2002 during the exposure period feeding and media replacement was performed daily and bi daily respectively d magna were fed at 9 30 daily during the duration of the experiment after 12 days the daphnids were sampled on the same day at four time points 11 00 13 00 15 00 and 17 00 time deviation of each sampling time point was 30 min and each sampling from an individual exposure was replicated twelve times fig 1 at each sampling reproduction stages were defined based on 4 stages fig 1 giardini et al 2015 jeong and simpson 2019b full details of reproduction stage classification are provided in the supplementary information fig s1 each sampled daphnid was then transferred into a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and rinsed with deionized water the water was carefully removed by using a glass pasteur pipette and liquid nitrogen was used to flash freeze the daphnids the frozen samples were stored at 20 c until metabolite extraction daphnia samples were randomized for the entire process of exposure and sampling 2 3 metabolite extraction and quantification from individual daphnia magna metabolite extraction and quantification were based on established methods jeong and simpson 2019b wu et al 2008 the purity of all solvents and reagents used including methanol acetonitrile chloroform and formic acid was spectroscopic grade or higher fisher scientific canada standard compounds used for metabolite quantification are listed in table s2 the purity of the standards was 98 table s2 and the standards were purchased from fischer scientific canada sigma aldrich canada alfa aesar bdh chemicals bioshop canada inc tci america emd millipore acros organics and cambridge isotope laboratories inc a mixture of internal standards table s2 was spiked into a microtube containing the frozen daphnid sample before the extraction a 160 μl mixture of 10 9 methanol and water was added into each 1 5 ml microtubes containing a frozen daphnid and homogenized subsequently 600 μl of the 10 9 methanol and water mixture was added and the microtube was sonicated for 5 min then 400 μl chloroform was added to the mixture and the microtube was vigorously mixed for 1 min the methanol and water were then separated from chloroform by centrifugation 4 c 5 min 12 500 rpm and the extraction cycle was repeated 3 times at the end of third extraction cycle 200 μl of the supernatant was filtered through a syringeless filter having 0 2 μm pore size mini prep whatman for lc ms ms analysis the entire extraction process was conducted on ice to maximize sample integrity sample labels and order were randomized for the entire extraction procedure including the sample loading for injection 10 μl for lc ms ms analysis metabolite analysis and quantification was performed using an agilent technologies 1260 lc connected to a 6420a triple quadrupole ms an ultra aq c18 column 3 μm x 100 mm 4 6 mm restek was employed for metabolite separation water and acetonitrile with 0 1 formic acid for both were used as mobile phases the gradient program of the binary mobile phase composition was 5 40 60 80 80 and 5 of acetonitrile at 0 3 75 4 5 6 75 7 25 and 8 5 min respectively electrospray ionization was used in polarity switching mode with application of dynamic multiple reaction monitoring for precursor and fragment ions detection the parameters of lc ms ms for metabolite quantification were as follows gas temperature 300 c gas flow 6 l min nebulizer pressure 15 psi and capillary voltage of 4000 v a 5 min equilibrium time was applied between each sample run a blank sample of water and methanol mixture was run every 10 samples and column cleaning samples were also run every 20 samples calibration curves for quantification of individual metabolite were generated using agilent mass hunter b 08 00 calibration curves were generated using more than 5 consecutive concentration points r2 of the calibrations were consistently 0 990 and with most above 0 995 standard metabolite mixtures at a low and high level of calibration curve were analyzed in triplicates for quality control accuracy 79 5 121 8 and precision 23 1 relative standard deviation were calculated and the full values are listed in table s3 extraction recovery rates were measured for all metabolites by extracting a set of samples n 4 where known standard concentrations were added before the extraction table s3 a signal to noise ratio of 10 was set as the minimum threshold for quantification peak intensity integration and concentration calculation with calibration curves generation were performed using the agilent mass hunter quantitative analysis program version b 08 00 2 4 data analysis the data set of measured absolute metabolite concentrations was deoutliered q1 and q3 1 5 interquartile range and inputted into metaboanalystr for further data processing and statistics chong and xia 2018 team 2015 deoutliered data was replaced with median and the data was normalized by dividing an individual metabolite concentration by the sum of all the metabolites per daphnid the normalized metabolite abundance data was rescaled using the auto scaling method of the metaboanalystr package chong and xia 2018 in the statistical analysis modules of metaboanalystr two way analysis of variance anova was performed to assess influence of fenoxycarb exposures on time dependent metabolite abundance false discovery rate adjusted p value fdr was calculated and used to evaluate statistical significance fdr 0 05 anova simultaneous component analysis asca and pearson correlation analysis were performed for analyses of time pattern and pairwise correlation in metabolic abundance regulation respectively reproduction stage 0 was not included in any statistics to avoid bias due to the low number of sampled daphnids at the stage 0 7 64 of all sampled daphnids each statistical analysis was performed for data both reorganized and unorganized based on the recorded reproduction stages to evaluate the influence of reproduction stage on statistical output 3 results 3 1 offspring production of daphnia magna exposed to different fenoxycarb concentrations over 12 days the impact of fenoxycarb at multiple concentrations on d magna reproduction was compared by summing the number of neonates produced at each exposure concentration over 12 days fig 2 the 12 days of fenoxycarb exposure resulted in 11 36 86 100 and 100 decreased neonate reproduction compared to the control at exposure concentrations of 3 125 12 5 50 200 and 800 ng l respectively fig 2 3 2 time dependent regulation of metabolite abundances in daphnia magna exposed to 50 ng l fenoxycarb solutions for 1 and 12 days two way anova revealed that metabolite abundance was not significantly differentiated by fenoxycarb exposure or the interaction of fenoxycarb exposure and sampling time regardless of data reorganization according to reproduction stage fdr 0 05 in contrast time pattern analysis for metabolite abundance variation showed distinguishable trends between the fenoxycarb exposures and control daphnia metabolite profiles asca was performed to investigate major time patterns of the metabolite variation between different fenoxycarb exposures fig 3 and revealed that the patterns of time course metabolite abundance change are dependent on reproduction stages fig 3a fig 3b shows with the results of the permutation test a validation test for the asca models that the asca model in the stage 3 is only valid n 1000 p value 0 05 among all of the asca models fitted in different reproduction stages fig 3b based on the asca scores of the component 1 in reproduction stage 3 fig 3a explaining 45 99 of data variation it is found that 1 and 12 days fenoxycarb exposures reverse the major time patterns detected by asca in the time dependent regulation of metabolite abundances at almost same magnitude fig 4 a metabolites that are well modelled by the observed major trends component 1 at reproduction stage 3 fig 3 were selected by using asca and the time dependent abundance change of the selected metabolites were analyzed to determine how much the observed major trends fig 3a explain specific metabolite regulation fig 4 the well modelled metabolites were defined based on the leverage threshold 0 8 and squared prediction error threshold 0 05 using metaboanalystr the selected metabolites in fig 4 show apparent inverse of abundance regulation pattern metabolite abundance decreased for leucine asparagine methionine and isoleucine across time in control in contrast the metabolites increased across time in fenoxycarb concentrations putrescine and trimethylenediamine showed increasing abundance in control oppositely the metabolites showed decreasing abundance with fenoxycarb exposure the full suite of metabolites with recognizable opposite time patterns between fenoxycarb exposures and a control but with leverage threshold lower than 0 8 are displayed in fig s2 3 3 impact of fenoxycarb exposure on pairwise correlation networks of metabolite regulation in daphnia magna pairwise correlation of metabolites during reproduction stage 3 was further analyzed between different fenoxycarb exposures and the control fig 5 the correlation network weakened with fenoxycarb exposures fig 5a and b compared to the control fig 5c as graphically observed with the whitened colour of network maps with fenoxycarb exposures based on the p values of pearson correlation analysis the numbers of significantly correlated metabolites p value 0 05 were confirmed 694 in control and decreased to 532 and 466 for 1 and 12 days of exposure respectively as such fenoxycarb disrupts metabolite correlations and the sub chronic 12 day exposure resulted in a higher number of correlation disruptions among all the correlations changed by fenoxycarb exposure consistently disrupted correlations from strong to weak were filtered and listed in table 1 the level of correlation was defined by absolute correlation coefficients weak and strong correlations were respectively defined correlations with absolute correlation coefficients smaller and higher than 0 4 and 0 6 the consistently disrupted correlation was defined by a correlation weakened by both 1 and 12 days fenoxycarb exposures as a result 20 consistently disrupted strong correlations were identified through the selection process as listed in table 1 4 discussion 4 1 metabolite abundance by fenoxycarb exposure at the reproduction disrupting concentration offspring reduction after fenoxycarb exposures at a range of ng l concentrations was observed to decrease to 11 at 3 125 ng l in this study fig 2 and the observed effective concentration range is comparable to the level from a previous study that reported the no observed effect concentration on reproduction at 1 6 ng l hosmer et al 1998 the fenoxycarb at 50 ng l chosen for metabolic profiling resulted in severe inhibition of offspring reproduction 86 after 12 days of exposure unexpectedly the 1 and 12 days exposures affected no metabolite abundances according to the two way anova results regardless of data reorganization based on reproduction stage a previous study reported differential gene expression profiles for d magna with fenoxycarb exposure at 500 ng l toyota et al 2014 and the influence on gene expression implies a regulatory potential of fenoxycarb on metabolome as well interestingly the observed lack of statistical significant variance of metabolite abundance suggests high homeostatic control of the metabolome abundance even with the severe reproduction disruption 4 2 reversed time course regulation and weakened pairwise correlation of metabolites by fenoxycarb exposures and mechanistic implications the only valid asca model in stage 3 suggests a reproduction stage specific impact of fenoxycarb on time course metabolic regulation in d magna in terms of characteristics of d magna reproduction cycle stage 3 is a pre phase of when neonates get released from the brood chamber hiruta et al 2010 furthermore stage 3 is a crucial period for preparing oogenesis as adult daphnids are at the stage for the next cycle of reproduction fenoxycarb acts similar to juvenile hormones with higher binding affinity to receptors in crustaceans gourmelon and ahtiainen 2007 as reproductive hormones such as ecdysteroids are reproduction stage specifically regulated in adult d magna martin creuzburg et al 2007 stage 3 specific action of fenoxycarb is likely related to the reproduction stage specific hormone activity the regulatory potential on oogenesis including vitellogenesis and oviposition by juvenile hormones and fenoxycarb has been reported in insects dubrovsky et al 2002 nagaraju 2007 smykal et al 2014 down regulation of vitellogenin gene expression by fenoxycarb exposure was observed in ovaries of adult d magna toyota et al 2017 and in whole body d magna at exposure to 10 ng l of fenoxycarb kim et al 2011 as vitellogenin is an egg yolk precursor protein which is important for complete oogenesis toyota et al 2017 disruption on vitellogenesis during reproduction stage 3 likely contributed to the impairment of successful oogenesis and the endocrine disruption actions are potentially connected to the observed metabolic dysregulation the major time pattern of metabolite abundance variation was reversed in reproduction stage 3 by both 1 and 12 days fenoxycarb exposures compared to the control based on asca fig 3 the majority of metabolites well modelled by the asca major patterns fig 4 are important metabolites in oogenesis regulation patterns of branched chain amino acids bcaas leucine isoleucine and valine were all reversed in fig 4 leucine and isoleucine showed decreasing concentration in controls but increased with fenoxycarb exposures valine showed an inversed u shape with controls and the acute fenoxycarb exposure changed the pattern to a u shape bcaas are precursors of monomethyl branched chain fatty acids mbcfas and the supressed synthesis of mbcfas impairs oogenesis in caenorhabditis elegans kniazeva et al 2004 caenorhabditis elegans with impaired egg production after exposure to 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine showed increased putrescine level davies 2011 the polyamine concentrations in gonads of insects including trimethylenediamine were suggested to be associated with oogenesis hamana et al 1989 accordingly disruption of oogenesis by fenoxycarb is supported by the observed dysregulation of metabolites fig 4 fenoxycarb is a carbamate pesticide that may inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity smulders et al 2003 acetylcholinesterase catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine to choline kanehisa et al 2016 acetylcholine and choline measured in this study were not affected by sub lethal fenoxycarb exposures in both time course regulation and pair wise correlation suggesting that these pathways were not impacted in d magna as has been reported for other organisms the detected time pattern disruptions of metabolite abundance regulation imply that fenoxycarb likely affects the circadian clock which regulates the metabolome güldür and otlu 2017 the circadian clock is operated by feedback loops composed of a number of transcriptional interactions and is able to be reprogrammed rapidly by environmental factors in a reversible manner eckel mahan et al 2013 both hormones and metabolites are known to be controlled by the circadian clock in insects di cara and king jones 2013 simultaneously juvenile hormones in d magna are assumed capable to timely regulate energy metabolism the assumption is based on the studies with different insect species showing engagement of juvenile hormones in honey bee energy metabolism wang et al 2012 and the regulatory potential of juvenile hormones in drosophila circadian clock uryu et al 2015 additionally in insects the juvenile hormone receptor activity is involved in circadian activation of oogenesis related gene expressions including kr h1 shin et al 2012 which is related to insect egg maturation lin et al 2015 as such continuous activation of juvenile hormone receptor by fenoxycarb potentially influences the circadian clock in d magna and consequently periodical metabolic regulation in addition to oogenesis although direct comparison between insect and crustacean classes is not the best due to the species difference we used observations from insect studies for interpretation of the observations in this study due to very limited circadian rhythm studies focusing on hormones in crustacean additionally the comparison of the hormone system between insect and crustacean is reasonable because the same juvenile hormones and similar receptor responses to the hormone involved in reproduction have been found miyakawa et al 2018 fenoxycarb exposures resulted in weakened correlations of pairwise metabolites fig 5 and table 1 observed decreasing number of significant correlations p value of pearson correlation 0 05 with longer exposure time indicates more extensive impact on metabolite correlations the filtered 20 consistent correlation disruptions table 1 are likely associated to the hormone dysregulation by fenoxycarb which occurred in both short and prolonged fenoxycarb exposures over 1 and 12 days among the consistent correlation disruptions in table 1 two correlations are neighbored on known kegg pathways glycine and threonine are directly connected to the alanine serine and threonine metabolism pathway and ornithine and proline are connected with two additional intermediates in between on the arginine and proline metabolism pathway kanehisa et al 2016 juvenile hormone analogues modulate gene expressions in silkworms which are engaged in multiple amino acid metabolism pathways including metabolism of glycine serine threonine arginine and proline cheng et al 2014 similarly the high correlations absolute correlation coefficient 0 6 in the control might be weakened absolute correlation coefficient 0 4 as a result of fenoxycarb exposures on the pathways during both 1 and 12 days of exposure for further understanding on enzymatic action resulting in the disrupted correlations between the neighbouring metabolites on pathways further investigation on enzyme activity responsible for transformation of the neighbouring metabolites will be required for instance threonine aldolase and acetaldehyde lyase are responsible for transformations between glycine and threonine kanehisa et al 2016 despite the mechanistically logical link of the two observed pairwise correlations with fenoxycarb action most of the observed correlations table 1 and fig 5 do not match established networks of kegg pathways such discrepancy between observed correlation networks and correlation networks on established pathways have often been observed rosato et al 2018 this might be due to the wide utility of the metabolites as precursors intermediates and products by known and unknown multiple pathways taken together the observed metabolic dysregulations at a specific reproduction stage reversed time regulation of select metabolites at reproduction stage 3 suggest oogenesis related action of fenoxycarb although there is limitation in implication translation of a part of results the correlation analysis result 4 3 prediction of 12 days fenoxycarb exposure based on 1 day metabolic observation and its implications to water pollution monitoring the statistically definable and consistently detectable disruptions on select metabolites are strong bioindicator candidates for d magna fenoxycarb exposure fig 4 and table 1 with regulation pattern and correlation analyses it was found that the 1 day metabolic disruption of these metabolites quantitatively matches the observations made after 12 days metabolic disruption under identical fenoxycarb exposure conditions the suggested bioindicator metabolites also provide a mechanistic perspective about endocrine disruption by fenoxycarb the oogenesis inhibition and sensitively responded to the sub lethal and environmentally relevant concentration thus these results suggest the high potential of metabolic bioindicators for water pollution monitoring in the present study the potential control of reproduction stage in addition to the sampling hour was considered in the comparative analysis of metabolic regulation in d magna as a result the measurement of reproduction stage dependent metabolic profile was available and the statistics could target a specific reproduction stage data finally detectability of abnormal metabolic regulation was improved by considering reproduction asca identified the major patterns clearly differentiated by fenoxycarb during reproduction stage 3 pearson correlation analysis resulted in more observations of significant correlations p value 0 05 more than twice during reproduction stage 3 specific data compared to the entire data set for example 694 532 and 466 were observed as significant correlations with control 1 and 12 days fenoxycarb exposures from reproduction stage 3 data in contrast 285 212 and 175 were observed as significant correlations with control 1 and 12 days fenoxycarb exposures of the entire data set in many cases comparative exposure studies using adult d magna employ sampling strategies measuring biological responses at a particular or multiple times without consideration of reproduction cycle the observed metabolic dysregulation in a specific reproduction stage and high predictability of sub chronic fenoxycarb exposure based on acute metabolic observation demonstrates the necessity of inclusion of reproduction stage information into d magna metabolomics studies some limitations of this approach include a reduction in the sample size per exposure when reproduction stage and time were considered which was 12 combinations of 3 reproduction stages and 4 sampling times in this study reduction of replicate numbers reduces statistical power of variance analysis and consequently the possibility of response observations practical challenges for the reduced sample size are unavoidable for in vivo studies where tissue samples acquired are limited therefore each sampling strategy seems to compensate each other than that one sampling method is better than the other more importantly selection of variables requiring constraint in comparative metabolomics needs to be dependent on toxicity types resulted by pollutants of interest the specific advantage by the inclusion of reproduction stage information was observed in this study because of the relation of the reproduction to endocrine regulation additional studies using a similar approach especially to understand metabolomic implication of endocrine disruptions in aquatic invertebrates are needed the observed disruptions on metabolic regulation patterns and correlation networks highlight the importance of different data analysis strategies in environmental metabolomics metabolomic regulation is constrained by well structured physiological periodicity which is geared to environmental changes including food uptake and rest güldür and otlu 2017 therefore homeostasis of metabolic regulation is not only about the abundance level but also regulation patterns across time the time regulation of the metabolome has been relatively well understood in mammalian studies and disruption on the periodicity such as broken circadian clock has been linked to diseases güldür and otlu 2017 more importantly disrupted circadian clock was confirmed with clock gene mutation that reduced the reproduction capacity in drosophila melanogaster beaver et al 2002 pollutants are capable of directly dysregulating the circadian clock in rainbow trout where polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exposures dysregulated the level of melatonin in pineal organ which is the main hormone associated to circadian rhythm gesto et al 2009 here the reversed time pattern of metabolite regulation is a potential sign of broken regulation rhythm in metabolome and consequent reproductive endocrine disruption in d magna it is also apparent fig 5 and table 1 that fenoxycarb weakens the pairwise connectivity between regulations of individual metabolite abundance the magnitude of metabolomic connectivity is often not related to the distance on the known pathway maps such as kegg pathways rosato et al 2018 however disruption and networking of the metabolic correlation is another bioindicator candidate of environmental change williams et al 2014 unfortunately regulation pattern and correlation network data are rare in environmental metabolomics studies the observations and suggested bioindicator metabolites highlight the necessity of more bioindicator metabolite discovery by using time pattern and correlation analyses 5 conclusion this study confirmed the potential of d magna metabolomics as a rapid reproducible and informative predictor of an invertebrate endocrine disruptor exposure quantitative matches in dysregulation for the select metabolites between 1 and 12 days fenoxycarb exposures showed the rapid prediction of chronic dysregulation based on early metabolic observation disruption on oogenesis was suggested as endocrine disruption related actions of fenoxycarb on d magna based on reproduction stage specific metabolic dysregulation this study discovered by including reproduction stage scaling into the study design improvements in the detectability of metabolic dysregulation and is consistent with observations across different exposure periods the consistency in metabolic dysregulations between 1 and 12 days of fenoxycarb exposure provides evidence that the inclusion of toxicity related biology namely reproduction stages for an endocrine disruptor in this study is fundamental in metabolomic data analysis inclusion of reproduction stage scaling in experiments and data analysis excluded variance resulted by the ambient biology reproduction and enabled the identification of responses related to pollutant exposure this discovery is critical for future d magna metabolomics because current studies do not consider the reproduction cycle in data analysis this study demonstrates distinguishable improvements in data analysis outputs by constraining the endocrine relevant variables as such a high capacity of the d magna metabolome was once again

17702,rapid biomolecular observation in model indicator organisms has been considered as a potential predictor of water pollution from chronic and trace toxicants this study evaluated the use of daphnia magna metabolomic measurements as indicators for exposure to reproductive endocrine disruptors by using the model juvenile hormone analogue fenoxycarb because d magna reproduction controls metabolic regulation the reproduction stage was also carefully considered in metabolic observations and data analysis to examine differences comparisons of metabolite abundance regulation between 1 and 12 days of fenoxycarb exposure were performed to investigate the predictability of the sub chronic 12 days adverse impacts on reproduction and metabolic regulation based on acute 1 day metabolic observations anova simultaneous component analysis asca detected reversed patterns in direction of time course metabolite abundance regulation with fenoxycarb exposure for example decreases in the abundances of leucine asparagine methionine and isoleucine which then changed to increases were observed with time during fenoxycarb exposures the reversed regulation pattern was observed at the last reproduction stage stage 3 exclusively pearson correlation analysis showed that correlations of pairwise metabolites were disrupted with fenoxycarb exposure similar to asca data normalization based on the reproduction stage improved the detectability of significant correlations the disruption on ambient metabolite regulation patterns and pairwise metabolite correlations was consistently observed with both 1 and 12 days of fenoxycarb exposures for sets of select metabolites the observed regulatory disruptions to these specific metabolites suggest altered oogenesis as the affected metabolites and the specific reproduction stage are related to successful oogenesis this study demonstrates that d magna metabolic dysregulation is a predictor of water contamination by endocrine disrupting compounds the high predictability of sub chronic 12 days endocrine disruption was confirmed based on acute 1 day metabolic observations furthermore integration of the reproduction cycle information in d magna metabolomics was validated by observing a reproduction stage specific dysregulation in metabolite abundance regulation which was not observable from the broader data analysis consequently this study confirms the potential for establishing a quantitative relationship between water quality and indicator species metabolic observations additionally it was found that constraining variables relevant to toxicity mechanisms of interest such as the reproduction stage is a key consideration for extraction of ecologically meaningful information in environmental metabolomics graphical abstract image 1 keywords environmental metabolomics reproductive cycle fenoxycarb 1 introduction reproduction is an ecologically critical biological function of aquatic organisms because the inhibition of reproduction differentiates population dynamics of the organism and its preys and predators kidd et al 2014 detection of reproduction impairment due to aquatic pollutant exposure typically requires at least a full sexual maturation period or reproduction cycle which is 2 3 days in traditional chemical risk assessment bioassays barata et al 1999 2004 2007 barata and baird 2000 dzialowski et al 2006 otherwise the concept of adverse outcome pathways aop suggests that chronic reproduction toxicity is predictable based on early biomolecular observations allen et al 2014 in the aop framework molecular initiating events mies represent the initial key stimulations of toxicant exposure to receiving organisms such as binding to specific molecular receptors doering et al 2016 mies subsequently lead to downstream molecular events that consequently result in adverse outcomes to targeted organs allen et al 2014 therefore matching the molecular responses occurring after the mies with chronic reproduction toxicity enables the discover of biomolecular indicators for reproductive endocrine disruption metabolites are under tight regulation within living organisms and the regulation changes in abundance and connectivity reflect phenotypical and biomolecular changes carrari et al 2006 eckel mahan et al 2012 smilowitz et al 2013 furthermore metabolic changes reflect shifts in environmental conditions making the metabolic measurement indicators highly sensitive to surrounding environmental changes taylor et al 2018 thus metabolic profiles potentially link and predict upstream mies and downstream physiological changes within the aop concept with high sensitivity in response to pollutant exposures taylor et al 2016 wagner et al 2019 by using daphnia magna one of the most frequently used model organisms in aquatic pollutant exposure bownik 2017 a recent study evidenced the rapid and sensitive contrast ability at hourly scales between standard and sub standard water qualities jeong and simpson 2019a potential of whole metabolome based prediction for chronic reproduction inhibition in d magna has been proposed by relating the magnitudes of offspring reduction and metabolomic variance in chronic toxicant exposures taylor et al 2016 2018 however consistent observation of identical metabolic dysregulation on individual metabolite abundances has not been reported among studies from acute and chronic exposures to the reproduction impairing toxicants taylor et al 2016 2018 constraining biological and environmental variables in exposure studies using living organisms is critical for interpreting the observed responses to specific toxicants weber 1991 a recent d magna study established the important factors including different stages of the reproduction cycle and the resulting contribution to metabolic variation jeong and simpson 2019b the finding supports a d magna transcriptomic study that showed a reproduction stage dependency of molecular regulation campos et al 2018 it was suggested that the reproduction cycle should be considered in exposure study designs which will facilitate higher contrast capability by minimizing the metabolic variation jeong and simpson 2019b the reproduction cycle repeats for the entire lifespan in d magna ebert 2005 and accounting for the differential reproduction stage is critical for d magna metabolomic studies especially when investigating the toxicity of endocrine disruptors which target reproduction processes dang et al 2012 kang et al 2014 it has been reported that hormone activity varied across reproduction stage martin creuzburg et al 2007 which further supports the importance of the reproduction cycle as hormones are targets of endocrine disruptors to the best of our knowledge no d magna comparative metabolomics study has investigated responses with exposure to endocrine disruptors and accounted for differential reproduction stages in these observations and data analysis this study aims to determine the validity of d magna metabolomic observations in predicting endocrine disruptor exposure within the context of metabolic variance from the reproduction cycle fenoxycarb a carbamate insecticide is a model endocrine disruptor and results in reproduction inhibition in non targeted aquatic invertebrates including daphnia tatarazako et al 2003 the observed environmental concentrations of fenoxycarb ranges from 25 to 700 ng l charizopoulos and papadopoulou mourkidou 1999 kim et al 2017 spycher et al 2018 and is within the concentration range whereof the reported effective concentrations to daphnia 10 1000 ng l tatarazako et al 2003 fenoxycarb mimics juvenile hormones in d magna gourmelon and ahtiainen 2007 and juvenile hormones are associated with regulation of multiple biological molecules and related functions miyakawa et al 2018 therefore we used fenoxycarb as the model endocrine disruptor for exposure experiments and hypothesized that endocrine disruption caused by fenoxycarb influences the regulation of individual metabolites in d magna to investigate whether the reproduction cycle and time dependent metabolic variance factor into the study design improves observations and statistical outcome reproduction stages were scaled and time course abundances of 51 individual metabolites were quantified these measured metabolites included amino acids nucleotides neurotransmitters and carbohydrates and were chosen based on published quantification methods jeong and simpson 2019b zhou and yin 2016 a previous study which measured 51 metabolites revealed that metabolic regulation differed with reproduction stages jeong and simpson 2019b in this study acute and sub chronic exposures for 1 and 12 days were performed and metabolic profiles of the exposed daphnids were monitored with inclusion of reproduction stage scaling to determine the predictability of the 12 days effects from the 1 day metabolic responses offspring production assays were performed before the metabolic profiling experiments to select a range of effective fenoxycarb concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 daphnia magna culturing d magna used in the present study was purchased from ward science and have been cultured consistently based on environmental canada and united states environmental protection agency guidelines environment canada 2002 weber 1991 population density was controlled at 35 daphnids per litre of culture media before the neonates were transferred to individual containers for exposure experiments the culture media was prepared by adding caso4 mgso4 kcl nahco3 vitamin b12 and selenium into deionized water 120 mg l of caso4 192 mg l of nahco3 120 mg l of mgso4 8 0 mg l of kcl 2 μg l of vitamin b12 and 2 μg l of selenium environment canada 2002 weber 1991 temperature was maintained at 22 1 5 c and light dark period was controlled at a ratio of 16 8 h chlorella vulgaris was fed daily as a nutrient source and the feeding and media renewal were performed daily and bi daily respectively 2 2 fenoxycarb exposures for reproduction impairment measurement and metabolic profiling fenoxycarb 98 0 was purchased from sigma aldrich canada and used to prepare the fenoxycarb stock solutions for exposure experiments for the exposures to observe fenoxycarb concentration dependent changes in offspring production 12 days of exposure was performed using neonate daphnids less than 24 h old with a control and 5 nominal concentrations of fenoxycarb of 3 125 12 5 50 200 and 800 ng l the exposures and control were replicated eight times the working stock and exposure solutions of fenoxycarb were prepared by dissolving fenoxycarb powder into d magna culture media ethanol 99 9 commercial alcohols inc was used as a solvent to fully dissolve fenoxycarb into stock solutions and the final ethanol concentration in the 12 days exposure for reproduction impairment measurement was matched at 0 00004 v v which is far lower than no observed effect concentrations cowgill and milazzo 1991 fenoxycarb at a concentration of 50 ng l was used in 1 and 12 day exposure experiments for the d magna metabolic profiling 50 ng l fenoxycarb was chosen based on the range of concentrations resulting in offspring number reduction from a separate 12 day exposure test the exposure experiment for metabolic profiling consisted of acute 1 day and sub chronic 12 days fenoxycarb exposures with one pure media control fenoxycarb stock solution was prepared by dissolving fenoxycarb powder into ethanol and the stock solution was diluted with culture media final ethanol concentrations in fenoxycarb exposure solutions and a control solution was maintained at 0 000005 v v for metabolic profiling exposures in the exposures for metabolite profiling nominal concentration of 50 fenoxycarb ng l the stability of dissolved fenoxycarb in the culture media solutions was measured continuously the reason for using stock solution in the fenoxycarb stability measurement was that the use of actual exposure solution had limitations in fenoxycarb quantification and extraction with the low concentration of fenoxycarb and the small solution volume per exposure fenoxycarb concentration dissolved in the stock solutions which was 1000 times diluted for the final exposure solution generation was quantified in exposure condition by using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms during the 12 days exposure period details are provided in the supplementary information measured fenoxycarb concentrations ranged from 45 472 to 55 628 μg l which confirmed the high stability of dissolved fenoxycarb in d magna media and with exposure conditions table s1 for the metabolic exposure experiments individual neonate d magna less than 24 h old were randomly collected from the culture and transferred into 30 ml vials for the sub chronic exposure the individual neonates transferred were maintained in the containers with fenoxycarb solution for 12 days for the acute exposure individual neonate daphnids were maintained in the containers with pure media solution for 11 days and subsequently with fenoxycarb solution for 1 day controls were maintained alongside the fenoxycarb exposures under the same conditions for 12 days fenoxycarb exposure periods were selected using adult d magna to measure rapid metabolic response 1 day exposure and using neonates to simulate chronic exposure 12 days united states environmental protection agency 2002 during the exposure period feeding and media replacement was performed daily and bi daily respectively d magna were fed at 9 30 daily during the duration of the experiment after 12 days the daphnids were sampled on the same day at four time points 11 00 13 00 15 00 and 17 00 time deviation of each sampling time point was 30 min and each sampling from an individual exposure was replicated twelve times fig 1 at each sampling reproduction stages were defined based on 4 stages fig 1 giardini et al 2015 jeong and simpson 2019b full details of reproduction stage classification are provided in the supplementary information fig s1 each sampled daphnid was then transferred into a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and rinsed with deionized water the water was carefully removed by using a glass pasteur pipette and liquid nitrogen was used to flash freeze the daphnids the frozen samples were stored at 20 c until metabolite extraction daphnia samples were randomized for the entire process of exposure and sampling 2 3 metabolite extraction and quantification from individual daphnia magna metabolite extraction and quantification were based on established methods jeong and simpson 2019b wu et al 2008 the purity of all solvents and reagents used including methanol acetonitrile chloroform and formic acid was spectroscopic grade or higher fisher scientific canada standard compounds used for metabolite quantification are listed in table s2 the purity of the standards was 98 table s2 and the standards were purchased from fischer scientific canada sigma aldrich canada alfa aesar bdh chemicals bioshop canada inc tci america emd millipore acros organics and cambridge isotope laboratories inc a mixture of internal standards table s2 was spiked into a microtube containing the frozen daphnid sample before the extraction a 160 μl mixture of 10 9 methanol and water was added into each 1 5 ml microtubes containing a frozen daphnid and homogenized subsequently 600 μl of the 10 9 methanol and water mixture was added and the microtube was sonicated for 5 min then 400 μl chloroform was added to the mixture and the microtube was vigorously mixed for 1 min the methanol and water were then separated from chloroform by centrifugation 4 c 5 min 12 500 rpm and the extraction cycle was repeated 3 times at the end of third extraction cycle 200 μl of the supernatant was filtered through a syringeless filter having 0 2 μm pore size mini prep whatman for lc ms ms analysis the entire extraction process was conducted on ice to maximize sample integrity sample labels and order were randomized for the entire extraction procedure including the sample loading for injection 10 μl for lc ms ms analysis metabolite analysis and quantification was performed using an agilent technologies 1260 lc connected to a 6420a triple quadrupole ms an ultra aq c18 column 3 μm x 100 mm 4 6 mm restek was employed for metabolite separation water and acetonitrile with 0 1 formic acid for both were used as mobile phases the gradient program of the binary mobile phase composition was 5 40 60 80 80 and 5 of acetonitrile at 0 3 75 4 5 6 75 7 25 and 8 5 min respectively electrospray ionization was used in polarity switching mode with application of dynamic multiple reaction monitoring for precursor and fragment ions detection the parameters of lc ms ms for metabolite quantification were as follows gas temperature 300 c gas flow 6 l min nebulizer pressure 15 psi and capillary voltage of 4000 v a 5 min equilibrium time was applied between each sample run a blank sample of water and methanol mixture was run every 10 samples and column cleaning samples were also run every 20 samples calibration curves for quantification of individual metabolite were generated using agilent mass hunter b 08 00 calibration curves were generated using more than 5 consecutive concentration points r2 of the calibrations were consistently 0 990 and with most above 0 995 standard metabolite mixtures at a low and high level of calibration curve were analyzed in triplicates for quality control accuracy 79 5 121 8 and precision 23 1 relative standard deviation were calculated and the full values are listed in table s3 extraction recovery rates were measured for all metabolites by extracting a set of samples n 4 where known standard concentrations were added before the extraction table s3 a signal to noise ratio of 10 was set as the minimum threshold for quantification peak intensity integration and concentration calculation with calibration curves generation were performed using the agilent mass hunter quantitative analysis program version b 08 00 2 4 data analysis the data set of measured absolute metabolite concentrations was deoutliered q1 and q3 1 5 interquartile range and inputted into metaboanalystr for further data processing and statistics chong and xia 2018 team 2015 deoutliered data was replaced with median and the data was normalized by dividing an individual metabolite concentration by the sum of all the metabolites per daphnid the normalized metabolite abundance data was rescaled using the auto scaling method of the metaboanalystr package chong and xia 2018 in the statistical analysis modules of metaboanalystr two way analysis of variance anova was performed to assess influence of fenoxycarb exposures on time dependent metabolite abundance false discovery rate adjusted p value fdr was calculated and used to evaluate statistical significance fdr 0 05 anova simultaneous component analysis asca and pearson correlation analysis were performed for analyses of time pattern and pairwise correlation in metabolic abundance regulation respectively reproduction stage 0 was not included in any statistics to avoid bias due to the low number of sampled daphnids at the stage 0 7 64 of all sampled daphnids each statistical analysis was performed for data both reorganized and unorganized based on the recorded reproduction stages to evaluate the influence of reproduction stage on statistical output 3 results 3 1 offspring production of daphnia magna exposed to different fenoxycarb concentrations over 12 days the impact of fenoxycarb at multiple concentrations on d magna reproduction was compared by summing the number of neonates produced at each exposure concentration over 12 days fig 2 the 12 days of fenoxycarb exposure resulted in 11 36 86 100 and 100 decreased neonate reproduction compared to the control at exposure concentrations of 3 125 12 5 50 200 and 800 ng l respectively fig 2 3 2 time dependent regulation of metabolite abundances in daphnia magna exposed to 50 ng l fenoxycarb solutions for 1 and 12 days two way anova revealed that metabolite abundance was not significantly differentiated by fenoxycarb exposure or the interaction of fenoxycarb exposure and sampling time regardless of data reorganization according to reproduction stage fdr 0 05 in contrast time pattern analysis for metabolite abundance variation showed distinguishable trends between the fenoxycarb exposures and control daphnia metabolite profiles asca was performed to investigate major time patterns of the metabolite variation between different fenoxycarb exposures fig 3 and revealed that the patterns of time course metabolite abundance change are dependent on reproduction stages fig 3a fig 3b shows with the results of the permutation test a validation test for the asca models that the asca model in the stage 3 is only valid n 1000 p value 0 05 among all of the asca models fitted in different reproduction stages fig 3b based on the asca scores of the component 1 in reproduction stage 3 fig 3a explaining 45 99 of data variation it is found that 1 and 12 days fenoxycarb exposures reverse the major time patterns detected by asca in the time dependent regulation of metabolite abundances at almost same magnitude fig 4 a metabolites that are well modelled by the observed major trends component 1 at reproduction stage 3 fig 3 were selected by using asca and the time dependent abundance change of the selected metabolites were analyzed to determine how much the observed major trends fig 3a explain specific metabolite regulation fig 4 the well modelled metabolites were defined based on the leverage threshold 0 8 and squared prediction error threshold 0 05 using metaboanalystr the selected metabolites in fig 4 show apparent inverse of abundance regulation pattern metabolite abundance decreased for leucine asparagine methionine and isoleucine across time in control in contrast the metabolites increased across time in fenoxycarb concentrations putrescine and trimethylenediamine showed increasing abundance in control oppositely the metabolites showed decreasing abundance with fenoxycarb exposure the full suite of metabolites with recognizable opposite time patterns between fenoxycarb exposures and a control but with leverage threshold lower than 0 8 are displayed in fig s2 3 3 impact of fenoxycarb exposure on pairwise correlation networks of metabolite regulation in daphnia magna pairwise correlation of metabolites during reproduction stage 3 was further analyzed between different fenoxycarb exposures and the control fig 5 the correlation network weakened with fenoxycarb exposures fig 5a and b compared to the control fig 5c as graphically observed with the whitened colour of network maps with fenoxycarb exposures based on the p values of pearson correlation analysis the numbers of significantly correlated metabolites p value 0 05 were confirmed 694 in control and decreased to 532 and 466 for 1 and 12 days of exposure respectively as such fenoxycarb disrupts metabolite correlations and the sub chronic 12 day exposure resulted in a higher number of correlation disruptions among all the correlations changed by fenoxycarb exposure consistently disrupted correlations from strong to weak were filtered and listed in table 1 the level of correlation was defined by absolute correlation coefficients weak and strong correlations were respectively defined correlations with absolute correlation coefficients smaller and higher than 0 4 and 0 6 the consistently disrupted correlation was defined by a correlation weakened by both 1 and 12 days fenoxycarb exposures as a result 20 consistently disrupted strong correlations were identified through the selection process as listed in table 1 4 discussion 4 1 metabolite abundance by fenoxycarb exposure at the reproduction disrupting concentration offspring reduction after fenoxycarb exposures at a range of ng l concentrations was observed to decrease to 11 at 3 125 ng l in this study fig 2 and the observed effective concentration range is comparable to the level from a previous study that reported the no observed effect concentration on reproduction at 1 6 ng l hosmer et al 1998 the fenoxycarb at 50 ng l chosen for metabolic profiling resulted in severe inhibition of offspring reproduction 86 after 12 days of exposure unexpectedly the 1 and 12 days exposures affected no metabolite abundances according to the two way anova results regardless of data reorganization based on reproduction stage a previous study reported differential gene expression profiles for d magna with fenoxycarb exposure at 500 ng l toyota et al 2014 and the influence on gene expression implies a regulatory potential of fenoxycarb on metabolome as well interestingly the observed lack of statistical significant variance of metabolite abundance suggests high homeostatic control of the metabolome abundance even with the severe reproduction disruption 4 2 reversed time course regulation and weakened pairwise correlation of metabolites by fenoxycarb exposures and mechanistic implications the only valid asca model in stage 3 suggests a reproduction stage specific impact of fenoxycarb on time course metabolic regulation in d magna in terms of characteristics of d magna reproduction cycle stage 3 is a pre phase of when neonates get released from the brood chamber hiruta et al 2010 furthermore stage 3 is a crucial period for preparing oogenesis as adult daphnids are at the stage for the next cycle of reproduction fenoxycarb acts similar to juvenile hormones with higher binding affinity to receptors in crustaceans gourmelon and ahtiainen 2007 as reproductive hormones such as ecdysteroids are reproduction stage specifically regulated in adult d magna martin creuzburg et al 2007 stage 3 specific action of fenoxycarb is likely related to the reproduction stage specific hormone activity the regulatory potential on oogenesis including vitellogenesis and oviposition by juvenile hormones and fenoxycarb has been reported in insects dubrovsky et al 2002 nagaraju 2007 smykal et al 2014 down regulation of vitellogenin gene expression by fenoxycarb exposure was observed in ovaries of adult d magna toyota et al 2017 and in whole body d magna at exposure to 10 ng l of fenoxycarb kim et al 2011 as vitellogenin is an egg yolk precursor protein which is important for complete oogenesis toyota et al 2017 disruption on vitellogenesis during reproduction stage 3 likely contributed to the impairment of successful oogenesis and the endocrine disruption actions are potentially connected to the observed metabolic dysregulation the major time pattern of metabolite abundance variation was reversed in reproduction stage 3 by both 1 and 12 days fenoxycarb exposures compared to the control based on asca fig 3 the majority of metabolites well modelled by the asca major patterns fig 4 are important metabolites in oogenesis regulation patterns of branched chain amino acids bcaas leucine isoleucine and valine were all reversed in fig 4 leucine and isoleucine showed decreasing concentration in controls but increased with fenoxycarb exposures valine showed an inversed u shape with controls and the acute fenoxycarb exposure changed the pattern to a u shape bcaas are precursors of monomethyl branched chain fatty acids mbcfas and the supressed synthesis of mbcfas impairs oogenesis in caenorhabditis elegans kniazeva et al 2004 caenorhabditis elegans with impaired egg production after exposure to 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine showed increased putrescine level davies 2011 the polyamine concentrations in gonads of insects including trimethylenediamine were suggested to be associated with oogenesis hamana et al 1989 accordingly disruption of oogenesis by fenoxycarb is supported by the observed dysregulation of metabolites fig 4 fenoxycarb is a carbamate pesticide that may inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity smulders et al 2003 acetylcholinesterase catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine to choline kanehisa et al 2016 acetylcholine and choline measured in this study were not affected by sub lethal fenoxycarb exposures in both time course regulation and pair wise correlation suggesting that these pathways were not impacted in d magna as has been reported for other organisms the detected time pattern disruptions of metabolite abundance regulation imply that fenoxycarb likely affects the circadian clock which regulates the metabolome güldür and otlu 2017 the circadian clock is operated by feedback loops composed of a number of transcriptional interactions and is able to be reprogrammed rapidly by environmental factors in a reversible manner eckel mahan et al 2013 both hormones and metabolites are known to be controlled by the circadian clock in insects di cara and king jones 2013 simultaneously juvenile hormones in d magna are assumed capable to timely regulate energy metabolism the assumption is based on the studies with different insect species showing engagement of juvenile hormones in honey bee energy metabolism wang et al 2012 and the regulatory potential of juvenile hormones in drosophila circadian clock uryu et al 2015 additionally in insects the juvenile hormone receptor activity is involved in circadian activation of oogenesis related gene expressions including kr h1 shin et al 2012 which is related to insect egg maturation lin et al 2015 as such continuous activation of juvenile hormone receptor by fenoxycarb potentially influences the circadian clock in d magna and consequently periodical metabolic regulation in addition to oogenesis although direct comparison between insect and crustacean classes is not the best due to the species difference we used observations from insect studies for interpretation of the observations in this study due to very limited circadian rhythm studies focusing on hormones in crustacean additionally the comparison of the hormone system between insect and crustacean is reasonable because the same juvenile hormones and similar receptor responses to the hormone involved in reproduction have been found miyakawa et al 2018 fenoxycarb exposures resulted in weakened correlations of pairwise metabolites fig 5 and table 1 observed decreasing number of significant correlations p value of pearson correlation 0 05 with longer exposure time indicates more extensive impact on metabolite correlations the filtered 20 consistent correlation disruptions table 1 are likely associated to the hormone dysregulation by fenoxycarb which occurred in both short and prolonged fenoxycarb exposures over 1 and 12 days among the consistent correlation disruptions in table 1 two correlations are neighbored on known kegg pathways glycine and threonine are directly connected to the alanine serine and threonine metabolism pathway and ornithine and proline are connected with two additional intermediates in between on the arginine and proline metabolism pathway kanehisa et al 2016 juvenile hormone analogues modulate gene expressions in silkworms which are engaged in multiple amino acid metabolism pathways including metabolism of glycine serine threonine arginine and proline cheng et al 2014 similarly the high correlations absolute correlation coefficient 0 6 in the control might be weakened absolute correlation coefficient 0 4 as a result of fenoxycarb exposures on the pathways during both 1 and 12 days of exposure for further understanding on enzymatic action resulting in the disrupted correlations between the neighbouring metabolites on pathways further investigation on enzyme activity responsible for transformation of the neighbouring metabolites will be required for instance threonine aldolase and acetaldehyde lyase are responsible for transformations between glycine and threonine kanehisa et al 2016 despite the mechanistically logical link of the two observed pairwise correlations with fenoxycarb action most of the observed correlations table 1 and fig 5 do not match established networks of kegg pathways such discrepancy between observed correlation networks and correlation networks on established pathways have often been observed rosato et al 2018 this might be due to the wide utility of the metabolites as precursors intermediates and products by known and unknown multiple pathways taken together the observed metabolic dysregulations at a specific reproduction stage reversed time regulation of select metabolites at reproduction stage 3 suggest oogenesis related action of fenoxycarb although there is limitation in implication translation of a part of results the correlation analysis result 4 3 prediction of 12 days fenoxycarb exposure based on 1 day metabolic observation and its implications to water pollution monitoring the statistically definable and consistently detectable disruptions on select metabolites are strong bioindicator candidates for d magna fenoxycarb exposure fig 4 and table 1 with regulation pattern and correlation analyses it was found that the 1 day metabolic disruption of these metabolites quantitatively matches the observations made after 12 days metabolic disruption under identical fenoxycarb exposure conditions the suggested bioindicator metabolites also provide a mechanistic perspective about endocrine disruption by fenoxycarb the oogenesis inhibition and sensitively responded to the sub lethal and environmentally relevant concentration thus these results suggest the high potential of metabolic bioindicators for water pollution monitoring in the present study the potential control of reproduction stage in addition to the sampling hour was considered in the comparative analysis of metabolic regulation in d magna as a result the measurement of reproduction stage dependent metabolic profile was available and the statistics could target a specific reproduction stage data finally detectability of abnormal metabolic regulation was improved by considering reproduction asca identified the major patterns clearly differentiated by fenoxycarb during reproduction stage 3 pearson correlation analysis resulted in more observations of significant correlations p value 0 05 more than twice during reproduction stage 3 specific data compared to the entire data set for example 694 532 and 466 were observed as significant correlations with control 1 and 12 days fenoxycarb exposures from reproduction stage 3 data in contrast 285 212 and 175 were observed as significant correlations with control 1 and 12 days fenoxycarb exposures of the entire data set in many cases comparative exposure studies using adult d magna employ sampling strategies measuring biological responses at a particular or multiple times without consideration of reproduction cycle the observed metabolic dysregulation in a specific reproduction stage and high predictability of sub chronic fenoxycarb exposure based on acute metabolic observation demonstrates the necessity of inclusion of reproduction stage information into d magna metabolomics studies some limitations of this approach include a reduction in the sample size per exposure when reproduction stage and time were considered which was 12 combinations of 3 reproduction stages and 4 sampling times in this study reduction of replicate numbers reduces statistical power of variance analysis and consequently the possibility of response observations practical challenges for the reduced sample size are unavoidable for in vivo studies where tissue samples acquired are limited therefore each sampling strategy seems to compensate each other than that one sampling method is better than the other more importantly selection of variables requiring constraint in comparative metabolomics needs to be dependent on toxicity types resulted by pollutants of interest the specific advantage by the inclusion of reproduction stage information was observed in this study because of the relation of the reproduction to endocrine regulation additional studies using a similar approach especially to understand metabolomic implication of endocrine disruptions in aquatic invertebrates are needed the observed disruptions on metabolic regulation patterns and correlation networks highlight the importance of different data analysis strategies in environmental metabolomics metabolomic regulation is constrained by well structured physiological periodicity which is geared to environmental changes including food uptake and rest güldür and otlu 2017 therefore homeostasis of metabolic regulation is not only about the abundance level but also regulation patterns across time the time regulation of the metabolome has been relatively well understood in mammalian studies and disruption on the periodicity such as broken circadian clock has been linked to diseases güldür and otlu 2017 more importantly disrupted circadian clock was confirmed with clock gene mutation that reduced the reproduction capacity in drosophila melanogaster beaver et al 2002 pollutants are capable of directly dysregulating the circadian clock in rainbow trout where polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exposures dysregulated the level of melatonin in pineal organ which is the main hormone associated to circadian rhythm gesto et al 2009 here the reversed time pattern of metabolite regulation is a potential sign of broken regulation rhythm in metabolome and consequent reproductive endocrine disruption in d magna it is also apparent fig 5 and table 1 that fenoxycarb weakens the pairwise connectivity between regulations of individual metabolite abundance the magnitude of metabolomic connectivity is often not related to the distance on the known pathway maps such as kegg pathways rosato et al 2018 however disruption and networking of the metabolic correlation is another bioindicator candidate of environmental change williams et al 2014 unfortunately regulation pattern and correlation network data are rare in environmental metabolomics studies the observations and suggested bioindicator metabolites highlight the necessity of more bioindicator metabolite discovery by using time pattern and correlation analyses 5 conclusion this study confirmed the potential of d magna metabolomics as a rapid reproducible and informative predictor of an invertebrate endocrine disruptor exposure quantitative matches in dysregulation for the select metabolites between 1 and 12 days fenoxycarb exposures showed the rapid prediction of chronic dysregulation based on early metabolic observation disruption on oogenesis was suggested as endocrine disruption related actions of fenoxycarb on d magna based on reproduction stage specific metabolic dysregulation this study discovered by including reproduction stage scaling into the study design improvements in the detectability of metabolic dysregulation and is consistent with observations across different exposure periods the consistency in metabolic dysregulations between 1 and 12 days of fenoxycarb exposure provides evidence that the inclusion of toxicity related biology namely reproduction stages for an endocrine disruptor in this study is fundamental in metabolomic data analysis inclusion of reproduction stage scaling in experiments and data analysis excluded variance resulted by the ambient biology reproduction and enabled the identification of responses related to pollutant exposure this discovery is critical for future d magna metabolomics because current studies do not consider the reproduction cycle in data analysis this study demonstrates distinguishable improvements in data analysis outputs by constraining the endocrine relevant variables as such a high capacity of the d magna metabolome was once again validated in this study as a promising predictor for exposure to an endocrine disrupting pollutant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17703,this study aimed to determine the prevalence and abundance of sewage and animal fecal contamination of sediment at seven estuarine locations in sydney nsw australia sediment samples were tested for the occurrence of microbial targets including molecular marker genes of enterococci ent bacteroides hf183 hf183 methanobrevibacter smithii nifh human adenovirus hadv and emerging sewage associated marker genes crassphage cpq 056 and lachnospiraceae lachno3 and animal feces associated marker genes including avian feces associated helicobacter spp gfd canine feces associated bacteroides dogbact cattle feces associated cowm2 and horse feces associated bacteroides hof597 results from this study showed that urban estuarine sediment can act as a reservoir of fecal indicator bacteria fib and several microbial source tracking mst marker genes including previously unreported lachno3 the sewage associated marker gene cpq 056 was most prevalent in 63 8 of sediment samples while the avian associated marker gene gfd had the highest mean abundance the gfd marker gene was highly abundant and widely detected in sediment samples from all seven locations compared to the other animal feces associated marker genes in all 31 44 9 sediment samples were positive for at least two sewage associated marker genes however the non quantifiable detection of the hadv marker gene did not always align with the detection of two or more sewage associated marker genes in addition the most frequent wet weather overflow exposure occurred at locations that did not have a consistent pattern of detection of the sewage associated marker genes suggesting sediments may not be a suitable measure of recent sewage contamination to assist water quality and public health managers better understand past microbial contamination of estuarine sediment further studies seem justified to explore the role of decay of mst marker genes in sediment further work is also needed on the role of resuspension of mst marker genes from sediment during storm events to the water column as a source of contamination for both the gfd and sewage associated marker genes keywords microbial source tracking hf183 crassphage lachno3 gfd cowm2 hadv nifh sewage contamination 1 introduction exposure to surface water contaminated with sewage and animal feces is a cause for concern in terms of human health risks penakalapati et al 2017 the magnitude of fecal contamination in water is typically determined by monitoring fecal indicator bacteria fib namely escherichia coli e coli and enterococci ent coliphages the somatic coliphages which infect e coli host cells through cell wall receptors and the f specific f coliphages which infect e coli cells through f pili rochelle newall et al 2015 ahmed et al 2019a nappier et al 2019 using culture based methods culture based methods are are widely used for fib monitoring by regulatory agencies worldwide sinigalliano et al 2010 a limitation of culture based fib methods is the time required to obtain results up to 48 h which impacts on the ability to make real time management decisions boehm and weisberg 2005 rodrigues and cunha 2017 another limitation is that fib can be viable but non culturable and injured or stressed cells may result in underestimation of their abundance in a water sample darcan et al 2009 an alternative approach is the application of quantitative pcr qpcr assays for the enumeration of fib which has several advantages over culture based methods chern et al 2009 noble et al 2010 quantitative pcr assays eliminate the incubation step by quantifying a specific dna sequence associated with fib from a water sample and can yield results within 4 6 h the usepa national environmental and epidemiological assessment of recreational water neear study reported that qpcr measurements of ent are better predictors of the occurrence of gastrointestinal illness among swimmers at fresh and marine waters wade et al 2006 2008 regardless of the methods used for fib enumeration several studies highlighted the limitations of fib monitoring badgley et al 2011 byappanahalli et al 2012 harwood et al 2014 decay rates of fib in aquatic environments are different to that of pathogens korajkic et al 2019 fib often do not correlate with pathogens numbers in sewage drinking water reservoirs recreational water stormwater and groundwater despite the good correlation between fib numbers and reported gastrointestinal illness in epidemiological studies harwood et al 2005 signor et al 2005 wade et al 2008 ferguson et al 2012 certain strains of fib reported as being present in vegetation soil and sands are known as environmentally adapted strains badgley et al 2011 byappanahalli et al 2012 most importantly fib monitoring alone does not provide information on the contaminating sources harwood et al 2014 without knowing the sources relative pathogen contributions cannot be assigned soller et al 2015 which in turn inhibits an informed understanding of human health risk and the ability to manage risk to human health the application of microbial source tracking mst tools has enabled researchers and regulators to differentiate between the sources of fecal contamination harwood et al 2014 ahmed et al 2016a various mst tools have been developed including database dependent culture and amplicon sequencing methods application of enteric viruses and host associated marker genes analysis harwood et al 2014 however the most widely used mst tools involve the analysis of host associated marker genes using qpcr harwood et al 2014 the benefit of host associated marker gene analysis is that their concentrations in source fecal and wastewater samples are far greater than enteric pathogens and that they are highly host specific stoeckel and harwood 2008 ahmed et al 2016a these tools are currently being applied throughout the world to gain insight into the sources of fecal contamination and to help guide risk management solutions harwood et al 2014 fecal indicator bacteria mst markers and pathogens from water environments can be deposited in sediment and sand by directly settling out from the the water column waves or tides pachepsky and shelton 2011 several studies have reported that sand and sediment are a reservoir for fib jamieson et al 2005 luna et al 2010 badgely et al 2011 fecal indicator bacteria in sediments were reported to be 1000 10 000 fold greater than in the overlying water davies colley et al 2004 bai and lung 2005 when sediment and sand resuspension events occur sediment and sand bound microorganisms can re contaminate the water column drummond et al 2014 o mullan et al 2019 little has been documented on the abundance of mst marker genes in sand and sediment while the presence of bacteroides hf183 and hadv marker gene in freshwater sediments and recreational beach sand has been reported eichmiller et al 2013 hughes et al 2016 farkas et al 2019 little is known regarding the occurrence and quantitative distribution of recently developed marker genes such as crassphage and lachno3 stachler et al 2017 feng et al 2018 an understanding of the dynamics of host associated genetic markers and fib in water and sediment matrices is essential to accurately characterize the level of fecal contamination and associated health risks to inform best management practices to reduce public health impacts a recent study in sydney nsw australia identified sewage contamination in urban estuarine waters ahmed et al 2019b wet weather overflows wwos and dry weather overflows dwos were identified as potential sources of the sewage contamination using hf183 crassphage and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov while information is available on the influence of wwos or dwos on estuarine waters ahmed et al 2019b little is known regarding their influence on estuarine sediments the main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and abundance of sewage and animal fecal contamination of sediment at several estuarine locations in sydney nsw australia the results from this study highlight the role of resuspension potential of mst marker genes from sediment during storm events to the water column as a source of fecal contamination in the study area which needs to be accounted for by the water quality monitoring authorities broadly data presented in this study also highlights the potential increase of microbial contaminants in water column and human health risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment sampling and dna extraction a total of 69 sediment core samples were collected from seven estuarine locations table 1 between december 4 2018 and april 3 2019 during the australian swimming season these sampling locations are situated adjacent to baths used for swimming fig 1 the locations are chowder bay cb davidson park dp gymea bay gb glades bay glb hen and chicken bay hcb kogarah bay kb and lime kiln bay lkb more details on the sampling locations and sediment characteristics are provided in the supplementary tables s1 and s2 samples were collected on two separate occasions for each site from each of the seven locations five sediment samples were randomly collected from a consistent depth using a uwitec core sampler uwitec austria depths between sampling sites varied from 0 9 m to 5 5 m below the mean low water spring mlws tide level table 1 dependant on the variable bathymetry of the estuaries and location of bathing sites this variation in depth resulted from the estuaries of the sydney region being drowned river valleys and selection of sampling locations near designed sewer overflows and designated swimming locations limited the ability to have a single uniform depth across locations under strong wind conditions from a suitable direction waves could generate sediment movement at these depths only four of a planned five samples were collected for hcb during the second sampling occasion surface sediment from the top 0 2 cm of the core was collected and inserted into a pre labelled sterile 50 ml dnase rnase free falcon tube to the 35 ml line to minimize cross contamination in the field sediment was collected from each core using a dnase rnase free sterilised spatula the falcon tubes were sealed placed in a clean rack and transported to the sydney water laboratory in a portable freezer to control possible cross contamination between locations a dna rna cleaned perspex core was used for each sample perspex cores were not reused on a sampling occasion between each sampling occasion all perspex cores were pre soaked in 10 15 bleach for 24 h thoroughly rinsed five times with milli q water and individually wrapped using plastic food cling wrap perspex cores were transported to each sampling location in cling wrap dna was extracted from approximately 7 5 g of wet weight sediment sample using the dneasy powermax soil dna isolation kit qiagen valencia ca according to the manufacturer s instruction with slight modifications cell lysis was enhanced by bead beating the tubes in omni bead ruptor 24 omni international kennesaw ga at 4 m s for 2 cycles of 30 s with 30 s interval between cycles during inhibition removal steps samples were incubated at 2 8 c for 30 min instead of 10 min dna was eluted with 5 ml elution buffer extracted dna concentrations were measured with a qubit fluorometer thermo fisher scientific united kingdom using a qubit double stranded dna high sensitivity assay kit thermo fisher scientific the concentrations of dna in sediment samples ranged from 2 21 to 44 8 ng μl four aliquots of 1 2 ml of dna were stored in a 80 c ultra freezer 2 2 pcr inhibition an experiment was conducted to determine the presence of pcr inhibitors in dna extracted from sediment samples using a sketa22 real time pcr assay haugland et al 2010 ahmed et al 2018 water samples with a 2 cq quantification cycle delay to the reference cq values were considered to have pcr inhibitors staley et al 2012 pcr inhibited samples were subjected to a 10 fold dilution with te buffer and retested with sketa22 real time pcr assay all dna samples were stored at 80 c and subjected to qpcr analysis within 7 days after dna extraction 2 3 qpcr assays previously published qpcr assays were used for the analysis of the ent 23s rrna molecular marker gene of enterococci haugland et al 2010 bacteroides hf183 green et al 2014 lachnospiraceae lachno3 feng et al 2018 methanobrevibacter smithii nifh johnston et al 2010 crassphage cpq 056 stachler et al 2017 human adenovirus hadv heim et al 2003 canine feces associated bacteroides dogbact dick et al 2005 sinigalliano et al 2010 cattle feces associated cowm2 shanks et al 2008 avian feces associated helicobacter spp gfd green et al 2012 and horse feces associated bacteroides hof597 dick et al 2005 marker genes the primers and probes for these qpcr assays are shown in supplementary table s3 along with qpcr cycling parameters for all qpcr assays synthetic dna 4 μg in plasmid cloning vectors or gblocks gene fragments containing 92 bp for ent 23s rrna 132 bp for hf183 187 bp lachno3 152 bp for nifh 125 bp for cpq 056 132 bp for hadv dogbact 251 bp gfd 123 bp cowm2 92 bp and hof597 127 bp were purchased from integrated dna technologies coralville ia usa qpcr standards were prepared from the synthetic dna ranging from 106 to 1 gene copies gc μl of dna all qpcr amplifications were performed in 20 μl reaction mixtures using ssoadvanced universal probes supermix bio rad laboratories richmond ca ent 23s rrna qpcr mixtures contained 10 μl of supermix 500 nm of forward primer 500 nm of reverse primer 400 nm probe and 3 μl of template dna hf183 lachno3 cpq 056 and cowm2 qpcr mixtures contained 10 μl of supermix 1000 nm of forward

template dna hadv qpcr mixture contained 10 μl of supermix 200 nm of forward primer 200 nm of reverse primer 200 nm probe and 3 μl of template dna dogbact qpcr mixture contained 10 μl of supermix 500 nm of forward primer 500 nm of reverse primer 200 nm probe and 3 μl of template dna hof597 qpcr mixture contained 10 μl of supermix 300 nm of forward primer 300 nm of reverse primer 200 nm probe and 3 μl of template dna gfd qpcr amplifications were performed in 20 μl reaction mixtures using ssoadvanced universal sybr green supermix bio rad laboratories richmond ca gfd mixture contained 10 μl of supermix 100 nm of forward primer 100 nm of reverse primer and 3 μl of template dna to separate the specific product from non specific products including primer dimers a melting curve analysis was performed for each qpcr run during melt curve analysis the temperature was increased from 65 to 95 c at 0 5 c increments melting curve analysis showed a distinct peak at a temperature of 84 0 2 c indicating a positive and correct amplification the qpcr assays were performed using a bio rad cfx96 thermal cycler all qpcr reactions were performed in triplicate for each qpcr run a series of standard 3 106 to 3 gc reaction and no template controls n 3 were included 2 4 qpcr performance characteristics qpcr standards were analyzed to determine the amplification efficiencies e and the correlation coefficient r 2 the reproducibility of the qpcr assays were determined by calculating inter assay reproducibility the qpcr assay s lower limit of detection allod values was determined from cq values of the six separate standard curves run for each assay qpcr allod values were defined as the minimum gc numbers that could be reliably detected over six qpcr standard curve runs for each assay in this study the assay limit of detection allod defined as the minimum copy number with a 95 probability of detection was determined as previously described verbyla et al 2016 2 5 quality control to control possible cross contamination between sampling locations a dna cleaned perspex core was used for sediment sampling a field blank sample consisting of 5 ml of dnase rnase free water was used on each sampling occasion to check for sample cross contamination during sampling and transporting a reagent and extraction blank were included for each batch of dna extraction to ensure no carryover contamination occurred during dna extraction no carryover contamination was observed in reagent blank samples to minimize qpcr contamination dna extraction and qpcr setup were performed in separate laboratories 2 6 data analysis for statistical analysis fib and mst marker genes abundances were log10 transformed correlations were assessed among fib and mst marker genes using binary presence absence data odds ratio or and 95 confidence intervals ci were calculated among fib and mst marker genes for the pooled data set using a chi square test fisher s exact test was used to assess the significance of the ors where an odds ratio 1 with a 95 ci that does not overlap 1 indicates a positive association between two factors an or 1 with a 95 ci that does not overlap 1 indicates a negative association hamilton et al 2017 a chi square test was also used to determine whether a statistically significant relationship existed between microbial targets and cumulative wwos or dwos events in the preceding 6 and 12 weeks a p value of 0 05 was considered significant 3 results 3 1 qpcr performance characteristics and pcr inhibition four qpcr standard curves were analyzed to determine the qpcr performance characteristics for each qpcr assay used in the study the standard curves had a linear range of quantification from 3 106 to 3 gc reaction the range of qpcr efficiency linearity slope y intercept and allod are shown in supplementary table s4 these parameters were within the optimal recommended value as per the miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 the mean coefficient of variation cv values for all assays were 5 the qpcr allod value was 3 gc reaction 2 82 log10 gc g for hf183 lachno3 cpq 056 dogbact and gfd while allod values of pmmov cowm2 and hof597 were 4 5 gc reaction 2 94 3 04 log10 gc g no carryover contamination was observed in method and reagent blank samples dna contamination was monitored using no template controls during the course of the study among the 69 samples tested 3 4 34 samples had pcr inhibition these three samples were diluted with dnase rnase free water which relieved pcr inhibition 3 2 prevalence of fib and mst marker genes in estuarine sediment samples among the ten targets analyzed in the 69 sediment samples the overall prevalence of ent 23s rrna 65 2 45 69 was greater than other targets among the sewage associated marker genes tested the prevalence of cpq 056 63 8 44 69 was the greatest followed by hf183 40 6 28 69 and lachno3 30 4 21 69 the overall incidence of hadv was lower 12 69 17 4 than cpq 056 hf183 and lachno3 while nifh could not be detected in any sediment samples tested in this study the total detection frequency of the ent hf183 lachno3 cpq 056 and hadv were much greater at dp glb hcb and lkb locations compared to cb gb and kb for example hadvs were detected in sediment samples from glb lkb and hcb locations whereas hadv could not be detected in sediment samples from other locations among the four animal feces associated marker genes tested cowm2 and gfd were detected in sediment samples from all seven locations table 3 the detection frequencies of cowm2 marker gene were greater at sediment samples collected from cb and dp locations compared to others gfd marker gene was equally prevalent in all sampling locations the overall prevalence of the gfd marker gene 69 6 48 69 was higher than the cowm2 marker gene 30 4 21 69 dogbact and hof597 could not be detected in any of the sediment samples tested occurrence of the above markers in the 69 tested sediment samples are presented in supplementary table s5 ent could not be detected in 24 of 69 sediment samples however 21 87 5 of those 24 samples were positive for either sewage associated or animal feces associated marker genes among the 69 samples 7 10 1 were positive for at least four sewage associated marker genes 19 27 5 were positive for at least three marker genes 31 44 9 were positive for at least two marker genes and 48 69 6 were positive for at least one sewage associated marker gene of the 69 samples tested 65 94 2 were positive for either one of the sewage associated or animal feces associated marker genes or with 95 confidence intervals analyses were calculated among fib and mst marker genes for all 69 sediment samples positive associations were observed between ent and hf183 lachno3 hadv and cowm2 fig 2 hadv also showed positive associations with hf183 and cpq 056 all these associations were statistically significant and had a p value 0 05 3 3 abundance of fib and mst marker genes in estuarine sediment samples a number of sediment samples 65 69 were positive for the fib and or mst marker genes however not all of them were quantifiable among the 45 pcr positive ent sediment samples 18 40 were quantifiable similarly 12 28 42 9 8 21 38 1 26 44 59 1 and 21 48 43 8 of pcr positive samples were quantifiable for hf183 lachno3 cpq 056 and gfd marker genes respectively none of the hadv pcr positive samples were quantifiable abundance gc g of sediment of fib and mst marker genes at individual sample level is shown in supplementary table s5 the mean abundance of ent in 18 qpcr quantifiable samples was 3 77 0 62 95 ci 3 48 to 4 06 gc g of sediment sample fig 3 the pooled mean concentration 4 38 0 33 95 ci 4 25 to 4 51 gc g of cpq 056 in qpcr quantifiable samples was greater than hf183 4 04 0 16 95 ci 3 95 to 4 13 gc g and lachno3 3 99 0 22 95 ci 3 84 to 4 14 gc g the mean concentrations of gfd in 21 qpcr quantifiable samples was 4 45 0 53 95 ci 4 22 4 68 gc g 4 discussion in this study we analyzed sediment samples from seven estuarine locations for ent and multiple sewage associated and animal feces associated marker genes using qpcr among the microbial targets tested ent 23s rrna marker gene was highly prevalent in sediment samples previous studies reported the presence of culturable or marker gene of ent in marine and freshwater sediments and sands obiri danso and jones 2000 le fevre and lewis 2003 ferguson et al 2005 bradshaw et al 2016 hughes et al 2016 ekwanzala et al 2017 hassard et al 2017 soil sediment environments provide suitable conditions for fib to survive adapt and proliferate jeng et al 2005 ishii and sadowsky 2008 the sources of ent marker gene in the sediment samples could be either fecal or environmental or from a combination of both however the presence of sewage or animal feces associated marker genes in certain sediment samples suggests that ent is likely to be derived from human and or animal feces further speciation and genetic characterization of ent in sediment may provide useful information on their types and potential sources byappanahalli et al 2012 several 28 of 69 40 6 sediment samples were positive for hf183 and the concentrations ranged from 3 87 to 4 38 log10 gc g of wet sediment vadde et al 2019 reported the high abundance of hf183 in sediment samples of tiaoxi river china with a mean concentration of 6 11 log10 gc g which are approximately two to three orders of magnitude greater than this study eichmiller et al 2013 also reported the presence of the hf183 in sand and sediment samples from the lake superior harbor site mn usa continuously receiving wastewater effluent bradshaw et al 2016 documented the presence of hf183 in sediment and overlying water samples in a mixed land use watershed in georgia usa all the above mentioned studies applied analyzed water and sediment samples for a single sewage associated marker gene since the application of a single marker gene such as hf183 has the potential to produce false positive results due to cross reactivity with other animal feces ahmed et al 2019d we also analyzed all sediment samples for four additional sewage associated marker genes i e nifh crassphage cpq 056 lachno3 and hadv ahmed et al 2019e among the sewage associated marker genes tested cpq 056 was highly prevalent 63 8 in sediment samples farkas et al 2019 have reported the presence of cpq 056 with concentrations up to 4 27 log10 gc g of sediment with little variations and a similar abundance mean concentration of 4 38 log10 gc g as reported in this study lachno3 was also detected in sediment samples 21 of 69 30 4 which to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that reports the presence of lachno3 marker gene in estuarine sediment samples hadv was also detected in estuarine sediment samples 12 of 69 17 4 however the frequency of detection was much lower than hf183 lachno3 and cpq 056 detection of hadv did not always align with detection of two or more sewage associated marker genes none of the hadv pcr positive samples were quantifiable the concentrations of the hadv in raw sewage is approximately 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than hf183 cpq 056 and lachno3 hughes et al 2016 therefore in the event of a sewage contamination the abundances of the hf183 cpq 056 and lachno3 in water and sediment samples are likely to be greater than hadv and will be detected more frequently the archaeal marker gene nifh could not be detected in any of the sediment samples tested in this study it is not clear why the nifh marker gene could not be detected it is possible that the abundance of nifh marker gene in untreated sewage is far lower than other marker genes tested in this study and therefore could not be detected the variable detection frequencies of sewage associated marker genes in sediment samples suggest that at least two marker genes should be used simultaneously to avoid false negative results ahmed et al 2019c for example lachno3 marker gene was detected in 21 samples whereas cpq 056 was detected in 44 samples if we would have used only lachno3 marker gene 26 samples would have produced false negative results conversely if we would have used only cpq 056 marker gene three samples would have produced false negative results these marker genes belong to different groups of microorganisms they decay differently in the environment and also their abundances are different in contaminating sources these factors need to be considered when applying these markers for fecal contamination tracking we also determined the association between ent and mst marker genes in sediment samples using or analysis there were higher odds of hf183 lachno3 and hadv occurrence in the presence of ent the occurrence of cpq 056 was not affected in the presence of ent in general sewage associated marker genes exhibited lower odds of occurrence in the presence of each other this could be due to the fact that these marker genes display differential decay rates also their concentrations are variable in sewage and receiving environments at individual sample level several sediment samples were negative for ent but positive for multiple mst marker genes suggesting monitoring ent alone may not be useful to indicate source specific fecal contamination in the sediment environments a previous study also reported that fib concentrations do not necessarily indicate the presence of waterborne pathogens in sediment vadde et al 2019 differential decay rates compared to pathogens and potential growth of ent marker gene in sediment environments limit its utility as a surrogate for pathogens monitoring mst marker genes may provide useful information regarding the microbial quality of sediment and the presence of potential pathogens among the four animal feces associated marker genes cowm2 and gfd were detected in 30 4 and 69 6 of 69 sediment samples respectively cowm2 marker gene could not be quantified in any of the sediment samples in which it was detected a previous study reported similar low occurrences of a different cow marker gene cowm3 in sediment samples in georgia usa bradshaw et al 2016 in this study the source of cowm2 marker gene in sediment samples is not clear as samples were collected from urbanised areas with little agricultural inputs application of cow manure in the adjoining reserve parks or residential gardens may be the source of cowm2 marker gene in sediment samples cowm2 detections at the dp sampling locations may also be from low intensity agriculture practices in the very upper catchment which may have contributed this marker into the sediment samples also cross reactivity of cowm2 marker genes with other animal feces especially sewage or avian cannot be ruled out and warrants further investigation the abundances of the gfd marker gene in sediment samples were high which is not surprising as gfd marker gene represents avian host groups and reported to be found in the feces of duck ibis chicken seagulls goose swan crow tern pelican egret cormorant pigeon coot and sandpiper green et al 2012 ahmed et al 2016b a previous study also reported the presence of the gfd marker in sediment samples in the tiaoxi river china however the frequency of detection was much lower 8 80 than this study 69 6 different study sites and sources of contamination make direct comparison difficult in our recent studies we have reported the high occurrence of the gfd marker genes in estuarine and freshwater samples under both dry and wet weather events ahmed et al 2019a b including at three of the seven urban estuarine locations dp gb and hcb of the current sediment study various avian hosts are present in the studied estuarine sampling locations which are the likely sources of the gfd marker gene in sediment samples our recent water quality study at three of the seven urban estuarine locations in sydney nsw australia also characterized the water column for fib and four sewage associated marker genes ahmed et al 2019b concentrations of e coli were similar during dry and wet weather conditions suggesting animal fecal pollution was contributing to these concentrations in contrast ent concentrations in wet weather samples were much greater than dry weather samples suggesting higher levels of fecal contamination occurring after wwos the occurrence of four sewage associated marker genes hf183 crassphage cpq 056 pmmov and lachno3 supported the ent water column results as they displayed greater i e 3 5 orders of magnitude concentrations in water samples collected during storm events that had recoded gauged wwos compared to urban estuarine water samples collected under dry weather taken together the results from this study suggest human and animal fecal contamination is present in certain estuarine sediment samples collected from various locations adjacent to swimming baths the likely sources of sewage associated marker genes in these samples are wwos and dwos ahmed et al 2019a b we collected total rainfall and wwos dwos gauged occurrence data prior to 12 weeks of sediment sampling in most of the cases sewage marker genes were detected in sampling locations that were subjected to wwos or dwos in the preceding 12 weeks chi square tests indicated significant associations between hf183 lachno3 hadv and cowm2 marker genes with wwos dwos occurrence in the preceding 6 or 12 weeks table 4 while cpq 056 was also significant at the p level 0 1 in the preceding 12 weeks ent and gfd did not show any significant associations with overflow occurrence suggesting sources other than wwos dwos the high abundance of multiple sewage associated marker genes in certain sediment samples from study locations suggests that human health risks from sewage contamination need to be considered and likely to be greater than animal fecal contamination i e avian or cattle in the event of resuspension resuspension could occur through surface runoff increase in the flow of the estuarine waters wave action from strong winds recreational watercraft or by the recreators themselves during recreational activities the presence of sewage associated marker genes in certain sediment samples indicates the potential presence of enteric viruses indeed human enteric virus hadv was detected but not quantifiable in several sediment samples at low frequencies compared to sewage associated marker genes such results suggest that sewage associated marker genes can be used as a proxy for the presence of enteric viruses and a warning sign to indicate potential human health risk people recreating in shallow sediment water interface may be more prone to risk than deep sediment water interface a recent study reported that shoreline water samples had higher average fib concentrations than samples collected from further down the shore line based on a sediment resuspension experiment o mullan et al 2019 in this study sediment samples were collected at different depths across the seven locations from 0 9 m to 5 5 m if resuspension occurs then locations glb hcb kb and lkb will pose increased risk to recreators than locations cb dp and gb no obvious pattern of depth and detection of sewage associated maker genes were apparent table 2 two of the three deepest locations cb 3 6 m and gb 5 5 m had no sewage associated maker genes detected while from the other deepest location of dp 3 9 m there were five detections of two or more sewage associated maker genes a similar level of detection was observed at glb that was about half as deep 1 8 m while at hcb and kb locations that were of a similar depth to glb only a single detection of sewage associated maker genes was observed the most frequent wwo exposure occurred at locations of gb dp and hcb but a corresponding consistent pattern of detection of sewage associated maker genes in sediments was not uniformly evident table 2 in the case of hcb the nearby across main estuarine channel glb location did not have recorded wwos in the 12 weeks preceding each round of sediment sample collection but had five detections of two or more sewage associated maker genes compared to one paired detection at hcb table 2 poor tidal flushing occurs in the hcb and glb section of the sydney estuary as dry weather residence time is 225 days das et al 2000 a more uniform detection of sewage associated maker genes across these two locations would have been expected this may suggest that detection of sewage associated maker genes in samples collected from the water column is a better measure of recent sewage contamination under the water quality study of the urban waterways of sydney the prevalent detection of human associated maker genes was observed in water samples collected immediately after wet weather with abundance and prevalence diminished under dry weather conditions ahmed et al 2019c it has been reported that sands and sediments play an essential role in the survival of culturable fib byappanahalli et al 2012 however the relative health risk presented by pathogens and correlations between fib mst marker genes and pathogens in sand sediment matrices remain mostly unknown khiyama and makemson 1973 o mullan et al 2019 the advantage of mst marker genes is that they are directly linked to human or animal hosts that are contaminating water and sediment environments since the cowm2 marker gene could not be quantified and the dogbact and hof596 marker genes across the seven urban estuarine locations were not detected this also suggests a low human health risk from these animals while a high abundance of gfd marker gene was detected in sediment samples this would require further investigation to understand potential human health risk to recreators in the event of resuspension it has to be noted that qpcr detect signal from both viable and non viable cells moreover lack of mst marker genes decay data in sediment makes it difficult to assess potential risks a recent study reported that sewage associated marker genes might persist in the sediment longer than the water column ahmed et al 2019d more persistence data will be required as the decay of these microorganisms and their dna in sediment may be influenced by several factors such as porosity grain size clay content oxygen conditions reduced predation by protozoans organic carbon etc it is also important to know what fraction of sediment borne mst marker genes are being released into the water due to resuspension it is possible that sediment composition in our study area may be unfavorable to resuspension and would require further investigation such information will help to clarify whether mst marker genes in the sediment environment should be monitored if at all in addition to water samples 5 conclusions the sewage associated marker gene cpq 056 was most prevalent in 63 8 of sediment samples in all 31 44 9 sediment samples were positive for at least two sewage associated marker genes the occurrence of hadv did not always align with the detection of two or more sewage associated marker genes the avian associated marker gene gfd had the highest mean abundance the gfd marker was highly abundant and widely detected in sediment samples from all seven locations in addition the most frequent wet weather overflow exposure occurred at locations that did not have a consistent pattern of detection of the sewage associated marker genes suggesting sediments may not be a suitable measure of recent sewage contamination the public health risk from sewage associated marker genes from sediment resuspension needs to be considered before incorporation of sediments into a monitoring framework however without better characterizing the mst marker genes and their correlations with pathogens in sediment and water column it is challenging to characterize water quality deterioration due to resuspension and

17703,this study aimed to determine the prevalence and abundance of sewage and animal fecal contamination of sediment at seven estuarine locations in sydney nsw australia sediment samples were tested for the occurrence of microbial targets including molecular marker genes of enterococci ent bacteroides hf183 hf183 methanobrevibacter smithii nifh human adenovirus hadv and emerging sewage associated marker genes crassphage cpq 056 and lachnospiraceae lachno3 and animal feces associated marker genes including avian feces associated helicobacter spp gfd canine feces associated bacteroides dogbact cattle feces associated cowm2 and horse feces associated bacteroides hof597 results from this study showed that urban estuarine sediment can act as a reservoir of fecal indicator bacteria fib and several microbial source tracking mst marker genes including previously unreported lachno3 the sewage associated marker gene cpq 056 was most prevalent in 63 8 of sediment samples while the avian associated marker gene gfd had the highest mean abundance the gfd marker gene was highly abundant and widely detected in sediment samples from all seven locations compared to the other animal feces associated marker genes in all 31 44 9 sediment samples were positive for at least two sewage associated marker genes however the non quantifiable detection of the hadv marker gene did not always align with the detection of two or more sewage associated marker genes in addition the most frequent wet weather overflow exposure occurred at locations that did not have a consistent pattern of detection of the sewage associated marker genes suggesting sediments may not be a suitable measure of recent sewage contamination to assist water quality and public health managers better understand past microbial contamination of estuarine sediment further studies seem justified to explore the role of decay of mst marker genes in sediment further work is also needed on the role of resuspension of mst marker genes from sediment during storm events to the water column as a source of contamination for both the gfd and sewage associated marker genes keywords microbial source tracking hf183 crassphage lachno3 gfd cowm2 hadv nifh sewage contamination 1 introduction exposure to surface water contaminated with sewage and animal feces is a cause for concern in terms of human health risks penakalapati et al 2017 the magnitude of fecal contamination in water is typically determined by monitoring fecal indicator bacteria fib namely escherichia coli e coli and enterococci ent coliphages the somatic coliphages which infect e coli host cells through cell wall receptors and the f specific f coliphages which infect e coli cells through f pili rochelle newall et al 2015 ahmed et al 2019a nappier et al 2019 using culture based methods culture based methods are are widely used for fib monitoring by regulatory agencies worldwide sinigalliano et al 2010 a limitation of culture based fib methods is the time required to obtain results up to 48 h which impacts on the ability to make real time management decisions boehm and weisberg 2005 rodrigues and cunha 2017 another limitation is that fib can be viable but non culturable and injured or stressed cells may result in underestimation of their abundance in a water sample darcan et al 2009 an alternative approach is the application of quantitative pcr qpcr assays for the enumeration of fib which has several advantages over culture based methods chern et al 2009 noble et al 2010 quantitative pcr assays eliminate the incubation step by quantifying a specific dna sequence associated with fib from a water sample and can yield results within 4 6 h the usepa national environmental and epidemiological assessment of recreational water neear study reported that qpcr measurements of ent are better predictors of the occurrence of gastrointestinal illness among swimmers at fresh and marine waters wade et al 2006 2008 regardless of the methods used for fib enumeration several studies highlighted the limitations of fib monitoring badgley et al 2011 byappanahalli et al 2012 harwood et al 2014 decay rates of fib in aquatic environments are different to that of pathogens korajkic et al 2019 fib often do not correlate with pathogens numbers in sewage drinking water reservoirs recreational water stormwater and groundwater despite the good correlation between fib numbers and reported gastrointestinal illness in epidemiological studies harwood et al 2005 signor et al 2005 wade et al 2008 ferguson et al 2012 certain strains of fib reported as being present in vegetation soil and sands are known as environmentally adapted strains badgley et al 2011 byappanahalli et al 2012 most importantly fib monitoring alone does not provide information on the contaminating sources harwood et al 2014 without knowing the sources relative pathogen contributions cannot be assigned soller et al 2015 which in turn inhibits an informed understanding of human health risk and the ability to manage risk to human health the application of microbial source tracking mst tools has enabled researchers and regulators to differentiate between the sources of fecal contamination harwood et al 2014 ahmed et al 2016a various mst tools have been developed including database dependent culture and amplicon sequencing methods application of enteric viruses and host associated marker genes analysis harwood et al 2014 however the most widely used mst tools involve the analysis of host associated marker genes using qpcr harwood et al 2014 the benefit of host associated marker gene analysis is that their concentrations in source fecal and wastewater samples are far greater than enteric pathogens and that they are highly host specific stoeckel and harwood 2008 ahmed et al 2016a these tools are currently being applied throughout the world to gain insight into the sources of fecal contamination and to help guide risk management solutions harwood et al 2014 fecal indicator bacteria mst markers and pathogens from water environments can be deposited in sediment and sand by directly settling out from the the water column waves or tides pachepsky and shelton 2011 several studies have reported that sand and sediment are a reservoir for fib jamieson et al 2005 luna et al 2010 badgely et al 2011 fecal indicator bacteria in sediments were reported to be 1000 10 000 fold greater than in the overlying water davies colley et al 2004 bai and lung 2005 when sediment and sand resuspension events occur sediment and sand bound microorganisms can re contaminate the water column drummond et al 2014 o mullan et al 2019 little has been documented on the abundance of mst marker genes in sand and sediment while the presence of bacteroides hf183 and hadv marker gene in freshwater sediments and recreational beach sand has been reported eichmiller et al 2013 hughes et al 2016 farkas et al 2019 little is known regarding the occurrence and quantitative distribution of recently developed marker genes such as crassphage and lachno3 stachler et al 2017 feng et al 2018 an understanding of the dynamics of host associated genetic markers and fib in water and sediment matrices is essential to accurately characterize the level of fecal contamination and associated health risks to inform best management practices to reduce public health impacts a recent study in sydney nsw australia identified sewage contamination in urban estuarine waters ahmed et al 2019b wet weather overflows wwos and dry weather overflows dwos were identified as potential sources of the sewage contamination using hf183 crassphage and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov while information is available on the influence of wwos or dwos on estuarine waters ahmed et al 2019b little is known regarding their influence on estuarine sediments the main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and abundance of sewage and animal fecal contamination of sediment at several estuarine locations in sydney nsw australia the results from this study highlight the role of resuspension potential of mst marker genes from sediment during storm events to the water column as a source of fecal contamination in the study area which needs to be accounted for by the water quality monitoring authorities broadly data presented in this study also highlights the potential increase of microbial contaminants in water column and human health risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment sampling and dna extraction a total of 69 sediment core samples were collected from seven estuarine locations table 1 between december 4 2018 and april 3 2019 during the australian swimming season these sampling locations are situated adjacent to baths used for swimming fig 1 the locations are chowder bay cb davidson park dp gymea bay gb glades bay glb hen and chicken bay hcb kogarah bay kb and lime kiln bay lkb more details on the sampling locations and sediment characteristics are provided in the supplementary tables s1 and s2 samples were collected on two separate occasions for each site from each of the seven locations five sediment samples were randomly collected from a consistent depth using a uwitec core sampler uwitec austria depths between sampling sites varied from 0 9 m to 5 5 m below the mean low water spring mlws tide level table 1 dependant on the variable bathymetry of the estuaries and location of bathing sites this variation in depth resulted from the estuaries of the sydney region being drowned river valleys and selection of sampling locations near designed sewer overflows and designated swimming locations limited the ability to have a single uniform depth across locations under strong wind conditions from a suitable direction waves could generate sediment movement at these depths only four of a planned five samples were collected for hcb during the second sampling occasion surface sediment from the top 0 2 cm of the core was collected and inserted into a pre labelled sterile 50 ml dnase rnase free falcon tube to the 35 ml line to minimize cross contamination in the field sediment was collected from each core using a dnase rnase free sterilised spatula the falcon tubes were sealed placed in a clean rack and transported to the sydney water laboratory in a portable freezer to control possible cross contamination between locations a dna rna cleaned perspex core was used for each sample perspex cores were not reused on a sampling occasion between each sampling occasion all perspex cores were pre soaked in 10 15 bleach for 24 h thoroughly rinsed five times with milli q water and individually wrapped using plastic food cling wrap perspex cores were transported to each sampling location in cling wrap dna was extracted from approximately 7 5 g of wet weight sediment sample using the dneasy powermax soil dna isolation kit qiagen valencia ca according to the manufacturer s instruction with slight modifications cell lysis was enhanced by bead beating the tubes in omni bead ruptor 24 omni international kennesaw ga at 4 m s for 2 cycles of 30 s with 30 s interval between cycles during inhibition removal steps samples were incubated at 2 8 c for 30 min instead of 10 min dna was eluted with 5 ml elution buffer extracted dna concentrations were measured with a qubit fluorometer thermo fisher scientific united kingdom using a qubit double stranded dna high sensitivity assay kit thermo fisher scientific the concentrations of dna in sediment samples ranged from 2 21 to 44 8 ng μl four aliquots of 1 2 ml of dna were stored in a 80 c ultra freezer 2 2 pcr inhibition an experiment was conducted to determine the presence of pcr inhibitors in dna extracted from sediment samples using a sketa22 real time pcr assay haugland et al 2010 ahmed et al 2018 water samples with a 2 cq quantification cycle delay to the reference cq values were considered to have pcr inhibitors staley et al 2012 pcr inhibited samples were subjected to a 10 fold dilution with te buffer and retested with sketa22 real time pcr assay all dna samples were stored at 80 c and subjected to qpcr analysis within 7 days after dna extraction 2 3 qpcr assays previously published qpcr assays were used for the analysis of the ent 23s rrna molecular marker gene of enterococci haugland et al 2010 bacteroides hf183 green et al 2014 lachnospiraceae lachno3 feng et al 2018 methanobrevibacter smithii nifh johnston et al 2010 crassphage cpq 056 stachler et al 2017 human adenovirus hadv heim et al 2003 canine feces associated bacteroides dogbact dick et al 2005 sinigalliano et al 2010 cattle feces associated cowm2 shanks et al 2008 avian feces associated helicobacter spp gfd green et al 2012 and horse feces associated bacteroides hof597 dick et al 2005 marker genes the primers and probes for these qpcr assays are shown in supplementary table s3 along with qpcr cycling parameters for all qpcr assays synthetic dna 4 μg in plasmid cloning vectors or gblocks gene fragments containing 92 bp for ent 23s rrna 132 bp for hf183 187 bp lachno3 152 bp for nifh 125 bp for cpq 056 132 bp for hadv dogbact 251 bp gfd 123 bp cowm2 92 bp and hof597 127 bp were purchased from integrated dna technologies coralville ia usa qpcr standards were prepared from the synthetic dna ranging from 106 to 1 gene copies gc μl of dna all qpcr amplifications were performed in 20 μl reaction mixtures using ssoadvanced universal probes supermix bio rad laboratories richmond ca ent 23s rrna qpcr mixtures contained 10 μl of supermix 500 nm of forward primer 500 nm of reverse primer 400 nm probe and 3 μl of template dna hf183 lachno3 cpq 056 and cowm2 qpcr mixtures contained 10 μl of supermix 1000 nm of forward

template dna hadv qpcr mixture contained 10 μl of supermix 200 nm of forward primer 200 nm of reverse primer 200 nm probe and 3 μl of template dna dogbact qpcr mixture contained 10 μl of supermix 500 nm of forward primer 500 nm of reverse primer 200 nm probe and 3 μl of template dna hof597 qpcr mixture contained 10 μl of supermix 300 nm of forward primer 300 nm of reverse primer 200 nm probe and 3 μl of template dna gfd qpcr amplifications were performed in 20 μl reaction mixtures using ssoadvanced universal sybr green supermix bio rad laboratories richmond ca gfd mixture contained 10 μl of supermix 100 nm of forward primer 100 nm of reverse primer and 3 μl of template dna to separate the specific product from non specific products including primer dimers a melting curve analysis was performed for each qpcr run during melt curve analysis the temperature was increased from 65 to 95 c at 0 5 c increments melting curve analysis showed a distinct peak at a temperature of 84 0 2 c indicating a positive and correct amplification the qpcr assays were performed using a bio rad cfx96 thermal cycler all qpcr reactions were performed in triplicate for each qpcr run a series of standard 3 106 to 3 gc reaction and no template controls n 3 were included 2 4 qpcr performance characteristics qpcr standards were analyzed to determine the amplification efficiencies e and the correlation coefficient r 2 the reproducibility of the qpcr assays were determined by calculating inter assay reproducibility the qpcr assay s lower limit of detection allod values was determined from cq values of the six separate standard curves run for each assay qpcr allod values were defined as the minimum gc numbers that could be reliably detected over six qpcr standard curve runs for each assay in this study the assay limit of detection allod defined as the minimum copy number with a 95 probability of detection was determined as previously described verbyla et al 2016 2 5 quality control to control possible cross contamination between sampling locations a dna cleaned perspex core was used for sediment sampling a field blank sample consisting of 5 ml of dnase rnase free water was used on each sampling occasion to check for sample cross contamination during sampling and transporting a reagent and extraction blank were included for each batch of dna extraction to ensure no carryover contamination occurred during dna extraction no carryover contamination was observed in reagent blank samples to minimize qpcr contamination dna extraction and qpcr setup were performed in separate laboratories 2 6 data analysis for statistical analysis fib and mst marker genes abundances were log10 transformed correlations were assessed among fib and mst marker genes using binary presence absence data odds ratio or and 95 confidence intervals ci were calculated among fib and mst marker genes for the pooled data set using a chi square test fisher s exact test was used to assess the significance of the ors where an odds ratio 1 with a 95 ci that does not overlap 1 indicates a positive association between two factors an or 1 with a 95 ci that does not overlap 1 indicates a negative association hamilton et al 2017 a chi square test was also used to determine whether a statistically significant relationship existed between microbial targets and cumulative wwos or dwos events in the preceding 6 and 12 weeks a p value of 0 05 was considered significant 3 results 3 1 qpcr performance characteristics and pcr inhibition four qpcr standard curves were analyzed to determine the qpcr performance characteristics for each qpcr assay used in the study the standard curves had a linear range of quantification from 3 106 to 3 gc reaction the range of qpcr efficiency linearity slope y intercept and allod are shown in supplementary table s4 these parameters were within the optimal recommended value as per the miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 the mean coefficient of variation cv values for all assays were 5 the qpcr allod value was 3 gc reaction 2 82 log10 gc g for hf183 lachno3 cpq 056 dogbact and gfd while allod values of pmmov cowm2 and hof597 were 4 5 gc reaction 2 94 3 04 log10 gc g no carryover contamination was observed in method and reagent blank samples dna contamination was monitored using no template controls during the course of the study among the 69 samples tested 3 4 34 samples had pcr inhibition these three samples were diluted with dnase rnase free water which relieved pcr inhibition 3 2 prevalence of fib and mst marker genes in estuarine sediment samples among the ten targets analyzed in the 69 sediment samples the overall prevalence of ent 23s rrna 65 2 45 69 was greater than other targets among the sewage associated marker genes tested the prevalence of cpq 056 63 8 44 69 was the greatest followed by hf183 40 6 28 69 and lachno3 30 4 21 69 the overall incidence of hadv was lower 12 69 17 4 than cpq 056 hf183 and lachno3 while nifh could not be detected in any sediment samples tested in this study the total detection frequency of the ent hf183 lachno3 cpq 056 and hadv were much greater at dp glb hcb and lkb locations compared to cb gb and kb for example hadvs were detected in sediment samples from glb lkb and hcb locations whereas hadv could not be detected in sediment samples from other locations among the four animal feces associated marker genes tested cowm2 and gfd were detected in sediment samples from all seven locations table 3 the detection frequencies of cowm2 marker gene were greater at sediment samples collected from cb and dp locations compared to others gfd marker gene was equally prevalent in all sampling locations the overall prevalence of the gfd marker gene 69 6 48 69 was higher than the cowm2 marker gene 30 4 21 69 dogbact and hof597 could not be detected in any of the sediment samples tested occurrence of the above markers in the 69 tested sediment samples are presented in supplementary table s5 ent could not be detected in 24 of 69 sediment samples however 21 87 5 of those 24 samples were positive for either sewage associated or animal feces associated marker genes among the 69 samples 7 10 1 were positive for at least four sewage associated marker genes 19 27 5 were positive for at least three marker genes 31 44 9 were positive for at least two marker genes and 48 69 6 were positive for at least one sewage associated marker gene of the 69 samples tested 65 94 2 were positive for either one of the sewage associated or animal feces associated marker genes or with 95 confidence intervals analyses were calculated among fib and mst marker genes for all 69 sediment samples positive associations were observed between ent and hf183 lachno3 hadv and cowm2 fig 2 hadv also showed positive associations with hf183 and cpq 056 all these associations were statistically significant and had a p value 0 05 3 3 abundance of fib and mst marker genes in estuarine sediment samples a number of sediment samples 65 69 were positive for the fib and or mst marker genes however not all of them were quantifiable among the 45 pcr positive ent sediment samples 18 40 were quantifiable similarly 12 28 42 9 8 21 38 1 26 44 59 1 and 21 48 43 8 of pcr positive samples were quantifiable for hf183 lachno3 cpq 056 and gfd marker genes respectively none of the hadv pcr positive samples were quantifiable abundance gc g of sediment of fib and mst marker genes at individual sample level is shown in supplementary table s5 the mean abundance of ent in 18 qpcr quantifiable samples was 3 77 0 62 95 ci 3 48 to 4 06 gc g of sediment sample fig 3 the pooled mean concentration 4 38 0 33 95 ci 4 25 to 4 51 gc g of cpq 056 in qpcr quantifiable samples was greater than hf183 4 04 0 16 95 ci 3 95 to 4 13 gc g and lachno3 3 99 0 22 95 ci 3 84 to 4 14 gc g the mean concentrations of gfd in 21 qpcr quantifiable samples was 4 45 0 53 95 ci 4 22 4 68 gc g 4 discussion in this study we analyzed sediment samples from seven estuarine locations for ent and multiple sewage associated and animal feces associated marker genes using qpcr among the microbial targets tested ent 23s rrna marker gene was highly prevalent in sediment samples previous studies reported the presence of culturable or marker gene of ent in marine and freshwater sediments and sands obiri danso and jones 2000 le fevre and lewis 2003 ferguson et al 2005 bradshaw et al 2016 hughes et al 2016 ekwanzala et al 2017 hassard et al 2017 soil sediment environments provide suitable conditions for fib to survive adapt and proliferate jeng et al 2005 ishii and sadowsky 2008 the sources of ent marker gene in the sediment samples could be either fecal or environmental or from a combination of both however the presence of sewage or animal feces associated marker genes in certain sediment samples suggests that ent is likely to be derived from human and or animal feces further speciation and genetic characterization of ent in sediment may provide useful information on their types and potential sources byappanahalli et al 2012 several 28 of 69 40 6 sediment samples were positive for hf183 and the concentrations ranged from 3 87 to 4 38 log10 gc g of wet sediment vadde et al 2019 reported the high abundance of hf183 in sediment samples of tiaoxi river china with a mean concentration of 6 11 log10 gc g which are approximately two to three orders of magnitude greater than this study eichmiller et al 2013 also reported the presence of the hf183 in sand and sediment samples from the lake superior harbor site mn usa continuously receiving wastewater effluent bradshaw et al 2016 documented the presence of hf183 in sediment and overlying water samples in a mixed land use watershed in georgia usa all the above mentioned studies applied analyzed water and sediment samples for a single sewage associated marker gene since the application of a single marker gene such as hf183 has the potential to produce false positive results due to cross reactivity with other animal feces ahmed et al 2019d we also analyzed all sediment samples for four additional sewage associated marker genes i e nifh crassphage cpq 056 lachno3 and hadv ahmed et al 2019e among the sewage associated marker genes tested cpq 056 was highly prevalent 63 8 in sediment samples farkas et al 2019 have reported the presence of cpq 056 with concentrations up to 4 27 log10 gc g of sediment with little variations and a similar abundance mean concentration of 4 38 log10 gc g as reported in this study lachno3 was also detected in sediment samples 21 of 69 30 4 which to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that reports the presence of lachno3 marker gene in estuarine sediment samples hadv was also detected in estuarine sediment samples 12 of 69 17 4 however the frequency of detection was much lower than hf183 lachno3 and cpq 056 detection of hadv did not always align with detection of two or more sewage associated marker genes none of the hadv pcr positive samples were quantifiable the concentrations of the hadv in raw sewage is approximately 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than hf183 cpq 056 and lachno3 hughes et al 2016 therefore in the event of a sewage contamination the abundances of the hf183 cpq 056 and lachno3 in water and sediment samples are likely to be greater than hadv and will be detected more frequently the archaeal marker gene nifh could not be detected in any of the sediment samples tested in this study it is not clear why the nifh marker gene could not be detected it is possible that the abundance of nifh marker gene in untreated sewage is far lower than other marker genes tested in this study and therefore could not be detected the variable detection frequencies of sewage associated marker genes in sediment samples suggest that at least two marker genes should be used simultaneously to avoid false negative results ahmed et al 2019c for example lachno3 marker gene was detected in 21 samples whereas cpq 056 was detected in 44 samples if we would have used only lachno3 marker gene 26 samples would have produced false negative results conversely if we would have used only cpq 056 marker gene three samples would have produced false negative results these marker genes belong to different groups of microorganisms they decay differently in the environment and also their abundances are different in contaminating sources these factors need to be considered when applying these markers for fecal contamination tracking we also determined the association between ent and mst marker genes in sediment samples using or analysis there were higher odds of hf183 lachno3 and hadv occurrence in the presence of ent the occurrence of cpq 056 was not affected in the presence of ent in general sewage associated marker genes exhibited lower odds of occurrence in the presence of each other this could be due to the fact that these marker genes display differential decay rates also their concentrations are variable in sewage and receiving environments at individual sample level several sediment samples were negative for ent but positive for multiple mst marker genes suggesting monitoring ent alone may not be useful to indicate source specific fecal contamination in the sediment environments a previous study also reported that fib concentrations do not necessarily indicate the presence of waterborne pathogens in sediment vadde et al 2019 differential decay rates compared to pathogens and potential growth of ent marker gene in sediment environments limit its utility as a surrogate for pathogens monitoring mst marker genes may provide useful information regarding the microbial quality of sediment and the presence of potential pathogens among the four animal feces associated marker genes cowm2 and gfd were detected in 30 4 and 69 6 of 69 sediment samples respectively cowm2 marker gene could not be quantified in any of the sediment samples in which it was detected a previous study reported similar low occurrences of a different cow marker gene cowm3 in sediment samples in georgia usa bradshaw et al 2016 in this study the source of cowm2 marker gene in sediment samples is not clear as samples were collected from urbanised areas with little agricultural inputs application of cow manure in the adjoining reserve parks or residential gardens may be the source of cowm2 marker gene in sediment samples cowm2 detections at the dp sampling locations may also be from low intensity agriculture practices in the very upper catchment which may have contributed this marker into the sediment samples also cross reactivity of cowm2 marker genes with other animal feces especially sewage or avian cannot be ruled out and warrants further investigation the abundances of the gfd marker gene in sediment samples were high which is not surprising as gfd marker gene represents avian host groups and reported to be found in the feces of duck ibis chicken seagulls goose swan crow tern pelican egret cormorant pigeon coot and sandpiper green et al 2012 ahmed et al 2016b a previous study also reported the presence of the gfd marker in sediment samples in the tiaoxi river china however the frequency of detection was much lower 8 80 than this study 69 6 different study sites and sources of contamination make direct comparison difficult in our recent studies we have reported the high occurrence of the gfd marker genes in estuarine and freshwater samples under both dry and wet weather events ahmed et al 2019a b including at three of the seven urban estuarine locations dp gb and hcb of the current sediment study various avian hosts are present in the studied estuarine sampling locations which are the likely sources of the gfd marker gene in sediment samples our recent water quality study at three of the seven urban estuarine locations in sydney nsw australia also characterized the water column for fib and four sewage associated marker genes ahmed et al 2019b concentrations of e coli were similar during dry and wet weather conditions suggesting animal fecal pollution was contributing to these concentrations in contrast ent concentrations in wet weather samples were much greater than dry weather samples suggesting higher levels of fecal contamination occurring after wwos the occurrence of four sewage associated marker genes hf183 crassphage cpq 056 pmmov and lachno3 supported the ent water column results as they displayed greater i e 3 5 orders of magnitude concentrations in water samples collected during storm events that had recoded gauged wwos compared to urban estuarine water samples collected under dry weather taken together the results from this study suggest human and animal fecal contamination is present in certain estuarine sediment samples collected from various locations adjacent to swimming baths the likely sources of sewage associated marker genes in these samples are wwos and dwos ahmed et al 2019a b we collected total rainfall and wwos dwos gauged occurrence data prior to 12 weeks of sediment sampling in most of the cases sewage marker genes were detected in sampling locations that were subjected to wwos or dwos in the preceding 12 weeks chi square tests indicated significant associations between hf183 lachno3 hadv and cowm2 marker genes with wwos dwos occurrence in the preceding 6 or 12 weeks table 4 while cpq 056 was also significant at the p level 0 1 in the preceding 12 weeks ent and gfd did not show any significant associations with overflow occurrence suggesting sources other than wwos dwos the high abundance of multiple sewage associated marker genes in certain sediment samples from study locations suggests that human health risks from sewage contamination need to be considered and likely to be greater than animal fecal contamination i e avian or cattle in the event of resuspension resuspension could occur through surface runoff increase in the flow of the estuarine waters wave action from strong winds recreational watercraft or by the recreators themselves during recreational activities the presence of sewage associated marker genes in certain sediment samples indicates the potential presence of enteric viruses indeed human enteric virus hadv was detected but not quantifiable in several sediment samples at low frequencies compared to sewage associated marker genes such results suggest that sewage associated marker genes can be used as a proxy for the presence of enteric viruses and a warning sign to indicate potential human health risk people recreating in shallow sediment water interface may be more prone to risk than deep sediment water interface a recent study reported that shoreline water samples had higher average fib concentrations than samples collected from further down the shore line based on a sediment resuspension experiment o mullan et al 2019 in this study sediment samples were collected at different depths across the seven locations from 0 9 m to 5 5 m if resuspension occurs then locations glb hcb kb and lkb will pose increased risk to recreators than locations cb dp and gb no obvious pattern of depth and detection of sewage associated maker genes were apparent table 2 two of the three deepest locations cb 3 6 m and gb 5 5 m had no sewage associated maker genes detected while from the other deepest location of dp 3 9 m there were five detections of two or more sewage associated maker genes a similar level of detection was observed at glb that was about half as deep 1 8 m while at hcb and kb locations that were of a similar depth to glb only a single detection of sewage associated maker genes was observed the most frequent wwo exposure occurred at locations of gb dp and hcb but a corresponding consistent pattern of detection of sewage associated maker genes in sediments was not uniformly evident table 2 in the case of hcb the nearby across main estuarine channel glb location did not have recorded wwos in the 12 weeks preceding each round of sediment sample collection but had five detections of two or more sewage associated maker genes compared to one paired detection at hcb table 2 poor tidal flushing occurs in the hcb and glb section of the sydney estuary as dry weather residence time is 225 days das et al 2000 a more uniform detection of sewage associated maker genes across these two locations would have been expected this may suggest that detection of sewage associated maker genes in samples collected from the water column is a better measure of recent sewage contamination under the water quality study of the urban waterways of sydney the prevalent detection of human associated maker genes was observed in water samples collected immediately after wet weather with abundance and prevalence diminished under dry weather conditions ahmed et al 2019c it has been reported that sands and sediments play an essential role in the survival of culturable fib byappanahalli et al 2012 however the relative health risk presented by pathogens and correlations between fib mst marker genes and pathogens in sand sediment matrices remain mostly unknown khiyama and makemson 1973 o mullan et al 2019 the advantage of mst marker genes is that they are directly linked to human or animal hosts that are contaminating water and sediment environments since the cowm2 marker gene could not be quantified and the dogbact and hof596 marker genes across the seven urban estuarine locations were not detected this also suggests a low human health risk from these animals while a high abundance of gfd marker gene was detected in sediment samples this would require further investigation to understand potential human health risk to recreators in the event of resuspension it has to be noted that qpcr detect signal from both viable and non viable cells moreover lack of mst marker genes decay data in sediment makes it difficult to assess potential risks a recent study reported that sewage associated marker genes might persist in the sediment longer than the water column ahmed et al 2019d more persistence data will be required as the decay of these microorganisms and their dna in sediment may be influenced by several factors such as porosity grain size clay content oxygen conditions reduced predation by protozoans organic carbon etc it is also important to know what fraction of sediment borne mst marker genes are being released into the water due to resuspension it is possible that sediment composition in our study area may be unfavorable to resuspension and would require further investigation such information will help to clarify whether mst marker genes in the sediment environment should be monitored if at all in addition to water samples 5 conclusions the sewage associated marker gene cpq 056 was most prevalent in 63 8 of sediment samples in all 31 44 9 sediment samples were positive for at least two sewage associated marker genes the occurrence of hadv did not always align with the detection of two or more sewage associated marker genes the avian associated marker gene gfd had the highest mean abundance the gfd marker was highly abundant and widely detected in sediment samples from all seven locations in addition the most frequent wet weather overflow exposure occurred at locations that did not have a consistent pattern of detection of the sewage associated marker genes suggesting sediments may not be a suitable measure of recent sewage contamination the public health risk from sewage associated marker genes from sediment resuspension needs to be considered before incorporation of sediments into a monitoring framework however without better characterizing the mst marker genes and their correlations with pathogens in sediment and water column it is challenging to characterize water quality deterioration due to resuspension and

17704,despite the existence of significant knowedge on complex mechanisms of thm formation a simple kinetic model to predict thm species concentration is not available hindering application of knowlwdge for regulatory monitoring and operational control the parallel second order reaction 2r model containing fast and slow reactants has been well established to describe the chlorine decay

each thm species is formed at a fixed yield µg thm species mg productive chlorine consumption the model concept is tested on 15 water samples that contain a wide range of dissolved organic carbon

chlorine is the most frequently used disinfectant in water supply systems despite its many advantages the formation of chlorinated disinfection by products dbps is a major health problem amongst the known dbps trihalomethanes thms are the most often regulated compounds the thms are a group of compounds produced by substituting three hydrogen atoms in methane with halides cl br or i the species that occur in higher concentrations are chloroform chcl3 bromodichloromethane chbrcl2 dibromochloromethane chbr2cl and bromoform chbr3 although the concentration of total thms tthm has been most often regulated some agencies such as the us environmental protection agency health canada and world health organisation regulate or recommend monitoring individual thm species as some brominated species are more toxic echigo et al 2004 wagner and plewa 2017 than their chlorinated counterparts environmental protection agency epa 2010 health canada 2006 world health organization who 2017 the measurement of thms is expensive 50 100 aud per sample and requires specialist skills and relatively expensive instrumentation hence regional water utilities in developed countries and utilities in many developing countries often do not measure thms in their systems due to either lack of facilities or high cost accurate dbp models which link dbp concentrations to easily measurable water quality parameters such as chlorine dissolved organic carbon doc or uv absorbence offer substantial advantages in regulating dbps e g they can reduce the cost of monitoring in places where skills and measurement facilities are limited providing a prediction rather than a post event measurement and reducing the frequency of measurement are possible alternatives a species level model can demonstrate the importance of a specific key water quality parameter that could should be controlled at the water treatment plant to satisfy regulatory requirements at customers taps and could help to identify the key mechanisms in operation in a water supply system network it can also aid in determining the impact of many reactions e g with wall material biofilm or loose deposits designers and operators of drinking water supply systems can thus employ these models as a decision making tool furthermore regulatory agencies can utilise the models to verify the status of a water supply system chowdhury et al 2009 and any anomaly or loss of integrity can also be easily identified natural organic matter nom is the major precursor of thms reckhow et al 1990 rook 1977 in view of the heterogeneity and widespread sources of nom derrien et al 2019 these organic compounds can react with chlorine and bromine if there is bromide present to form a variety of dbps including thms hua and reckhow 2008 via complex pathways deborde and von gunten 2008 that makes it difficult to identify the specific organic components of nom e g humic substances fulvic acids or the reactions that contribute to thm production amongst the phenolic structures identified in humic substances phenol and resorcinol have been considered as the slow and fast reacting precursors of thm respectively gallard and von gunten 2002b reckhow 2011 von gunten 2018 this implies that the prediction of dbps is still in its infancy and an alternate way of analysing the data is needed von gunten 2018 two approaches are adopted to predict thms in a given water thm formation potential thmfp or tthm concentration in the water at any given time of reaction with chlorine thmfp characterises the water with one maximum value of tthm concentration generated under a single set of standard conditions and various correlations are derived to understand the link between the characteristics of nom and thmfp golea et al 2017 to achieve efficient distribution system design operation and regulation the concentrations of thm species need to be predicted at any given time and temperature across the whole system because of the complex nature of nom and reaction variables two types of models empirical and semi mechanistic are available to predict thm concentrations at any given time there are two types of empirical models water specific and generic the water specific empirical models often predict the thm concentrations well as they are trained to the data set of the same water ged et al 2015 based on independent evaluations of 118 generic empirical models ged et al 2015 found that even the best predictive empirical models have significant errors the standard error se and r2 for tthm predictions were in the range 68 8 76 8 µg l and 0 757 0 852 respectively the chloroform model had se and r2 of 14 4 µg l and 0 95 respectively no dibromochloroform model has ever attained se 35 µg l the semi mechanistic model links chlorine decay and tthm formation kinetics compared to empirical models mechanistic model has the capability to reveal fundamental mechanisms although they are still water specific clark and sivaganesan 1998 demonstrated that the production rate of tthm concentrations is linearly related to the consumption rate of chlorine in a given water several authors boccelli et al 2003 dickenson 2005 fisher et al 2004 gallard and von gunten 2002a gang et al 2003 have thereafter confirmed this relationship and were able to accurately describe tthm concentrations this description has two issues it does not account for the initial chlorine consumption that does not form thm and it does not describe thm species concentrations it is well known that unproductive chlorine demand chlorine consumption without tthm formation occurs within the first few hours of chlorine dosing by inorganic ions such as nh4 fe2 or by chlorine substitution reactions of larger organic molecules such as polyphenols gunten and gallard 2002b however it is not known how to account for this demand in formulating tthm models researchers gallard and gunten 2002a b either avoided the first few hours or neglected the initial reaction and modelled the whole reaction with the same linearity clark and sivaganesan 1998 fisher et al 2004 the prediction of concentrations of tthm or thm species from the time of chlorine dosing did not succeed dickenson 2005 if thm species concentrations are to be predicted from the beginning of chlorine dosing the unproductive chlorine demand should be taken into account systematically in the model to link thm species formation to chlorine accurately a model that accurately describes chlorine decay kinetics is needed fisher et al 2011 comprehensively evaluated the applicability of many existing models for distribution systems and showed that one of the alternatives of kastl et al 1999 termed the 2r model two reactant parallel second order model was the most suitable most importantly their model fisher et al 2012 2017a fisher et al 2015 describes chlorine kinetics from the time of chlorine dosing and hence can facilitate incorporation of initial unproductive chlorine demand with the availability of the accurate chlorine decay models fisher et al 2017a and the epanet msx engine fisher et al 2018 analysis of a water supply system for dbps will become feasible if accurate models are available to predict thm species concentrations from the time of chlorine dosing to the best of our knowledge there is no simple kinetic model that can accurately predict thm species concentrations in wide ranging conditions from the time of chlorine dosing despite the existence of significant knowledge of factors affecting the formation of thm species such a model should systematically incorporate the unproductive chlorine demand that occurs within the initial period and should predict thm species concentrations accurately the objective of the current study is to develop a simple kinetic model to predict individual thm species concentrations from the time the chlorine is dosed the model is rigorously tested using our own and independent data sets of 15 different water samples sourced from two states in australia and nine states in the usa once the concept of the model is verified by fitting it to all data the model is reconstructed using minimum data and the predictive capability of the model is demonstrated 2 model development to develop the thm species model free chlorine is assumed to be the primary driver of dbp production provided the reactive sites on nom are available the reaction kinetics of chlorine with water constituents in a water distribution system follows a parallel second order relationship with two notional reactants slow and fast reacting agents fisher et al 2017a the model conceptually calculates the concentration and reaction rates of these agents with the assumption that both reactants fras and sras react with chlorine and produce oxidised and non reactive compounds referred to as nras 1 f r a c l 2 k f n r a c l 2 s r a c l 2 k s n r a c l the forgoing assumption may not be correct because a part of what is defined as sra may be a compound resulting from the reaction of fra with chlorine and some of the oxidation products of the sra reaction may become a new reactant adding to the pool of sra for practical applications simplicity is important it has been shown that the model can describe chlorine concentrations accurately in different waters and various operational scenarios fisher et al 2017a hence the 2r chlorine decay model is adopted it follows 3 d c c l d t k f c f c c l k s c s c c l where cs and cf are respectively the notional concentrations of fras and sras at time t h expressed as mg cl2 equivalent l ccl is the concentration of chlorine at time t in mg cl2 l kf and ks are respectively the reaction rates in l mg h of fras and sras the formation of thms or any other dbps in water containing nom and bromide involves a series of reactions that fundamentally includes four mechanisms langsa et al 2017 bromide is oxidised to hobr by dosed chlorine hocl within the first few minutes both hocl and hobr are involved in electrophilic substitution of bromide onto nom forming brominated and chlorinated organics org br and org cl respectively the oxidation of nom by hobr releases bromide back into the solution that may be oxidised again to hobr if there is chlorine the formed org br and org cl react with the remaining hocl or hobr to form org br cl or org cl br it is possible that the hydrolysis of halogenated organic compounds of larger molecular weight may result in the production of regulated dbps e g thms and haloacetic acids it is well known that not all chlorine that reacts with nom will directly produce thms but as explained in the introduction this has not been systematically incorporated in dbp formation models inorganic compounds e g ammonia nitrite and ferrous ion can consume considerable amounts of chlorine within the first few minutes thereby contributing to fras but not forming thms as a typical practice in chlorinated water supply systems ammonia is made to react with the excess chlorine cl2 n molar ratio 1 and chlorine undergoes breakpoint chlorination jafvert and valentine 1992 in the absence of nom the amount of chlorine required to breakpoint chlorinate is 1 75 mol cl2 mole nh3 accordingly only a part of the chlorine or bromine if bromide is present reacts with nom and produces dbps including thms in parallel gallard and von gunten 2002a hypothesised that resorcinol may be involved in the initial production of thms without consuming much chlorine therefore some thms could still be produced during breakpoint chlorination some structures such as phenol consume chlorine within the fast reacting stage but do not produce thms irrespective of the compound mechanism some chlorine has to be consumed before thms appear in the water and has to be incorporated within thm formation modelling it follows that there are two fras one that produces thms while the other does not 4 f r a t h m c l 2 k f n r a c l α t t h m t t h m 5 f r a o t h c l 2 k f n r a c l where frathm and fraoth are fras that produce and that do not produce thms respectively it is assumed that the stoichiometric coefficient for tthm is αtthm µmol mmol or µg mg depending on how tthm and chlorine demand are expressed hereafter the stoichiometric coefficient is referred to as yield the fraction and concentration of fraoth are denoted as roth and c f oth 0 respectively 6 r o t h c f o t h 0 c f 0 where cf 0 is the initial fra concentration mg cl2 l if the frathm concentration at time t h is defined as c f thm then the initial concentration is c f thm 0 7 c f t h m 0 c f 0 c f o t h 0 if sra are also assumed to produce thms with the same stoichiometry yield then it is expressed as follows 8 s r a c l 2 k s n r a c l α t t h m t t h m therefore the following relationship can be written 9 d c t t h m d t α t t h m k f c f t h m c c l k s c s c c l to develop the species level model some observations on literature data are noted amongst all reliable profiles reported in the literature hua and reckhow 2012 dickenson 2005 mcclellan 2000 thm species concentrations increase in the presence of chlorine this implies that the thm species are either the end products the production rate of each species is faster than the consumption or conversion to other dbps rates throughout the reaction or other instances have not been encountered in practice it could also be possible changes are occurring but is not significant enough to impact the observed profiles within the reaction time of interest 120 h for example it is obvious that when bromide has all been incorporated into organic matter and only chlorine is available to react then the proportion of chlorinated thm species could increase but the significance of such change needs verification further the linearity of tthm production rate with chlorine consumption rate eq 9 has been proven to hold irrespective of how molar or mass basis the tthm concentration is expressed clarke and sivaganesan 1998 gallard and gunten 2002a although no author has thus far established that both mass and molar yields with respect to chlorine remain constant in a given water sample of varying reaction conditions and water quality it is assumed that this is true in order to develop the model thereafter it is verified it therefore mathematically follows that thm species should form largely in proportion and each species has its own yield although this should be verified by testing the concept in many waters 10 f r a t h m c l 2 k f n r a c l α c f m c f m α d c b d c

roth as well as initial concentrations of fast cf 0 and slow cs 0 reacting agents requires simulation in aquasim excel using an analytical solution jabari kohpaei and sathasivan 2011 or any other

relationships 13 c t t h m α t t h m c c l 0 c f o t h 0 c l c l c t t h m 0 where c cl 0 is the initial concentration of chlorine in most cases the initial chlorine is the dose in some cases the water may already contain chlorine before primary chlorination in such instances c cl 0 represents the sum of chlorine before dosing and the primary chlorine dose ctthm 0 is the concentration of tthm before primary chlorination this can also be re arranged as follows 14 c t t h m α t t h m c c l o c l c l α t t h m c f o t h 0 c t t h m 0 a plot of ctthm on the y axis and the consumed chlorine c c

concentration of individual thm species eq 14 can be rewritten by replacing the subscripts tthm with cfm dcb dbc or bfm 3 materials and methods data sets derived from raw and treated water samples were selected to provide a wide range of conditions these water samples originate from nine states in the us and two in australia table 1 when the bromide variation was insufficient to cause a wide variation in the distribution of brominated thm species the data sets in which bromide was added to achieve a low chlorine bromide ratio were selected 3 1 data extraction from archived theses to comprehensively test the model and assumptions data describing both short term and long term behaviour from dickenson 2005 were included the total test time varied between 72 and 2664 h table 1 thus providing a good representation of behaviour in the extended chlorine decay tests this thesis also provided sufficient short term measurements 0 5 1 3 5 min etc for many of the samples sometimes only the concentration of thm species or chlorine was measured at a reaction time when that occurred the chlorine or thms concentration at that point was estimated by linear interpolation the estimated chlorine was only used for plotting linear regression lines and manually calculating the yield for the purpose of model fitting in aquasim section 3 6 the original data were used 3 2 analytical methods the extracted data originate from three different sources dickenson 2005 gunasekera 2018 mcclellan 2000 hence the methods are only briefly described here as the details can be found in the original source gunasekera 2018 measured chlorine concentration using the dpd colorimetric method and dickenson 2005 employed the iodometric method and ferrous titrimetric methods for high and low chlorine concentrations mcclellan 2000 also used the ferrous titrimetric method for all his measurements gunasekera 2018 determined the doc concentration of samples using the shimadzu total organic carbon toc analyser toc lcph cpn ssm 5000a whereas dickenson 2005 employed the sievers 800 toc analyser gunasekera 2018 measured the uv absorption at a 254 nm wavelength using cary 60 ultraviolet and visible uv vis spectroscopy whereas dickenson 2005 employed the hach dr 4000 spectrophotometer dickenson 2005 and gunasekera 2018 measured the background bromide concentration of the samples by ion chromatography dionex for thm analysis dickenson 2005 and mcclellan 2000 followed the epa 551 1 method but gunasekera 2018 used the laboratory in sydney water corporation which followed the epa 5021a method all the samples were quenched using aqueous na2s2o3 solution by gunasekera 2018 but mcclellan 2000 and dickenson 2005 used ammonium chloride agilent 6890 gas chromatography system with gc µecd detector was used by dickenson 2005 but mcclellan 2000 used hewlett packard gc ecd sydney water corporation adopted the headspace extraction followed by agilent gc ms 3 3 coagulation tests dickenson 2005 carried out enhanced coagulation in a large 40 l tank after determining the appropriate alum dose in a laboratory jar tester rapid mixing was at 100 rpm followed by flocculation at 30 and 10 rpm each for 15 min to separate the flocs sedimentation was carried out for at least five hours followed by cartridge filtration the filtered samples were preserved at 4 c 3 4 chlorine decay tests dickenson 2005 and mcclellan 2000 followed a similar chlorine decay test procedure chlorination tests were carried out in headspace free amber glass bottles water was first placed in a larger amber glass bottle and an appropriate amount of a chlorine stock solution was dosed after 30 s this water was dispensed into smaller amber bottles such that the headspace was eliminated for achieving ph 8 dickenson 2005 used a borate buffer to achieve a final concentration of 4 mm mcclellan 2000 conducted the tests at ph 7 5 gunasekera 2018 carried out the tests in pte bottles in the dark with an initial concentration of chlorine between 5 9 and 8 3 mg cl2 l depending on the initial doc concentration the ph was adjusted to 7 5 0 1 with 1 m hcl and naoh these bottles were rendered chlorine demand free by soaking for 24 h in 10 mg cl2 l solution overnight and rinsing with milliq water immediately after dosing chlorine sample bottles headspace free were closed tightly and incubated at 23 c to ensure an accurately measured dose the same amount of chlorine was dosed into millq water of the same volume of water and chlorine was measured at each desired reaction time sample bottles were analysed for chlorine and thm concentrations 3 5 calculations including linear regression and statistical analysis eq 9 implies that the slope of a scatter plot of tthm or thm species in mass basis µg l or molar basis µm vs consumed chlorine mg cl2 l or mm cl2 provides the yield estimate the goodness of fit r2 and se to a linear relationship was calculated using the linear regression linest function in excel the regression estimates the slope the yield and y intercept the regression also estimates se of the yield and constant the unproductive chlorine consumption x intercept can be calculated from dividing the y intercept by the yield eq 14 3 6 simulation of chlorine and thm species in aquasim aquasim software reichert 1994 1998 was used to estimate the optimal parameter values that allow the model to best describe chlorine decay and thm formation data in all fifteen water samples these optimal values were derived by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the measured and predicted concentrations at corresponding points in two stages first the measured chlorine concentrations were used to estimate the optimal parameter values for the chlorine decay model these parameters are initial concentrations of fast cf 0 and slow reacting agents cs 0 and the rate constants kf and ks then the predicted chlorine concentrations for each water were used to estimate the parameters for the thm species formation model the estimated parameters are αcfm αdcb αdbc αbfm and roth the software uses the simplex technique or the secant method to minimize the sum of squared differences there are no constraints placed on the parameter values except for non negativity the actual initial chlorine concentrations listed in table 1 and thm species concentrations were set during the parameter optimization procedure the initial thm species concentration were set to zero when no data were available or when raw waters were chlorinated 4 results and discussion 4 1 water quality characteristics of chosen water samples the characteristics and concentrations of nom bromide concentration chlorine dose or cl2 br ratio reaction time ph and temperature can determine the concentrations of thm species when analysed at the end of reaction time chang et al 2001 roccaro et al 2014 the tests included in this study are conducted at an incubation temperature of 15 23 c and a practical ph range of 7 2 8 1 table 1 the analyses of 15 water samples table 2 show that the doc suva and initial bromide concentration widely vary doc 1 43 9 88 mg l suva 1 522 5 843 l mg m bromide 14 187 µg l ammonia was measured in nine samples with a concentration of 0 3 mg n l for demonstrating the model of thm species that occur in various relative fractions natural bromide variation is insufficient the data were therefore selected from bromide added cases of nepean neprw wyong wyorw and colorado river water colrw and colrw2 to attain a cl2 br ratio as low as 5 table 2 4 2 behaviour of tthm molar and mass concentrations with respect to consumed chlorine concentration the behaviour of molar and mass yields are summarised in table 3 and one sample is discussed in detail as an example when the tthm concentration is plotted against the consumed chlorine on a mass or molar basis for water from tampa florida tamcw fig 1 several observations can be made first the data points in both molar and mass plots fig 1a and b are distributed along two strongly correlated lines representing short 0 25 h r2 0 962 and long term 0 25 h r2 0 9976 behaviour this implies that each thm species has its own species yield that the results exhibit a strong linear relationship for each species validates the assumption of the model concept the separation time varies amongst different samples table 3 but was always 0 5 h in certain samples the long term yield line starts from the first measurement point these water samples are marked as n a as the separation time cannot be identified clearly second the short term mass and molar yields are approximately one half the corresponding long term yields of tamcw fig 1 the short term yield is not always half the long term yield in other samples but is always lower than the long term yield table 3 clark and sivaganesan 1998 and fisher et al 2004 assumed that one yield explains the behaviour from the beginning to the end of the chlorine decay test these authors did not have short term thm formation data boccelli et al 2003 and gallard and von gunten 2002a calculated the linear correlation after an elapsed time 3 h dickenson 2005 analysed the data by separating the behaviour at 4 h for the short and long term reactions and found a slight difference between the two yields although the separation clearly occurs in a shorter time fig 1 and table 3 to accurately model thms and understand the key mechanisms the model should describe both the short term and long term behaviours third the long term yield line starts at 2 8 mg cl2 l when extended the line crosses the x axis at a chlorine concentration of 1 41 mg cl2 l fig 1 which represents c f oth 0 and this could be interpreted as an unproductive chlorine demand eq 14 table 3 summarises the c f oth 0 values of all 15 water samples except for two water samples c f oth 0 is positive the negative value is so small in petrie raw water petrw that it could be the result of an experimental error the negative value in the effluent of lake gaillard water treatment plant effluent gaiwtp is justifiable given that the water from this source might have been exposed to certain oxidants in the treatment plant before the chlorine decay test although no relevant data is available from the thesis mcclellan 2000 more details on this observation are discussed in section 4 4 it is confirmed that it is important to consider the fast reacting compounds such as cf oth 0 in eq 2 that consume chlorine without forming thms the inclusion of cf oth fully explains the lower short term yield as discussed in the succeeding sections fourth the linearity of the long term yield line extends until the end of the test time in all cases except for the enhanced coagulated guilderland water guicw wherein the linearity r2 0 986 extends only up to 720 8 h which is considerably less than the total test time of 2664 h table 1 given that no water supply system keeps water within the water supply system for such a long time and there is only one data point at 2664 h after 720 8 h the linearity up to 720 8 h is assumed sufficient finally the long term mass yield slope of the long term yield line widely varies from 29 5 to 81 5 µg mg for low and high bromide containing water respectively table 3 these results are within the previously reported mass yield range of 36 189 µg mg for waters from several sources with a wide range of ph boccelli et al 2003 chang et al 2001 clark and sivaganesan 1998 within the practical ph range of 7 8 2 and br 200 µg l the mass yield average and standard deviation are 43 4 and 7 7 µg mg respectively the molar plot slope termed the molar yield varies within a narrow range i e 17 35 µm mm with an average and standard deviations of 24 6 and 3 9 µm mm respectively these results agree with previously reported molar yields in the range 15 26 µm mm with the ph levels 7 and 8 2 in surface waters from switzerland containing 1 2 2 6 mg l of doc gallard and von gunten 2002a in summary both molar and mass yields exhibit a strong linear relationship r2 0 976 during the short or long term reactions i e after an elapsed time in all 15 samples this implies that each thm species has its own yield as assumed in the model development but the thm species yields may differ over the short and long term this could only be confirmed by fitting the data to the proposed model in the model it is important to consider that the separation between long and short term yields occurs when the chlorine concentration is higher than the unproductive chlorine consumption cf oth 0 4 3 estimation of model parameters and model concept validation the parameters that define the model and the goodness of fit in the 15 water samples are summarised in table 4 the model fit to the data in four of the samples are presented in fig 2 and are discussed in detail fig 2 shows that the model lines describes well the measured concentrations markers of the same colour of chlorine and thm species for the wide variation of cl2 br ratio 5 104 in these four samples during the short and long terms the figures that illustrate the match for cl2 br 104 are not presented herein because the primary species in this case is chloroform all the measured concentrations of chlorine and thm species and the corresponding estimates from the model after fitting to all data are compared in fig 3 the enhanced coagulated water from tampa florida contained 90 µg br l its model chlorine profile substantially agrees with the measured chlorine data over a 121 7 h period fig 2a it should be noted that the data from this water tamcw has the largest se amongst all cases which is caused by a single chlorine reading at 2 min if such a reading is neglected then the se is 0 18 mg cl2 l the chlorine consumed by fra is equivalent to 3 17 mg cl2 l cf 0 table 4 of this the unproductive chlorine consumption demand from non thm forming compounds is equivalent to 1 51 mg cl2 l cf oth 0 and separation of short and long term occurs at 2 8 mg cl2 l as noted in figure 1 the cf oth 0 is calculated by multiplying 0 477 roth by 3 17 cf 0 as per eq 6 the estimated cf oth 0 value from the x axis intersection of the plot of tthm vs consumed chlorine is 1 41 0 14 mg cl2 l and is comparable to the estimate from the model the separation chlorine concentration 2 8 mg cl2 l is also very close to cf 0 the excellent fit of the chlorine profile to data for all samples from the beginning to the end of their reaction times is indicated by attaining r2 0 987 and se 0 15 mg cl2 l in other samples table 4 and fig 3a the modelling of thm species is the primary objective of this study hence chlorine modelling results are not discussed in detail any further the modelled and measured concentrations of thm species are compared in figs 2a and fig 3 the model fits all measured concentrations of chloroform dichlorobromoform dibromochloroform and bromoform fig 2a as expected chloroform was the major species as reflected by the estimated individual yield values of thm species αcfm αdcb αdbc αbfm is equal to 77 3 18 1 3 7 0 9 table 4 the se and r2 for predictions of all thm species except bromoform are given in table 4 the bromoform concentrations are too low 3 2 µg l as also reflected by the bromoform yield 0 56 µg mg the calculation of r2 for these data is likely to be affected by the measurement error and hence only the se 0 85 µg l is provided in table 4 similarly only the se values are provided in table 4 when the yield of a thm species is 1 5 µg mg cl2 chlorine and thm concentrations match well guicw fig 2b in the very long term experiment 720 8 h with high chlorine dose in a water sample from guilderland ny containing low doc 1 96 mg l and bromide of 125 µg l the model fitted yield values of individual species highlights chloroform as the major species and αcfm is 83 of all thm species here the estimate of cf oth from the x axis intersection of the long term yield line 0 28 0 15 mg cl2 l table 3 and 0 53 mg cl2 l obtained through the fitting of the model table 4 and eq 6 are comparable in this water bromoform behaves strangely compared with the other 59 species profiles from 15 different waters it increases to 3 79 µg l within 5 min of dosing 9 84 mg l of chlorine but it consistently decays to 0 26 µg l in the next 720 h assuming this is not due to experimental error when there is no more production of bromoform the transformation amongst different species is extremely slow and conditions outside normal operation 9 84 mg cl2 l in 1 96 mg c l incubated over 720 h are needed to produce this behaviour even if constant yield is assumed the se is still 1 67 µg l therefore it is not necessary to complicate the model further in the raw water neprw containing moderate bromide the chlorine profile and thm species fit well fig 2c table 4 mass fractions of chloroform dichloro bromoform chloro dibromoform and bromoform were 60 6 29 1 9 8 and 0 5 respectively at 126 3 h and this is reflected by the yield values 60 29 10 0 respectively in table 4 again the similarity of the estimates of cf oth from the linear regression 0 38 0 1 mg cl2 l table 3 and from the model 0 65 mg cl2 l table 4 and eq 6 is notable in this water sample when the water colrw fig 2d containing high bromide is chlorinated to achieve a cl2 br ratio of 5 the fraction of brominated compounds exceeds that of chloroform the concentrations of thm species also fit well se 3 07 for all species table 4 based on tables 2 and 4 it appears that higher ses 6 1 µg l are associated with samples containing high ammonia 0 25 mg n l for chcl3 model estimates tamcw water had the highest se 9 71 µg l followed by 7 83 µg l for morcw mt orab coagulated water interestingly these samples also have high ammonia concentrations 0 25 mg n l table 2 most errors in tamcw estimates occur in five chloroform readings within the first 30 min and an error of 18 9 µg l is obtained at 24 h the model estimated and measured chloroform concentrations are 207 9 and 189 µg l in contrast the morcw model performs well in the first 30 min error 2 4 µg l but has one considerable error of 18 µg l after 24 h of reaction time that influences the estimated se given this it cannot be concluded that the model does not provide accurate model estimates in water samples when ammonia is present in high concentration the next largest se 6 09 µg l is observed in bourw estimates and the high se is obtained from a single reading at 122 h the mode estimated and measured chloroform concentrations at that point are 155 2 and 167 µg l respectively in many other samples the case is similar i e one or two measurements are outliers all measured and model estimated concentrations of chlorine and all four thm species match well in all 15 water samples sourced from various sources and subjected to various conditions fig 3 this is an excellent outcome considering that measured concentrations of thm species are as high as 350 µg l and the model estimates are based on chlorine measurements also both measurements are likely to be affected by the error besides the data are obtained from three different researchers even then the model describes well the measured concentrations the results confirm that a model based on two simple concepts is sufficient to describe the thm species concentration at any reaction time as long as the chlorine profile is reliably known first there is a fixed yield for a given thm species whether it is formed over the short or long term second there are fast reacting agents or other reactions with nom that do not directly produce thms and this could be represented by cf oth 0 cf oth 0 is introduced in such a way that does not influence the chlorine prediction the relationship between cf oth and ammonia is discussed in the next section 4 4 the effect of ammonia and other short term reactions on thms formation at ph 8 approximately 1 95 mole of chlorine per mole of ammonia is needed to achieve breakpoint chlorination in organic carbon free water jafvert and valentine 1992 in tamcw the ammonia concentration is 0 256 mg n l table 2 so to breakpoint chlorinate this ammonia 2 53 mg cl2 l is necessary considering the experimental error in ammonia and chlorine measurement this is close to 2 80 mg cl2 l the chlorine concentration at the slope change where a measurement is available fig 1 interestingly about 90 µg l of tthm also forms but the additional chlorine loss is not noted in the form of consumed chlorine even if the additional chlorine loss of 0 27 mg cl2 l beyond 2 53 mg cl2 l is considered the chlorine loss is not sufficient to explain the tthm production of 90 µg l unless compounds such as resourcinol is involved in the production of thm species within the short term as noted previously gallard and von gunten 2002b unproductive chlorine cannot always be defined by the theoretical requirement found in the absence of nom 1 95 mol mol for ammonia gaining insight into the mechanism behind thm formation during breakpoint chlorination requires further experimentation the ammonia concentrations however correlate well r2 0 99 with the values of cf oth 0 obtained from x axis intersection of the long term yield line in the plot of tthm vs consumed chlorine and those from the model estimate in eight of the nine samples where ammonia was measured fig 4 an exception is noted in the enhanced coagulated water sample from boulder boucw in which ammonia concentration is less than the detection limit 0 017 mg n l in this case cf oth 0 is 0 67 mg cl2 l a high value for low ammonia concentration it is possible that some other mechanisms could be involved in this water sample for example when a phenol containing water sample is dosed chlorination of phenols occurs before chloroform appears gallard and von gunten 2002b in the initial few minutes there could be several chlorine demanding reactions that do not necessarily result in thm production in view of this the consideration of other fast reacting compounds cf oth that do not produce thms but quickly consume chlorine is correct and has resulted in an accurate prediction of thm species for the whole chlorine test period fig 3b 4 5 predictive capability of the model formulated from minimum data having proved that the model concept describes the data of 15 waters a water specific model was formulated from a minimum set of data the purpose here is to demonstrate the capability of the thm species model from known chlorine concentrations because chlorine model has already been well validated fisher et al 2017a the purpose here is to show whether the thm species model coefficients can be estimated from a minimum data set the initial condition 0 h and two other data points were found sufficient as long as they are accurate the example of tamcw in fig 5 demonstrates the predictive capability of the model when the chlorine concentrations are known there are 13 data points of chlorine and commensurate thm species concentrations available two approaches were adopted to estimate five model coefficients roth αcfm αdcb αdbc and αbfm either using all data points as described in fig 3a also marked as continuous line in figure 5 or using only three data points marked as dotted line in fig 5 using the estimated coefficients thm species concentrations were predicted as shown in fig 5 there are minimal differences between measured data and predictions irrespective of the number of data points three or 13 used in formulating the thm species model 4 6 practical implications from the results thm species evidently form with a constant yield during chlorine consumption over an extended period 720 8 h when incubated at 15 23 c the model developed can accurately describe chlorine and thm species in all tested waters raw and treated water drawn from geographically diverse locations with variations in bromide cl2 br ratio chlorine dose ph 7 2 8 and doc fig 3 section 4 5 demonstrates that unknown thm species concentrations can be accurately predicted from chlorine concentrations if at least initial and two other data points are known once the variability of coefficients due to operational variations is established the model could be used for regulatory and operational control purposes the model concept could also be used within a laboratory to cross validate the experimental data quickly with the availability of epanet msx software it is relatively easy to implement kinetic models similar to the one proposed in this study within distribution system simulations because the model parameters can be set from the time of chlorine dosing the prerequisite is to know how thm species yield and unproductive chlorine demand vary under desired conditions by conducting laboratory experiments to fully predict the thm species concentrations for different operational and seasonal variations further research is needed as specified below 4 7 further research the laboratory tests are performed only at a single temperature chlorine dose bromide and doc in contrast in a given water source and distribution system chlorine dose rechlorination conditions temperature bromide nom characteristics doc concentration and chlorine demanding inorganics such as ammonia can vary over the seasons accordingly it is important to understand how these variations impact model parameters in a given water such developments may help in generalising the model for one water source or many different water sources using a similar approach to fisher et al 2017b the bulk water predictions derived from this study could be utilised to understand how the interactions with biofilm and wall material affect the thm species in a full scale water supply systems finding that thm species are formed at a constant yield with respect to productive chlorine consumption raises the question of whether other dbps also form similarly this would need rigorous testing the results for thms are surprising given the complexity of the organic matter present and the multiple parallel reactions that may occur in water to produce thm species consequently our fundamental understanding has to be revisited to evaluate the relative rate of each reaction such as hydrolysis transformation from one dbp group haas to another thms and one dbp species chcl3 to another chcl2br 5 conclusions despite the existence of significant knowledge on complex mechanisms of thm formation a practically useable model that can accurately predict the concentrations of thm species from simple measurement is not available in this study a novel but simple thm species model was developed and tested on 15 water samples to prove the validity of the concept twelve samples were from nine states in the usa and three were from two states in australia once the concept was proven an example of the construction of the model from minimum data sets and its predictive capability were demonstrated the major conclusions are 1 chlorine consumed by reaction is strongly linearly related to concentration of tthms or thm species by two regression lines that intersect at approximately 0 08 0 5 h after chlorine dosing the initial short term yield of tthms or thm species from consumed chlorine is lower than the long term yield 2 initial short term yield is caused by the unproductive chlorine consumption which was approximately five times the nh3 n concentration in eight of the nine different source waters for which ammonia data was available r2 0 99 this is substantially less than the theoretical value ten times nh3 n needed for breakpoint chlorination the chlorine concentration at which long and short term yield separates in some cases agree with ten times nh3 n 3 a model was formulated from the concept that each thm species concentration is proportional to the productive chlorine consumption after separating it from the unproductive non thm forming initial chlorine consumption this model described all the data well this is a surprising outcome given the complexity of reactions occurring amongst chlorine bromide and nom which should prompt reevaluation of the relative rates of known reactions to determine which ones predominate 4 the model concept can be practically employed to predict concentrations of thm species by estimating the model parameters unproductive chlorine consumption yields of each thm species from three sets initial end and middle of chlorine and corresponding thm species concentrations chlorine is then the only entity needed to predict thm species concentration in other instances an easily measurable or usually measured variable 5 the model could be used for operational and regulatory purposes with minimal measurements but further research is needed to understand how changes in operational conditions and quality of the water source affect the model parameters the model concept may also be extended to predict concentrations of other dbps however further experimentation and data analysis would be necessary for this purpose

17704,despite the existence of significant knowedge on complex mechanisms of thm formation a simple kinetic model to predict thm species concentration is not available hindering application of knowlwdge for regulatory monitoring and operational control the parallel second order reaction 2r model containing fast and slow reactants has been well established to describe the chlorine decay kinetics under distribution conditions the proposed thm species model expands the 2r model by systematically incorporating the initial unproductive not forming thm chlorine consumption and assuming each thm species is formed at a fixed yield µg thm species mg productive chlorine consumption the model concept is tested on 15 water samples that contain a wide range of dissolved organic carbon

as the chlorine profile is described accurately r2 0 984 the model formulated from the minimum data initial and two other data points of cl2 and thm species predicts the rest of concentrations of thm

chlorine is the most frequently used disinfectant in water supply systems despite its many advantages the formation of chlorinated disinfection by products dbps is a major health problem amongst the known dbps trihalomethanes thms are the most often regulated compounds the thms are a group of compounds produced by substituting three hydrogen atoms in methane with halides cl br or i the species that occur in higher concentrations are chloroform chcl3 bromodichloromethane chbrcl2 dibromochloromethane chbr2cl and bromoform chbr3 although the concentration of total thms tthm has been most often regulated some agencies such as the us environmental protection agency health canada and world health organisation regulate or recommend monitoring individual thm species as some brominated species are more toxic echigo et al 2004 wagner and plewa 2017 than their chlorinated counterparts environmental protection agency epa 2010 health canada 2006 world health organization who 2017 the measurement of thms is expensive 50 100 aud per sample and requires specialist skills and relatively expensive instrumentation hence regional water utilities in developed countries and utilities in many developing countries often do not measure thms in their systems due to either lack of facilities or high cost accurate dbp models which link dbp concentrations to easily measurable water quality parameters such as chlorine dissolved organic carbon doc or uv absorbence offer substantial advantages in regulating dbps e g they can reduce the cost of monitoring in places where skills and measurement facilities are limited providing a prediction rather than a post event measurement and reducing the frequency of measurement are possible alternatives a species level model can demonstrate the importance of a specific key water quality parameter that could should be controlled at the water treatment plant to satisfy regulatory requirements at customers taps and could help to identify the key mechanisms in operation in a water supply system network it can also aid in determining the impact of many reactions e g with wall material biofilm or loose deposits designers and operators of drinking water supply systems can thus employ these models as a decision making tool furthermore regulatory agencies can utilise the models to verify the status of a water supply system chowdhury et al 2009 and any anomaly or loss of integrity can also be easily identified natural organic matter nom is the major precursor of thms reckhow et al 1990 rook 1977 in view of the heterogeneity and widespread sources of nom derrien et al 2019 these organic compounds can react with chlorine and bromine if there is bromide present to form a variety of dbps including thms hua and reckhow 2008 via complex pathways deborde and von gunten 2008 that makes it difficult to identify the specific organic components of nom e g humic substances fulvic acids or the reactions that contribute to thm production amongst the phenolic structures identified in humic substances phenol and resorcinol have been considered as the slow and fast reacting precursors of thm respectively gallard and von gunten 2002b reckhow 2011 von gunten 2018 this implies that the prediction of dbps is still in its infancy and an alternate way of analysing the data is needed von gunten 2018 two approaches are adopted to predict thms in a given water thm formation potential thmfp or tthm concentration in the water at any given time of reaction with chlorine thmfp characterises the water with one maximum value of tthm concentration generated under a single set of standard conditions and various correlations are derived to understand the link between the characteristics of nom and thmfp golea et al 2017 to achieve efficient distribution system design operation and regulation the concentrations of thm species need to be predicted at any given time and temperature across the whole system because of the complex nature of nom and reaction variables two types of models empirical and semi mechanistic are available to predict thm concentrations at any given time there are two types of empirical models water specific and generic the water specific empirical models often predict the thm concentrations well as they are trained to the data set of the same water ged et al 2015 based on independent evaluations of 118 generic empirical models ged et al 2015 found that even the best predictive empirical models have significant errors the standard error se and r2 for tthm predictions were in the range 68 8 76 8 µg l and 0 757 0 852 respectively the chloroform model had se and r2 of 14 4 µg l and 0 95 respectively no dibromochloroform model has ever attained se 35 µg l the semi mechanistic model links chlorine decay and tthm formation kinetics compared to empirical models mechanistic model has the capability to reveal fundamental mechanisms although they are still water specific clark and sivaganesan 1998 demonstrated that the production rate of tthm concentrations is linearly related to the consumption rate of chlorine in a given water several authors boccelli et al 2003 dickenson 2005 fisher et al 2004 gallard and von gunten 2002a gang et al 2003 have thereafter confirmed this relationship and were able to accurately describe tthm concentrations this description has two issues it does not account for the initial chlorine consumption that does not form thm and it does not describe thm species concentrations it is well known that unproductive chlorine demand chlorine consumption without tthm formation occurs within the first few hours of chlorine dosing by inorganic ions such as nh4 fe2 or by chlorine substitution reactions of larger organic molecules such as polyphenols gunten and gallard 2002b however it is not known how to account for this demand in formulating tthm models researchers gallard and gunten 2002a b either avoided the first few hours or neglected the initial reaction and modelled the whole reaction with the same linearity clark and sivaganesan 1998 fisher et al 2004 the prediction of concentrations of tthm or thm species from the time of chlorine dosing did not succeed dickenson 2005 if thm species concentrations are to be predicted from the beginning of chlorine dosing the unproductive chlorine demand should be taken into account systematically in the model to link thm species formation to chlorine accurately a model that accurately describes chlorine decay kinetics is needed fisher et al 2011 comprehensively evaluated the applicability of many existing models for distribution systems and showed that one of the alternatives of kastl et al 1999 termed the 2r model two reactant parallel second order model was the most suitable most importantly their model fisher et al 2012 2017a fisher et al 2015 describes chlorine kinetics from the time of chlorine dosing and hence can facilitate incorporation of initial unproductive chlorine demand with the availability of the accurate chlorine decay models fisher et al 2017a and the epanet msx engine fisher et al 2018 analysis of a water supply system for dbps will become feasible if accurate models are available to predict thm species concentrations from the time of chlorine dosing to the best of our knowledge there is no simple kinetic model that can accurately predict thm species concentrations in wide ranging conditions from the time of chlorine dosing despite the existence of significant knowledge of factors affecting the formation of thm species such a model should systematically incorporate the unproductive chlorine demand that occurs within the initial period and should predict thm species concentrations accurately the objective of the current study is to develop a simple kinetic model to predict individual thm species concentrations from the time the chlorine is dosed the model is rigorously tested using our own and independent data sets of 15 different water samples sourced from two states in australia and nine states in the usa once the concept of the model is verified by fitting it to all data the model is reconstructed using minimum data and the predictive capability of the model is demonstrated 2 model development to develop the thm species model free chlorine is assumed to be the primary driver of dbp production provided the reactive sites on nom are available the reaction kinetics of chlorine with water constituents in a water distribution system follows a parallel second order relationship with two notional reactants slow and fast reacting agents fisher et al 2017a the model conceptually calculates the concentration and reaction rates of these agents with the assumption that both reactants fras and sras react with chlorine and produce oxidised and non reactive compounds referred to as nras 1 f r a c l 2 k f n r a c l 2 s r a c l 2 k s n r a c l the forgoing assumption may not be correct because a part of what is defined as sra may be a compound resulting from the reaction of fra with chlorine and some of the oxidation products of the sra reaction may become a new reactant adding to the pool of sra for practical applications simplicity is important it has been shown that the model can describe chlorine concentrations accurately in different waters and various operational scenarios fisher et al 2017a hence the 2r chlorine decay model is adopted it follows 3 d c c l d t k f c f c c l k s c s c c l where cs and cf are respectively the notional concentrations of fras and sras at time t h expressed as mg cl2 equivalent l ccl is the concentration of chlorine at time t in mg cl2 l kf and ks are respectively the reaction rates in l mg h of fras and sras the formation of thms or any other dbps in water containing nom and bromide involves a series of reactions that fundamentally includes four mechanisms langsa et al 2017 bromide is oxidised to hobr by dosed chlorine hocl within the first few minutes both hocl and hobr are involved in electrophilic substitution of bromide onto nom forming brominated and chlorinated organics org br and org cl respectively the oxidation of nom by hobr releases bromide back into the solution that may be oxidised again to hobr if there is chlorine the formed org br and org cl react with the remaining hocl or hobr to form org br cl or org cl br it is possible that the hydrolysis of halogenated organic compounds of larger molecular weight may result in the production of regulated dbps e g thms and haloacetic acids it is well known that not all chlorine that reacts with nom will directly produce thms but as explained in the introduction this has not been systematically incorporated in dbp formation models inorganic compounds e g ammonia nitrite and ferrous ion can consume considerable amounts of chlorine within the first few minutes thereby contributing to fras but not forming thms as a typical practice in chlorinated water supply systems ammonia is made to react with the excess chlorine cl2 n molar ratio 1 and chlorine undergoes breakpoint chlorination jafvert and valentine 1992 in the absence of nom the amount of chlorine required to breakpoint chlorinate is 1 75 mol cl2 mole nh3 accordingly only a part of the chlorine or bromine if bromide is present reacts with nom and produces dbps including thms in parallel gallard and von gunten 2002a hypothesised that resorcinol may be involved in the initial production of thms without consuming much chlorine therefore some thms could still be produced during breakpoint chlorination some structures such as phenol consume chlorine within the fast reacting stage but do not produce thms irrespective of the compound mechanism some chlorine has to be consumed before thms appear in the water and has to be incorporated within thm formation modelling it follows that there are two fras one that produces thms while the other does not 4 f r a t h m c l 2 k f n r a c l α t t h m t t h m 5 f r a o t h c l 2 k f n r a c l where frathm and fraoth are fras that produce and that do not produce thms respectively it is assumed that the stoichiometric coefficient for tthm is αtthm µmol mmol or µg mg depending on how tthm and chlorine demand are expressed hereafter the stoichiometric coefficient is referred to as yield the fraction and concentration of fraoth are denoted as roth and c f oth 0 respectively 6 r o t h c f o t h 0 c f 0 where cf 0 is the initial fra concentration mg cl2 l if the frathm concentration at time t h is defined as c f thm then the initial concentration is c f thm 0 7 c f t h m 0 c f 0 c f o t h 0 if sra are also assumed to produce thms with the same stoichiometry yield then it is expressed as follows 8 s r a c l 2 k s n r a c l α t t h

noted amongst all reliable profiles reported in the literature hua and reckhow 2012 dickenson 2005 mcclellan 2000 thm species concentrations increase in the presence of chlorine this implies that the thm species are either the end products the production rate of each species is faster than the consumption or conversion to other dbps rates throughout the reaction or other instances have not been encountered in practice it could also be possible changes are occurring but is not significant enough to impact the observed profiles within the reaction time of interest 120 h for example it is obvious that when bromide has all been incorporated into organic matter and only chlorine is available to react then the proportion of chlorinated thm species could increase but the significance of such change needs verification further the linearity of tthm production rate with chlorine consumption rate eq 9 has been proven to hold irrespective of how molar or mass basis the tthm concentration is expressed clarke and sivaganesan 1998 gallard and gunten 2002a although no author has thus far established that both mass and molar yields with respect to chlorine remain constant in a given water sample of varying reaction conditions and water quality it is assumed that this is true in order to develop the model thereafter it is verified it therefore mathematically follows that thm species should form largely in proportion and each species has its own yield although this should be verified by testing the concept in many waters 10 f r a t h m c l 2 k f n r a c l α c f m c f m α d c b d c

were selected to provide a wide range of conditions these water samples originate from nine states in the us and two in australia table 1 when the bromide variation was insufficient to cause a wide variation in the distribution of brominated thm species the data sets in which bromide was added to achieve a low chlorine bromide ratio were selected 3 1 data extraction from archived theses to comprehensively test the model and assumptions data describing both short term and long term behaviour from dickenson 2005 were included the total test time varied between 72 and 2664 h table 1 thus providing a good representation of behaviour in the extended chlorine decay tests this thesis also provided sufficient short term measurements 0 5 1 3 5 min etc for many of the samples sometimes only the concentration of thm species or chlorine was measured at a reaction time when that occurred the chlorine or thms concentration at that point was estimated by linear interpolation the estimated chlorine was only used for plotting linear regression lines and manually calculating the yield for the purpose of model fitting in aquasim section 3 6 the original data were used 3 2 analytical methods the extracted data originate from three different sources dickenson 2005 gunasekera 2018 mcclellan 2000 hence the methods are only briefly described here as the details can be found in the original source gunasekera 2018 measured chlorine concentration using the dpd colorimetric method and dickenson 2005 employed the iodometric method and ferrous titrimetric methods for high and low chlorine concentrations mcclellan 2000 also used the ferrous titrimetric method for all his measurements gunasekera 2018 determined the doc concentration of samples using the shimadzu total organic carbon toc analyser toc lcph cpn ssm 5000a whereas dickenson 2005 employed the sievers 800 toc analyser gunasekera 2018 measured the uv absorption at a 254 nm wavelength using cary 60 ultraviolet and visible uv vis spectroscopy whereas dickenson 2005 employed the hach dr 4000 spectrophotometer dickenson 2005 and gunasekera 2018 measured the background bromide concentration of the samples by ion chromatography dionex for thm analysis dickenson 2005 and mcclellan 2000 followed the epa 551 1 method but gunasekera 2018 used the laboratory in sydney water corporation which followed the epa 5021a method all the samples were quenched using aqueous na2s2o3 solution by gunasekera 2018 but mcclellan 2000 and dickenson 2005 used ammonium chloride agilent 6890 gas chromatography system with gc µecd detector was used by dickenson 2005 but mcclellan 2000 used hewlett packard gc ecd sydney water corporation adopted the headspace extraction followed by agilent gc ms 3 3 coagulation tests dickenson 2005 carried out enhanced coagulation in a large 40 l tank after determining the appropriate alum dose in a laboratory jar tester rapid mixing was at 100 rpm followed by flocculation at 30 and 10 rpm each for 15 min to separate the flocs sedimentation was carried out for at least five hours followed by cartridge filtration the filtered samples were preserved at 4 c 3 4 chlorine decay tests dickenson 2005 and mcclellan 2000 followed a similar chlorine decay test procedure chlorination tests were carried out in headspace free amber glass bottles water was first placed in a larger amber glass bottle and an appropriate amount of a chlorine stock solution was dosed after 30 s this water was dispensed into smaller amber bottles such that the headspace was eliminated for achieving ph 8 dickenson 2005 used a borate buffer to achieve a final concentration of 4 mm mcclellan 2000 conducted the tests at ph 7 5 gunasekera 2018 carried out the tests in pte bottles in the dark with an initial concentration of chlorine between 5 9 and 8 3 mg cl2 l depending on the initial doc concentration the ph was adjusted to 7 5 0 1 with 1 m hcl and naoh these bottles were rendered chlorine demand free by soaking for 24 h in 10 mg cl2 l solution overnight and rinsing with milliq water immediately after dosing chlorine sample bottles headspace free were closed tightly and incubated at 23 c to ensure an accurately measured dose the same amount of chlorine was dosed into millq water of the same volume of water and chlorine was measured at each desired reaction time sample bottles were analysed for chlorine and thm concentrations 3 5 calculations including linear regression and statistical analysis eq 9 implies that the slope of a scatter plot of tthm or thm species in mass basis µg l or molar basis µm vs consumed chlorine mg cl2 l or mm cl2 provides the yield estimate the goodness of fit r2 and se to a linear relationship was calculated using the linear regression linest function in excel the regression estimates the slope the yield and y intercept the regression also estimates se of the yield and constant the unproductive chlorine consumption x intercept can be calculated from dividing the y intercept by the yield eq 14 3 6 simulation of chlorine and thm species in aquasim aquasim software reichert 1994 1998 was used to estimate the optimal parameter values that allow the model to best describe chlorine decay and thm formation data in all fifteen water samples these optimal values were derived by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the measured and predicted concentrations at corresponding points in two stages first the measured chlorine concentrations were used to estimate the optimal parameter values for the chlorine decay model these parameters are initial concentrations of fast cf 0 and slow reacting agents cs 0 and the rate constants kf and ks then the predicted chlorine concentrations for each water were used to estimate the parameters for the thm species formation model the estimated parameters are αcfm αdcb αdbc αbfm and roth the software uses the simplex technique or the secant method to minimize the sum of squared differences there are no constraints placed on the parameter values except for non negativity the actual initial chlorine concentrations listed in table 1 and thm species concentrations were set during the parameter optimization procedure the initial thm species concentration were set to zero when no data were available or when raw waters were chlorinated 4 results and discussion 4 1 water quality characteristics of chosen water samples the characteristics and concentrations of nom bromide concentration chlorine dose or cl2 br ratio reaction time ph and temperature can determine the concentrations of thm species when analysed at the end of reaction time chang et al 2001 roccaro et al 2014 the tests included in this study are conducted at an incubation temperature of 15 23 c and a practical ph range of 7 2 8 1 table 1 the analyses of 15 water samples table 2 show that the doc suva and initial bromide concentration widely vary doc 1 43 9 88 mg l suva 1 522 5 843 l mg m bromide 14 187 µg l ammonia was measured in nine samples with a concentration of 0 3 mg n l for demonstrating the model of thm species that occur in various relative fractions natural bromide variation is insufficient the data were therefore selected from bromide added cases of nepean neprw wyong wyorw and colorado river water colrw and colrw2 to attain a cl2 br ratio as low as 5 table 2 4 2 behaviour of tthm molar and mass concentrations with respect to consumed chlorine concentration the behaviour of molar and mass yields are summarised in table 3 and one sample is discussed in detail as an example when the tthm concentration is plotted against the consumed chlorine on a mass or molar basis for water from tampa florida tamcw fig 1 several observations can be made first the data points in both molar and mass plots fig 1a and b are distributed along two strongly correlated lines representing short 0 25 h r2 0 962 and long term 0 25 h r2 0 9976 behaviour this implies that each thm species has its own species yield that the results exhibit a strong linear relationship for each species validates the assumption of the model concept the separation time varies amongst different samples table 3 but was always 0 5 h in certain samples the long term yield line starts from the first measurement point these water samples are marked as n a as the separation time cannot be identified clearly second the short term mass and molar yields are approximately one half the corresponding long term yields of tamcw fig 1 the short term yield is not always half the long term yield in other samples but is always lower than the long term yield table 3 clark and sivaganesan 1998 and fisher et al 2004 assumed that one yield explains the behaviour from the beginning to the end of the chlorine decay test these authors did not have short term thm formation data boccelli et al 2003 and gallard and von gunten 2002a calculated the linear correlation after an elapsed time 3 h dickenson 2005 analysed the data by separating the behaviour at 4 h for the short and long term reactions and found a slight difference between the two yields although the separation clearly occurs in a shorter time fig 1 and table 3 to accurately model thms and understand the key mechanisms the model should describe both the short term and long term behaviours third the long term yield line starts at 2 8 mg cl2 l when extended the line crosses the x axis at a chlorine concentration of 1 41 mg cl2 l fig 1 which represents c f oth 0 and this could be interpreted as an unproductive chlorine demand eq 14 table 3 summarises the c f oth 0 values of all 15 water samples except for two water samples c f oth 0 is positive the negative value is so small in petrie raw water petrw that it could be the result of an experimental error the negative value in the effluent of lake gaillard water treatment plant effluent gaiwtp is justifiable given that the water from this source might have been exposed to certain oxidants in the treatment plant before the chlorine decay test although no relevant data is available from the thesis mcclellan 2000 more details on this observation are discussed in section 4 4 it is confirmed that it is important to consider the fast reacting compounds such as cf oth 0 in eq 2 that consume chlorine without forming thms the inclusion of cf oth fully explains the lower short term yield as discussed in the succeeding sections fourth the linearity of the long term yield line extends until the end of the test time in all cases except for the enhanced coagulated guilderland water guicw wherein the linearity r2 0 986 extends only up to 720 8 h which is considerably less than the total test time of 2664 h table 1 given that no water supply system keeps water within the water supply system for such a long time and there is only one data point at 2664 h after 720 8 h the linearity up to 720 8 h is assumed sufficient finally the long term mass yield slope of the long term yield line widely varies from 29 5 to 81 5 µg mg for low and high bromide containing water respectively table 3 these results are within the previously reported mass yield range of 36 189 µg mg for waters from several sources with a wide range of ph boccelli et al 2003 chang et al 2001 clark and sivaganesan 1998 within the practical ph range of 7 8 2 and br 200 µg l the mass yield average and standard deviation are 43 4 and 7 7 µg mg respectively the molar plot slope termed the molar yield varies within a narrow range i e 17 35 µm mm with an average and standard deviations of 24 6 and 3 9 µm mm respectively these results agree with previously reported molar yields in the range 15 26 µm mm with the ph levels 7 and 8 2 in surface waters from switzerland containing 1 2 2 6 mg l of doc gallard and von gunten 2002a in summary both molar and mass yields exhibit a strong linear relationship r2 0 976 during the short or long term reactions i e after an elapsed time in all 15 samples this implies that each thm species has its own yield as assumed in the model development but the thm species yields may differ over the short and long term this could only be confirmed by fitting the data to the proposed model in the model it is important to consider that the separation between long and short term yields occurs when the chlorine concentration is higher than the unproductive chlorine consumption cf oth 0 4 3 estimation of model parameters and model concept validation the parameters that define the model and the goodness of fit in the 15 water samples are summarised in table 4 the model fit to the data in four of the samples are presented in fig 2 and are discussed in detail fig 2 shows that the model lines describes well the measured concentrations markers of the same colour of chlorine and thm species for the wide variation of cl2 br ratio 5 104 in these four samples during the short and long terms the figures that illustrate the match for cl2 br 104 are not presented herein because the primary species in this case is chloroform all the measured concentrations of chlorine and thm species and the corresponding estimates from the model after fitting to all data are compared in fig 3 the enhanced coagulated water from tampa florida contained 90 µg br l its model chlorine profile substantially agrees with the measured chlorine data over a 121 7 h period fig 2a it should be noted that the data from this water tamcw has the largest se amongst all cases which is caused by a single chlorine reading at 2 min if such a reading is neglected then the se is 0 18 mg cl2 l the chlorine consumed by fra is equivalent to 3 17 mg cl2 l cf 0 table 4 of this the unproductive chlorine consumption demand from non thm forming compounds is equivalent to 1 51 mg cl2 l cf oth 0 and separation of short and long term occurs at 2 8 mg cl2 l as noted in figure 1 the cf oth 0 is calculated by multiplying 0 477 roth by 3 17 cf 0 as per eq 6 the estimated cf oth 0 value from the x axis intersection of the plot of tthm vs consumed chlorine is 1 41 0 14 mg cl2 l and is comparable to the estimate from the model the separation chlorine concentration 2 8 mg cl2 l is also very close to cf 0 the excellent fit of the chlorine profile to data for all samples from the beginning to the end of their reaction times is indicated by attaining r2 0 987 and se 0 15 mg cl2 l in other samples table 4 and fig 3a the modelling of thm species is the primary objective of this study hence chlorine modelling results are not discussed in detail any further the modelled and measured concentrations of thm species are compared in figs 2a and fig 3 the model fits all measured concentrations of chloroform dichlorobromoform dibromochloroform and bromoform fig 2a as expected chloroform was the major species as reflected by the estimated individual yield values of thm species αcfm αdcb αdbc αbfm is equal to 77 3 18 1 3 7 0 9 table 4 the se and r2 for predictions of all thm species except bromoform are given in table 4 the bromoform concentrations are too low 3 2 µg l as also reflected by the bromoform yield 0 56 µg mg the calculation of r2 for these data is likely to be affected by the measurement error and hence only the se 0 85 µg l is provided in table 4 similarly only the se values are provided in table 4 when the yield of a thm species is 1 5 µg mg cl2 chlorine and thm concentrations match well guicw fig 2b in the very long term experiment 720 8 h with high chlorine dose in a water sample from guilderland ny containing low doc 1 96 mg l and bromide of 125 µg l the model fitted yield values of individual species highlights chloroform as the major species and αcfm is 83 of all thm species here the estimate of cf oth from the x axis intersection of the long term yield line 0 28 0 15 mg cl2 l table 3 and 0 53 mg cl2 l obtained through the fitting of the model table 4 and eq 6 are comparable in this water bromoform behaves strangely compared with the other 59 species profiles from 15 different waters it increases to 3 79 µg l within 5 min of dosing 9 84 mg l of chlorine but it consistently decays to 0 26 µg l in the next 720 h assuming this is not due to experimental error when there is no more production of bromoform the transformation amongst different species is extremely slow and conditions outside normal operation 9 84 mg cl2 l in 1 96 mg c l incubated over 720 h are needed to produce this behaviour even if constant yield is assumed the se is still 1 67 µg l therefore it is not necessary to complicate the model further in the raw water neprw containing moderate bromide the chlorine profile and thm species fit well fig 2c table 4 mass fractions of chloroform dichloro bromoform chloro dibromoform and bromoform were 60 6 29 1 9 8 and 0 5 respectively at 126 3 h and this is reflected by the yield values 60 29 10 0 respectively in table 4 again the similarity of the estimates of cf oth from the linear regression 0 38 0 1 mg cl2 l table 3 and from the model 0 65 mg cl2 l table 4 and eq 6 is notable in this water sample when the water colrw fig 2d containing high bromide is chlorinated to achieve a cl2 br ratio of 5 the fraction of brominated compounds exceeds that of chloroform the concentrations of thm species also fit well se 3 07 for all species table 4 based on tables 2 and 4 it appears that higher ses 6 1 µg l are associated with samples containing high ammonia 0 25 mg n l for chcl3 model estimates tamcw water had the highest se 9 71 µg l followed by 7 83 µg l for morcw mt orab coagulated water interestingly these samples also have high ammonia concentrations 0 25 mg n l table 2 most errors in tamcw estimates occur in five chloroform readings within the first 30 min and an error of 18 9 µg l is obtained at 24 h the model estimated and measured chloroform concentrations are 207 9 and 189 µg l in contrast the morcw model performs well in the first 30 min error 2 4 µg l but has one considerable error of 18 µg l after 24 h of reaction time that influences the estimated se given this it cannot be concluded that the model does not provide accurate model estimates in water samples when ammonia is present in high concentration the next largest se 6 09 µg l is observed in bourw estimates and the high se is obtained from a single reading at 122 h the mode estimated and measured chloroform concentrations at that point are 155 2 and 167 µg l respectively in many other samples the case is similar i e one or two measurements are outliers all measured and model estimated concentrations of chlorine and all four thm species match well in all 15 water samples sourced from various sources and subjected to various conditions fig 3 this is an excellent outcome considering that measured concentrations of thm species are as high as 350 µg l and the model estimates are based on chlorine measurements also both measurements are likely to be affected by the error besides the data are obtained from three different researchers even then the model describes well the measured concentrations the results confirm that a model based on two simple concepts is sufficient to describe the thm species concentration at any reaction time as long as the chlorine profile is reliably known first there is a fixed yield for a given thm species whether it is formed over the short or long term second there are fast reacting agents or other reactions with nom that do not directly produce thms and this could be represented by cf oth 0 cf oth 0 is introduced in such a way that does not influence the chlorine prediction the relationship between cf oth and ammonia is discussed in the next section 4 4 the effect of ammonia and other short term reactions on thms formation at ph 8 approximately 1 95 mole of chlorine per mole of ammonia is needed to achieve breakpoint chlorination in organic carbon free water jafvert and valentine 1992 in tamcw the ammonia concentration is 0 256 mg n l table 2 so to breakpoint chlorinate this ammonia 2 53 mg cl2 l is necessary considering the experimental error in ammonia and chlorine measurement this is close to 2 80 mg cl2 l the chlorine concentration at the slope change where a measurement is available fig 1 interestingly about 90 µg l of tthm also forms but the additional chlorine loss is not noted in the form of consumed chlorine even if the additional chlorine loss of 0 27 mg cl2 l beyond 2 53 mg cl2 l is considered the chlorine loss is not sufficient to explain the tthm production of 90 µg l unless compounds such as resourcinol is involved in the production of thm species within the short term as noted previously gallard and von gunten 2002b unproductive chlorine cannot always be defined by the theoretical requirement found in the absence of nom 1 95 mol mol for ammonia gaining insight into the mechanism behind thm formation during breakpoint chlorination requires further experimentation the ammonia concentrations however correlate well r2 0 99 with the values of cf oth 0 obtained from x axis intersection of the long term yield line in the plot of tthm vs consumed chlorine and those from the model estimate in eight of the nine samples where ammonia was measured fig 4 an exception is noted in the enhanced coagulated water sample from boulder boucw in which ammonia concentration is less than the detection limit 0 017 mg n l in this case cf oth 0 is 0 67 mg cl2 l a high value for low ammonia concentration it is possible that some other mechanisms could be involved in this water sample for example when a phenol containing water sample is dosed chlorination of phenols occurs before chloroform appears gallard and von gunten 2002b in the initial few minutes there could be several chlorine demanding reactions that do not necessarily result in thm production in view of this the consideration of other fast reacting compounds cf oth that do not produce thms but quickly consume chlorine is correct and has resulted in an accurate prediction of thm species for the whole chlorine test period fig 3b 4 5 predictive capability of the model formulated from minimum data having proved that the model concept describes the data of 15 waters a water specific model was formulated from a minimum set of data the purpose here is to demonstrate the capability of the thm species model from known chlorine concentrations because chlorine model has already been well validated fisher et al 2017a the purpose here is to show whether the thm species model coefficients can be estimated from a minimum data set the initial condition 0 h and two other data points were found sufficient as long as they are accurate the example of tamcw in fig 5 demonstrates the predictive capability of the model when the chlorine concentrations are known there are 13 data points of chlorine and commensurate thm species concentrations available two approaches were adopted to estimate five model coefficients roth αcfm αdcb αdbc and αbfm either using all data points as described in fig 3a also marked as continuous line in figure 5 or using only three data points marked as dotted line in fig 5 using the estimated coefficients thm species concentrations were predicted as shown in fig 5 there are minimal differences between measured data and predictions irrespective of the number of data points three or 13 used in formulating the thm species model 4 6 practical implications from the results thm species evidently form with a constant yield during chlorine consumption over an extended period 720 8 h when incubated at 15 23 c the model developed can accurately describe chlorine and thm species in all tested waters raw and treated water drawn from geographically diverse locations with variations in bromide cl2 br ratio chlorine dose ph 7 2 8 and doc fig 3 section 4 5 demonstrates that unknown thm species concentrations can be accurately predicted from chlorine concentrations if at least initial and two other data points are known once the variability of coefficients due to operational variations is established the model could be used for regulatory and operational control purposes the model concept could also be used within a laboratory to cross validate the experimental data quickly with the availability of epanet msx software it is relatively easy to implement kinetic models similar to the one proposed in this study within distribution system simulations because the model parameters can be set from the time of chlorine dosing the prerequisite is to know how thm species yield and unproductive chlorine demand vary under desired conditions by conducting laboratory experiments to fully predict the thm species concentrations for different operational and seasonal variations further research is needed as specified below 4 7 further research the laboratory tests are performed only at a single temperature chlorine dose bromide and doc in contrast in a given water source and distribution system chlorine dose rechlorination conditions temperature bromide nom characteristics doc concentration and chlorine demanding inorganics such as ammonia can vary over the seasons accordingly it is important to understand how these variations impact model parameters in a given water such developments may help in generalising the model for one water source or many different water sources using a similar approach to fisher et al 2017b the bulk water predictions derived from this study could be utilised to understand how the interactions with biofilm and wall material affect the thm species in a full scale water supply systems finding that thm species are formed at a constant yield with respect to productive chlorine consumption raises the question of whether other dbps also form similarly this would need rigorous testing the results for thms are surprising given the complexity of the organic matter present and the multiple parallel reactions that may occur in water to produce thm species consequently our fundamental understanding has to be revisited to evaluate the relative rate of each reaction such as hydrolysis transformation from one dbp group haas to another thms and one dbp species chcl3 to another chcl2br 5 conclusions despite the existence of significant knowledge on complex mechanisms of thm formation a practically useable model that can accurately predict the concentrations of thm species from simple measurement is not available in this study a novel but simple thm species model was developed and tested on 15 water samples to prove the validity of the concept twelve samples were from nine states in the usa and three were from two states in australia once the concept was proven an example of the construction of the model from minimum data sets and its predictive capability were demonstrated the major conclusions are 1 chlorine consumed by reaction is strongly linearly related to concentration of tthms or thm species by two regression lines that intersect at approximately 0 08 0 5 h after chlorine dosing the initial short term yield of tthms or thm species from consumed chlorine is lower than the long term yield 2 initial short term yield is caused by the unproductive chlorine consumption which was approximately five times the nh3 n concentration in eight of the nine different source waters for which ammonia data was available r2 0 99 this is substantially less than the theoretical value ten times nh3 n needed for breakpoint chlorination the chlorine concentration at which long and short term yield separates in some cases agree with ten times nh3 n 3 a model was formulated from the concept that each thm species concentration is proportional to the productive chlorine consumption after separating it from the unproductive non thm forming initial chlorine consumption this model described all the data well this is a surprising outcome given the complexity of reactions occurring amongst chlorine bromide and nom which should prompt reevaluation of the relative rates of known reactions to determine which ones predominate 4 the model concept can be practically employed to predict concentrations of thm species by estimating the model parameters unproductive chlorine consumption yields of each thm species from three sets initial end and middle of chlorine and corresponding thm species concentrations chlorine is then the only entity needed to predict thm species concentration in other instances an easily measurable or usually measured variable 5 the model could be used for operational and regulatory purposes with minimal measurements but further research is needed to understand how changes in operational conditions and quality of the water source affect the model parameters the model concept may also be extended to predict concentrations of other dbps however further experimentation and data analysis would be necessary for this purpose
