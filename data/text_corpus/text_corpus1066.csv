5330,water discharged from active abandoned and or reclaimed coal mine sites with relatively higher acidity continues to be a global concern due to variable impacts on the quality of surface water and groundwater treatment of such acid mine drainage amd is often complex costly and challenging towards this end this review provides an overview of the formation and effects of amd reviews prediction and treatment methods identifies critical research gaps and explores the associated challenges and opportunities amd poses for environmental scientists and researchers acid drainage occurs through oxidation of sulfide minerals such as pyrite the main sources of amd include runoff and seepage from mine rock dumps open pit mines stockpiles tailings construction rocks and rock cuts while different active and passive treatment systems are available to treat amd prevention techniques and integrated management approaches could better identify possible risks abate treatment costs and reduce eco hydrological hazards also the coal mining sector could benefit from remote and ground sensing techniques including the use of unmanned aerial vehicles and hyperspectral imaging for hydrogeochemical investigations effective treatment of acid drainage from mine areas reduces material damage allows resource reuse and recovery and enables successful post mine land use environmental scientists must however design and implement a proper framework to address amd in a timely manner while mining and treatment plans may vary with land use history climate topography hydrogeology available technology and socio political outlooks environmental scientists regulatory agencies and mining companies must make it a priority to form multidisciplinary partnerships advocate for effective enforcement of discharge standards encourage performance bonding and formulate remediation plans keywords acid base accounting acid mine drainage active treatment coal kinetic tests passive treatment pyrite 1 introduction although experiencing remarkable turmoil in the last few decades the coal industry is nevertheless a prominent source of power generation and one of the roots to economic growth and infrastructure development worldwide coal production reached 8612 4 million short tons mt in 2018 wca 2020 the dynamic realm of the coal market is globally recognized for example asia is expanding its coal mining and coal power generation largely driven by rapidly growing population economic expansion and energy demands wca 2020 the united states u s is one of the largest coal producers in the world with recoverable coal reserves totaling 252733 mt and the total production of 756 2 mt coal in 2018 table 1 national mining association 2019 surface coal mining underpins the shallow mining method to extract coal embedded in earth by removing overburden covering a coal seam it includes strip auger highwall open pit and area mining after mining coal companies reclaim sites by grading replacing topsoil and revegetation driven by specific set of soil air and water quality regulations and health and safety standards in the u s surface coal mining is mostly common in central appalachian ferrari et al 2009 pericak et al 2018 eastern states barnhisel and hower 1997 and the great plains hemish 1989 mamula 1978 martinez salazar 1985 vestal 1987 regions among others surface coal mining accounts for nearly 63 of the 679 total mines in the u s table 1 national mining association 2019 and dominates both the mining method and coal mine productivity table 2 coal mining has significant economic ecologic hydrologic and geomorphic ramifications recently feng et al 2019 reviewed the effects of surface mining and reclamation on the physical chemical and biological properties of fundamentally inter connected soil and they highlighted management needs and reclamation strategies for environmental protection others bonta 2000 bonta et al 1997 negley and eshleman 2006 have documented the hydrological impacts of surface mining those studies indicated that mining disturbance could alter water flowpaths and increase runoff erosion nutrient leaching and drainage subsurface void space and baseflow non point pollution for example acid drainage is highly likely when mining exposes sulfide minerals sulfide oxidation could furthermore initiate several in mine chemical reactions that adversely affect water quality mayo et al 2000 but after mining companies reclaim sites runoff attenuates water chemistry improves and recharge increases those effects however vary with reclamation methods climate hydrogeology vegetation and remediation bonding evans et al 2015 lines et al 1981 surber and simonton 2017 acid mine drainage amd continues to be a concern in coal mining because it reduces surface water and groundwater quality verburg et al 2009 and may perhaps persist for several years in the u s only amd pollutes over 20 000 km of streams skousen et al 2019 blasting and dewatering exposes sulfide minerals posing threats to environment treatment of amd is often complex costly and challenging but any discharge from mine sites ought to comply with local regional national and international laws and regulations such as the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra and the clean water act cwa in the u s zipper 2000 treatment costs may vary with site conditions composition of acid mine water and treatment methods globally governments and private companies spend millions of dollars each year in capital and operational costs to treat amd meet effluent limits and minimize environmental risks for example construction costs of keister wetlands in west virginia u s was nearly 225 000 1994 u s dollar value to treat amd by using passive biological system faulkner and skousen 1994 this review provides an overview of amd problems describes the state of the art methods in predicting preventing and treating amd and identifies critical research gaps along with the associated challenges and opportunities for additional research while the review focuses primarily on the u s the authors synthesize information from several other countries for better understanding of amd problems globally first this paper briefly discusses amd as a global environmental pollution and management issue followed by the chemistry of acid mine formation and the factors affecting it subsequently it addresses a wide range of amd prediction methods along with their strengths and weaknesses this review provides a comprehensive review of different prevention and treatment methods and the use of remote sensing techniques in mining operations the assessment of the cumulative impact of mining through material damage criteria and a guide to effective mine closure finally this paper discusses existing challenges and opportunities in amd treatments and proposes recommendations for amd treatments 2 amd a global concern acid mine drainage refers to water discharged from active inactive or abandoned mine and reclaimed areas with relatively higher total acidity compared with total alkalinity it encompasses several chemical biological and electrochemical reactions which the paper discusses in later sections different sources of amd include runoff from mine rock dumps and open pit mines tailings diffuse seeps construction rocks rock cuts chips and stockpiles among others fig 1 there are documentation of amd issues in different parts of the globe e g india equeenuddin et al 2010 swer and singh 2004 tiwary 2001 u s brady et al 1994 skousen et al 2019 canada ramasamy and power 2019 brazil silva et al 2013 south africa geldenhuis and bell 1998 ochieng et al 2017 and concurrently extensive research on characterization prediction prevention treatment and control measures have been ongoing for 50 years verburg et al 2009 acidic and metal rich water presents a major threat to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems besides human health reported effects of amd include increased levels of suspended solids mobilization of heavy metals decreased ph on water bodies and groundwater contamination entry of heavy metals into food chain and their uptake by plants and animals and degradation of drinking water ochieng et al 2017 geldenhuis and bell 1998 silva et al 2013 toxic metals in water may cause human and animal cells damage and diminution in the percentage of cell viability dutta et al 2019 effects due to acidic drainage differ with site land use history climate scale of mining geochemistry of overburden material and composition of mine water researchers largely discuss groundwater seepage of amd as a challenging and most problematic route while amd effects are multifold fig 2 they generally pollute water bodies according to the u s environmental protection agency epa environmental risks due to amd are second only to global warming and ozone depletion manders et al 2009 moodley et al 2018 mudd and weng 2012 3 chemistry of acid mine formation water discharged from mine sites may potentially comprise higher acidity due to the exposure of sulfide minerals to the atmosphere table 3 lists some of the selected sulfide minerals coal sulfur may occur in organic sulfur pyritic sulfur or sulfate sulfur forms pyritic sulfur occurs in its disulfide phase as pyrite and is chemically active pyrite oxidizes to ferrous iron sulfate and acidity the sequential reactions below eqs 1 4 depict the chemical weathering of pyrite blowes et al 2003 usepa 1994 1 fes2 7 2 o2 h2o fe2 2 so4 2 2h 2 fe2 1 4 o2 h fe3 ½ h2o 3 fe3 3h2o fe oh 3 3h 4 fes2 14 fe3 8 h2o 15 fe2 2 so4 2 16h eq 1 shows the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate and generation of h ions in presence of water and oxygen according to simate and ndlovu 2014 eq 1 relies on oxygen concentration ph 3 5 and bacterial activities the presence of thiobacillus and ferroplasma bacteria accelerate the oxidation process in the refuse the ferrous iron then oxidizes to ferric iron eq 2 this step is usually a slow process and many papers discuss this process as a rate determining step hallberg 2010 sahoo et al 2013 under abiotic condition when ph 5 the process is relatively slower but at ph 2 3 3 5 ferric iron in eq 2 precipitates as ferric hydroxide which tends to lower the ph of the solution simate and ndlovu 2014 in the eq 3 ferric iron hydrolyzes to ferric hydroxide the rate of formation varies with fluid ph for example the rate could surge rapidly at ph 4 ferric hydroxide precipitates to appear as white and yellow crust on surface of rocks and sediments some ferric iron formed during eq 2 may not play their part in fe oh 3 formation which possibly could oxidize pyrite eq 4 and produce ferrous iron sulfate and acids overall these reactions will increase h ions in the solution which lower ph to form acidic drains these reactions and acid formation will differ largely due to multiple and interactive factors as discussed next 4 factors affecting amd factors that affect amd include sulfur content acidity alkalinity ph distribution and mode of pyrite occurrence and interactions between calcium carbonate and pyrite among others fig 3 literature suggests that such factors vary with geographic locations and therefore prediction prevention and treatment must be site specific simate and ndlovu 2014 factors affecting amd fall within three broad categories generation factors oxygen water bacteria chemical factors acidity alkalinity and physical factors particle size permeability weathering hydrology pat espadas et al 2018 the ph has the most likely effect on amd which may function in conjunction with several other factors based on ph kirby 2014 classified mine drainage into five types type 1 ph 4 5 with iron aluminum and manganese metals and higher oxygen levels type 2 ph 6 0 with higher levels of ferrous iron manganese and dissolved solids type 3 alkaline with low to moderate levels of iron manganese and dissolved solids type 4 neutralized amd ph 6 0 with high levels of suspended particles and type 5 neutralized amd with high levels of dissolved solids and dissolved calcium and magnesium type 1 drainage is a primary mode of acidic drains a lower ph in acidic waters generally translates into higher electrical conductivity ec due to the dissolution of metals along with the oxidation of pyrite and mobility of metals occurring at lower ph equeenuddin et al 2010 the literature review herein indicates that the presence of iron sulfides and quantity of calcareous material affect the amount of acid and quality of drainage fig 3 similarly field studies support a strong co relation between pyrite morphology and amd caruccio et al 1977 geidel and caruccio 2000 pyrite may occur in different forms such as framboidal euhedral and anhedral but the decomposition of framboidal pyrites is critical to produce acid drainage non framboidal iron disulfides are less reactive and they decompose slowly and produce lower acids caruccio et al 1977 in general fine grained pyrites produce more acid than coarse grained pyrites many studies discuss the effects of paleoclimatic and paleodepositional environments on rock chemistry and distribution of minerals such as sulfides and carbonates for example caruccio et al 1977 observed that pyrite distribution and acid drainage in the appalachian coalfield of eastern kentucky u s was related to coal s paleoenvironment their findings explicitly demonstrated higher reactive pyrite in the lower delta plain sequence back barrier than the upper delta plain causing acid drainage paleoenvironmental factors could further modify or influence rock types and chemistry at a spatial scale for example brady et al 1998 detected rapid change in the amount of carbonates and stratigraphy at lateral spaces on surface mining sites in pennsylvania u s due to paleodeposition in summary forms of pyrite their occurrences and their interactions with carbonates may influence amd and therefore the study and examination of such factors is necessary to predict and control acid drainage as discussed next 5 prediction of amd mining operators should develop plans and control measures to prevent amd or design treatment systems appropriate to climate topography and regulatory requirements upon the prediction of amd risks and thereby to minimize potential ecological and human health issues regulations set forth in different countries require mining operators to analyze soil and overburden samples to identify potentially acid and toxic forming materials prior mining using either static or kinetic tests static tests evaluate if the given sample will generate acid whereas kinetic tests predict timings of acid production rates of acid generation and the assessment of the released elements dold 2017 according to skousen et al 2000 accurate prediction of amd depends on three principal factors overburden geochemistry overburden handling and placement and post mine hydrology upon the prediction of acid and toxic forming materials mining operators must cover those materials with non toxic and non combustible materials or treat them to correct acid drainage and minimize water pollution studies report that controlled placement of overburden materials and water management provide beneficial effects on regulating acid drainage sahoo et al 2013 other measures that correct acid drainage and minimize water pollution include diverting surface water away from the pyrite bearing spoil or passing it through alkaline materials mining operators could remove or isolate contaminated water from non contaminated water to substantially reduce acid formation also mining operators may impound the contaminated water in the structures that are non toxic forming and restrict oxygen diffusion skousen et al 2019 these measures also serve as preventive ways of reducing amd in coal mining areas 5 1 static tests acid base accounting aba first described in 1973 grube et al 1973 aba is a rapid and relatively cheap method of overburden analysis to determine either acid production potential app or acid neutralizing potential this method evaluates sulfide in the overburden sample based on the stoichiometry of complete pyrite oxidation and calculates app sobek et al 1978 using the eq 5 usepa 1994 5 app 31 25 percent s neutralization potential np represents the buffering effects of alkaline materials such as carbonates that neutralize acid by using the acid base titration method sobek et al 1978 this static test therefore connotes the balance between acid production and consumption if the net np value exceeds 20 kg caco3 t the sample is non acid generating but at values less than 20 kg caco3 t the sample will generate acids one can estimate acid generating potential by using neutralization potential ratio app np values less than one indicate acid generating samples during aba the pulverization of samples destroys their initial textures therefore many use the degree of sulfide and carbonate release to correct aba results elghali et al 2018 while aba method assumes all the sulfur in sample as reactive it neglects the manifestation of gypsum and other non reactive sulfur minerals this assumption of aba method potentially leads to overestimation of np by three ways dissolution of ph regulating minerals through strong acid usage reaction of iron and manganese carbonates with acid and precipitation of metal hydroxides during the titration with sodium hydroxide usepa 1994 dold 2017 reviewed static and kinetic tests used in acid rock drainage prediction and suggested that the calculation factor of 31 25 overestimates neutralization potential of carbonate by roughly 100 additionally aba underestimated acid potential of fe3 hydroxides and sulfates and failed to discern different carbonate minerals however yucel and baba 2016 compared different static tests such as paste ph and electrical conductivity aba and net acid generation test to predict amd in the etili open pit mine in turkey they observed uniformity between the results and the association of amd with mine waste and altered volcanic rocks usepa 1994 provided a comparison between the aba method and other static methods such as the modified aba bc research initial alkaline production potential and net acid production table 4 the modified aba method excludes non sulfide sources in sulfur assuming sulfate as a non acid producing source this assumption leads to underestimation of app when jarosite is present in large quantities in waste materials usepa 1994 nevertheless aba serves as a useful method to make treatment decisions in acidic areas skousen et al 2002 used aba to evaluate the quality of overburden prior mining and to predict the drainage quality after mining for different sites in west virginia u s they found that the aba simulations were accurate for 50 out of 52 sites tested studies indicate that accurate prediction of app fundamentally depends on volume of samples to better represent and incorporate geologic heterogeneity within a site however caruccio and geidel 1986 criticized the aba method for not relating to kinetic data that affect weathering of mine rocks which calls for additional studies and selection of kinetic tests 5 2 kinetic tests kinetic tests examine long term acid generating and acid neutralizing potentials using chemical analysis of leachates on humidity cells or columns scientists and professionals have been using humidity cells experiments to study acid consuming potential of calcites in several waste rocks langman et al 2019 tests in humidity cells are relatively faster than in columns and differ in sample mass and the number and duration of flush drainage cycles table 5 shows the comparison between humidity cells and column tests in a study benzaazoua et al 2001 compared two different kinetic tests humidity cells and the column tests for sulfide mine tailings which showed very little difference in oxidation neutralization rate of minerals banerjee 2014 performed kinetic tests on overburden samples that showed high acid generation potential and observed better neutralizing capacity than oxidative capacity of the samples but banerjee also reported risks of acid generation due to accelerated rates of carbonate weathering and dissolution and depletion of neutralizing materials in the study system the oxidation of sulfides depends on a number of factors like micro textures grain size temperature humidity bacterial activity and oxidants dold 2017 bouzahzah et al 2014 compared kinetic tests against sobek static tests and mineralogical static tests in synthetic tailing samples and provided recommendations for better prediction of amd however considering the amount of time consumed in kinetic tests along with the production of large dataset with inconclusive results one must conclude that mineral characterization and quantification could be one of the predictive tools for amd if available dold 2017 scientists and researchers are increasingly using x ray diffraction fluorescence analyses or micro computed tomography inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy for mineral characterization that quantify modal mineralogy and predict the degree of sulfide release dold 2017 gottlieb et al 2000 elghali et al 2018 used mineralogical and chemical characterization to estimate net acid generating potential of waste rocks from the open pit mine in abitibi canada results showed that sulfides primarily consisted of fine to mid sized fractions also the fine sized sulfides were highly reactive and had utmost liberation but the liberation was negligible when size exceeded 2 4 mm the study also proposed diameter of physical locking of sulfides as a new parameter to access amd this diameter connotes particle size above which sulfides are locked by non sulfide minerals i e 2 4 mm in this study therefore scientists and researchers can determine reactive fraction and use it to predict amd and plan for drainage management yet they must use the column tests to validate the results 5 3 amdtreat studies indicate increasing use of amdtreat as a method to predict and recommend treatment for acid mine drainage waters cravotta et al 2015 2010 amdtreat is a computer based application jointly developed by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection the west virginia department of environmental protection u s geological survey and the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement in 2003 in recent years scientists researchers and mining operators have been using amdtreat to estimate quantity of caustic chemicals naoh cao ca oh 2 na2co3 and nh3 effluent quality and sludge volume produced during treatments cravotta et al 2015 2010 table 6 provides a summary of the caustic equivalents used by amdtreat to treat acidic water amdtreat estimates the costs incurred to treat acid mine discharge using different chemical treatment and constructed wetland systems it consists of more than 400 variables that users can modify as necessary to best estimate the costs of developing treatment systems revegetation water sampling surveying sludge removal chemical consumption among others for both past and future projects different tools embedded within the amdtreat allow actual site specific financial forecasting and calculation of the recapitalization cost langelier saturation index acidity flow sulfate reduction mass balance oxidation abiotic homogeneous fe2 oxidation biotic homogeneous fe2 oxidation ph averaging metric conversion chemical cost conversion and pert statistics osmre 2020 for example a sulfate reduction calculator estimates sulfate loading and the volume of organic matter required to reduce sulfate based on the specific sulfate reduction rate of constructed wetlands amdtreat consists of two geochemical phreeq modules un aerated phreeq and pre aerated phreeq to compute amd treatment costs chemical consumption chemical composition of treated effluents and volume of byproducts cravotta et al 2015 osmre 2020 in an un aerated phreeq module user uses water quality analysis data as an input which includes the amount of ferrous iron and inorganic carbon by using the software users can also estimate the amount of ferrous iron which largely depends on user defined total iron concentration and ph of water it simulates the use of caustic chemical to fresh effluent which may contain limited to no dissolved o2 but relatively higher concentration of co2 pre aerated phreeq however allows for the simulation of pre areated co2 using log pco2 values to bring water to equilibrium with the atmosphere and complete oxidation of ferrous iron and manganese osmre 2020 for different treatment phs these modules simulate effluent standards for additional details see cravotta et al 2015 and https amd osmre gov 6 prevention and treatment of amd this review indicates the utmost importance of prevention techniques to sustainably reduce amd problems in coal mining and to ensure effective mine closure park et al 2019 preventive methods eliminate or reduce amd generation by protecting sulfide from exposure to air and water during disturbance kefeni et al 2017 preventive methods could include land based storage in sealed heaps blending acidic materials with acid consuming materials solidification of tailings use of anoxic surfactants and microencapsulation johnson and hallberg 2005 studies also recommend other surface based techniques to prevent amd such as dry cover water cover oxygen consuming cover e g wood waste and subaqueous tailing disposal kefeni et al 2017 the proper handling of earth materials groundwater discharge and runoff by facilitating the use of best technology available and ensuring the use of drainage control revegetation diversion of runoff and water treatment facilities protect surface and groundwater bodies during mining and reclamation oac 2016 the u s epa developed the sequential steps and framework to prevent and treat amd in abandoned mine sites usepa 1997 which remains valuable for active mining operations we modified these sequential steps and framework in fig 4 which provide guidance for the treatment of acidic drains and highlight the roles of multiple stakeholders such as governmental and non governmental agencies and organizations communities industries citizens and civic groups and their multi disciplinary partnerships for planning reclamation and remediation 6 1 treatment of amd once amd forms mining operators need to isolate neutralize or remove it by exploiting different abiotic and biotic processes kefeni et al 2017 johnson and hallberg 2005 reviewed and discussed different abiotic and biological measures each comprising active and passive ways to remediate amd for example an active abiotic system could include aeration and addition of lime whereas a passive abiotic system comprises anoxic limestone drains active biological systems include sulfidogenic bioreactors whereas passive biological systems include wetlands permeable reactive barriers and packed bed iron oxidation bioreactors generally treatments are either active or passive active systems use chemicals and passive systems use natural treatment media 6 1 1 active treatment active treatment refers to the addition of alkaline chemicals such as ca oh 2 cao naoh na2co3 and nh3 to polluted mine water or effluents table 6 two commonly used chemical treatment methods include high density sludge and the chemsulphidetm process ali et al 2019 the former method utilizes neutralizing reagents cao naoh to raise ph and to precipitate metals in sludge while the later utilizes sulfide reagent nahs or na2s alkaline chemicals raise ph oxidize ferrous iron and precipitate metals in hydroxides and carbonates forms johnson and hallberg 2005 according to siebert et al 2019 four major processes comprise the active treatment of amd precipitation sulfate reduction ion exchange absorption adsorption and filtration and crystallization the sequential reactions depicting the dissolution of calcium carbonate in water appear below where dissolution of carbonates hinge on partial pressure of carbon dioxide gas eqs 6 8 usepa 1994 6 caco3 h2o ca2 hco3 oh 7 hco3 h2o h2co3 oh 8 h2co3 co2 h2o webb and sasowsky 1994 indicated that a combined effect of acid neutralization through carbonic acid dissociation and acid neutralization by carbonate dissolution provides an improved treatment of amd of different alkaline chemicals naoh establishes 100 neutralization efficiency as it completely dissociates in water to raise the water ph table 7 kefeni et al 2017 scientists and researchers use naoh in low flow environments when acidity is high however naoh is relatively expensive generates ferric hydroxide sludge and is difficult to handle in cold weather skousen et al 1996 usepa 1997 table 7 shows the advantages and disadvantages of different chemicals including naoh in active treatments climate mine water composition and operation costs largely determine the use of chemical treatments ali et al 2018 there are several other active treatment options that are in use for example chen et al 2015 studied the short term and long term hydrological effects of dry flue gas desulfurization product fgd and observed that fgd product could remediate acidic surface coal mined sites the ph of surface runoff increased to 7 or higher after 20 years peiravi et al 2017 used a cathode chamber under aerobic condition for bio electrochemical treatment of amd from abandoned coal mines mulopo 2015 used an alkaline barium calcium desalination process to treat amd and observed the sulfate reduction to very low levels and the recovery of barium carbonates active treatment is more suitable for operating mines it is a relatively low cost technology cost however varies with the chemicals and labor involved it may entail a long term commitment fripp et al 2000 also whilst treating acidic water scientists should equally consider recycling and recovery of raw materials from sludge fig 5 provides a schematic representation of active treatment methods involving alkaline chemicals and resource recovery 6 1 2 passive treatment passive systems rely on natural treatment media and construction materials to treat acidic water through biological physical geochemical and gravitational mechanisms siebert et al 2019 zipper et al 2018 passive treatments include wetlands anoxic limestone drains open limestone channels vertical flow systems and other systems such as limestone ponds limestone sand beds and limestone diversion wells zipper et al 2018 passive treatment methods are more suitable for abandoned mines ali et al 2019 and several studies have documented their usage blowes et al 2003 gazea et al 1996 hedin et al 1994 kaur et al 2018 nordstrom 2009 pat espadas et al 2018 skousen et al 2019 zipper et al 2018 for example different passive treatments their design factors and organic substrates pertinent to sulfate removal are available from an earlier review by skousen et al 2017 similar to active treatment options the use and efficacy of passive systems also differ with climate mine water composition and operational costs for example ali et al 2020 studied the effects of temperature 22 and 5 c and salinity 0 and 20 g l 1 on the efficacy of passive biochemical reactors and observed lower efficiency at low temperature and high salinity for synthetic amd treatments garcía valero et al 2020 tested marl sandstone and calcareous crust in a batch experiment and observed increased ph and reduced metal concentration by precipitation for all three alkaline materials efficiency of metals removal however differed with the particle size of alkaline materials and contact time between alkaline materials and amd they attained a complete removable of pb fe and cu when the particle size of these materials were 10 20 mm similarly they found that a contact time of six minutes between marl and amd reduced metals literature indicates the wide use of constructed wetlands for low cost treatment of amd where utilized emergent and submergent vegetation and microorganisms remediate contaminated water qasaimeh et al 2015 acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and a ferrooxidans are two autotrophic iron and sulfur oxidizing microbes commonly found in constructed wetlands nicomrat et al 2006 2008 constructed wetlands generally incur low cost and maintenance compared with active treatments but acid neutralization potential largely depends on climatic events a survey of 142 constructed wetlands in eastern u s showed that approximately 50 wetlands reduced h concentration by 68 acidity by 67 and so4 by 8 wieder 1989 efficiency may however vary with area depth organic substrates plants used and wastewater composition among other factors more details on constructed wetlands and operational guidelines are available from brodie et al 1988 johnson and hallberg 2005 pat espadas et al 2018 perry and kleinmann 1991 and sheridan et al 2018 therefore this review is primarily focused on anaerobic wetlands bactericides technologies and integrated methods anaerobic wetlands are natural wetlands but engineered biologically to reduce amd fig 6 using the dissimilatory sulfate reduction dmr technique moodley et al 2018 dmr takes advantage of sulfate reducing bacteria and organic substrates as carbon sources to remove sulfides moodley et al 2018 three major groups of organic substrates used in sulfate removal include easily available materials soluble sugars starch amino acids and proteins cellulose and hemicellulose and lignin skousen et al 2017 the designs of anaerobic wetlands exclude plants to treat a wide range of pollutants siebert et al 2019 but generally for 3 5 g acidity m 2 day 1 and 10 g fe m 2 day 1 rates of removal skousen et al 2017 these anaerobic wetlands consist of limestone and gravel bedrock about 15 30 cm thick layer underneath a permeable organic substrate of 30 60 cm to increase alkalinity water flows into the organic substrate where bacteria remove o2 zipper et al 2018 sulfate reducing bacteria convert sulfur to sulfides which undergo reduction reaction to form hydrogen sulfide and bicarbonates eq 9 bicarbonates that form in anaerobic wetlands raise ph and remove metals as hydroxides and oxyhydroxides 9 so4 2 2 ch2o h2s 2 hco3 anaerobic wetlands can be reducing and alkalinity producing system raps successive alkalinity producing system saps or permeable reactive barriers prbs for details on each of these systems refer to siebert et al 2019 anaerobic wetlands bestow several advantages including removal of metals and sulfate stabilization of metal precipitates lowering sludge volume enhancing ecological integrity increasing habitat for birds and biodiversity and lowering maintenance cost moodley et al 2018 overall passive systems can reduce acidic drains by 50 but their performance is however site specific and largely influenced by biogeochemical and physical processes kaur et al 2018 table 8 lists advantages and disadvantages of active and passive treatment systems apart from sulfate and iron manganese mn also occurs in acidic drains at higher levels affecting water quality cheong et al 2010 karathanasis et al 2010 neculita and rosa 2019 mn is autocatalytic with high sorption capacity for other metals cr cu pb hg ni zn a high ph will possibly increase mn requisitioning in colloids suspended particulate matter and sediments whereas a low ph induces reductive dissolution of oxyhydroxides to further increase mn levels and or release trace elements passive systems such as open limestone beds can remove mn by oxidizing and precipitating mn which is mediated by mn ii oxidizing microbes mn oxide coated limestone improves performance in mn ii removal beds mussel shells can also remove mn by more than 35 mccauley et al 2009 studies reported removal efficiencies of 10 to as high as100 in bioreactor batch experiments with mushroom compost substrates karathanasis et al 2010 song et al 2012 generally mn removal is challenging due to higher solubility and it warrants further research for additional details on the prevalence effects treatments and challenges of mn removal from acidic drains refer to neculita and rosa 2019 6 2 other treatments 6 2 1 bactericide treatment systems promac a bactericide system developed in the 1980s by bfgoodrich company used spray liquid and controlled release pellets to inhibit iron oxidizing bacteria at a source point promac treatment systems eliminated thiobacillus ferrooxidans the iron oxidizing bacteria and thereby reduced amd sobek and rastogi 1986 identified four step approach of using promac to abate amd which includes problem identification proposing treatment supervising the use of controlled release bactericides and monitoring treatment and its effectiveness guerrero and oliver 1999 reported that promac promoted the proliferation of beneficial heterotrophic bacteria such as acidiphilium researchers use bactericides directly to the effluents or as intimate mixtures blowes et al 2003 sobek et al 1990 used controlled release bactericides to reclaim coal refuse areas in east springfield ohio and dawmont west virginia and reported that bactericides reduced amd and facilitated vegetation growth and development for extended years the production and use of this bactericides technology however ceased during late 1990s gusek 2018 nonetheless studies indicate that heterotrophic biofilms and bactericides technologies are rapidly developing and extensively scrutinized to reduce iron oxidizing bacteria kalin et al 2018 moodley et al 2018 in a microcosm study jin et al 2008 observed that microbial inoculum could raise water ph and reduce concentration of al as cu fe pb ni and zn metals zhang and wang 2017 observed anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate as an effective bactericide technology that suppressed iron oxidation caused by thiobacillus ferroxidans more studies are however necessary to confirm or refute benefits from such bactericides technologies 6 2 2 industrial by products and wastes other treatments include use of industrial by products such as basic oxygen furnace slag and argon oxygen decarburization slag from steel industries to potentially remove sulfate from acidic drains moodley et al 2018 mussel shell is another waste material with high acid neutralizing potential with 80 wt caco3 moodley et al 2018 and as such butler et al 2019 diloreto et al 2016 and weber et al 2008 among others have used mussel shell to reduce amd risks researchers more recently tested and used biochar to reduce heavy metals from amd wibowo and naswir 2019 for example giachini et al 2018 used poultry litter biochar enriched with three sulfate reducing bacteria sources sediments from amd cattle manure and domestic activated sewage sludge to treat amd from coalmine pond in brazil and observed 41 reduction in sulfate with cow manure sulfate reducing bacteria enriched biochar in summary different methods are available to treat amd and to remove metals from acidic drains but their combination with a passive system could improve performance and lower treatment costs as discussed next 6 2 3 holistic and integrated approach integrated approaches use a combination of different methods and are efficient ways to treat amd masindi 2017 wei et al 2018 kefeni et al 2017 suggested a holistic approach such as resource recovery and reuse to control amd naidu et al 2019 suggested the integration of membrane techniques with active and passive remediation systems to facilitate water reuse geldenhuys 2003 integrated synthetic organic polymers with limestone treatments and used those as coagulant and flocculent to remove suspended and colloidal substances masindi 2017 used an integrated approach with cryptocrystalline magnesite for pre treatment of amd and barium chloride to eliminate residual sulfate from an aqueous system results indicated the removal of 99 heavy metals and 40 sulfate with magnesite and the removable of 99 residual sulfate with barium integrated assessment of amd and treatment of waste and effluents therefore prevent and reduce acidic water but the effects are largely site and treatment specific more studies on integrated technologies are however warranted in the treatment of amd and recovery of resources 7 remote and ground sensing techniques in amd studies remote and ground sensing techniques are popular and cost effective ways to map land use and land cover delineate groundwater potential zones kumar and krishna 2018 analyze ground subsidence baek et al 2008 study coal fires and fires related emissions saraf et al 1995 zhang et al 2004 detect near surface interfaces strange et al 2005 access hydrologic conditions and amd ebraheem et al 1990 kumar and krishna 2018 develop water treatment plans jin et al 2008a b and to accomplish other tasks ebraheem et al 1990 used vertical electrical sounding and horizontal resistivity profiling to study amd at a reclaimed coal mine site near wheatland indiana u s results showed a strong negative relationship between resistivity and total dissolved solids moreover oxidation dissolution and infiltration of iron disulfides resulted in the contamination of wheatland aquifer in northeastern india blahwar et al 2012 used high resolution satellite imagery to study amd in artisanal coal mining results indicated an acidic drain problem due to dissolution of pyrites and highlighted potential use of satellite imagery to largely identify iron precipitates on streambeds moreover others used remote sensing techniques to facilitate amd treatment methods for example in tennessee u s a biological source treatment method utilized remote sensing for down hole injection of microbial inoculum to prevent sulfides oxidation jin et al 2008a b drones or unmanned aerial vehicles uavs equipped with active or passive sensors are rapidly evolving and increasingly being tested as non intrusive remote sensing machineries for surveying terrains and developing digital models promptly collecting water quality samples banerjee et al 2018 and mapping and monitoring such coal mining areas and water pollution issues as acidic drains by using multi and hyperspectral imaging kirsch et al 2018 herrmann et al 2019 in a recent review ren et al 2019 discussed the development and application of uavs and challenges and opportunities of using them in a mining sector among different uavs available fixed wing and multi rotar wing uavs are common in mining ren et al 2019 jackisch et al 2018 used drone based hyperspectral imaging to monitor amd in litov tailings in the sokolov district czech republic where they identified the association of acidic drains with jarosite and goethite minerals and validated iron absorption bands in uav hyperspectral images by using ground truth spectroscopy while studies based on uavs are relatively safe flexible efficient economical and precise such studies remain few thus there is a need for more of such research for the effective use of remote sensing techniques in understanding coal mine production gathering soil and water samples and integrating hyperspectral images with field based hydrological and geochemical data 8 material damage criteria and mine closure in the u s researchers and regulatory agencies developed material damage criteria to access the cumulative impact of mining to water availability and changes in ph total dissolved solids total suspended solids iron and manganese among others these criteria signify water quality standards established under the epa 40 code of federal regulations cfr and are also important to determine the cumulative impact during mining and reclamation phase to control water pollution for example a desirable ph range is 6 0 9 0 iron content is 7 0 mg l and total suspended solid content is 70 0 mg l worrall et al 2009 highlighted 14 criteria and 72 indicators for the sustainable development and use of legacy mine lands in australia that are abandoned derelict and orphan lands in their study they recognized amd as one of the environmental criteria to determine the success of post mine land use effective treatment of acid drainage prevents material damage determines the success of mine closure and reclamation and enables sustainable development of post mine lands in a recent report young et al 2019 suggested a 6 step framework to guide effective mine closure and completion determining post mine land use setting realistic and achievable mining closure objectives selecting references and setting targets establishing risk based prioritization of post mine land use and closure plans developing completion criteria and monitoring reclamation plans against completion criteria completion criteria are of utmost importance to determine success of reclamation to achieve closure objectives and to ensure environmental sustainability young et al 2019 studies indicate a wide use of pre disturbance conditions as reference conditions in post mine planning but they require adequate baseline data such data may include different physio chemical biological and geological attributes surface water quality groundwater quality hydraulic conductivity electrical conductivity cation exchange capacity ph sediment loss and vegetation among others the baseline data are also important for assessing water quality after amd treatment in the absence of such adequate data scientists agencies and researchers often used or suggested a similar site or a conceptual model young et al 2019 in summary while effective mine closure prevents amd risks prevention and control of amd dictates the post mine land use success 9 challenges and opportunities amd studies treatment methods and control measures are not without challenges below this study highlights major challenges and opportunities in preventing and treating acidic mine waters 1 there is a need for regular monitoring of acid drainage and water quality from overburden rock dumps refuse piles mine tailings and diffuse seeps to determine emerging problems sought proper treatment designs and reclaim mine sites for future use use of baseline data paleo depositional information and geochemical models wherever possible would improve amd prediction and control effective treatment of acid drainage from mine areas offers opportunities for resource reuse and recovery of such substances as ferric hydroxide ferrite sulfur and sulfuric acids kefeni et al 2017 rakotonimaro et al 2017 and post mine land usage recovery of gypsum calcite and ferrihydrite is possible from the sludge which could be used as raw materials in cement manufacturing scientists and researchers used two different methods to recover dissolved metals and water from amd 1 ph dependent methods selective precipitation selective adsorption and selective ion exchange and 2 ph independent methods electro dialysis microfiltration ultrafiltration nano filtration reverse osmosis and membrane distillation simate and ndlovu 2014 opportunities also exist to generate electricity and produce iron pigments during wastewater treatment by using microbial fuel cells mfc technology however no single technology could effectively eliminate dissolved metals and therefore simate and ndlovu 2014 recommended a combination of different systems 2 static and kinetic tests are associated with large uncertainties and results are often difficult to interpret usepa 1994 developing a standard kinetic test could potentially reduce uncertainties and errors in analytical results more research is however warranted to develop examine and enact new tests and techniques also there are multiple opportunities to use uavs and hyperspectral imaging in active and abandoned mines and reclamation areas for monitoring water pollution including amd and developing treatment plans 3 climatic change and associated variability in weather events such as drought rainfall and snowmelt runoff is an emerging challenge and could modify flushing effects amd generation and treatments hotton et al 2020 nordstrom 2009 a dry spell followed by first flush event could increase sulfate concentration gzyl and banks 2007 nordstrom 2009 younger and blachere 2004 the effect may however decrease after attaining a peak discharge level generally drought will increase low flow conditions and reduce carbonate containing groundwater which escalates acid concentration in drainage water nordstrom 2009 increased temperature will likely increase oxidation and sulfuration and the release of heavy metals fu and lu 2018 also intense rainstorm events will increase dissolution of sulfates treatment plans and measures are also susceptible to the impacts of climate change for example covers with capillary barrier effects ccbe are sensitive to precipitation events increased moisture from precipitation events will maintain saturation of moisture retaining layer and therefore reduce acid drainage whereas drought could accelerate desaturation and amd formation hotton et al 2020 as such environmental scientists and mining companies need to account for climate variability and flush out events in developing and targeting treatment plans nordstrom 2009 4 mine closures that adhere a properly designed and implemented framework in a timely manner may prevent amd risks and vice versa challenges and opportunities exist for multidisciplinary partnerships among agencies organizations industries and general public for problem assessment treatment planning funding and remediation 5 spontaneous combustion of coal waste piles represents a special category of mining waste problems and may emit heavy metals into the atmosphere which later deposit into aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems wang et al 2016 mcconnell and edwards 2008 reported the deposition of heavy metals and bio magnification risks in artic ecosystems further studies on spontaneous combustion of coal wastes atmospheric deposition of heavy metals and the potential for acid leaching are necessary 6 developing and implementing cost effective treatments is challenging but crucial designing and implementation of treatment methods must consider local settings to ensure post mining safety and land use each mining project is peculiar and the science of mine drainage prediction continues to evolve also codes of mining regulations vary with states and countries unveiling needs for site specific framework and criteria while plans may vary with sites land use history mines available technology eco hydrological settings socio economic conditions political outlooks collaboration among multiple stakeholders long term monitoring effective enforcement of effluent limitation treatment standards and performance bonding must be a priority 10 conclusions and recommendations this paper reviewed different methods of amd prediction prevention and treatment and identified critical research gaps challenges and opportunities the literature in general suggests that amd can affect water quality and post mine land use depending on multiple interactive factors this review draws the following important conclusions 1 amd effects are multifarious and therefore future studies should focus on characterization prediction prevention long term monitoring and effective treatment of amd 2 scientists and researchers use both static and kinetic tests to predict amd risks new tests are however warranted to potentially reduce uncertainties and errors in analytical results 3 mineral characterization and quantification could be one of the predictive tools and therefore require further studies 4 amd risks demand developing site specific plans and control measures depending on land use history climate topography hydrogeology and regulatory requirements 5 mining sector and amd studies could benefit from the use of emerging uavs and hyperspectral imaging technology in active and abandoned mines and reclamation areas for hydrogeochemical investigations 6 different active and passive treatment systems bactericides technologies and industrial by products and wastes are available to reduce amd problems in coal mining however preventive methods integrated treatments and multidisciplinary partnerships are necessary to understand the complexity of multiple factors and acid drainage to curtail material damage and to ensure effective

5330,water discharged from active abandoned and or reclaimed coal mine sites with relatively higher acidity continues to be a global concern due to variable impacts on the quality of surface water and groundwater treatment of such acid mine drainage amd is often complex costly and challenging towards this end this review provides an overview of the formation and effects of amd reviews prediction and treatment methods identifies critical research gaps and explores the associated challenges and opportunities amd poses for environmental scientists and researchers acid drainage occurs through oxidation of sulfide minerals such as pyrite the main sources of amd include runoff and seepage from mine rock dumps open pit mines stockpiles tailings construction rocks and rock cuts while different active and passive treatment systems are available to treat amd prevention techniques and integrated management approaches could better identify possible risks abate treatment costs and reduce eco hydrological hazards also the coal mining sector could benefit from remote and ground sensing techniques including the use of unmanned aerial vehicles and hyperspectral imaging for hydrogeochemical investigations effective treatment of acid drainage from mine areas reduces material damage allows resource reuse and recovery and enables successful post mine land use environmental scientists must however design and implement a proper framework to address amd in a timely manner while mining and treatment plans may vary with land use history climate topography hydrogeology available technology and socio political outlooks environmental scientists regulatory agencies and mining companies must make it a priority to form multidisciplinary partnerships advocate for effective enforcement of discharge standards encourage performance bonding and formulate remediation plans keywords acid base accounting acid mine drainage active treatment coal kinetic tests passive treatment pyrite 1 introduction although experiencing remarkable turmoil in the last few decades the coal industry is nevertheless a prominent source of power generation and one of the roots to economic growth and infrastructure development worldwide coal production reached 8612 4 million short tons mt in 2018 wca 2020 the dynamic realm of the coal market is globally recognized for example asia is expanding its coal mining and coal power generation largely driven by rapidly growing population economic expansion and energy demands wca 2020 the united states u s is one of the largest coal producers in the world with recoverable coal reserves totaling 252733 mt and the total production of 756 2 mt coal in 2018 table 1 national mining association 2019 surface coal mining underpins the shallow mining method to extract coal embedded in earth by removing overburden covering a coal seam it includes strip auger highwall open pit and area mining after mining coal companies reclaim sites by grading replacing topsoil and revegetation driven by specific set of soil air and water quality regulations and health and safety standards in the u s surface coal mining is mostly common in central appalachian ferrari et al 2009 pericak et al 2018 eastern states barnhisel and hower 1997 and the great plains hemish 1989 mamula 1978 martinez salazar 1985 vestal 1987 regions among others surface coal mining accounts for nearly 63 of the 679 total mines in the u s table 1 national mining association 2019 and dominates both the mining method and coal mine productivity table 2 coal mining has significant economic ecologic hydrologic and geomorphic ramifications recently feng et al 2019 reviewed the effects of surface mining and reclamation on the physical chemical and biological properties of fundamentally inter connected soil and they highlighted management needs and reclamation strategies for environmental protection others bonta 2000 bonta et al 1997 negley and eshleman 2006 have documented the hydrological impacts of surface mining those studies indicated that mining disturbance could alter water flowpaths and increase runoff erosion nutrient leaching and drainage subsurface void space and baseflow non point pollution for example acid drainage is highly likely when mining exposes sulfide minerals sulfide oxidation could furthermore initiate several in mine chemical reactions that adversely affect water quality mayo et al 2000 but after mining companies reclaim sites runoff attenuates water chemistry improves and recharge increases those effects however vary with reclamation methods climate hydrogeology vegetation and remediation bonding evans et al 2015 lines et al 1981 surber and simonton 2017 acid mine drainage amd continues to be a concern in coal mining because it reduces surface water and groundwater quality verburg et al 2009 and may perhaps persist for several years in the u s only amd pollutes over 20 000 km of streams skousen et al 2019 blasting and dewatering exposes sulfide minerals posing threats to environment treatment of amd is often complex costly and challenging but any discharge from mine sites ought to comply with local regional national and international laws and regulations such as the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra and the clean water act cwa in the u s zipper 2000 treatment costs may vary with site conditions composition of acid mine water and treatment methods globally governments and private companies spend millions of dollars each year in capital and operational costs to treat amd meet effluent limits and minimize environmental risks for example construction costs of keister wetlands in west virginia u s was nearly 225 000 1994 u s dollar value to treat amd by using passive biological system faulkner and skousen 1994 this review provides an overview of amd problems describes the state of the art methods in predicting preventing and treating amd and identifies critical research gaps along with the associated challenges and opportunities for additional research while the review focuses primarily on the u s the authors synthesize information from several other countries for better understanding of amd problems globally first this paper briefly discusses amd as a global environmental pollution and management issue followed by the chemistry of acid mine formation and the factors affecting it subsequently it addresses a wide range of amd prediction methods along with their strengths and weaknesses this review provides a comprehensive review of different prevention and treatment methods and the use of remote sensing techniques in mining operations the assessment of the cumulative impact of mining through material damage criteria and a guide to effective mine closure finally this paper discusses existing challenges and opportunities in amd treatments and proposes recommendations for amd treatments 2 amd a global concern acid mine drainage refers to water discharged from active inactive or abandoned mine and reclaimed areas with relatively higher total acidity compared with total alkalinity it encompasses several chemical biological and electrochemical reactions which the paper discusses in later sections different sources of amd include runoff from mine rock dumps and open pit mines tailings diffuse seeps construction rocks rock cuts chips and stockpiles among others fig 1 there are documentation of amd issues in different parts of the globe e g india equeenuddin et al 2010 swer and singh 2004 tiwary 2001 u s brady et al 1994 skousen et al 2019 canada ramasamy and power 2019 brazil silva et al 2013 south africa geldenhuis and bell 1998 ochieng et al 2017 and concurrently extensive research on characterization prediction prevention treatment and control measures have been ongoing for 50 years verburg et al 2009 acidic and metal rich water presents a major threat to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems besides human health reported effects of amd include increased levels of suspended solids mobilization of heavy metals decreased ph on water bodies and groundwater contamination entry of heavy metals into food chain and their uptake by plants and animals and degradation of drinking water ochieng et al 2017 geldenhuis and bell 1998 silva et al 2013 toxic metals in water may cause human and animal cells damage and diminution in the percentage of cell viability dutta et al 2019 effects due to acidic drainage differ with site land use history climate scale of mining geochemistry of overburden material and composition of mine water researchers largely discuss groundwater seepage of amd as a challenging and most problematic route while amd effects are multifold fig 2 they generally pollute water bodies according to the u s environmental protection agency epa environmental risks due to amd are second only to global warming and ozone depletion manders et al 2009 moodley et al 2018 mudd and weng 2012 3 chemistry of acid mine formation water discharged from mine sites may potentially comprise higher acidity due to the exposure of sulfide minerals to the atmosphere table 3 lists some of the selected sulfide minerals coal sulfur may occur in organic sulfur pyritic sulfur or sulfate sulfur forms pyritic sulfur occurs in its disulfide phase as pyrite and is chemically active pyrite oxidizes to ferrous iron sulfate and acidity the sequential reactions below eqs 1 4 depict the chemical weathering of pyrite blowes et al 2003 usepa 1994 1 fes2 7 2 o2 h2o fe2 2 so4 2 2h 2 fe2 1 4 o2 h fe3 ½ h2o 3 fe3 3h2o fe oh 3 3h 4 fes2 14 fe3 8 h2o 15 fe2 2 so4 2 16h eq 1 shows the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate and generation of h ions in presence of water and oxygen according to simate and ndlovu 2014 eq 1 relies on oxygen concentration ph 3 5 and bacterial activities the presence of thiobacillus and ferroplasma bacteria accelerate the oxidation process in the refuse the ferrous iron then oxidizes to ferric iron eq 2 this step is usually a slow process and many papers discuss this process as a rate determining step hallberg 2010 sahoo et al 2013 under abiotic condition when ph 5 the process is relatively slower but at ph 2 3 3 5 ferric iron in eq 2 precipitates as ferric hydroxide which tends to lower the ph of the solution simate and ndlovu 2014 in the eq 3 ferric iron hydrolyzes to ferric hydroxide the rate of formation varies with fluid ph for example the rate could surge rapidly at ph 4 ferric hydroxide precipitates to appear as white and yellow crust on surface of rocks and sediments some ferric iron formed during eq 2 may not play their part in fe oh 3 formation which possibly could oxidize pyrite eq 4 and produce ferrous iron sulfate and acids overall these reactions will increase h ions in the solution which lower ph to form acidic drains these reactions and acid formation will differ largely due to multiple and interactive factors as discussed next 4 factors affecting amd factors that affect amd include sulfur content acidity alkalinity ph distribution and mode of pyrite occurrence and interactions between calcium carbonate and pyrite among others fig 3 literature suggests that such factors vary with geographic locations and therefore prediction prevention and treatment must be site specific simate and ndlovu 2014 factors affecting amd fall within three broad categories generation factors oxygen water bacteria chemical factors acidity alkalinity and physical factors particle size permeability weathering hydrology pat espadas et al 2018 the ph has the most likely effect on amd which may function in conjunction with several other factors based on ph kirby 2014 classified mine drainage into five types type 1 ph 4 5 with iron aluminum and manganese metals and higher oxygen levels type 2 ph 6 0 with higher levels of ferrous iron manganese and dissolved solids type 3 alkaline with low to moderate levels of iron manganese and dissolved solids type 4 neutralized amd ph 6 0 with high levels of suspended particles and type 5 neutralized amd with high levels of dissolved solids and dissolved calcium and magnesium type 1 drainage is a primary mode of acidic drains a lower ph in acidic waters generally translates into higher electrical conductivity ec due to the dissolution of metals along with the oxidation of pyrite and mobility of metals occurring at lower ph equeenuddin et al 2010 the literature review herein indicates that the presence of iron sulfides and quantity of calcareous material affect the amount of acid and quality of drainage fig 3 similarly field studies support a strong co relation between pyrite morphology and amd caruccio et al 1977 geidel and caruccio 2000 pyrite may occur in different forms such as framboidal euhedral and anhedral but the decomposition of framboidal pyrites is critical to produce acid drainage non framboidal iron disulfides are less reactive and they decompose slowly and produce lower acids caruccio et al 1977 in general fine grained pyrites produce more acid than coarse grained pyrites many studies discuss the effects of paleoclimatic and paleodepositional environments on rock chemistry and distribution of minerals such as sulfides and carbonates for example caruccio et al 1977 observed that pyrite distribution and acid drainage in the appalachian coalfield of eastern kentucky u s was related to coal s paleoenvironment their findings explicitly demonstrated higher reactive pyrite in the lower delta plain sequence back barrier than the upper delta plain causing acid drainage paleoenvironmental factors could further modify or influence rock types and chemistry at a spatial scale for example brady et al 1998 detected rapid change in the amount of carbonates and stratigraphy at lateral spaces on surface mining sites in pennsylvania u s due to paleodeposition in summary forms of pyrite their occurrences and their interactions with carbonates may influence amd and therefore the study and examination of such factors is necessary to predict and control acid drainage as discussed next 5 prediction of amd mining operators should develop plans and control measures to prevent amd or design treatment systems appropriate to climate topography and regulatory requirements upon the prediction of amd risks and thereby to minimize potential ecological and human health issues regulations set forth in different countries require mining operators to analyze soil and overburden samples to identify potentially acid and toxic forming materials prior mining using either static or kinetic tests static tests evaluate if the given sample will generate acid whereas kinetic tests predict timings of acid production rates of acid generation and the assessment of the released elements dold 2017 according to skousen et al 2000 accurate prediction of amd depends on three principal factors overburden geochemistry overburden handling and placement and post mine hydrology upon the prediction of acid and toxic forming materials mining operators must cover those materials with non toxic and non combustible materials or treat them to correct acid drainage and minimize water pollution studies report that controlled placement of overburden materials and water management provide beneficial effects on regulating acid drainage sahoo et al 2013 other measures that correct acid drainage and minimize water pollution include diverting surface water away from the pyrite bearing spoil or passing it through alkaline materials mining operators could remove or isolate contaminated water from non contaminated water to substantially reduce acid formation also mining operators may impound the contaminated water in the structures that are non toxic forming and restrict oxygen diffusion skousen et al 2019 these measures also serve as preventive ways of reducing amd in coal mining areas 5 1 static tests acid base accounting aba first described in 1973 grube et al 1973 aba is a rapid and relatively cheap method of overburden analysis to determine either acid production potential app or acid neutralizing potential this method evaluates sulfide in the overburden sample based on the stoichiometry of complete pyrite oxidation and calculates app sobek et al 1978 using the eq 5 usepa 1994 5 app 31 25 percent s neutralization potential np represents the buffering effects of alkaline materials such as carbonates that neutralize acid by using the acid base titration method sobek et al 1978 this static test therefore connotes the balance between acid production and consumption if the net np value exceeds 20 kg caco3 t the sample is non acid generating but at values less than 20 kg caco3 t the sample will generate acids one can estimate acid generating potential by using neutralization potential ratio app np values less than one indicate acid generating samples during aba the pulverization of samples destroys their initial textures therefore many use the degree of sulfide and carbonate release to correct aba results elghali et al 2018 while aba method assumes all the sulfur in sample as reactive it neglects the manifestation of gypsum and other non reactive sulfur minerals this assumption of aba method potentially leads to overestimation of np by three ways dissolution of ph regulating minerals through strong acid usage reaction of iron and manganese carbonates with acid and precipitation of metal hydroxides during the titration with sodium hydroxide usepa 1994 dold 2017 reviewed static and kinetic tests used in acid rock drainage prediction and suggested that the calculation factor of 31 25 overestimates neutralization potential of carbonate by roughly 100 additionally aba underestimated acid potential of fe3 hydroxides and sulfates and failed to discern different carbonate minerals however yucel and baba 2016 compared different static tests such as paste ph and electrical conductivity aba and net acid generation test to predict amd in the etili open pit mine in turkey they observed uniformity between the results and the association of amd with mine waste and altered volcanic rocks usepa 1994 provided a comparison between the aba method and other static methods such as the modified aba bc research initial alkaline production potential and net acid production table 4 the modified aba method excludes non sulfide sources in sulfur assuming sulfate as a non acid producing source this assumption leads to underestimation of app when jarosite is present in large quantities in waste materials usepa 1994 nevertheless aba serves as a useful method to make treatment decisions in acidic areas skousen et al 2002 used aba to evaluate the quality of overburden prior mining and to predict the drainage quality after mining for different sites in west virginia u s they found that the aba simulations were accurate for 50 out of 52 sites tested studies indicate that accurate prediction of app fundamentally depends on volume of samples to better represent and incorporate geologic heterogeneity within a site however caruccio and geidel 1986 criticized the aba method for not relating to kinetic data that affect weathering of mine rocks which calls for additional studies and selection of kinetic tests 5 2 kinetic tests kinetic tests examine long term acid generating and acid neutralizing potentials using chemical analysis of leachates on humidity cells or columns scientists and professionals have been using humidity cells experiments to study acid consuming potential of calcites in several waste rocks langman et al 2019 tests in humidity cells are relatively faster than in columns and differ in sample mass and the number and duration of flush drainage cycles table 5 shows the comparison between humidity cells and column tests in a study benzaazoua et al 2001 compared two different kinetic tests humidity cells and the column tests for sulfide mine tailings which showed very little difference in oxidation neutralization rate of minerals banerjee 2014 performed kinetic tests on overburden samples that showed high acid generation potential and observed better neutralizing capacity than oxidative capacity of the samples but banerjee also reported risks of acid generation due to accelerated rates of carbonate weathering and dissolution and depletion of neutralizing materials in the study system the oxidation of sulfides depends on a number of factors like micro textures grain size temperature humidity bacterial activity and oxidants dold 2017 bouzahzah et al 2014 compared kinetic tests against sobek static tests and mineralogical static tests in synthetic tailing samples and provided recommendations for better prediction of amd however considering the amount of time consumed in kinetic tests along with the production of large dataset with inconclusive results one must conclude that mineral characterization and quantification could be one of the predictive tools for amd if available dold 2017 scientists and researchers are increasingly using x ray diffraction fluorescence analyses or micro computed tomography inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy for mineral characterization that quantify modal mineralogy and predict the degree of sulfide release dold 2017 gottlieb et al 2000 elghali et al 2018 used mineralogical and chemical characterization to estimate net acid generating potential of waste rocks from the open pit mine in abitibi canada results showed that sulfides primarily consisted of fine to mid sized fractions also the fine sized sulfides were highly reactive and had utmost liberation but the liberation was negligible when size exceeded 2 4 mm the study also proposed diameter of physical locking of sulfides as a new parameter to access amd this diameter connotes particle size above which sulfides are locked by non sulfide minerals i e 2 4 mm in this study therefore scientists and researchers can determine reactive fraction and use it to predict amd and plan for drainage management yet they must use the column tests to validate the results 5 3 amdtreat studies indicate increasing use of amdtreat as a method to predict and recommend treatment for acid mine drainage waters cravotta et al 2015 2010 amdtreat is a computer based application jointly developed by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection the west virginia department of environmental protection u s geological survey and the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement in 2003 in recent years scientists researchers and mining operators have been using amdtreat to estimate quantity of caustic chemicals naoh cao ca oh 2 na2co3 and nh3 effluent quality and sludge volume produced during treatments cravotta et al 2015 2010 table 6 provides a summary of the caustic equivalents used by amdtreat to treat acidic water amdtreat estimates the costs incurred to treat acid mine discharge using different chemical treatment and constructed wetland systems it consists of more than 400 variables that users can modify as necessary to best estimate the costs of developing treatment systems revegetation water sampling surveying sludge removal chemical consumption among others for both past and future projects different tools embedded within the amdtreat allow actual site specific financial forecasting and calculation of the recapitalization cost langelier saturation index acidity flow sulfate reduction mass balance oxidation abiotic homogeneous fe2 oxidation biotic homogeneous fe2 oxidation ph averaging metric conversion chemical cost conversion and pert statistics osmre 2020 for example a sulfate reduction calculator estimates sulfate loading and the volume of organic matter required to reduce sulfate based on the specific sulfate reduction rate of constructed wetlands amdtreat consists of two geochemical phreeq modules un aerated phreeq and pre aerated phreeq to compute amd treatment costs chemical consumption chemical composition of treated effluents and volume of byproducts cravotta et al 2015 osmre 2020 in an un aerated phreeq module user uses water quality analysis data as an input which includes the amount of ferrous iron and inorganic carbon by using the software users can also estimate the amount of ferrous iron which largely depends on user defined total iron concentration and ph of water it simulates the use of caustic chemical to fresh effluent which may contain limited to no dissolved o2 but relatively higher concentration of co2 pre aerated phreeq however allows for the simulation of pre areated co2 using log pco2 values to bring water to equilibrium with the atmosphere and complete oxidation of ferrous iron and manganese osmre 2020 for different treatment phs these modules simulate effluent standards for additional details see cravotta et al 2015 and https amd osmre gov 6 prevention and treatment of amd this review indicates the utmost importance of prevention techniques to sustainably reduce amd problems in coal mining and to ensure effective mine closure park et al 2019 preventive methods eliminate or reduce amd generation by protecting sulfide from exposure to air and water during disturbance kefeni et al 2017 preventive methods could include land based storage in sealed heaps blending acidic materials with acid consuming materials solidification of tailings use of anoxic surfactants and microencapsulation johnson and hallberg 2005 studies also recommend other surface based techniques to prevent amd such as dry cover water cover oxygen consuming cover e g wood waste and subaqueous tailing disposal kefeni et al 2017 the proper handling of earth materials groundwater discharge and runoff by facilitating the use of best technology available and ensuring the use of drainage control revegetation diversion of runoff and water treatment facilities protect surface and groundwater bodies during mining and reclamation oac 2016 the u s epa developed the sequential steps and framework to prevent and treat amd in abandoned mine sites usepa 1997 which remains valuable for active mining operations we modified these sequential steps and framework in fig 4 which provide guidance for the treatment of acidic drains and highlight the roles of multiple stakeholders such as governmental and non governmental agencies and organizations communities industries citizens and civic groups and their multi disciplinary partnerships for planning reclamation and remediation 6 1 treatment of amd once amd forms mining operators need to isolate neutralize or remove it by exploiting different abiotic and biotic processes kefeni et al 2017 johnson and hallberg 2005 reviewed and discussed different abiotic and biological measures each comprising active and passive ways to remediate amd for example an active abiotic system could include aeration and addition of lime whereas a passive abiotic system comprises anoxic limestone drains active biological systems include sulfidogenic bioreactors whereas passive biological systems include wetlands permeable reactive barriers and packed bed iron oxidation bioreactors generally treatments are either active or passive active systems use chemicals and passive systems use natural treatment media 6 1 1 active treatment active treatment refers to the addition of alkaline chemicals such as ca oh 2 cao naoh na2co3 and nh3 to polluted mine water or effluents table 6 two commonly used chemical treatment methods include high density sludge and the chemsulphidetm process ali et al 2019 the former method utilizes neutralizing reagents cao naoh to raise ph and to precipitate metals in sludge while the later utilizes sulfide reagent nahs or na2s alkaline chemicals raise ph oxidize ferrous iron and precipitate metals in hydroxides and carbonates forms johnson and hallberg 2005 according to siebert et al 2019 four major processes comprise the active treatment of amd precipitation sulfate reduction ion exchange absorption adsorption and filtration and crystallization the sequential reactions depicting the dissolution of calcium carbonate in water appear below where dissolution of carbonates hinge on partial pressure of carbon dioxide gas eqs 6 8 usepa 1994 6 caco3 h2o ca2 hco3 oh 7 hco3 h2o h2co3 oh 8 h2co3 co2 h2o webb and sasowsky 1994 indicated that a combined effect of acid neutralization through carbonic acid dissociation and acid neutralization by carbonate dissolution provides an improved treatment of amd of different alkaline chemicals naoh establishes 100 neutralization efficiency as it completely dissociates in water to raise the water ph table 7 kefeni et al 2017 scientists and researchers use naoh in low flow environments when acidity is high however naoh is relatively expensive generates ferric hydroxide sludge and is difficult to handle in cold weather skousen et al 1996 usepa 1997 table 7 shows the advantages and disadvantages of different chemicals including naoh in active treatments climate mine water composition and operation costs largely determine the use of chemical treatments ali et al 2018 there are several other active treatment options that are in use for example chen et al 2015 studied the short term and long term hydrological effects of dry flue gas desulfurization product fgd and observed that fgd product could remediate acidic surface coal mined sites the ph of surface runoff increased to 7 or higher after 20 years peiravi et al 2017 used a cathode chamber under aerobic condition for bio electrochemical treatment of amd from abandoned coal mines mulopo 2015 used an alkaline barium calcium desalination process to treat amd and observed the sulfate reduction to very low levels and the recovery of barium carbonates active treatment is more suitable for operating mines it is a relatively low cost technology cost however varies with the chemicals and labor involved it may entail a long term commitment fripp et al 2000 also whilst treating acidic water scientists should equally consider recycling and recovery of raw materials from sludge fig 5 provides a schematic representation of active treatment methods involving alkaline chemicals and resource recovery 6 1 2 passive treatment passive systems rely on natural treatment media and construction materials to treat acidic water through biological physical geochemical and gravitational mechanisms siebert et al 2019 zipper et al 2018 passive treatments include wetlands anoxic limestone drains open limestone channels vertical flow systems and other systems such as limestone ponds limestone sand beds and limestone diversion wells zipper et al 2018 passive treatment methods are more suitable for abandoned mines ali et al 2019 and several studies have documented their usage blowes et al 2003 gazea et al 1996 hedin et al 1994 kaur et al 2018 nordstrom 2009 pat espadas et al 2018 skousen et al 2019 zipper et al 2018 for example different passive treatments their design factors and organic substrates pertinent to sulfate removal are available from an earlier review by skousen et al 2017 similar to active treatment options the use and efficacy of passive systems also differ with climate mine water composition and operational costs for example ali et al 2020 studied the effects of temperature 22 and 5 c and salinity 0 and 20 g l 1 on the efficacy of passive biochemical reactors and observed lower efficiency at low temperature and high salinity for synthetic amd treatments garcía valero et al 2020 tested marl sandstone and calcareous crust in a batch experiment and observed increased ph and reduced metal concentration by precipitation for all three alkaline materials efficiency of metals removal however differed with the particle size of alkaline materials and contact time between alkaline materials and amd they attained a complete removable of pb fe and cu when the particle size of these materials were 10 20 mm similarly they found that a contact time of six minutes between marl and amd reduced metals literature indicates the wide use of constructed wetlands for low cost treatment of amd where utilized emergent and submergent vegetation and microorganisms remediate contaminated water qasaimeh et al 2015 acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and a ferrooxidans are two autotrophic iron and sulfur oxidizing microbes commonly found in constructed wetlands nicomrat et al 2006 2008 constructed wetlands generally incur low cost and maintenance compared with active treatments but acid neutralization potential largely depends on climatic events a survey of 142 constructed wetlands in eastern u s showed that approximately 50 wetlands reduced h concentration by 68 acidity by 67 and so4 by 8 wieder 1989 efficiency may however vary with area depth organic substrates plants used and wastewater composition among other factors more details on constructed wetlands and operational guidelines are available from brodie et al 1988 johnson and hallberg 2005 pat espadas et al 2018 perry and kleinmann 1991 and sheridan et al 2018 therefore this review is primarily focused on anaerobic wetlands bactericides technologies and integrated methods anaerobic wetlands are natural wetlands but engineered biologically to reduce amd fig 6 using the dissimilatory sulfate reduction dmr technique moodley et al 2018 dmr takes advantage of sulfate reducing bacteria and organic substrates as carbon sources to remove sulfides moodley et al 2018 three major groups of organic substrates used in sulfate removal include easily available materials soluble sugars starch amino acids and proteins cellulose and hemicellulose and lignin skousen et al 2017 the designs of anaerobic wetlands exclude plants to treat a wide range of pollutants siebert et al 2019 but generally for 3 5 g acidity m 2 day 1 and 10 g fe m 2 day 1 rates of removal skousen et al 2017 these anaerobic wetlands consist of limestone and gravel bedrock about 15 30 cm thick layer underneath a permeable organic substrate of 30 60 cm to increase alkalinity water flows into the organic substrate where bacteria remove o2 zipper et al 2018 sulfate reducing bacteria convert sulfur to sulfides which undergo reduction reaction to form hydrogen sulfide and bicarbonates eq 9 bicarbonates that form in anaerobic wetlands raise ph and remove metals as hydroxides and oxyhydroxides 9 so4 2 2 ch2o h2s 2 hco3 anaerobic wetlands can be reducing and alkalinity producing system raps successive alkalinity producing system saps or permeable reactive barriers prbs for details on each of these systems refer to siebert et al 2019 anaerobic wetlands bestow several advantages including removal of metals and sulfate stabilization of metal precipitates lowering sludge volume enhancing ecological integrity increasing habitat for birds and biodiversity and lowering maintenance cost moodley et al 2018 overall passive systems can reduce acidic drains by 50 but their performance is however site specific and largely influenced by biogeochemical and physical processes kaur et al 2018 table 8 lists advantages and disadvantages of active and passive treatment systems apart from sulfate and iron manganese mn also occurs in acidic drains at higher levels affecting water quality cheong et al 2010 karathanasis et al 2010 neculita and rosa 2019 mn is autocatalytic with high sorption capacity for other metals cr cu pb hg ni zn a high ph will possibly increase mn requisitioning in colloids suspended particulate matter and sediments whereas a low ph induces reductive dissolution of oxyhydroxides to further increase mn levels and or release trace elements passive systems such as open limestone beds can remove mn by oxidizing and precipitating mn which is mediated by mn ii oxidizing microbes mn oxide coated limestone improves performance in mn ii removal beds mussel shells can also remove mn by more than 35 mccauley et al 2009 studies reported removal efficiencies of 10 to as high as100 in bioreactor batch experiments with mushroom compost substrates karathanasis et al 2010 song et al 2012 generally mn removal is challenging due to higher solubility and it warrants further research for additional details on the prevalence effects treatments and challenges of mn removal from acidic drains refer to neculita and rosa 2019 6 2 other treatments 6 2 1 bactericide treatment systems promac a bactericide system developed in the 1980s by bfgoodrich company used spray liquid and controlled release pellets to inhibit iron oxidizing bacteria at a source point promac treatment systems eliminated thiobacillus ferrooxidans the iron oxidizing bacteria and thereby reduced amd sobek and rastogi 1986 identified four step approach of using promac to abate amd which includes problem identification proposing treatment supervising the use of controlled release bactericides and monitoring treatment and its effectiveness guerrero and oliver 1999 reported that promac promoted the proliferation of beneficial heterotrophic bacteria such as acidiphilium researchers use bactericides directly to the effluents or as intimate mixtures blowes et al 2003 sobek et al 1990 used controlled release bactericides to reclaim coal refuse areas in east springfield ohio and dawmont west virginia and reported that bactericides reduced amd and facilitated vegetation growth and development for extended years the production and use of this bactericides technology however ceased during late 1990s gusek 2018 nonetheless studies indicate that heterotrophic biofilms and bactericides technologies are rapidly developing and extensively scrutinized to reduce iron oxidizing bacteria kalin et al 2018 moodley et al 2018 in a microcosm study jin et al 2008 observed that microbial inoculum could raise water ph and reduce concentration of al as cu fe pb ni and zn metals zhang and wang 2017 observed anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate as an effective bactericide technology that suppressed iron oxidation caused by thiobacillus ferroxidans more studies are however necessary to confirm or refute benefits from such bactericides technologies 6 2 2 industrial by products and wastes other treatments include use of industrial by products such as basic oxygen furnace slag and argon oxygen decarburization slag from steel industries to potentially remove sulfate from acidic drains moodley et al 2018 mussel shell is another waste material with high acid neutralizing potential with 80 wt caco3 moodley et al 2018 and as such butler et al 2019 diloreto et al 2016 and weber et al 2008 among others have used mussel shell to reduce amd risks researchers more recently tested and used biochar to reduce heavy metals from amd wibowo and naswir 2019 for example giachini et al 2018 used poultry litter biochar enriched with three sulfate reducing bacteria sources sediments from amd cattle manure and domestic activated sewage sludge to treat amd from coalmine pond in brazil and observed 41 reduction in sulfate with cow manure sulfate reducing bacteria enriched biochar in summary different methods are available to treat amd and to remove metals from acidic drains but their combination with a passive system could improve performance and lower treatment costs as discussed next 6 2 3 holistic and integrated approach integrated approaches use a combination of different methods and are efficient ways to treat amd masindi 2017 wei et al 2018 kefeni et al 2017 suggested a holistic approach such as resource recovery and reuse to control amd naidu et al 2019 suggested the integration of membrane techniques with active and passive remediation systems to facilitate water reuse geldenhuys 2003 integrated synthetic organic polymers with limestone treatments and used those as coagulant and flocculent to remove suspended and colloidal substances masindi 2017 used an integrated approach with cryptocrystalline magnesite for pre treatment of amd and barium chloride to eliminate residual sulfate from an aqueous system results indicated the removal of 99 heavy metals and 40 sulfate with magnesite and the removable of 99 residual sulfate with barium integrated assessment of amd and treatment of waste and effluents therefore prevent and reduce acidic water but the effects are largely site and treatment specific more studies on integrated technologies are however warranted in the treatment of amd and recovery of resources 7 remote and ground sensing techniques in amd studies remote and ground sensing techniques are popular and cost effective ways to map land use and land cover delineate groundwater potential zones kumar and krishna 2018 analyze ground subsidence baek et al 2008 study coal fires and fires related emissions saraf et al 1995 zhang et al 2004 detect near surface interfaces strange et al 2005 access hydrologic conditions and amd ebraheem et al 1990 kumar and krishna 2018 develop water treatment plans jin et al 2008a b and to accomplish other tasks ebraheem et al 1990 used vertical electrical sounding and horizontal resistivity profiling to study amd at a reclaimed coal mine site near wheatland indiana u s results showed a strong negative relationship between resistivity and total dissolved solids moreover oxidation dissolution and infiltration of iron disulfides resulted in the contamination of wheatland aquifer in northeastern india blahwar et al 2012 used high resolution satellite imagery to study amd in artisanal coal mining results indicated an acidic drain problem due to dissolution of pyrites and highlighted potential use of satellite imagery to largely identify iron precipitates on streambeds moreover others used remote sensing techniques to facilitate amd treatment methods for example in tennessee u s a biological source treatment method utilized remote sensing for down hole injection of microbial inoculum to prevent sulfides oxidation jin et al 2008a b drones or unmanned aerial vehicles uavs equipped with active or passive sensors are rapidly evolving and increasingly being tested as non intrusive remote sensing machineries for surveying terrains and developing digital models promptly collecting water quality samples banerjee et al 2018 and mapping and monitoring such coal mining areas and water pollution issues as acidic drains by using multi and hyperspectral imaging kirsch et al 2018 herrmann et al 2019 in a recent review ren et al 2019 discussed the development and application of uavs and challenges and opportunities of using them in a mining sector among different uavs available fixed wing and multi rotar wing uavs are common in mining ren et al 2019 jackisch et al 2018 used drone based hyperspectral imaging to monitor amd in litov tailings in the sokolov district czech republic where they identified the association of acidic drains with jarosite and goethite minerals and validated iron absorption bands in uav hyperspectral images by using ground truth spectroscopy while studies based on uavs are relatively safe flexible efficient economical and precise such studies remain few thus there is a need for more of such research for the effective use of remote sensing techniques in understanding coal mine production gathering soil and water samples and integrating hyperspectral images with field based hydrological and geochemical data 8 material damage criteria and mine closure in the u s researchers and regulatory agencies developed material damage criteria to access the cumulative impact of mining to water availability and changes in ph total dissolved solids total suspended solids iron and manganese among others these criteria signify water quality standards established under the epa 40 code of federal regulations cfr and are also important to determine the cumulative impact during mining and reclamation phase to control water pollution for example a desirable ph range is 6 0 9 0 iron content is 7 0 mg l and total suspended solid content is 70 0 mg l worrall et al 2009 highlighted 14 criteria and 72 indicators for the sustainable development and use of legacy mine lands in australia that are abandoned derelict and orphan lands in their study they recognized amd as one of the environmental criteria to determine the success of post mine land use effective treatment of acid drainage prevents material damage determines the success of mine closure and reclamation and enables sustainable development of post mine lands in a recent report young et al 2019 suggested a 6 step framework to guide effective mine closure and completion determining post mine land use setting realistic and achievable mining closure objectives selecting references and setting targets establishing risk based prioritization of post mine land use and closure plans developing completion criteria and monitoring reclamation plans against completion criteria completion criteria are of utmost importance to determine success of reclamation to achieve closure objectives and to ensure environmental sustainability young et al 2019 studies indicate a wide use of pre disturbance conditions as reference conditions in post mine planning but they require adequate baseline data such data may include different physio chemical biological and geological attributes surface water quality groundwater quality hydraulic conductivity electrical conductivity cation exchange capacity ph sediment loss and vegetation among others the baseline data are also important for assessing water quality after amd treatment in the absence of such adequate data scientists agencies and researchers often used or suggested a similar site or a conceptual model young et al 2019 in summary while effective mine closure prevents amd risks prevention and control of amd dictates the post mine land use success 9 challenges and opportunities amd studies treatment methods and control measures are not without challenges below this study highlights major challenges and opportunities in preventing and treating acidic mine waters 1 there is a need for regular monitoring of acid drainage and water quality from overburden rock dumps refuse piles mine tailings and diffuse seeps to determine emerging problems sought proper treatment designs and reclaim mine sites for future use use of baseline data paleo depositional information and geochemical models wherever possible would improve amd prediction and control effective treatment of acid drainage from mine areas offers opportunities for resource reuse and recovery of such substances as ferric hydroxide ferrite sulfur and sulfuric acids kefeni et al 2017 rakotonimaro et al 2017 and post mine land usage recovery of gypsum calcite and ferrihydrite is possible from the sludge which could be used as raw materials in cement manufacturing scientists and researchers used two different methods to recover dissolved metals and water from amd 1 ph dependent methods selective precipitation selective adsorption and selective ion exchange and 2 ph independent methods electro dialysis microfiltration ultrafiltration nano filtration reverse osmosis and membrane distillation simate and ndlovu 2014 opportunities also exist to generate electricity and produce iron pigments during wastewater treatment by using microbial fuel cells mfc technology however no single technology could effectively eliminate dissolved metals and therefore simate and ndlovu 2014 recommended a combination of different systems 2 static and kinetic tests are associated with large uncertainties and results are often difficult to interpret usepa 1994 developing a standard kinetic test could potentially reduce uncertainties and errors in analytical results more research is however warranted to develop examine and enact new tests and techniques also there are multiple opportunities to use uavs and hyperspectral imaging in active and abandoned mines and reclamation areas for monitoring water pollution including amd and developing treatment plans 3 climatic change and associated variability in weather events such as drought rainfall and snowmelt runoff is an emerging challenge and could modify flushing effects amd generation and treatments hotton et al 2020 nordstrom 2009 a dry spell followed by first flush event could increase sulfate concentration gzyl and banks 2007 nordstrom 2009 younger and blachere 2004 the effect may however decrease after attaining a peak discharge level generally drought will increase low flow conditions and reduce carbonate containing groundwater which escalates acid concentration in drainage water nordstrom 2009 increased temperature will likely increase oxidation and sulfuration and the release of heavy metals fu and lu 2018 also intense rainstorm events will increase dissolution of sulfates treatment plans and measures are also susceptible to the impacts of climate change for example covers with capillary barrier effects ccbe are sensitive to precipitation events increased moisture from precipitation events will maintain saturation of moisture retaining layer and therefore reduce acid drainage whereas drought could accelerate desaturation and amd formation hotton et al 2020 as such environmental scientists and mining companies need to account for climate variability and flush out events in developing and targeting treatment plans nordstrom 2009 4 mine closures that adhere a properly designed and implemented framework in a timely manner may prevent amd risks and vice versa challenges and opportunities exist for multidisciplinary partnerships among agencies organizations industries and general public for problem assessment treatment planning funding and remediation 5 spontaneous combustion of coal waste piles represents a special category of mining waste problems and may emit heavy metals into the atmosphere which later deposit into aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems wang et al 2016 mcconnell and edwards 2008 reported the deposition of heavy metals and bio magnification risks in artic ecosystems further studies on spontaneous combustion of coal wastes atmospheric deposition of heavy metals and the potential for acid leaching are necessary 6 developing and implementing cost effective treatments is challenging but crucial designing and implementation of treatment methods must consider local settings to ensure post mining safety and land use each mining project is peculiar and the science of mine drainage prediction continues to evolve also codes of mining regulations vary with states and countries unveiling needs for site specific framework and criteria while plans may vary with sites land use history mines available technology eco hydrological settings socio economic conditions political outlooks collaboration among multiple stakeholders long term monitoring effective enforcement of effluent limitation treatment standards and performance bonding must be a priority 10 conclusions and recommendations this paper reviewed different methods of amd prediction prevention and treatment and identified critical research gaps challenges and opportunities the literature in general suggests that amd can affect water quality and post mine land use depending on multiple interactive factors this review draws the following important conclusions 1 amd effects are multifarious and therefore future studies should focus on characterization prediction prevention long term monitoring and effective treatment of amd 2 scientists and researchers use both static and kinetic tests to predict amd risks new tests are however warranted to potentially reduce uncertainties and errors in analytical results 3 mineral characterization and quantification could be one of the predictive tools and therefore require further studies 4 amd risks demand developing site specific plans and control measures depending on land use history climate topography hydrogeology and regulatory requirements 5 mining sector and amd studies could benefit from the use of emerging uavs and hyperspectral imaging technology in active and abandoned mines and reclamation areas for hydrogeochemical investigations 6 different active and passive treatment systems bactericides technologies and industrial by products and wastes are available to reduce amd problems in coal mining however preventive methods integrated treatments and multidisciplinary partnerships are necessary to understand the complexity of multiple factors and acid drainage to curtail material damage and to ensure effective

5331,excessive exploitation of the groundwater and discharge of urban and industrial wastewater into the environment led to a significant decline of the local surface and groundwater quality in many parts of the beijing urban area in the present study tap water derived from deep groundwater 70 m depth was collected in two seasons in the rural area around urban beijing china in order to shed light on the hydrochemical composition of the local drinking water for these cation ca2 k mg2 na nh4 and anion cl no3 so4 2 f concentrations were measured in addition multiple stable isotope δ15nnitrate δ18onitrate δ34ssulfate δ18osulfate δ33ssulfate analyses were applied for identifying the specific hydrochemical processes and major contamination sources the result showed that thirty percent of the analyzed tap water in the wet season and twenty three percent in the dry season do not comply with the national legislation and represent a serious health risk primarily due to high nitrate concentrations moreover half of tap water could not be drunk due to the pollution of ammonium in wet season thereby the most deteriorated tap water was derived from the highest populated areas in rural beijing multiple isotopes reveal urban sewage as the dominant pollution source for deep groundwater as the principle tap water source therefore it is necessary to control public and private sewage disposal and exchange leaking sewer pipes in order to reduce the risk of anthropogenic contamination of groundwater representing the prime drinking water source in the beijing area this study demonstrates clearly the advantage of multi isotope approach for evaluating water quality problems in urban groundwater keywords tap water water quality nitrate and sulfate multiple isotopes beijing rural area 1 introduction in the last few decades rapid growth of urban populations has resulted in dramatic increases in water use and wastewater production in many developing countries throughout the world varis and vakkilainen 2001 foster and chilton 2004 markovic et al 2006 li et al 2010 excessive exploitation of the groundwater and careless discharge of private and industrial wastewater into the environment led to a significant decline of the local surface and groundwater quality with the result that tap water does not fulfill the requirements for drinking water in many parts of the beijing area he et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 he et al 2014 peters et al 2015 however few studies have investigated in detail the sources of contaminants and the hydrogeochemical processes that affect local regional tap water quality including within beijing china beijing is located on the beijing plain which is situated in the northwest of the larger north china plain ncp the bed rock of the beijing plain and the surrounding mountain ranges is characterized by archean gneisses and proterozoic carbonates chen et al 2003 the sedimentary deposits of the quaternary layer are classified into four aquifers based on their lithological properties and hydrodynamic conditions the shallow aquifer 50 m depth is unconfined whereas the deep aquifers 50 m are confined aji et al 2008 the recharge to the deep aquifers is mainly caused by leakage from the shallow aquifer the general direction of the groundwater flow on the beijing plain is nw se north west south east human activities are primarily focused on the center part southeast and east of the beijing municipality which is characterized by an urban agglomeration with additional surrounding farmland with numerous smaller towns and villages it is reported that residential areas produced 3 3 million tons domestic sewage per day and about 17 wastewater is directly discharged into the waterbody li et al 2016 dai et al 2015 consequently it is urgent to identify the source of water pollution and protect the water environment of beijing stable isotopes are useful for tracing the origin s of waters and the source s of dissolved constituents hosono et al 2011 barbieri 2019 the n s and o isotope ratios of no3 and so4 2 have been successfully used to trace the sources and transformations of n and s compounds in various ecosystems bottcher et al 1990 wassenaar 1995 robinson and bottrell 1997 aravena and robertson 1998 mayer et al 2002 brenot et al 2007 balci et al 2007 spoelstra et al 2007 kaown et al 2009 choi et al 2011 lin et al 2017 cao et al 2018 stable isotope ratios for no3 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 have been applied to understand the sources of no3 pollution and denitrification processes that may take place in aquifers kendall and mcdonnell 1998 cook and herczeg 2000 nikolenko et al 2018 although dissolved so4 2 is not a hazardous ion in natural water systems so4 2 can derive from anthropogenic sources such as air pollution agrochemicals and sewage sulfate isotope ratios δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 have been used to elucidate the pollution sources of dissolved so4 2 robinson and bottrell 1997 cao et al 2018 torssander et al 2006 otero et al 2008 hosono et al 2010 traditionally sulfur isotope studies focused on the two most abundant sulfur isotopes 32s and 34s only few studies addressing environmental issues have yet included the rare sulfur isotopes 33s and 36s peters et al 2010 lin et al 2017 han et al 2017 in our previous study the hydrochemical and multiple isotope investigation in the river water of the beijing countryside have been carried out peters et al 2019 in the present study tap water derived from deep groundwater 70 m depth was collected in the dry and wet seasons of the rural area around urban beijing china for this selected cation ca2 k mg2 na nh4 anion cl no3 so4 2 f concentrations and multiple stable isotopes δ15nnitrate δ18onitrate δ34ssulfate δ18osulfate δ33ssulfate were analyzed the major objectives of this study are 1 to investigate fundamental problems of tap water quality in rural beijing 2 to scale the effect of precipitation on the degree of contamination in the different seasons by sampling in the dry and wet season 3 to identify the sources of tap water contamination by multi isotopic indicator the results represent a case study showing the usefulness of a multi isotope approach in developing a comprehensive understanding of tap water contamination in the urban and suburban environments of beijing 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area beijing plain is located in the northern corner of the north china plain belonging to the upper part of the flood fan of yongding river daqing river north canal chaobai river jiyun river and other water system shown as fig 1 it is surrounded by mountains in west and north and bounded by the hebei province and tianjin city in east and south land elevation is high in northwest and gradually decreases towards southeast zhou et al 2012 beijing is located in the middle west of the beijing plain beijing plain has the temperate continental climate cold and dry in winter hot and humid in summer spring and autumn with moderate temperature beijing is a major city with groundwater resources as the city s main water supply source the city s total annual water supply of about 4 billion cubic meters of which groundwater extraction is about 2 7 billion cubic meters accounting for two thirds of the city s total water supply the average annual precipitation is 600 mm year and around 80 of this precipitation occurs during the summer monsoon between june and september there is an apparent difference between wet and dry season streamflow due to this precipitation in the wet and dry season wang et al 2015 streamflow during the wet season summer fall can be 10 times higher than that during the dry season winter spring the rainfall has impacted the water discharge and hydrochemical composition even more this apparent difference between wet and dry season streamflow lead lower river water levels or completely dried out rivers in the dry season compared to the wet season beijing plain consists of quaternary deposits formed by alluvial fans and plains the thickness of quaternary deposits varies from tens meters to 500 m from the alluvial fans to plain the sediment thickness increases and grain size decreases aquifer systems change from a single gravel aquifer to multiple aquifer systems of sand layer separated by silt and clay layers zhou et al 2012 most of agricultural well fields are installed in the shallow aquifer 50 m while most of industrial water supply wells and some drinking water well fields are drilled in the deep aquifer 50 m 2 2 sample collection in the rural parts of the beijing municipality in all five catchment areas water samples were taken from drinking water taps mainly in private houses and restaurant kitchens fig 1 in order to sample the drinking water used daily for drinking and cooking purposes by the local population the sampled tap water represents pure local groundwater pumped up by private or community wells the latter located in the center of the respective villages and small towns with mostly several tens to hundreds of residents according to the information of the well owners and officials the groundwater was derived from depths between 70 and 300 m and was not object of any physical or chemical treatment before distribution to the local households the supply network between pump and taps of the villagers consisted primarily of stainless steel and polyvinyl chloride pvc tubes sampling was conducted in june and july 2013 wet season as well as in march 2014 dry season in total 30 tap water samples in the wet season as well as 27 tap water samples in the dry season were collected shown as fig 1 the random daytime tap water samples were taken after 2 min flushing 5 l tap water samples were collected by a pe bucket and 1 5 l water samples were filled in a pet polyethylene tetraphthalate bottle according the methods of peters et al 2019 the sample was used to analyze nitrogen oxygen and sulfur isotopes of dissolved nitrate and sulfate in addition two 15 ml subsamples of each sample were filtered using 0 45 μm pore size syringe tip filters cellulose acetate and collected in hdpe high density polyethylene tubes for concentration measurements of selected anions cations metals and trace elements several drops of ultrapure hno3 65 were added in the samples before samples were used to analyze major cations metals and trace elements another 50 ml subsample was taken for determining the dic dissolved inorganic carbon concentration and treated with some drops of a saturated hgcl2 solution after filled into the sample flask in order to terminate microbial activity dic was calculated based on the consumption of 0 1 n hcl during titration to ph 4 3 all subsamples were stored dark and cool immediately after sampling until further preparation in lab the temperature ph redox potential eh and electric conductivity ec were measured on site during sampling using the electrode kit sx731 sanxin in addition to the tap water samples 3 rain water samples were collected on the building roof of the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research igsnrr chinese academy of sciences cas in beijing china in order to quantify the concentrations of selected inorganic constituents sampling was carried out as mentioned above for the tap water samples 2 3 chemical and isotopic

beijing according with our previous measurement methods of river water peters et al 2019 δ15n and δ18o for dissolved nitrate in tap water samples were analyzed using the bacterial denitrifyer method sigman et al 2001 casciotti et al 2002 it was measured by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms isoprime uk in the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry at the institute of geochemistry cas in guiyang china the international usgs 32 usgs 34 usgs 35 and iaea n3 and experimental reference materials were used to calibrate the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of samples after blank corrections casciotti et al 2002 each sample was measured in duplicate and the analytical precision of the δ15n and δ18o values was generally better than 0 2 and 0 3 respectively the δ34s and δ18o

respectively the tap water was categorized according to the classification system of the national guideline for surface water gb 3838 2002 and drinking water gb 5749 2006 by single factor assessment table 1 the quality grade of the water sample was determined by the highest concentration or value of the measured parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemistry and principal component tap water collected in the rural area of beijing shows ph values between 7 17 and 8 32 in the wet season and between 7 45 and 8 52 in the dry season table 2 only one sample exceeds the required ph range between 6 5 and 8 5 according to the national guideline for drinking water gb 5749 2006 which are similar to the european and u s standards following the suggestions of the world health organization who table 1 eh values between 40 and 90 mv in the wet season and between 51 and 85 mv in the dry season with median values of 49 and 59 mv respectively reveal predominantly oxidizing conditions ec values exhibit a wide range from 412 to 1812 μs cm in the wet season and from 428 to 1300 μs cm in the dry season all values are below the official standard for drinking water of 2000 μs cm moreover the hydrochemical map fig 2 indicates that the ec values of tap water from the southern rural area tend to be only slightly higher compared to tap water from north of the beijing urban area suggesting that the influence of urban contamination on the rural groundwater is rather limited 3 2 water quality and contamination patterns in the year 2007 the chinese government established the new drinking water guideline gb 5749 2006 for microbiological and chemical parameters which came into effect five years later in july 2012 the number of indicators increased from 35 established in 1985 to 106 most of the new standards are much stricter than the previous ones and match international guideline limits as suggested by the world health organization who 2011 respective values for the physio chemical and chemical parameters which are of interest for this study are compiled in table 2 we consider the drinking water standards for dissolved chloride nitrate and sulfate additionally listed in the official surface water guideline as the class iii threshold values due to the potential utilization of surface water in this category as drinking water nine of thirty tap water samples 30 collected in the wet season and six of twenty seven samples 22 taken in the dry season exhibit concentration values for at least one contaminant above the official limit according to the national legislation fig 2 dissolved nitrate from wastewater is by far the most important pollutant in the investigated tap water representing untreated groundwater from deeper aquifers 70 m depth consequently this water should not be used for drinking or cooking due to serious health risks when consumed frequently the concentration of nh4 ranged from 0 005 mg l to 17 83 mg l according to the gb3838 2002 the acceptable limit for nh4 is 1 mg l shown as fig 2 the nh4 concentrations in half of tap water 14 30 are higher than 1 mg l during wet season it indicated that half of tap water could not be drunk due to the pollution of ammonium in wet season the concentration of no3 in the dry season ranged from 0 79 to 122 78 mg l while it ranged from 0 99 to 146 72 mg l in the wet season usually ammonium nitrogen is mainly from human and animal waste and domestic sewage while no3 is mainly from farmland xing et al 2001 in this study nitrogen in all tap water is mainly in form of no3 in the dry season while nitrogen in most of tap water except six points 11 16 from south is also mainly in form of no3 in the wet season this suggested that dissolved nitrogen mainly come from farmland different from this xing et al 2001 found the nh4 concentration of river in taihu lake is 5 63 mg l and accounting for 80 71 of the total of inorganic n the problematic situation of beijing groundwater is supported by a recent publication of han et al 2016 the study shows the critical status of chinese groundwater systems in general and reveals the pollution of deep aquifers in the beijing area especially by nitrate from urban sewage which indicates cross contamination between the shallow and deep aquifers e g by faulty well sealing or long screened wells allowing contaminants to cross the aquitard through the well groundwater can be polluted by urban sewage due to corroded sewers which is a common problem in many megacities in the developing countries of se asia as shown by the high leakage fluxes of urban sewage into the ground of the asian megacities bangkok thailand 35 manila philippines 36 and jakarta indonesia 46 yasuhara 1998 also the concentrations of the wastewater derived nitrate in urban tap water of beijing point to significant groundwater contamination by leaking sewer pipes in the beijing area peters et al 2015 the pollution of deeper groundwater is of even greater concern than shallow groundwater contamination due to the long residence time of deep groundwater 10 000 years which prevents natural dilution han et al 2016 moreover the remediation of deeper aquifers is technically challenging and of limited effectiveness hence it is of prime importance to protect deep groundwater since many people depend on this valuable drinking water source especially in the beijing area the investigated tap water samples with minor water quality in both seasons seem to reflect a rather low effect of precipitation on the composition of deep groundwater suggesting a more stable composition of deep groundwater this is confirmed by the median values for the physio chemical and chemical parameters of the tap water samples which show except for nitrate smaller differences between wet and dry season concentrations than the river water peters et al 2019 also the spatial distribution of low quality tap water in the northern and southern rural area shows a different pattern compared to river water peters et al 2019 show as fig 3 the most deteriorated tap water can be found in the highest populated areas such as in the southwestern rural area confirming that anthropogenic wastewater is the most important contamination source for rural groundwater e g as shown by nitrate and sulfate isotopes moreover zhai et al 2015 conducted a study on the composition of deep groundwater from the daxing district in the southeastern rural area of beijing focusing groundwater from two seasons june and october 2012 collected in depths between 50 and 200 m the mean concentrations for all hydrochemical parameters including the anthropogenic pollutants fall into the range of values obtained for this study table 1 confirming the groundwater nature of the analyzed tap water moreover the small differences between the mean concentrations of the june and october samples confirm our observation of rather small seasonal changes with respect to the chemical characteristics of deep groundwater from rural beijing as described above in addition the study of zhai et al 2015 revealed that groundwater quality depends on land use worse in residential areas better in agricultural areas indicating the high impact of highly populated areas on beijing groundwater as shown in the present study also the study of choi et al 2005 provides evidence for different degrees of groundwater contamination depending on the type of anthropogenic activities 79 groundwater samples were taken at different locations in seoul south korea considering the different land use characteristics of the metropolitan area seoul represents a mega city similar to beijing with 10 million residents and a very high population density as well as similar climatic conditions cold and dry winters hot and humid summers as in the beijing area the groundwater samples were collected from depths between 50 and 150 m the results indicate increasing anthropogenic pollution in the order of forested green zones agricultural areas residential areas traffic areas industrialized areas confirming the better groundwater quality in agricultural areas compared to residential areas on average the mean ec value of 492 μs cm for seoul groundwater table 1 as a tracer for anthropogenic contamination is lower compared with the median value for groundwater from the beijing rural area 622 623 μs cm however the mean no3 40 7 mg l and cl 53 1 mg l concentrations are clearly higher than the median no3 6 0 13 6 mg l and cl 24 1 33 8 mg l concentrations in the groundwater derived tap water of rural beijing hence although the pollutant concentrations in the deeper groundwater from seoul and beijing differ the spatial distribution of the contaminants according to the land use type is rather similar indicating that the degree of the anthropogenic impact on groundwater depends on the specific human activities 3 3 the isotopic composition and the sources of the tap water the tap water displays a ca mg hco3 composition fig 4 groundwater in the beijing area is characterized by ca2 and mg2 as the dominant cations lower na fractions as well as hco3 as the dominant anion reflecting the influence of the paleoproterozoic carbonates on the water chemistry chen et al 2003 aji et al 2008 hence the tap water from the rural area of beijing which are derived from the lower aquifers shows a similar cation composition 3 3 1 cl concentrations in tap water the tap water samples exhibit cl concentrations between 2 3 and 210 8 mg l in the wet season and between 2 7 and 171 0 mg l in the dry season table 1 all values are below the drinking water standard limit of 250 mg l table 2 suggesting a sufficient drinking water quality with respect to dissolved chloride this is also confirmed by the relatively low median values of 24 1 and 33 8 mg l for wet and dry seasons respectively the tap water in the southern rural area is not significantly heavier affected by chloride rich contributions fig 2 confirming the lower influence of urban contaminants on the rural groundwater as previously proposed according to the ec values of the tap water samples however the highest values show the samples from the southwestern area which is characterized by the highest population density in rural beijing 3 3 2 f concentrations in tap water f concentrations for the tap water samples range between 0 1 and 1 2 mg l in the wet season and between 0 1 and 1 0 mg l in the dry season table 1 one tap water from the north taken in the dry season as well as one tap water from the south taken in the wet season show a f concentration above the drinking water limit of 1 0 mg l excessive fluorine in human bodies may cause dental and or skeletal fluorosis and harm kidneys nerves and muscles who 2011 hence the high f tap water in the beijing rural area is not appropriate for drinking fluoride concentration in water depends on several contributing factors such as ph total dissolved solids alkalinity and hardness karthikeyan and shanmugasundarraj 2000 subba 2003 usually fluoride in water come from geogenic or anthirpogenic sources moreover the fluoride concentration in rocks showed the orders of metamorphic rock fire forming rock sedimentary rock viswanathan et al 2009 this two points of high f was invaded with igneous rocks without these three rocks in this study the relatively high median concentrations of 0 4 and 0 5 mg l in wet and dry season might be partially caused by the high background values next to anthropogenic pollution sources the hydrochemical map fig 2 shows a similar distribution of f in tap water from the northern and southern rural area as for f in river water peters et al 2019 this indicates that next to local rivers the natural and fertilizer derived fluoride also percolates into the deep aquifers 3 3 3 no3 concentrations and the isotopic characteristics in tap water the no3 concentrations in the tap water samples ranges widely from 1 0 to 146 7 mg l in the wet season with a median value of 6 0 mg l and from 0 8 to 122 8 mg l in the dry season with a median value of 13 6 mg l table 1 eight samples 26 in the wet season and five samples 16 in the dry season show elevated no3 abundances above the chinese drinking water guideline limit of 44 mg l in addition one sample 3 in the wet season and four samples 13 in the dry season display relatively high no3 concentration above 30 mg l hence 29 of the tap water in the beijing rural area in wet and dry season show critical no3 levels which pose a serious health risk for the local population especially for children and babies high nitrate tap water enhances the risk for methaemoglobinaemia in bottle fed infants particularly in the case of simultaneous gastrointestinal infections who 2011 methaemoglobinaemia also known as the bluebaby syndrome is caused by nitrate which is reduced to nitrite in the infant s stomach the nitrite in turn oxidizes hemoglobin to methaemoglobin which is unable to transport oxygen in the veins sadeq et al 2008 consequently although the groundwater derived tap water in the beijing rural area represents the vital drinking water source for many local residents almost one third of this tap water is not appropriate to be used frequently for drinking or cooking purposes the distribution map fig 2 reveals that again most of the high nitrate tap water samples were collected in the rural southwest with a higher population than the rest of the rural area interestingly also the samples from the rural north display relatively high no3 levels although this area shows lower ec values and cl concentrations in tap water indicating a lower contribution of urban effluents compared to the southwestern area however most of the n and o isotopic compositions for high nitrate tap water from the north fall into the range for manure and septic waste in the δ15n no3 vs δ18o no3 plot fig 5 a as well as the nitrate from the southwest suggesting sewage as the prime no3 source one explanation could be that wastewater in the villages and towns of the northern rural area is accidentally released to the underground possibly by leaking wastewater pipes due to corrosion then to the local rivers in addition another yet unidentified nitrate source for the tap water samples from the north cannot be ruled out the nitrate is necessarily formed by nitrification in theory no3 formed by nitrification microbial mediated oxidation derives two of its oxygen atoms from water and one from dissolved o2 which has a similar isotopic composition to atmospheric oxygen bottcher et al 1990 shown as fig 5b most samples revealed δ18o no3 values around this value which suggests nitrification as the major source of nitrate in this area in addition there are two samples point 7 and 29 with low δ15n values considering that land use type of these two points is agricultural land the low δ15n values might dues to nitrification of agricultural fertilization 3 4 so4 2 concentrations and isotopic characteristics in tap water the tap water samples exhibit so4 2 concentrations between 3 9 and 272 8 mg l in the wet season with a median value of 48 4 mg l and between 2 2 and 200 8 mg l in the dry season with a median value of 60 0 mg l table 2 only one sample cw19 taken in the wet season exceeds the national standard value of 250 mg l although dissolved sulfate in potable water does not pose a serious health risk this water should be not frequently used for drinking due to the risk of catharsis dehydration and gastrointestinal irritation sigman et al 2001 saleh et al 2001 the hydrochemical map for so4 2 fig 2 shows that tap water from the southern rural area is more heavily contaminated than tap water from the northern rural area in contrast to the distribution of ec cl and no3 fig 2 however the highest concentrations are again shown by the samples from the southwest confirming the influence of the residents in the highest populated area of rural beijing on the groundwater composition this is also evident from the δ34s and δ18o results revealing beijing sewage as the dominant sulfate source fig 6 for most tap water samples this result is according with the study of li et al 2016 which suggested that the pollution of some rivers in beijing ware mainly due to the untreated sewage discharge moreover the isotopic compositions of sulfate from some tap water samples suggest a contribution of sulfate from local detergents characterized by higher δ34s and δ18o values however this is not confirmed by the results of the δ33s measurements thirteen samples of the wet season and eight samples of the dry season display δ33s ranges from 0 045 to 0 020 and from 0 054 and 0 002 respectively table 3 most samples are located in or near the field for beijing sewage only the data points of the samples cw3 and cw9 are located in the field for local detergents which is in contrast to their locations in the δ34s δ18o plot where they lie aside of the detergents field furthermore some samples lie in the field for fertilizer in the δ34s δ33s plot fig 7 but not in the δ34s δ18o plot hence we interpret the isotopic compositions of these samples as influenced by not yet identified sulfate sources rather than by sulfate from beijing fertilizers or detergents however some contribution of sulfate from these sources to the local ground and drinking water cannot be ruled out 4 conclusions firstly thirty percent of the tap water samples in the wet season and twenty three percent from the dry season show concentrations above the guideline limits with dissolved nitrate as the major pollutant moreover half of tap water could not be drunk due to the pollution of ammonium in wet season this tap water is hazardous for human health especially for children and babies and should not be consumed frequently secondly the amount of precipitation shows only a minor effect on the tap water composition moreover no difference between the tap water quality from the northern and from the southern rural area is discernible thirdly sewage represents the dominant source of pollution for tap water as reflected by the stable isotopes of dissolved nitrate and sulfate this is confirmed by the spatial distribution of deteriorated tap water which can be found predominantly in the highest populated regions especially in the southwestern rural area this distribution suggests leaking sewer pipes and or irresponsible discharge of wastewater to the environment which reaches even deep groundwater through shallow groundwater leakage probably through pumping activities overall results reveal that human wastewater has substantially influenced the composition of tap water in the beijing rural area this represents a serious health risk for humans due to the usage of deep groundwater as the vital drinking water source in the beijing area and exerts a major control on the local ecology therefore it is necessary to control public and private sewage disposal and update leaking sewer pipes in order to reduce the risk of anthropogenic contamination of groundwater representing the prime drinking water

5331,excessive exploitation of the groundwater and discharge of urban and industrial wastewater into the environment led to a significant decline of the local surface and groundwater quality in many parts of the beijing urban area in the present study tap water derived from deep groundwater 70 m depth was collected in two seasons in the rural area around urban beijing china in order to shed light on the hydrochemical composition of the local drinking water for these cation ca2 k mg2 na nh4 and anion cl no3 so4 2 f concentrations were measured in addition multiple stable isotope δ15nnitrate δ18onitrate δ34ssulfate δ18osulfate δ33ssulfate analyses were applied for identifying the specific hydrochemical processes and major contamination sources the result showed that thirty percent of the analyzed tap water in the wet season and twenty three percent in the dry season do not comply with the national legislation and represent a serious health risk primarily due to high nitrate concentrations moreover half of tap water could not be drunk due to the pollution of ammonium in wet season thereby the most deteriorated tap water was derived from the highest populated areas in rural beijing multiple isotopes reveal urban sewage as the dominant pollution source for deep groundwater as the principle tap water source therefore it is necessary to control public and private sewage disposal and exchange leaking sewer pipes in order to reduce the risk of anthropogenic contamination of groundwater representing the prime drinking water source in the beijing area this study demonstrates clearly the advantage of multi isotope approach for evaluating water quality problems in urban groundwater keywords tap water water quality nitrate and sulfate multiple isotopes beijing rural area 1 introduction in the last few decades rapid growth of urban populations has resulted in dramatic increases in water use and wastewater production in many developing countries throughout the world varis and vakkilainen 2001 foster and chilton 2004 markovic et al 2006 li et al 2010 excessive exploitation of the groundwater and careless discharge of private and industrial wastewater into the environment led to a significant decline of the local surface and groundwater quality with the result that tap water does not fulfill the requirements for drinking water in many parts of the beijing area he et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 he et al 2014 peters et al 2015 however few studies have investigated in detail the sources of contaminants and the hydrogeochemical processes that affect local regional tap water quality including within beijing china beijing is located on the beijing plain which is situated in the northwest of the larger north china plain ncp the bed rock of the beijing plain and the surrounding mountain ranges is characterized by archean gneisses and proterozoic carbonates chen et al 2003 the sedimentary deposits of the quaternary layer are classified into four aquifers based on their lithological properties and hydrodynamic conditions the shallow aquifer 50 m depth is unconfined whereas the deep aquifers 50 m are confined aji et al 2008 the recharge to the deep aquifers is mainly caused by leakage from the shallow aquifer the general direction of the groundwater flow on the beijing plain is nw se north west south east human activities are primarily focused on the center part southeast and east of the beijing municipality which is characterized by an urban agglomeration with additional surrounding farmland with numerous smaller towns and villages it is reported that residential areas produced 3 3 million tons domestic sewage per day and about 17 wastewater is directly discharged into the waterbody li et al 2016 dai et al 2015 consequently it is urgent to identify the source of water pollution and protect the water environment of beijing stable isotopes are useful for tracing the origin s of waters and the source s of dissolved constituents hosono et al 2011 barbieri 2019 the n s and o isotope ratios of no3 and so4 2 have been successfully used to trace the sources and transformations of n and s compounds in various ecosystems bottcher et al 1990 wassenaar 1995 robinson and bottrell 1997 aravena and robertson 1998 mayer et al 2002 brenot et al 2007 balci et al 2007 spoelstra et al 2007 kaown et al 2009 choi et al 2011 lin et al 2017 cao et al 2018 stable isotope ratios for no3 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 have been applied to understand the sources of no3 pollution and denitrification processes that may take place in aquifers kendall and mcdonnell 1998 cook and herczeg 2000 nikolenko et al 2018 although dissolved so4 2 is not a hazardous ion in natural water systems so4 2 can derive from anthropogenic sources such

2018 torssander et al 2006 otero et al 2008 hosono et al 2010 traditionally sulfur isotope studies focused on the two most abundant sulfur isotopes 32s and 34s only few studies addressing environmental issues have yet included the rare sulfur isotopes 33s and 36s peters et al 2010 lin et al 2017 han et al 2017 in our previous study the hydrochemical and multiple isotope investigation in the river water of the beijing countryside have been carried out peters et al 2019 in the present study tap water derived from deep groundwater 70 m depth was collected in the dry and wet seasons of the rural area around urban beijing china for this selected cation ca2 k mg2 na nh4 anion cl no3 so4 2 f concentrations and multiple stable isotopes δ15nnitrate δ18onitrate δ34ssulfate δ18osulfate δ33ssulfate were analyzed the major objectives of this study are 1 to investigate fundamental problems of tap water quality in rural beijing 2 to scale the effect of precipitation on the degree of contamination in the different seasons by sampling in the dry and wet season 3 to identify the sources of tap water contamination by multi isotopic indicator the results represent a case study showing the usefulness of a multi isotope approach in developing a comprehensive understanding of tap water contamination in the urban and suburban environments of beijing 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area beijing plain is located in the northern corner of the north china plain belonging to the upper part of the flood fan of yongding river daqing river north canal chaobai river jiyun river and other water system shown as fig 1 it is surrounded by mountains in west and north and bounded by the hebei province and tianjin city in east and south land elevation is high in northwest and gradually decreases towards southeast zhou et al 2012 beijing is located in the middle west of the beijing plain beijing plain has the temperate continental climate cold and dry in winter hot and humid in summer spring and autumn with moderate temperature beijing is a major city with groundwater resources as the city s main water supply source the city s total annual water supply of about 4 billion cubic meters of which groundwater extraction is about 2 7 billion cubic meters accounting for two thirds of the city s total water supply the average annual precipitation is 600 mm year and around 80 of this precipitation occurs during the summer monsoon between june and september there is an apparent difference between wet and dry season streamflow due to this precipitation in the wet and dry season wang et al 2015 streamflow during the wet season summer fall can be 10 times higher than that during the dry season winter spring the rainfall has impacted the water discharge and hydrochemical composition even more this apparent difference between wet and dry season streamflow lead lower river water levels or completely dried out rivers in the dry season compared to the wet season beijing plain consists of quaternary deposits formed by alluvial fans and plains the thickness of quaternary deposits varies from tens meters to 500 m from the alluvial fans to plain the sediment thickness increases and grain size decreases aquifer systems change from a single gravel aquifer to multiple aquifer systems of sand layer separated by silt and clay layers zhou et al 2012 most of agricultural well fields are installed in the shallow aquifer 50 m while most of industrial water supply wells and some drinking water well fields are drilled in the deep aquifer 50 m 2 2 sample collection in the rural parts of the beijing municipality in all five catchment areas water samples were taken from drinking water taps mainly in private houses and restaurant kitchens fig 1 in order to sample the drinking water used daily for drinking and cooking purposes by the local population the sampled tap water represents pure local groundwater pumped up by private or community wells the latter located in the center of the respective villages and small towns with mostly several tens to hundreds of residents according to the information of the well owners and officials the groundwater was derived from depths between 70 and 300 m and was not object of any physical or chemical treatment before distribution to the local households the supply network between pump and taps of the villagers consisted primarily of stainless steel and polyvinyl chloride pvc tubes sampling was conducted in june and july 2013 wet season as well as in march 2014 dry season in total 30 tap water samples in the wet season as well as 27 tap water samples in the dry season were collected shown as fig 1 the random daytime tap water samples were taken after 2 min flushing 5 l tap water samples were collected by a pe bucket and 1 5 l water samples were filled in a pet polyethylene tetraphthalate bottle according the methods of peters et al 2019 the sample was used to analyze nitrogen oxygen and sulfur isotopes of dissolved nitrate and sulfate in addition two 15 ml subsamples of each sample were filtered using 0 45 μm pore size syringe tip filters cellulose acetate and collected in hdpe high density polyethylene tubes for concentration measurements of selected anions cations metals and trace elements several drops of ultrapure hno3 65 were added in the samples before samples were used to analyze major cations metals and trace elements another 50 ml subsample was taken for determining the dic dissolved inorganic carbon concentration and treated with some drops of a saturated hgcl2 solution after filled into the sample flask in order to terminate microbial activity dic was calculated based on the consumption of 0 1 n hcl during titration to ph 4 3 all subsamples were stored dark and cool immediately after sampling until further preparation in lab the temperature ph redox potential eh and electric conductivity ec were measured on site during sampling using the electrode kit sx731 sanxin in addition to the tap water samples 3 rain water samples were collected on the building roof of the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research igsnrr chinese academy of sciences cas in beijing china in order to quantify the concentrations of selected inorganic constituents sampling was carried out as mentioned above for the tap water samples 2 3 chemical and isotopic

beijing according with our previous measurement methods of river water peters et al 2019 δ15n and δ18o for dissolved nitrate in tap water samples were analyzed using the bacterial denitrifyer method sigman et al 2001 casciotti et al 2002 it was measured by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms isoprime uk in the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry at the institute of geochemistry cas in guiyang china the international usgs 32 usgs 34 usgs 35 and iaea n3 and experimental reference materials were used to calibrate the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of samples after blank corrections casciotti et al 2002 each sample was measured in duplicate and the analytical precision of the δ15n and δ18o values was generally better than 0 2 and 0 3 respectively the δ34s and δ18o analyses the dissolved sulfate was precipitated as baso4 from the filtered water sample using the standard bacl2 precipitation method dogramaci et al 2001 after that baso4 precipitates were converted to ag2s to analyze multiple sulfur isotope δ33s δ34s δ33s following the thode extraction method thode et al 1961 o isotope ratios of sulfate were determined by elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass

respectively the tap water was categorized according to the classification system of the national guideline for surface water gb 3838 2002 and drinking water gb 5749 2006 by single factor assessment table 1 the quality grade of the water sample was determined by the highest concentration or value of the measured parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemistry and principal component tap water collected in the rural area of beijing shows ph values between 7 17 and 8 32 in the wet season and between 7 45 and 8 52 in the dry season table 2 only one sample exceeds the required ph range between 6 5 and 8 5 according to the national guideline for drinking water gb 5749 2006 which are similar to the european and u s standards following the suggestions of the world health organization who table 1 eh values between 40 and 90 mv in the wet season and between 51 and 85 mv in the dry season with median values of 49 and 59 mv respectively reveal predominantly oxidizing conditions ec values exhibit a wide range from 412 to 1812 μs cm in the wet season and from 428 to 1300 μs cm in the dry season all values are below the official standard for drinking water of 2000 μs cm moreover the hydrochemical map fig 2 indicates that the ec values of tap water from the southern rural area tend to be only slightly higher compared to tap water from north of the beijing urban area suggesting that the influence of urban contamination on the rural groundwater is rather limited 3 2 water quality and contamination patterns in the year 2007 the chinese government established the new drinking water guideline gb 5749 2006 for microbiological and chemical parameters which came into effect five years later in july 2012 the number of indicators increased from 35 established in 1985 to 106 most of the new standards are much stricter than the previous ones and match international guideline limits as suggested by the world health organization who 2011 respective values for the physio chemical and chemical parameters which are of interest for this study are compiled in table 2 we consider the drinking water standards for dissolved chloride nitrate and sulfate additionally listed in the official surface water guideline as the class iii threshold values due to the potential utilization of surface water in this category as drinking water nine of thirty tap water samples 30 collected in the wet season and six of twenty seven samples 22 taken in the dry season exhibit concentration values for at least one contaminant above the official limit according to the national legislation fig 2 dissolved nitrate from wastewater is by far the most important pollutant in the investigated tap water representing untreated groundwater from deeper aquifers 70 m depth consequently this water should not be used for drinking or cooking due to serious health risks when consumed frequently the concentration of nh4 ranged from 0 005 mg l to 17 83 mg l according to the gb3838 2002 the acceptable limit for nh4 is 1 mg l shown as fig 2 the nh4 concentrations in half of tap water 14 30 are higher than 1 mg l during wet season it indicated that half of tap water could not be drunk due to the pollution of ammonium in wet season the concentration of no3 in the dry season ranged from 0 79 to 122 78 mg l while it ranged from 0 99 to 146 72 mg l in the wet season usually ammonium nitrogen is mainly from human and animal waste and domestic sewage while no3 is mainly from farmland xing et al 2001 in this study nitrogen in all tap water is mainly in form of no3 in the dry season while nitrogen in most of tap water except six points 11 16 from south is also mainly in form of no3 in the wet season this suggested that dissolved nitrogen mainly come from farmland different from this xing et al 2001 found the nh4 concentration of river in taihu lake is 5 63 mg l and accounting for 80 71 of the total of inorganic n the problematic situation of beijing groundwater is supported by a recent publication of han et al 2016 the study shows the critical status of chinese groundwater systems in general and reveals the pollution of deep aquifers in the beijing area especially by nitrate from urban sewage which indicates cross contamination between the shallow and deep aquifers e g by faulty well sealing or long screened wells allowing contaminants to cross the aquitard through the well groundwater can be polluted by urban sewage due to corroded sewers which is a common problem in many megacities in the developing countries of se asia as shown by the high leakage fluxes of urban sewage into the ground of the asian megacities bangkok thailand 35 manila philippines 36 and jakarta indonesia 46 yasuhara 1998 also the concentrations of the wastewater derived nitrate in urban tap water of beijing point to significant groundwater contamination by leaking sewer pipes in the beijing area peters et al 2015 the pollution of deeper groundwater is of even greater concern than shallow groundwater contamination due to the long residence time of deep groundwater 10 000 years which prevents natural dilution han et al 2016 moreover the remediation of deeper aquifers is technically challenging and of limited effectiveness hence it is of prime importance to protect deep groundwater since many people depend on this valuable drinking water source especially in the beijing area the investigated tap water samples with minor water quality in both seasons seem to reflect a rather low effect of precipitation on the composition of deep groundwater suggesting a more stable composition of deep groundwater this is confirmed by the median values for the physio chemical and chemical parameters of the tap water samples which show except for nitrate smaller differences between wet and dry season concentrations than the river water peters et al 2019 also the spatial distribution of low quality tap water in the northern and southern rural area shows a different pattern compared to river water peters et al 2019 show as fig 3 the most deteriorated tap water can be found in the highest populated areas such as in the southwestern rural area confirming that anthropogenic wastewater is the most important contamination source for rural groundwater e g as shown by nitrate and sulfate isotopes moreover zhai et al 2015 conducted a study on the composition of deep groundwater from the daxing district in the southeastern rural area of beijing focusing groundwater from two seasons june and october 2012 collected in depths between 50 and 200 m the mean concentrations for all hydrochemical parameters including the anthropogenic pollutants fall into the range of values obtained for this study table 1 confirming the groundwater nature of the analyzed tap water moreover the small differences between the mean concentrations of the june and october samples confirm our observation of rather small seasonal changes with respect to the chemical characteristics of deep groundwater from rural beijing as described above in addition the study of zhai et al 2015 revealed that groundwater quality depends on land use worse in residential areas better in agricultural areas indicating the high impact of highly populated areas on beijing groundwater as shown in the present study also the study of choi et al 2005 provides evidence for different degrees of groundwater contamination depending on the type of anthropogenic activities 79 groundwater samples were taken at different locations in seoul south korea considering the different land use characteristics of the metropolitan area seoul represents a mega city similar to beijing with 10 million residents and a very high population density as well as similar climatic conditions cold and dry winters hot and humid summers as in the beijing area the groundwater samples were collected from depths between 50 and 150 m the results indicate increasing anthropogenic pollution in the order of forested green zones agricultural areas residential areas traffic areas industrialized areas confirming the better groundwater quality in agricultural areas compared to residential areas on average the mean ec value of 492 μs cm for seoul groundwater table 1 as a tracer for anthropogenic contamination is lower compared with the median value for groundwater from the beijing rural area 622 623 μs cm however the mean no3 40 7 mg l and cl 53 1 mg l concentrations are clearly higher than the median no3 6 0 13 6 mg l and cl 24 1 33 8 mg l concentrations in the groundwater derived tap water of rural beijing hence although the pollutant concentrations in the deeper groundwater from seoul and beijing differ the spatial distribution of the contaminants according to the land use type is rather similar indicating that the degree of the anthropogenic impact on groundwater depends on the specific human activities 3 3 the isotopic composition and the sources of the tap water the tap water displays a ca mg hco3 composition fig 4 groundwater in the beijing area is characterized by ca2 and mg2 as the dominant cations lower na fractions as well as hco3 as the dominant anion reflecting the influence of the paleoproterozoic carbonates on the water chemistry chen et al 2003 aji et al 2008 hence the tap water from the rural area of beijing which are derived from the lower aquifers shows a similar cation composition 3 3 1 cl concentrations in tap water the tap water samples exhibit cl concentrations between 2 3 and 210 8 mg l in the wet season and between 2 7 and 171 0 mg l in the dry season table 1 all values are below the drinking water standard limit of 250 mg l table 2 suggesting a sufficient drinking water quality with respect to dissolved chloride this is also confirmed by the relatively low median values of 24 1 and 33 8 mg l for wet and dry seasons respectively the tap water in the southern rural area is not significantly heavier affected by chloride rich contributions fig 2 confirming the lower influence of urban contaminants on the rural groundwater as previously proposed according to the ec values of the tap water samples however the highest values show the samples from the southwestern area which is characterized by the highest population density in rural beijing 3 3 2 f concentrations in tap water f concentrations for the tap water samples range between 0 1 and 1 2 mg l in the wet season and between 0 1 and 1 0 mg l in the dry season table 1 one tap water from the north taken in the dry season as well as one tap water from the south taken in the wet season show a f concentration above the drinking water limit of 1 0 mg l excessive fluorine in human bodies may cause dental and or skeletal fluorosis and harm kidneys nerves and muscles who 2011 hence the high f tap water in the beijing rural area is not appropriate for drinking fluoride concentration in water depends on several contributing factors such as ph total dissolved solids alkalinity and hardness karthikeyan and shanmugasundarraj 2000 subba 2003 usually fluoride in water come from geogenic or anthirpogenic sources moreover the fluoride concentration in rocks showed the orders of metamorphic rock fire forming rock sedimentary rock viswanathan et al 2009 this two points of high f was invaded with igneous rocks without these three rocks in this study the relatively high median concentrations of 0 4 and 0 5 mg l in wet and dry season might be partially caused by the high background values next to anthropogenic pollution sources the hydrochemical map fig 2 shows a similar distribution of f in tap water from the northern and southern rural area as for f in river water peters et al 2019 this indicates that next to local rivers the natural and fertilizer derived fluoride also percolates into the deep aquifers 3 3 3 no3 concentrations and the isotopic characteristics in tap water the no3 concentrations in the tap water samples ranges widely from 1 0 to 146 7 mg l in the wet season with a median value of 6 0 mg l and from 0 8 to 122 8 mg l in the dry season with a median value of 13 6 mg l table 1 eight samples 26 in the wet season and five samples 16 in the dry season show elevated no3 abundances above the chinese drinking water guideline limit of 44 mg l in addition one sample 3 in the wet season and four samples 13 in the dry season display relatively high no3 concentration above 30 mg l hence 29 of the tap water in the beijing rural area in wet and dry season show critical no3 levels which pose a serious health risk for the local population especially for children and babies high nitrate tap water enhances the risk for methaemoglobinaemia in bottle fed infants particularly in the case of simultaneous gastrointestinal infections who 2011 methaemoglobinaemia also known as the bluebaby syndrome is caused by nitrate which is reduced to nitrite in the infant s stomach the nitrite in turn oxidizes hemoglobin to methaemoglobin which is unable to transport oxygen in the veins sadeq et al 2008 consequently although the groundwater derived tap water in the beijing rural area represents the vital drinking water source for many local residents almost one third of this tap water is not appropriate to be used frequently for drinking or cooking purposes the distribution map fig 2 reveals that again most of the high nitrate tap water samples were collected in the rural southwest with a higher population than the rest of the rural area interestingly also the samples from the rural north display relatively high no3 levels although this area shows lower ec values and cl concentrations in tap water indicating a lower contribution of urban effluents compared to the southwestern area however most of the n and o isotopic compositions for high nitrate tap water from the north fall into the range for manure and septic waste in the δ15n no3 vs δ18o no3 plot fig 5 a as well as the nitrate from the southwest suggesting sewage as the prime no3 source one explanation could be that wastewater in the villages and towns of the northern rural area is accidentally released to the underground possibly by leaking wastewater pipes due to corrosion then to the local rivers in addition another yet unidentified nitrate source for the tap water samples from the north cannot be ruled out the nitrate is necessarily formed by nitrification in theory no3 formed by nitrification microbial mediated oxidation derives two of its oxygen atoms from water and one from dissolved o2 which has a similar isotopic composition to atmospheric oxygen bottcher et al 1990 shown as fig 5b most samples revealed δ18o no3 values around this value which suggests nitrification as the major source of nitrate in this area in addition there are two samples point 7 and 29 with low δ15n values considering that land use type of these two points is agricultural land the low δ15n values might dues to nitrification of agricultural fertilization 3 4 so4 2 concentrations and isotopic characteristics in tap water the tap water samples exhibit so4 2 concentrations between 3 9 and 272 8 mg l in the wet season with a median value of 48 4 mg l and between 2 2 and 200 8 mg l in the dry season with a median value of 60 0 mg l table 2 only one sample cw19 taken in the wet season exceeds the national standard value of 250 mg l although dissolved sulfate in potable water does not pose a serious health risk this water should be not frequently used for drinking due to the risk of catharsis dehydration and gastrointestinal irritation sigman et al 2001 saleh et al 2001 the hydrochemical map for so4 2 fig 2 shows that tap water from the southern rural area is more heavily contaminated than tap water from the northern rural area in contrast to the distribution of ec cl and no3 fig 2 however the highest concentrations are again shown by the samples from the southwest confirming the influence of the residents in the highest populated area of rural beijing on the groundwater composition this is also evident from the δ34s and δ18o results revealing beijing sewage as the dominant sulfate source fig 6 for most tap water samples this result is according with the study of li et al 2016 which suggested that the pollution of some rivers in beijing ware mainly due to the untreated sewage discharge moreover the isotopic compositions of sulfate from some tap water samples suggest a contribution of sulfate from local detergents characterized by higher δ34s and δ18o values however this is not confirmed by the results of the δ33s measurements thirteen samples of the wet season and eight samples of the dry season display δ33s ranges from 0 045 to 0 020 and from 0 054 and 0 002 respectively table 3 most samples are located in or near the field for beijing sewage only the data points of the samples cw3 and cw9 are located in the field for local detergents which is in contrast to their locations in the δ34s δ18o plot where they lie aside of the detergents field furthermore some samples lie in the field for fertilizer in the δ34s δ33s plot fig 7 but not in the δ34s δ18o plot hence we interpret the isotopic compositions of these samples as influenced by not yet identified sulfate sources rather than by sulfate from beijing fertilizers or detergents however some contribution of sulfate from these sources to the local ground and drinking water cannot be ruled out 4 conclusions firstly thirty percent of the tap water samples in the wet season and twenty three percent from the dry season show concentrations above the guideline limits with dissolved nitrate as the major pollutant moreover half of tap water could not be drunk due to the pollution of ammonium in wet season this tap water is hazardous for human health especially for children and babies and should not be consumed frequently secondly the amount of precipitation shows only a minor effect on the tap water composition moreover no difference between the tap water quality from the northern and from the southern rural area is discernible thirdly sewage represents the dominant source of pollution for tap water as reflected by the stable isotopes of dissolved nitrate and sulfate this is confirmed by the spatial distribution of deteriorated tap water which can be found predominantly in the highest populated regions especially in the southwestern rural area this distribution suggests leaking sewer pipes and or irresponsible discharge of wastewater to the environment which reaches even deep groundwater through shallow groundwater leakage probably through pumping activities overall results reveal that human wastewater has substantially influenced the composition of tap water in the beijing rural area this represents a serious health risk for humans due to the usage of deep groundwater as the vital drinking water source in the beijing area and exerts a major control on the local ecology therefore it is necessary to control public and private sewage disposal and update leaking sewer pipes in order to reduce the risk of anthropogenic contamination of groundwater representing the prime drinking water

5332,a one dimensional 1d and two dimensional 2d coupling procedure for solute transport is presented using the lattice boltzmann method lbm it makes use of the advantage of the lbm boundary treatment and avoids the boundary control volume problems of the traditional computational fluid dynamics cfd methods such as the high order finite difference method fdm and the finite volume method fvm the proposed coupling scheme only uses the solute particle distributions and kinetic velocities at current time to calculate the missing particle distributions at the boundary lattices concentration variables can then be derived from the mesoscopic particle quantities according to the particle group definition equation in the lbm the calculation is locally dependent and simultaneous so the coupling scheme can be performed right after the calculation of each single dimensional model no asynchronous variables are involved and no further lattice is related to the coupling this can keep the advantage of parallel computation of the lbm and bring the simplicity of the boundary treatment of the lbm to deal with solute transport problems the model is tested by three benchmarks point source solute transported in steady flow diffusion through a square cavity and a sharp curved flow the results show that the 1d 2d coupling model has a good agreement with the analytical solution in the point source transportation and is also able to qualitatively approximate the results achieved by a pre verified full 2d lbm model it is not only an accurate and efficient coupling scheme but also a new cross dimensional coupling method in water quality simulation keywords lattice boltzmann method 1d 2d coupling solute transport cfd mesoscopic 1 introduction solute transport in surface water is a classic example of advection diffusion phenomena in nature it occurs in water bodies such as rivers estuaries lakes and reservoirs the advection component describes the solute mass entering the system via water flow which is a hyperbolic component in the governing equation the diffusion wave is a parabolic procedure which is usually much smaller than the advective component when advection and diffusion take place simultaneously it is difficult to solve the equations in a cross dimensional domain except for in some simple cases there is no analytical solution to the advection diffusion equation ade the most popular solution to the ade is to use traditional numerical techniques such as the finite difference method fdm leonard 1979 presented a stable fdm modeling procedure for convective problems based on a quadratic upstream interpolation but which neglected the effects of oscillation error leonard 1991 further corrected it with the ultimate conservative difference scheme in which the second order scheme still generates un physical waviness finite volume method fvm is another popular approach to solving the ade leveque 1996 introduced a hierarchical conservative solution for the advection problems in multidimensional incompressible flow though it is struggles to deal with discontinuous data ollivier gooch and altena 2002 presented an fvm for the ade with high order accuracy in which the boundary meshes were imposed by boundary conditions but the accuracy still degenerated in the first and the third order schemes some researchers have also used the finite element method fem to achieve approximate solutions of the ade hughes et al 1989 proposed a galerkin least squares scheme to solve the ade the results are second order accurate but the formulation is complicated john and schmeyer 2008 solved the convection diffusion reaction equations where the performance of the methods with different boundary conditions time step and mesh size was uncertain morales hernaández et al 2015 incorporated a solute transport model into an fvm hydrodynamic 1d 2d model for flood simulation but the diffusion term is neglected due to the complexity at the coupling edges all these three kinds of traditional computational fluid dynamics cfd methods not only have their limits in accuracy or efficiency in high solution modeling but also encounter difficulties when dealing with complex boundaries at the cross dimensional areas as an alternative numerical method the lattice boltzmann method lbm has been successfully used to solve the ade in both 1d and 2d water modeling du and liu 2013 cartalade et al 2019 guo et al 1999 developed an lbm model to solve 2d ade by introducing lagrangian variables which achieves only first order accuracy zhou 2009 proposed a five speed lattice 2d lbm ade model which has similar accuracy to but is more efficient than that based on the nine speed lattice for solute transport wang et al 2018 dealt with 1d advection diffusion problems combining the 1d hydrodynamic and solute transport lbm models which was then applied to the simulation of pollution processes in a real flood event furthermore the particular characteristic of the lbm s directional particle distributions simplifies the process of 1d 2d model coupling in addition the intrinsic computing locality of the lbm brings the advantage in parallel computing which can increase the efficiency of the coupled model when dealing with intensive computing problems such as solving partial differential equations pdes in modeling the solute transport in environmental systems in this paper we propose a novel solute transport coupling scheme using lattice boltzmann method coupling the 1d and 2d model at mesoscopic level instead of coupling the 1d and 2d model by manipulating macroscopic concentration at the boundary the proposed model provides an improved treatment of the diffusion phenomenon at the 1d 2d coupling area by calculating the transfer parameters between the 1d lattice and the 2d boundary using the exclusive mesoscopic quantity the particle distributions the mass and momentum conservation was satisfied by balancing the solute concentration and solute flux at the coupling boundary of the 1d and the 2d model this not only simplifies the coupling procedure of 1d 2d models like the river lake system but also improves the efficiency of the coupling model without the sacrifice on the accuracy of solute transport in the lateral direction the only calculation error may come from the neglect of lateral velocity during the parameter derivation 2 the lattice boltzmann method the lattice boltzmann method lbm is a promising numerical method firstly derived from lattice gas automata he and luo 1997 two decades ago it is proven to be an accurate and reliable method for both 1d and 2d solute transport modeling zhou 2009 wang et al 2018 in contrast to other traditional numerical methods the lbm solution to the ade is to simulate the microscopic solute particles movement by a kinetic mesoscopic model instead of the discretization of the ade in time and space directly chen and doolen 1998 lallemand and luo 2000 the particle motion reveals the macro fluids averaging variable in the connection between the macro and micro levels kadanoff 1986 which is represented in the lattice boltzmann equation lbe the particles move forward and backward on pre defined lattices a process called streaming the particles in the same lattice then collide with each other and reach a certain equilibrium status zhou 2004 the combination of these two collective behaviors results in the lattice boltzmann equation lbe zhou 2004 lallemand and luo 2000 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 there are single relaxation time srt two relaxation time trt and the multiple relaxation time mrt lbm models which has different collision operators and results in different stability and numerical accuracy for solving incompressible navier stokes equations the mrt and trt has similar results in most general flow features luo et al 2011 the two relaxation time trt collision operator was adopted to keep the simplicity for solving the ade ginzburg 2005 ginzburg 2005 the trt lbm scheme is presented by the following mesoscopic kinetic equation 1 f α x e α δ t t δ t f α x t 1 τ f α x t f α eq x t 1 τ f α x t f α eq x t where f α x t is the symmetric pre collision distribution function in space and time and f α eq x t is the symmetric post collision equilibrium distribution function f α x t and f α eq x t are the anti symmetric pre collision distribution function and post collision equilibrium distribution function respectively which are given by 2 f α 1 2 f α f α 3 f α 1 2 f α f α 4 f α eq 1 2 f α eq f α eq 5 f α eq 1 2 f α eq f α eq the δ t is the change in time τ is the symmetric relaxation time and τ is the anti symmetric relaxation time when τ τ the trt lbm is simplified to the srt lbm model the advection diffusion equation without the source and sink terms is fischer et al 1979 6 ch t u ch x v ch y w ch z k d 2 ch x 2 2 ch y 2 2 ch z 2 the 1d lbm for the ade was presented by wang et al 2018 and the equilibrium distribution function f α eq is wang et al 2018 7 f α eq 1 2 λ ch e α uch 2 e 2 α 1 2 1 λ ch α 3 where h is the water depth u is the water velocity c is the concentration of solute and λ is a linear equation of diffusion coefficient k d and particle velocity e expressed as 8 λ k d δ t τ 1 2 e 2 the solution of concentration can be derived from the sum of the distribution function f α in all directions 9 c 1 h α f α the 2d lbm for the ade was developed by zhou 2009 and it has been shown to be accurate and efficient for the most solute transport problems the f α eq for the 2d model on d 2 q 5 lattice is 10 f α eq 1 λ j e i 2 λ i e j 2 e i e j ch α 0 e j λ i 2 e i e α i u i 2 e i 2 ch α 1 3 e i λ j 2 e j e α j u j 2 e j 2 ch α 2 4 where the 2d diffusion coefficient λ ij is 11 λ ij kd ij δ t τ 1 2 e i e j the 2d solute concentration c is same as the 1d case eq 9 3 1d 2d coupling scheme for the 1d 2d coupling problems most previous research has adopted the upwind scheme coupling for advection diffusion which used the water velocity to determine the solute transport direction then solved the ade using either fdm or fvm but this inevitably brings about calculation error due to the approximation at the coupling boundary the superposition method can here create an artificial overlapped zone for the 1d and the 2d model to deal with the coupling error this can eliminate the un physical oscillation of solute concentration but decrease the efficiency of the coupling model in order to directly couple the last lattice of the 1d model with the boundary lattices of the 2d model the width of the 1d boundary lattice is assumed to be equals to the 2d boundary lattice size the missing particle distributions represented by dashed arrows in fig 1 are unknown quantities to be calculated for the 1d 2d solute transport coupling model the 1d particle distribution at α 2 directions is missing at the boundary lattice because it flows from the downstream during the streaming process for the 2d boundary lattices the particle distributions at α 1 direction is vacant for the same reason first take the upstream 1d model coupling with the downstream 2d model as an example reverse coupling works in the same way the concentration in the 1d boundary lattice is assumed to be same as the averaged concentration of the 2d boundary lattices then the mass and momentum conservation of the solute can be listed as 12 c 1 d end c 2 d 1 13 u 1 d end c 1 d end u 2 d 1 c 2 d 1 where c 1 d end represents concentration of the last lattice of the 1d model and c 2 d 1 is the averaged concentration of the first column of the 2d lattices similarly u 1 d end is the velocity of the last 1d lattice and u 2 d x is the averaged velocity in the x direction of the first column of the 2d lattices the over bar is the averaged calculation of all lattices in the same column according to wang et al 2018 we have the following momentum solution for solute flux u 1 d c 1 d 14 u 1 d c 1 d 1 h 1 d α e α 1 d f α 1 d hence the unknown direction particle distribution f 1 d 2 can be expressed as 15 f 1 d 2 f 1 d 1 h 1 d u 1 d c 1 d e 1 d substituting eq 15 into eq 9 gives 16 c 1 d 1 h f 1 d 0 2 f 1 d 1 u 1 d c 1 d e 1 d for the 2d solute transport model zhou 2009 had listed the momentum solution as 17 u 2 d c 2 d 1 h 2 d α α 1 3 e α 2 d f α eq 2 d 18 v 2 d c 2 d 1 h 2 d α α 2 4 e α 2 d f α eq 2 d where v 2 d is the lateral velocity of the 2d model as the momentum conservation should be kept on the coupling boundary v 2 d 0 should be satisfied from eq 17 the particle distribution at the unknown direction f 2 d 1 can be derived as 19 f 2 d 1 f 2 d 3 h 2 d u 2 d c 2 d e 2 d substituting eq 19 into eq 9 gives 20 c 2 d 1 h f 2 d 0 f 2 d 2 2 f 2 d 3 f 2 d 4 u 2 d c 2 d e 2 d then substituting eqs 16 and 20 into eq 12 brings 21 1 h 1 d end f 1 d 0 end 2 f 1 d 1 end u 1 d end c 1 d end e 1 d 1 h 2 d 1 f 2 d 0 1 f 2 d 2 1 2 f 2 d 3 1 f 2 d 4 1 u 2 d 1 c 2 d 1 e 2 d according to the momentum conservation eq 13 u 1 d end c 1 d end and u 2 d 1 c 2 d 1 is the same therefore a notation mo 1 d 2 d is used to represent the solute flux as 22 mo 1 d 2 d u 1 d end c 1 d end u 2 d 1 c 2 d 1 in addition the water depth at the coupling boundaries should be the same 23 h 1 d 2 d h 1 d end h 2 d 1 so substituting eq 22 and 23 into eq 21 leads to the solute flux equation 24 mo 1 d 2 d e 1 d e 2 d h 1 d 2 d e 1 d e 2 d f 1 d 0 end 2 f 1 d 1 end f 2 d 0 1 f 2 d 2 1 2 f 2 d 3 1 f 2 d 4 1 then substituting mo 1 d 2 d into eq 15 gives the unknown particle distribution of the 1d model 25 f 1 d 2 f 1 d 1 e 2 d e 1 d e 2 d f 1 d 0 end 2 f 1 d 1 end f 2 d 0 1 f 2 d 2 1 2 f 2 d 3 1 f 2 d 4 1 also the unknown particle distribution of the 2d model can be derived by substituting mo 1 d 2 d into eq 19 26 f 2 d 1 f 2 d 3 e 1 d e 1 d e 2 d f 1 d 0 end 2 f 1 d 1 end f 2 d 0 1 f 2 d 2 1 2 f 2 d 3 1 f 2 d 4 1 from eqs 25 and 26 it can be seen that the unknown particle distributions f 1 d 2 and f 2 d 1 are calculated from the particle velocity and known particle distributions of the 1d and the 2d model the 1d solute transport model is coupled with the 2d model by satisfying the conservation of mass and momentum in the horizontal direction for conserving lateral momentum v 0 should also be satisfied according to eq 18 the lateral momentum condition and mass balance should be kept through the following equation on the 2d lattices 27 f 2 d 2 1 f 2 d 4 1 1 2 f 2 d 2 1 f 2 d 4 1 with respect to the stability condition of the coupled model it should satisfy the stability requirement for both 1d and 2d lbm for the ade model which has been discussed by wang et al 2018 and zhou 2004 resulting in that the relaxation coefficient should be bigger than 0 5 28 τ 1 d 1 2 τ 2 d 1 2 although the stability condition does not require all the particle distribution functions being positive they still can provide good stability with reasonable results this gives the stability condition related to the lattice size 29 δ x 1 d 2 k d e 1 d δ x 2 d 2 kd ij e 2 d δ y 2 d 2 kd ij e 2 d in this way the 1d and 2d models have been coupled successfully by satisfying both mass and momentum conservation in all directions the coupling scheme calculates the missing particle distributions by using known particle distributions and the particle velocity of both models no further calculation are needed except the balancing at the lateral direction this scheme takes the advantage of lbm s simplicity on the boundary condition there is no artificial superposition zone and no iteration calculation it is a conservative and efficient approach to coupling 1d and 2d models for solute transport 4 benchmarks in order to test the accuracy of the proposed model the full 2d lbm models were setup for comparison which have already been verified zhou 2009 three benchmarks are used a point source transport in steady flow a solute diffusion through a square cavity and the flow in a sharp curved channel 4 1 point source solute transported in steady flow point source transported in steady flow is a classical scenario to verify advection diffusion ad model in this case the result of 1d 2d coupled lbm ad model and the full 2d lbm ad model labade 2 d zhou 2004 was compared against its analytical solution 30 c x t c 0 4 π dt exp x ut 2 4 dt the test case consists of a 500 m long straight channel of 2 5 m in width with flat bed the steady flow velocity is set as 0 008 m s for the whole channel with 0 5 m in depth a similar test was performed by zhou 2009 and wang et al 2018 the 1d 2d lbm model was composed of 500 1d lattices and 500 7 2d lattices the lattice size for the 1d domain is 0 5 m and the 2d lattice is 0 5 m 0 5 m the 1d and 2d domain coupled at x 250 m a 1 g m point source was added to the channel at x 20 m at t 0 s the dispersion coefficient is k x k y 0 01 m 2 s for the whole area fig 2 plots the comparison of snapshots at 6 different time during the evolution of the concentration it is clear that both the 1d 2d lbm and the full 2d lbm models can produce great agreement at all the time the accuracy is further compared by calculating the root mean square error in table 1 the 1d 2d coupled model has acceptable accuracy compared to the 2d lbm results see fig 3 4 2 diffusion through a square cavity in the river lake system the flow characteristics are shown as typical 1d 2d coupled flows in this case a 1 5 m 1 5 m cavity is set up linked to a 0 75 m long channels both upstream and downstream the channel width is 0 156 m and the 13 lattices at the boundaries of the 2d cavity are coupled with the boundary lattices of the 1d models the constant static water domain is 0 1 m in depth the initial concentration is zero in all water domains and a constant solute

in a sharp curved channel generates complex fluid characteristics in this case a 180 sharp curved channel was used to verify the 1d 2d coupled solute transport model the straight channels are 100 m long both upstream and downstream of the curved channel the channel is 20 m wide at all sections and the inner radius is 30 m as shown in fig 8 initially the water depth is 5 m and water velocity is zero the boundary velocity is u 0 5 m s and u 0 5 m s at the inlet and outlet respectively the 1d channels are coupled with the 2d curved channel at the end of the channels shown in yellow lines in fig 8 three monitoring points are set at the center of the channels the solute concentration c 0 1 g m is added at the lower inlet the diffusion coefficient was set at k d k di k dj 0 2 m 2 s and the relaxation coefficients at τ τ 1 5 the lattice size is δ x δ y 1 m so the 1d model boundary lattice is coupled with 20 2d model boundary lattices at the curved channel the time series of the solute concentration at the three monitoring points are displayed in fig 9 it demonstrates that the 1d 2d model is able to reproduce similar results to the full 2d model with very small relative error the solute concentration at the curved area has been plotted in fig 10 it shows that the 1d 2d result displayed almost the same distribution as the full 2d result it implies that the coupled model is able to simulate the eddy flows at the sharp curved area only slight differences appear at the downstream coupling boundary where the error is small and could be neglected the lattice number of the 1d 2d coupled model is much less than the full 2d model therefore computation efficiency is much higher than in the full 2d model which is an advantage of a cross dimensional coupled model over a higher

5332,a one dimensional 1d and two dimensional 2d coupling procedure for solute transport is presented using the lattice boltzmann method lbm it makes use of the advantage of the lbm boundary treatment and avoids the boundary control volume problems of the traditional computational fluid dynamics cfd methods such as the high order finite difference method fdm and the finite volume method fvm the proposed coupling scheme only uses the solute particle distributions and kinetic velocities at current time to calculate the missing particle distributions at the boundary lattices concentration variables can then be derived from the mesoscopic particle quantities according to the particle group definition equation in the lbm the calculation is locally dependent and simultaneous so the coupling scheme can be performed right after the calculation of each single dimensional model no asynchronous variables are involved and no further lattice is related to the coupling this can keep the advantage of parallel computation of the lbm and bring the simplicity of the boundary treatment of the lbm to deal with solute transport problems the model is tested by three benchmarks point source solute transported in steady flow diffusion through a square cavity and a sharp curved flow the results show that the 1d 2d coupling model has a good agreement with the analytical solution in the point source transportation and is also able to qualitatively approximate the results achieved by a pre verified full 2d lbm model it is not only an accurate and efficient coupling scheme but also a new cross dimensional coupling method in water quality simulation keywords lattice boltzmann method 1d 2d coupling solute transport cfd mesoscopic 1 introduction solute transport in surface water is a classic example of advection diffusion phenomena in nature it occurs in water bodies such as rivers estuaries lakes and reservoirs the advection component describes the solute mass entering the system via water flow which is a hyperbolic component in the governing equation the diffusion wave is a parabolic procedure which is usually much smaller than the advective component when advection and diffusion take place simultaneously it is difficult to solve the equations in a cross dimensional domain except for in some simple cases there is no analytical solution to the advection diffusion equation ade the most popular solution to the ade is to use traditional numerical techniques such as the finite difference method fdm leonard 1979 presented a stable fdm modeling procedure for convective problems based on a quadratic upstream interpolation but which neglected the effects of oscillation error leonard 1991 further corrected it with the ultimate conservative difference scheme in which the second order scheme still generates un physical waviness finite volume method fvm is another popular approach to solving the ade leveque 1996 introduced a hierarchical conservative solution for the advection problems in multidimensional incompressible flow though it is struggles to deal with discontinuous data ollivier gooch and altena 2002 presented an fvm for the ade with high order accuracy in which the boundary meshes were imposed by boundary conditions but the accuracy still degenerated in the first and the third order schemes some researchers have also used the finite element method fem to achieve approximate solutions of the ade hughes et al 1989 proposed a galerkin least squares scheme to solve the ade the results are second order accurate but the formulation is complicated john and schmeyer 2008 solved the convection diffusion reaction equations where the performance of the methods with different boundary conditions time step and mesh size was uncertain morales hernaández et al 2015 incorporated a solute transport model into an fvm hydrodynamic 1d 2d model for flood simulation but the diffusion term is neglected due to the complexity at the coupling edges all these three kinds of traditional computational fluid dynamics cfd methods not only have their limits in accuracy or efficiency in high solution modeling but also encounter difficulties when dealing with complex boundaries at the cross dimensional areas as an alternative numerical method the lattice boltzmann method lbm has been successfully used to solve the ade in both 1d and 2d water modeling du and liu 2013 cartalade et al 2019 guo et al 1999 developed an lbm model to solve 2d ade by introducing lagrangian variables which achieves only first order accuracy zhou 2009 proposed a five speed lattice 2d lbm ade model which has similar accuracy to but is more efficient than that based on the nine speed lattice for solute transport wang et al 2018 dealt with 1d advection diffusion problems combining the 1d hydrodynamic and solute transport lbm models which was then applied to the simulation of pollution processes in a real flood event furthermore the particular characteristic of the lbm s directional particle distributions simplifies the process of 1d 2d model coupling in addition the intrinsic computing locality of the lbm brings the advantage in parallel computing which can increase the efficiency of the coupled model when dealing with intensive computing problems such as solving partial differential equations pdes in modeling the solute transport in environmental systems in this paper we propose a novel solute transport coupling scheme using lattice boltzmann method coupling the 1d and 2d model at mesoscopic level instead of coupling the 1d and 2d model by manipulating macroscopic concentration at the boundary the proposed model provides an improved treatment of the diffusion phenomenon at the 1d 2d coupling area by calculating the transfer parameters between the 1d lattice and the 2d boundary using the exclusive mesoscopic quantity the particle distributions the mass and momentum conservation was satisfied by balancing the solute concentration and solute flux at the coupling boundary of the 1d and the 2d model this not only simplifies the coupling procedure of 1d 2d models like the river lake system but also improves the efficiency of the coupling model without the sacrifice on the accuracy of solute transport in the lateral direction the only calculation error may come from the neglect of lateral velocity during the parameter derivation 2 the lattice boltzmann method the lattice boltzmann method lbm is a promising numerical method firstly derived from lattice gas automata he and luo 1997 two decades ago it is proven to be an accurate and reliable method for both 1d and 2d solute transport modeling zhou 2009 wang et al 2018 in contrast to other traditional numerical methods the lbm solution to the ade is to simulate the microscopic solute particles movement by a kinetic mesoscopic model instead of the discretization of the ade in time and space directly chen and doolen 1998 lallemand and luo 2000 the particle motion reveals the macro fluids averaging variable in the connection between the macro and micro levels kadanoff 1986 which is represented in the lattice boltzmann equation lbe the particles move forward and backward on pre defined lattices a process called streaming the particles in the same lattice then collide with each other and reach a certain equilibrium status zhou 2004 the combination of these two collective behaviors results in the lattice boltzmann equation lbe zhou 2004 lallemand and luo 2000 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 there are single relaxation time srt two relaxation time trt and the multiple relaxation time mrt lbm models which has different collision operators and results in different stability and numerical accuracy for solving incompressible navier stokes equations the mrt and trt has similar results in most general flow features luo et al 2011 the two relaxation time trt collision operator was adopted to keep the simplicity for solving the ade ginzburg 2005 ginzburg 2005 the trt lbm scheme is presented by the following mesoscopic kinetic equation 1 f α x e α δ t t δ t f α x t 1 τ f α x t f α eq x t 1 τ f α x t f α eq x t where f α x t is the symmetric pre collision distribution function in space and time and f α eq x t is the symmetric post collision equilibrium distribution function f α x t and f α eq x t are the anti symmetric pre collision distribution function and post collision equilibrium distribution function respectively which are given by 2 f α 1 2 f α f α 3 f α 1 2 f α f α 4 f α eq 1 2 f α eq f α eq 5 f α eq 1 2 f α eq f α eq the δ t is the change in time τ is the symmetric relaxation time and τ is the anti symmetric relaxation time when τ τ the trt lbm is simplified to the srt lbm model the advection diffusion equation without the source and sink terms is fischer et al 1979 6 ch t u ch x v ch y w ch z k d 2 ch x 2 2 ch y 2 2 ch z 2 the 1d lbm for the ade was presented by wang et al 2018 and the equilibrium distribution function f α eq is wang et al 2018 7 f α eq 1 2 λ ch e α uch 2 e 2 α 1 2 1 λ ch α 3 where h is the water depth u is the water velocity c is the concentration of solute and λ is a linear equation of diffusion coefficient k d and particle velocity e expressed as 8 λ k d δ t τ 1 2 e 2 the solution of concentration can be derived from the sum of the distribution function f α in all directions 9 c 1 h α f α the 2d lbm for the ade was developed by zhou 2009 and it has been shown to be accurate and efficient for the most solute transport problems the f α eq for the 2d model on d 2 q 5 lattice is 10 f α eq 1 λ j e i 2 λ i e j 2 e i e j ch α 0 e j λ i 2 e i e α i u i 2 e i 2 ch α 1 3 e i λ j 2 e j e α j u j 2 e j 2 ch α 2 4 where the 2d diffusion coefficient λ ij is 11 λ ij kd ij δ t τ 1 2 e i e j the 2d solute concentration c is same as the 1d case eq 9 3 1d 2d coupling scheme for the 1d 2d coupling problems most previous research has adopted the upwind scheme coupling for advection diffusion which used the water velocity to determine the solute transport direction then solved the ade using either fdm or fvm but this inevitably brings about calculation error due to the approximation at the coupling boundary the superposition method can here create an artificial overlapped zone for the 1d and the 2d model to deal with the coupling error this can eliminate the un physical oscillation of solute concentration but decrease the efficiency of the coupling model in order to directly couple the last lattice of the 1d model with the boundary lattices of the 2d model the width of the 1d boundary lattice is assumed to be equals to the 2d boundary lattice size the missing particle distributions represented by dashed arrows in fig 1 are unknown quantities to be calculated for the 1d 2d solute transport coupling model the 1d particle distribution at α 2 directions is missing at the boundary lattice because it flows from the downstream during the streaming process for the 2d boundary lattices the particle distributions at α 1 direction is vacant for the same reason first take the upstream 1d model coupling with the downstream 2d model as an example reverse coupling works in the same way the concentration in the 1d boundary lattice is assumed to be same as the averaged concentration of the 2d boundary lattices then the mass and momentum conservation of the solute can be listed as 12 c 1 d end c 2 d 1 13 u 1 d end c 1 d end u 2 d 1 c 2 d 1 where c 1 d end represents concentration of the last lattice of the 1d model and c 2 d 1 is the averaged concentration of the first column of the 2d lattices similarly u 1 d end is the velocity of the last 1d lattice and u 2 d x is the averaged velocity in the x direction of the first column of the 2d lattices the over bar is the averaged calculation of all lattices in the same column according to wang et al 2018 we have the following momentum solution for solute flux u 1 d c 1 d 14 u 1 d c 1 d 1 h 1 d α e α 1 d f α 1 d hence the unknown direction particle distribution f 1 d 2 can be expressed as 15 f 1 d 2 f 1 d 1 h 1 d u 1 d c 1 d e 1 d substituting eq 15 into eq 9 gives 16 c 1 d 1 h f 1 d 0 2 f 1 d 1 u 1 d c 1 d e 1 d for the 2d solute transport model zhou 2009 had listed the momentum solution as 17 u 2 d c 2 d 1 h 2 d α α 1 3 e α 2 d f α eq 2 d 18 v 2 d c 2 d 1 h 2 d α α 2 4 e α 2 d f α eq 2 d where v 2 d is the lateral velocity of the 2d model as the momentum conservation should be kept on the coupling boundary v 2 d 0 should be satisfied from eq 17 the particle distribution at the unknown direction f 2 d 1 can be derived as 19 f 2 d 1 f 2 d 3 h 2 d u 2 d c 2 d e 2 d substituting eq 19 into eq 9 gives 20 c 2 d 1 h f 2 d 0 f 2 d 2 2 f 2 d 3 f 2 d 4 u 2 d c 2 d e 2 d then substituting eqs 16 and 20 into eq 12 brings 21 1 h 1 d end f 1 d 0 end 2 f 1 d 1 end u 1 d end c 1 d end e 1 d 1 h 2 d 1 f 2 d 0 1 f 2 d 2 1 2 f 2 d 3 1 f 2 d 4 1 u 2 d 1 c 2 d 1 e 2 d according to the momentum conservation eq 13 u 1 d end c 1 d end and u 2 d 1 c 2 d 1 is the same therefore a notation mo 1 d 2 d is used to represent the solute flux as 22 mo 1 d 2 d u 1 d end c 1 d end u 2 d 1 c 2 d 1 in addition the water depth at the coupling boundaries should be the same 23 h 1 d 2 d h 1 d end h 2 d 1 so substituting eq 22 and 23 into eq 21 leads to the solute flux equation 24 mo 1 d 2 d e 1 d e 2 d h 1 d 2 d e 1 d e 2 d f 1 d 0 end 2 f 1 d 1 end f 2 d 0 1 f 2 d 2 1 2 f 2 d 3 1 f 2 d 4 1 then substituting mo 1 d 2 d into eq 15 gives the unknown particle distribution of the 1d model 25 f 1 d 2 f 1 d 1 e 2 d e 1 d e 2 d f 1 d 0 end 2 f 1 d 1 end f 2 d 0 1 f 2 d 2 1 2 f 2 d 3 1 f 2 d 4 1 also the unknown particle distribution of the 2d model can be derived by substituting mo 1 d 2 d into eq 19 26 f 2 d 1 f 2 d 3 e 1 d e 1 d e 2 d f 1 d 0 end 2 f 1 d 1 end f 2 d 0 1 f 2 d 2 1 2 f 2 d 3 1 f 2 d 4 1 from eqs 25 and 26 it can be seen that the unknown particle distributions f 1 d 2 and f 2 d 1 are calculated from the particle velocity and known particle distributions of the 1d and the 2d model the 1d solute transport model is coupled with the 2d model by satisfying the conservation of mass and momentum in the horizontal direction for conserving lateral momentum v 0 should also be satisfied according to eq 18 the lateral momentum condition and mass balance should be kept through the following equation on the 2d lattices 27 f 2 d 2 1 f 2 d 4 1 1 2 f 2 d 2 1 f 2 d 4 1 with respect to the stability condition of the coupled model it should satisfy the stability requirement for both 1d and 2d lbm for the ade model which has been discussed by wang et al 2018 and zhou 2004 resulting in that the relaxation coefficient should be bigger than 0 5 28 τ 1 d 1 2 τ 2 d 1 2 although the stability condition does not require all the particle distribution functions being positive they still can provide good stability with reasonable results this gives the stability condition related to the lattice size 29 δ x 1 d 2 k d e 1 d δ x 2 d 2 kd ij e 2 d δ y 2 d 2 kd ij e 2 d in this way the 1d and 2d models have been coupled successfully by satisfying both mass and momentum conservation in all directions the coupling scheme calculates the missing particle distributions by using known particle distributions and the particle velocity of both models no further calculation are needed except the balancing at the lateral direction this scheme takes the advantage of lbm s simplicity on the boundary condition there is no artificial superposition zone and no iteration calculation it is a conservative and efficient approach to coupling 1d and 2d models for solute transport 4 benchmarks in order to test the accuracy of the proposed model the full 2d lbm models were setup for comparison which have already been verified zhou 2009 three benchmarks are used a point source transport in steady flow a solute diffusion through a square cavity and the flow in a sharp curved channel 4 1 point source

long both upstream and downstream of the curved channel the channel is 20 m wide at all sections and the inner radius is 30 m as shown in fig 8 initially the water depth is 5 m and water velocity is zero the boundary velocity is u 0 5 m s and u 0 5 m s at the inlet and outlet respectively the 1d channels are coupled with the 2d curved channel at the end of the channels shown in yellow lines in fig 8 three monitoring points are set at the center of the channels the solute concentration c 0 1 g m is added at the lower inlet the diffusion coefficient was set at k d k di k dj 0 2 m 2 s and the relaxation coefficients at τ τ 1 5 the lattice size is δ x δ y 1 m so the 1d model boundary lattice is coupled with 20 2d model boundary lattices at the curved channel the time series of the solute

5333,accurately estimating field mean of soil water content swc is important for irrigation management in an agricultural field temporal stability ts analysis has been widely applied to identify representative locations rls for predicting spatial mean of swc in natural landscapes the objectives of the study were to examine ts patterns of swc at various soil depths in different years and to evaluate the performance of ts analysis in predicting field mean in an irrigated vineyard soil water content was measured regularly at 135 locations in the vineyard at soil depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm in 2012 2014 temporal stability indices of mean relative difference mrd standard deviation of relative difference sdrd the comprehensive indicator ci and the mean absolute bias error mabe were obtained for each location at different depths in different seasons the range of mrd and standard deviation of mrd sdmrd increased with soil depth for the three years inter season correlations of the indices at the same depth were stronger than those between different depths of the same year the rls identified by ci and mabe were different between different soil depths and between the three seasons temporal stability analysis outperformed the random sampling method greatly and on average one single rl could achieve rmse about 2 and the maximum absolute error mae less than 4 at a given sampling day during the validation period when the same year data were used to identify the rl estimation error could be reduced by 40 with the number of rls increased from one to four for most cases four rls identified by 2012 data were good enough to obtain rmse and mae less than 3 for the following two years soil texture information was found unable to identify rls that could reliably estimate field mean temporal stability analysis is a valuable tool in identifying rls to estimate field mean in an irrigated agricultural field while intensive swc sampling during half an irrigation cycle is needed to identify the rls keywords field scale comprehensive indicator mabe representative location soil water content irrigation 1 introduction soil moisture is an important state variable affecting many hydrological and ecological processes such as evaporation and plant root uptake and has important implications for decision making on water management practices in an agricultural field for example soil water content swc has often been used as an indicator variable to trigger irrigation when its value is below the prescribed threshold value soil water content is highly variable in both space and time spatial temporal variability of soil water content especially in near surface soils has long been a research topic of many studies the concept of temporal stability ts was first introduced to demonstrate some locations ability in maintaining their soil water content ranking i e consistently having higher average or lower soil water content than other locations through time vachaud et al 1985 the concept has been applied to describe and compare the temporal stability characteristics of different conditions and to identify representative location rl or locations where the change of swc could reflect the change of spatial average e g kachanoski and de jong 1988 martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 2005 brocca et al 2009 penna et al 2013 biswas 2014 chen et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 he et al 2019 identifying rls is an attempt to reduce the number of samples needed for estimating soil water storage in an area although ts has already been applied widely in a variety of environmental settings the study area in most previous studies was relatively larger and in natural landscapes vanderlinden et al 2012 ran et al 2017 the maximum distance between any sampling locations from 30 published studies was on average 5000 m vanderlinden et al 2012 a few studies have examined ts performance on agricultural lands on the field scale schneider et al 2008 studied the temporal stability of soil moisture in a semi arid steppe field with different grazing intensities of northwestern china they found that temporal stability was consistent during the three year study period but the degree of temporal stability was different between fields with different grazing rates zhao et al 2010 found that spatial patterns of soil moisture were very stable over the 3 year period in the same steppe field guber et al 2008 found that there was considerable ts in swc and ts increased with soil depth in agricultural fields with a total size of 6 ha located at beltsville md previous studies on the field scale reported considerable degree of ts in terms of the persistence of drier or wetter status for a given location however whether ts could be applied in estimating the field mean in different years especially in an irrigated field is uncertain and needs further study application of ts methods in practice has some limitations since identifying rls requires intensive swc sampling campaigns it would be very valuable if the rls could be identified with some invariant soil physical properties efforts have been made to link ts indices with soil properties soil texture in particular jacobs et al 2004 cosh et al 2008 choi and jacobs 2011 previous studies have demonstrated that there was association between ts indices with soil texture temporal stability index of mean relative difference mrd was found significantly different between locations with different texture and locations with the highest sand content tended to have lower ts jacobs et al 2004 choi and jacobs 2011 however whether soil properties could be used to reliably identify rls and accurately predict spatial average of swc remains unclear to identify the most temporally stable points various indices based on ts have been proposed and evaluated in different studies the index is considered a direct one if swc at the rls identified by the index was used directly to estimate the spatial mean for indirect indices the spatial mean is estimated by accounting for the offset between swc at rls and the mean although locations with the smallest mrd have swc closest to the spatial mean on average mrd does not account for the spread of relative difference between swc at those locations with the spatial mean jacobs et al 2004 proposed a direct index combining mean relative difference mrd and standard deviation of relative difference sdrd the index has been referred as root mean square error rmse or comprehensive indicator ci in some other studies hu et al 2012 martínez et al 2014 ran et al 2017 since the term rmse is commonly used as a goodness of fitness index ci was used in this manuscript to represent the ts index as ran et al 2017 did mean absolute bias error mabe was proposed based on the assumption that rls should be the locations with the smallest absolute bias relative to the spatial mean and is an indirect index hu et al 2010 2012 hu et al 2012 found that mabe outperformed ci and among several indirect indices mabe was the best in two different settings of canada prairie landscape and loess plateau of china in a field of desert oasis mabe performed better in estimating area mean relative to sdrd zhang and shao 2017 as mentioned above there have been many studies on ts at a variety of landscapes and scales however most previous studies were conducted in natural landscapes and often at scales larger than a management unit of agricultural land accurate estimation of spatial swc mean from a limited number of monitoring points is especially important for an irrigated field since decision on irrigation is often made based on measured swc at a single point or several points at present results on temporal stability pattern of swc in an intensively irrigated field and whether the estimated spatial mean of swc based on ts would be good enough for irrigation management are lacking therefore the objectives of the study are to investigate ts pattern of swc at different soil depths over the three different years and to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated swc field mean based on the rls identified by ts indices in an irrigated vineyard 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and data collection this experiment was conducted at huangtai vineyard with an area of 7 6 ha at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university 37 52 20 n 102 50 50 e and altitude of 1581 m the climate in the area is typical temperate arid continental with high temperatures in summer cold winters windy and dry weather the mean annual temperature is 8 8 and the frost free period is 150 days the mean annual precipitation is about 164 mm and the mean annual pan evaporation is about 2000 mm pan evaporation is the measurement of water evaporated from open water stored in a pan or tank and is used to estimate potential evaporation or evapotranspiration in a region the average groundwater level can reach over 25 m the grape variety at the site was vitis vinifera l cv merlot noir which was established in 1999 rows in the experimental plots were east west oriented with a spacing of about 270 cm and spacing between vines was about 100 cm the vineyard is furrow irrigated 4 or 6 times during the growth period of each year roughly in early may late may early july and late august and for each irrigation event about 70 mm water is applied before each irrigation event fertilizers including urea zinc compound fertilizer boric acid compound fertilizer and phosphate diamine are applied into holes between grapevines from 2012 to 2014 soil water content was measured at regularly spaced points 25 m apart in both east west and north south directions in a 275 275 m area fig 1 nine points at the edge of the area were omitted from the study due to some unexpected conditions as fig 1 shows there were additional 12 points during 2013 and 2014 which were in closer distance than 25 m with three randomly selected points among those 135 points soil volumetric water content was measured at those sampling locations at three soil depths of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm using a portable device diviner 2000 sennheiser pty ltd australia table 1 shows the frequency of the measurement in the three years measurements were taken approximately every 10 days and additional measurements were taken before and after an irrigation event the measured soil volumetric water content was calibrated using the gravimetric method during the sampling period soil texture clay silt and sand content for 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of 0 20 cm soil were measured by collecting soil samples in may of 2012 soil textural analysis were conducted using a matersizer2000 laser particle size analyzer malvern instruments ltd u k saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using the falling head method klute and dirksen 1986 fig 1 also shows the digital elevation model dem for the sampling area the field was relatively flat with slope less than 2 the accumulated natural precipitation during the study period varied greatly between the three years about 128 72 and 234 mm for 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively fig 2 2 2 data analysis different indicators or criteria based on ts analysis have been used to rank the locations in terms of their time stability i e goodness to represent the area average in this study commonly used indices of mrd sdrd ci and mabe at each location were obtained separately for the three depths of the three years as well as the profile average of the three years data of all sampling days of each year were used to obtain those indices for comparing ts characteristics between different depths and years all the indicators are based on the relative difference rd following the formula proposed by vachaud et al 1985 1 rd i j s i j s j s j where rd i j is the relative difference of the soil water content at the ith sample location of the jth sample day s i j is the measured soil water content at the ith sample location of the jth day of observation s j is the average soil water content of all sample locations on a given jth sample day mean relative difference mrd sdmrd sdrd ci and mabe were calculated by 2 mrd i 1 m j 1 m rd i j 3 sdmrd i 1 n mrd i mrd 2 n 1 4 sdr d i j 1 m r d i j m r d i 2 m 1 5 c i i mr d i 2 s d r d i 2 6 mab e i 1 m j 1 m r d i j m r d i 1 m r d i where m is the number of sampling times used to obtain mrd m r d is the average mrd over all sample locations mean relative difference at each location represents the systematic bias of soil water content at the location regarding to the spatial average and sdrd represents the precision and consistence of the locations in representing the spatial average the evolution of ci and mabe and the five rls identified by them was obtained using sampling times from the minimum of two to the maximum of 17 for 2012 and 2013 and19 for 2014 performance of the two indices in estimating field mean with different number of rls were compared for the comparison the observed swc at each layer in each year was divided into two periods for calibration and validation respectively the calibration period or number of sampling times was determined after evaluating the evolution of the five rls as the five rls identified by both ci and mabe became relatively stable when five sampling times were used to obtain the indices the first five sampling times of each year was set as the calibration period while the remaining period was the validation period locations with the smallest ci and mabe values are considered as the rls to test whether temporal stability properties of the rls could persist over different years the rls identified in 2012 were also used to estimate the field mean of all sampling days in 2013 and 2014 we also included random sampling of 1000 runs into the comparison to evaluate whether the temporal stability analysis would perform better than the simple random sampling method performance of the different estimation methods were evaluated based on root mean square error rmse and the maximum absolute error mae between the predicted and calculated field mean of each sampling day calculated as 7 r m s e 1 m j 1 m θ j θ j 2 8 m a e max j 1 m θ j θ j where θ j and θ j are the predicted and observed mean swc for jth sampling day respectively the mean swc of all sampling points at each sampling time was considered as the observed field mean at that specific day for indirect index mabe spatial average was obtained by dividing observed swc by 1 mrdi differences in sdrd between different layers of the three years were compared using two way analysis of variance anova with year and depth as factors while one way anova was used to compare the difference in sdrd of average swc of 0 60 cm between the three years spearman correlation was conducted for ts indices of mrd sdrd ci and mabe between the different layers of the same year and the same depth of different years spearman correlation was also conducted between ci and mabe with soil properties of clay silt sand content organic matter and ks for the surface layer of the three years statistical analyses were performed using sas 9 1 3 version 9 1 3 sas institute 3 results 3 1 temporal change of spatial soil water content fig 3 shows the evolution of the field mean and standard deviation of swc for each layer of the three years overall field mean of swc of the three layers along with the average of 0 60 cm changed in a similar pattern i e soil water content decreasing continuously until an irrigation or effective precipitation 5 mm bringing it to a larger value then repeating the decrease in 2012 swc of the three layers was similar while swc of deeper soil layers both 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm was obviously larger in comparison to the surface 20 cm soil in 2013 and 2014 especially during the later period of the season the average difference of swc between the surface layer and the two deeper layers was less than 1 in 2012 while larger than 2 5 and 3 5 in 2013 and 2014 respectively standard deviation of swc was fairly stable over the season for each layer of the three years for all three years sd increased with the deeper soil and was about 4 for the surface layer in each year of the three years and 8 for 40 60 cm to detect the mean difference at the prescribed probability level sample size could be obtained following 9 n t α 2 n σ e 2 where n is the sample size t is the value of student distribution at probability of α 2 σ is the sample standard deviation and e is the absolute mean difference number of samples required to obtain the absolute error of 2 of mean swc was obtained with repetitive method sample size change mirrored the change of sd over the period and the deeper soil the greater sd and larger sample size fig 3 for the surface layer of the three years about 20 samples were needed to obtain the prescribed precision while for deeper soil layers much more samples had to be collected for the same level of precision specifically at least 60 samples needed for 40 60 cm of the three years 50 for 20 40 cm of 2013 and 2014 table 2 3 2 temporal stability analysis fig 4 displays the ranked mrd beginning from the smallest for different layers of the three years along with one standard deviation of mrd ci and mabe for all layers mrd ranged between 0 77 and 1 03 both occurring in 40 60 cm of 2012 also notably magnitude of mrd in the top two layers of 2012 was relatively smaller around 30 compared to more than 40 for the three layers in 2013 and 2014 the range of mrd and sdmrd generally increased with soil depth for the three years with mean sdmrd of 0 16 0 22 and 0 32 for soil depths of 0 20 20 40 and 60 80 cm respectively standard deviation of relative difference for each location was often used to evaluate temporal stability level of different fields generally speaking mean sdrd of 2012 was relatively larger than that of 2013 and 2014 there was no significant difference in sdrd between the three depths in 2012 and 2014 while sdrd of 40 60 cm was significantly larger in 2013 than the other two depths of the same year for averaged swc over 0 60 cm anova of sdrd showed no significant difference between the three years on the other hand ci was relatively larger for 40 60 cm in 2012 and 2013 than the other cases while it was similar between the three layers in 2014 similarly mabe fluctuated more drastically for 40 60 cm in 2012 and 2013 while for other depths of the three years variation of mabe was fairly stable significant correlation was found between the same depth of the three years and between the adjacent layers of the same year for all four ts indices p 0 05 table 3 in general the strength of the correlation between the same depth of different years has the order mrd ci mabe sdrd with the mean correlation coefficient of 0 65 0 44 0 33 and 0 20 for mrd ci mabe and sdrd respectively actually the correlation of sdrd was mostly insignificant for subsurface soils between the three years indicating that spread of mrd for each location tended to vary depending on different soil conditions in the three years as a result correlation coefficients of ci and mabe for the same layer of the three years were relatively smaller than those of mrd given that both ci and mabe account for some form of the deviation of mrd on the other hand correlation coefficient of these indices between different soil layers of the same year was generally smaller than those between the same layer of different years and for most cases the correlation was not significant between the surface layer and 40 60 cm 3 3 effect of sampling times on identifying representative locations the five rls identified by the smallest ci and mabe based on different calibration sampling times of each year were compared between different soil depths and different years representative locations were generally different for different layers for the same year and also the same layer for different years this was the case for both indices used figs s1 2 the identification became more stable with larger number of sampling times i e same rls were repetitively identified with the increase of sampling times apparently identification of rls by ci was more consistent than that by mabe as fewer number of locations was ever identified as the five most stable points when sampling times changed from 2 to all 17 2012 and 2013 or 19 2014 times fig 5 3 4 predicting field mean soil water content using the identified representative locations during the calibration period swc at the single representative point could represent well the spatial mean for both indices fig 6 the average rmse of the three layers of the three years was 0 64 and 0 28 while the average mae was 1 0 and 0 48 for ci and mabe respectively during the calibration relative to calibration mean rmse and mae during validation was much larger for both indices with both rmse and mae about three times and six times larger than the calibration for ci and mabe respectively table 4 relative to mabe ci led to smaller rmse and mae for validation largely due to poor performance of mabe for 40 60 cm of the three years table 4 and fig 6 for the top two layers and mean swc of 0 60 cm mabe had similar or smaller rmse than ci for the average swc of 0 60 cm rmse was less than 1 and mae less than 2 for both ci and mabe with an exception of 2012 using ci where rmse and mae were 1 57 and 2 45 respectively as expected using a single rl identified in 2012 led to larger mean rmse and mae when predicting mean soil moisture of 2013 and 2014 than using one rl identified with the same year data of 2013 and 2014 on average ci showed advantages compared to mabe with smaller rmse mean rmse of the individual layers of the two years was 2 76 and 3 61 for ci and mabe respectively compared to 1 65 and 1 93 with the rl identified by the same year data using the point identified by mabe of 2012 tended to perform better than ci in predicting of field mean swc of the top two layers in 2013 in terms of both rmse and mae while worse for the three layers in 2014 it seems that the single point identified by both indices of 2012 had difficulties in correctly predicting mean swc of 40 60 cm of 2013 with rmse greater than 6 and mae greater than 10 for the layer for the average swc of 0 60 cm rmse and mae was much smaller for 2013 than 2014 in 2013 ci and mabe led to similar rmse and mae with rmse of approximate 1 0 and mae of 2 7 while in 2014 rmse was 3 1 and 6 0 and mae was 4 4 and 8 5 for ci and mabe respectively in practice multiple sampling points were often recommended to improve data reliability and reduce sampling error using four points identified by the same year mean rmse of the individual layers was generally reduced by 40 for ci and about 50 for mabe and random method for the average of 0 60 cm the improvement was less pronounced for ci with only about 10 mean rmse reduction table 4 the largest rmse for ci was 3 0 and 1 8 with one and four points respectively both occurring at 20 40 cm of 2012 while the largest rmse for mabe was 3 1 and 1 5 occurring at 40 60 cm of 2012 with four points mabe achieved slightly smaller mean rmse and similar mean mae with ci over different layers for the three years similarly increasing sampling points from one to four reduced rmse greatly for all methods when points identified with 2012 data were used to predict mean swc of 2013 and 2014 with four points mean rmse was 1 7 and 1 4 for ci and mabe respectively with a reduction percentage of 38 and 62 when compared to single point estimation for the average swc of 0 60 cm rmse and mae with four points for ci were larger in both 2013 and 2014 when compared to one point estimation while for mabe using four points reduced both rmse and mae in 2014 greatly as a result mean rmse and mae was lower for mabe than ci when four points were used in prediction with increasing sample numbers mean rmse generally decreased for all methods and the difference in rmse and mae between different methods became smaller fig 7 and fig s3 with number of rl less than 5 ts analysis outperformed random method with smaller mean rmse and mae and the advantage was greater for deeper soil layers for most layers three rls from ts analysis based on the same year measurements could achieve rmse and mae of less than 2 while as many as 35 points still led to mae greater than 2 with the random method when rls identified based on 2012 data were used to estimate swc of 2013 and 2014 change of rmse and mae were found not always consistent with the increase of the number of sampling points especially for mabe and for subsurface layers of 2013 meanwhile prediction for 2014 was found better than 2013 when ts indices based on 2012 data were used in most cases four representative points identified by ts in 2012 were good enough to obtain rmse and mae less than 3 3 5 relationship of tsa indices with ancillary variables the correlations between ts indices in 2012 and soil variables of clay silt sand organic matter and ks are shown in table 5 among the indices mrd had the largest correlation coefficients and was found significantly correlated with soil texture and organic matter for both soil depths both ci and mabe were found significantly correlated with soil sand and silt content for 20 40 cm with negative correlation with sand content and positive with silt content fig 8 shows the descriptive statistics of standardized soil variables for the 20 rls identified by ci and mabe mean soil sand content of the 20 representative points identified by ci was significantly higher while mean silt content significantly lower than average for 40 cm soil layer of all three years which was also the case for 0 20 cm in 2012 soil organic matter content was significantly larger than average at the 20 points identified by ci for 0 20 cm in 2013 on the other hand mean soil variables were not significantly different to the average at rls identified by mabe for all cases except soil silt content and sand content for 20 40 cm in 2012 4 discussion 4 1 temporal stability pattern at different soil depths of different seasons the range and standard deviation of mrd were relatively larger than those reported at a similar spatial scale brocca et al 2010 liu and shao 2014 barker et al 2017 pedrera parrilla et al 2017 for example barker et al 2017 found that mrd of surface soil water content was in the range between 10 and 10 in a 25 ha agricultural field and mrd was found within the range of 0 5 between 0 25 to 0 25 in a 6 7 ha rainfed olive orchard for surface 0 20 cm soil water content pedrera parrilla et al 2017 the observed sdmrd in this study was close to the largest sdmrd for spatial extent of 200 m obtained from analyzing 157 graphs in 37 publications in a review paper vanderlinden et al 2012 the relatively greater mrd range and larger sdmrd in the vineyard and in deeper soils could be partially attributed to wider soil texture range in the studied vineyard area previous studies have shown that field with wider textural range could lead to greater mrd range hu et al 2012 martínez et al 2013 while smaller mrd range was found for relatively homogeneous clay soil martínez et al 2010 soil sand content was within the range of 53 75 and silt content of 8 35 for 0 20 cm while for 20 40 cm texture fluctuated more widely with sand content ranging from 24 to 77 and silt from 4 to 68 soil texture information was not available for 40 60 cm soil and it might have similar or even wider textural range given that sdmrd was larger in the layer than the other two layers for all three years spatial variation in water input furrow irrigation used in the study might also contribute to the overall larger sdmrd observed in the vineyard as ran et al 2017 argued that non uniform water input reduced the temporal stability of soil moisture spatial pattern by increasing random error in estimating spatial mean swc in terms of the change of sdmrd with soil depth previous studies have shown that sdmrd could increase or decrease depending on different environmental settings of the studies vanderlinden et al 2012 agricultural activity could lower sdmrd of surfaces soils in agricultural fields while root water uptake might lead to unstable spatial pattern of swc and larger sdmrd guber et al 2008 for the vineyard root density was the largest in 40 60 cm layer which might contribute to the larger sdmrd of the layer relative to the surface soil the persistence of swc temporal stability pattern in different vegetation periods or different years has been reported although methods used to evaluate the temporal stability might vary among different studies martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 schneider et al 2008 our results were consistent with those previous studies significantly positive correlation of ts indices between the same soil depths of different years indicates that temporal stability pattern was largely maintained and locations consistently had higher lower swc than the field mean spatial pattern change of temporal stability indices with depths could be attributed to that factors e g climate topography controlling the soil water dynamics at different depths especially between 0 20 and 40 60 cm depth were different biswas 2014 suggested that environmental forcing having great impact on swc dynamics on surface soil might not have pronounced effect on subsurface soils in compliance with the relatively weaker correlation of ci and mabe rls identified by both ci and mabe were generally different between different soil depths of the same year and between different years of the same depth which was consistent with previous studies e g martínez fernández and ceballos 2005 pachepsky et al 2005 guber et al 2008 biswas 2014 biswas 2014 found that the rls identified by the smallest mrd and sdrd was different for the surface soil 0 20 cm the root zone soil 0 60 cm and the whole soil profile 0 100 cm therefore different locations are recommended for estimating field mean of swc when the change of soil water storage is used to schedule irrigation events 4 2 predicting field mean using the representative locations identified by temporal stability analysis our results are consistent with previous studies that rls identified by ts analysis outperformed greatly the random method in estimating spatial average of swc good performance of ts indices is generally considered a result from temporally invariant factors associated with soil water dynamics such as soil texture vegetation type and topography ran et al 2017 our study shows that ts could perform reasonably well in an intensively managed agricultural field although it is believed that under such conditions human activities irrigation fertilization etc add large random error in soil water spatio temporal distribution patterns most previous studies reported rmse during the calibration period as the representative error of ts methods which likely underestimated the representative error for the validation ran et al 2017 as rmse provides the mean error of rls in estimating mean swc of multiple sampling times mae provides the maximum error for a given sampling time which is important in determining whether the method achieves a certain level of precision for a given sampling day our results indicate that ts showed greater advantage over random sampling in terms of reducing the maximum absolute error than rmse as mentioned above many studies have proven that swc at different scales generally displayed a certain degree of temporal stability in different years using rls identified in an earlier year did increase representative errors compared with those from rls in the same year which is in agreement with previous studies when rls identified by the data of earlier years were used multiple points are recommended as using one single rl could potentially lead to larger representative errors in some cases such as 40 60 cm of 2013 in our study in such cases there was no advantage of using ts method over the random method however four points identified by 2012 data could represent well the temporal change of the spatial mean in 2013 and 2014 with overall rmse less than 2 and mae less than 3 for the length of calibration period in ts a time span that captures the full range of spatial mean of swc during the whole monitoring period was considered necessary ran et al 2017 suggested that one irrigation cycle i e the period between two consecutive irrigation events was needed to identify rls for a relatively larger scale field while for a smaller scale field with spatially uniform water input half of an irrigation cycle was sufficient in the study five sampling times or half of an irrigation cycle appeared to be sufficient to identify rls therefore the period that can capture the temporal highest and lowest of swc for an agricultural field of arid or semiarid area is recommended to identify rls it is agreed that there was some correlation between ts indices with soil properties e g jacobs et al 2004 cosh et al 2008 however whether the correlation could help identify rls is not clear in the study there was strong correlation between ci and mabe in 2012 with soil silt content for 20 40 cm we used the locations with the lowest silt content to estimate field mean of 0 20 and 20 40 cm during the three years fig s4 and the results showed that both rmse and mae were above 2 with a few exceptions when number of samples was within the range of 2 to 35 the estimation error was actually greater than the mean error of about 6 from 1000 runs of simple random sampling fig 7 therefore the selected soil properties alone seem not enough to identify rls even though they were significantly correlated with ts indices he et al 2019 reported that mrd was significantly positively correlated with ks of 0 20 cm soil depth in a natural forest in northwest china in this study ks was found correlated with sdrd and mabe but not mrd and ci for the surface soils probably due to different landscapes between the two studies many factors including but not limited to soil properties topography and vegetation and their interactions in practice could affect swc temporal stability vegetation and intensive management practices in an agricultural field like irrigation likely add uncertainty and difficulties in pinpointing the link between ts indices and soil properties relative to a natural landscape 5 conclusions applicability of temporal stability analysis method in identifying rls to estimate field mean in an intensively irrigated vineyard was evaluated based on monitoring swc regularly at 135 locations at three different depths in the three years of 2012 2014 there was a strong correlation of mrd between the same depth layer of different years and between different layers of the same year compared to that the correlations of ci and mabe used in identifying rls were relatively much weaker consequently rls identified were generally different between different depths in different years temporal stability analysis is an effective method to identify locations where swc could reflect the change of the field mean when the same year data were used to identify the rl one single rl could achieve rmse less than 2 and mae less than 4 and four rls led to much lower error with both rmse and mae reduced by about 40 on the other hand using the four rls identified by 2012 data could achieve average rmse lower than 2 and mae lower than 3 when used for predicting field mean in 2013 and 2014 in an irrigated field half an irrigation cycle including temporal high and low swc seems good enough to identify rls based on ts analysis the soil properties including soil texture organic matter and saturated hydraulic conductivity were not enough to identify rls that could accurately estimate field mean therefore intensive sampling of multiple times at the field is needed to identify rls credit authorship contribution statement xinmei hao conceptualization methodology investigation funding acquisition yuan qiu data curation software methodology yaqiong fan data

5333,accurately estimating field mean of soil water content swc is important for irrigation management in an agricultural field temporal stability ts analysis has been widely applied to identify representative locations rls for predicting spatial mean of swc in natural landscapes the objectives of the study were to examine ts patterns of swc at various soil depths in different years and to evaluate the performance of ts analysis in predicting field mean in an irrigated vineyard soil water content was measured regularly at 135 locations in the vineyard at soil depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm in 2012 2014 temporal stability indices of mean relative difference mrd standard deviation of relative difference sdrd the comprehensive indicator ci and the mean absolute bias error mabe were obtained for each location at different depths in different seasons the range of mrd and standard deviation of mrd sdmrd increased with soil depth for the three years inter season correlations of the indices at the same depth were stronger than those between different depths of the same year the rls identified by ci and mabe were different between different soil depths and between the three seasons temporal stability analysis outperformed the random sampling method greatly and on average one single rl could achieve rmse about 2 and the maximum absolute error mae less than 4 at a given sampling day during the validation period when the same year data were used to identify the rl estimation error could be reduced by 40 with the number of rls increased from one to four for most cases four rls identified by 2012 data were good enough to obtain rmse and mae less than 3 for the following two years soil texture information was found unable to identify rls that could reliably estimate field mean temporal stability analysis is a valuable tool in identifying rls to estimate field mean in an irrigated agricultural field while intensive swc sampling during half an irrigation cycle is needed to identify the rls keywords field scale comprehensive indicator mabe representative location soil water content irrigation 1 introduction soil moisture is an important state variable affecting many hydrological and ecological processes such as evaporation and plant root uptake and has important implications for decision making on water management practices in an agricultural field for example soil water content swc has often been used as an indicator variable to trigger irrigation when its value is below the prescribed threshold value soil water content is highly variable in both space and time spatial temporal variability of soil water content especially in near surface soils has long been a research topic of many studies the concept of temporal stability ts was first introduced to demonstrate some locations ability in maintaining their soil water content ranking i e consistently having higher average or lower soil water content than other locations through time vachaud et al 1985 the concept has been applied to describe and compare the temporal stability characteristics of different conditions and to identify representative location rl or locations where the change of swc could reflect the change of spatial average e g kachanoski and de jong 1988 martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 2005 brocca et al 2009 penna et al 2013 biswas 2014 chen et al 2016 zhao

locations from 30 published studies was on average 5000 m vanderlinden et al 2012 a few studies have examined ts performance on agricultural lands on the field scale schneider et al 2008 studied the temporal stability of soil moisture in a semi arid steppe field with different grazing intensities of northwestern china they found that temporal stability was consistent during the three year study period but the degree of temporal stability was different between fields with different grazing rates zhao et al 2010 found that spatial patterns of soil moisture were very stable over the 3 year period in the same steppe field guber et al 2008 found that there was considerable ts in swc and ts increased with soil depth in agricultural fields with a total size of 6 ha located at beltsville md previous studies on the field scale reported considerable degree of ts in terms of the persistence of drier or wetter status for a given location however whether ts could be applied in estimating the field mean in different years especially in an irrigated field is uncertain and needs further study application of ts methods in practice has some limitations since identifying rls requires intensive swc sampling campaigns it would be very valuable if the rls could be identified with some invariant soil physical properties efforts have been made to link ts indices with soil properties soil texture in particular jacobs et al 2004 cosh et al 2008 choi and jacobs 2011 previous studies have demonstrated that there was association between ts indices with soil texture temporal stability index of mean relative difference mrd was found significantly different between locations with different texture and locations with the highest sand content tended to have lower ts jacobs et al 2004 choi and jacobs 2011 however whether soil properties could be used to reliably identify rls and accurately predict spatial average of swc remains unclear to identify the most temporally stable points various indices based on ts have been proposed and evaluated in different studies the index is considered a direct one if swc at the rls identified by the index was used directly to estimate the spatial mean for indirect indices the spatial mean is estimated by accounting for the offset between swc at rls and the mean although locations with the smallest mrd have swc closest to the spatial mean on average mrd does not account for the spread of relative difference between swc at those locations with the spatial mean jacobs et al 2004 proposed a direct index combining mean relative difference mrd and standard deviation of relative difference sdrd the index has been referred as root mean square error rmse or comprehensive indicator ci in some other studies hu et al 2012 martínez et al 2014 ran et al 2017 since the term rmse is commonly used as a goodness of fitness index ci was used in this manuscript to represent the ts index as ran et al 2017 did mean absolute bias error mabe was proposed based on the assumption that rls should be the locations with the smallest absolute bias relative to the spatial mean and is an indirect index hu et al 2010 2012 hu et al 2012 found that mabe outperformed ci and among several indirect indices mabe was the best in two different settings of canada prairie landscape and loess plateau of china in a field of desert oasis mabe performed better in estimating area mean relative to sdrd zhang and shao 2017 as mentioned above there have been many studies on ts at a variety of landscapes and scales however most previous studies were conducted in natural landscapes and often at scales larger than a management unit of agricultural land accurate estimation of spatial swc mean from a limited number of monitoring points is especially important for an irrigated field since decision on irrigation is often made based on measured swc at a single point or several points at present results on temporal stability pattern of swc in an intensively irrigated field and whether the estimated spatial mean of swc based on ts would be good enough for irrigation management are lacking therefore the objectives of the study are to investigate ts pattern of swc at different soil depths over the three different years and to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated swc field mean based on the rls identified by ts indices in an irrigated vineyard 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and data collection this experiment was conducted at huangtai vineyard with an area of 7 6 ha at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university 37 52 20 n 102 50 50 e and altitude of 1581 m the climate in the area is typical temperate arid continental with high temperatures in summer cold winters windy and dry weather the mean annual temperature is 8 8 and the frost free period is 150 days the mean annual precipitation is about 164 mm and the mean annual pan evaporation is about 2000 mm pan evaporation is the measurement of water evaporated from open water stored in a pan or tank and is used to estimate potential evaporation or evapotranspiration in a region the average groundwater level can reach over 25 m the grape variety at the site was vitis vinifera l cv merlot noir which was established in 1999 rows in the experimental plots were east west oriented with a spacing of about 270 cm and spacing between vines was about 100 cm the vineyard is furrow irrigated 4 or 6 times during the growth period of each year roughly in early may late may early july and late august and for each irrigation event about 70 mm water is applied before each irrigation event fertilizers including urea zinc compound fertilizer boric acid compound fertilizer and phosphate diamine are applied into holes between grapevines from 2012 to 2014 soil water content was measured at regularly spaced points 25 m apart in both east west and north south directions in a 275 275 m area fig 1 nine points at the edge of the area were omitted from the study due to some unexpected conditions as fig 1 shows there were additional 12 points during 2013 and 2014 which were in closer distance than 25 m with three randomly selected points among those 135 points soil volumetric water content was measured at those sampling locations at three soil depths of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm using a portable device diviner 2000 sennheiser pty ltd australia table 1 shows the frequency of the measurement in the three years measurements were taken approximately every 10 days and additional measurements were taken before and after an irrigation event the measured soil volumetric water content was calibrated using the gravimetric method during the sampling period soil texture clay silt and sand content for 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of 0 20 cm soil were measured by collecting soil samples in may of 2012 soil textural analysis were conducted using a matersizer2000 laser particle size analyzer malvern instruments ltd u k saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using the falling head method klute and dirksen 1986 fig 1 also shows the digital elevation model dem for the sampling area the field was relatively flat with slope less than 2 the accumulated natural precipitation during the study period varied greatly between the three years about 128 72 and 234 mm for 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively fig 2 2 2 data analysis different indicators or criteria based on ts analysis have been used to rank the locations in terms of their time stability i e goodness to represent the area average in this study commonly used indices of mrd sdrd ci and mabe at each location were obtained separately for the three depths of the three years as well as the profile average of the three years data of all sampling days of each year were used to obtain those indices for comparing ts characteristics between different depths and years all the indicators are based on the relative difference rd following the formula proposed by vachaud et al 1985 1 rd i j s i j s j s j where rd i j is the relative difference of the soil water content at the ith sample location of the jth sample day s i j is the measured soil water content at the ith sample location of the jth day of observation s j is the average soil water content of all sample locations on a given jth sample day mean relative difference mrd sdmrd sdrd ci and mabe were calculated by 2 mrd i 1 m j 1 m rd i j 3 sdmrd i 1 n mrd i mrd 2 n 1 4 sdr d i j 1 m r d i j m r d i 2 m 1 5 c i i mr d i 2 s d r d i 2 6 mab e i 1 m j 1 m r d i j m r d i 1 m r d i where m is the number of sampling times used to obtain mrd m r d is the average mrd over all sample locations mean relative difference at each location represents the systematic bias of soil water content at the location regarding to the spatial average and sdrd represents the precision and consistence of the locations in representing the spatial average the evolution of ci and mabe and the five rls identified by them was obtained using sampling times from the minimum of two to the maximum of 17 for 2012 and 2013 and19 for 2014 performance of the two indices in estimating field mean with different number of rls were compared for the comparison the observed swc at each layer in each year was divided into two periods for calibration and validation respectively the calibration period or number of sampling times was determined after evaluating the evolution of the five rls as the five rls identified by both ci and mabe became relatively stable when five sampling times were used to obtain the indices the first five sampling times of each year was set as the calibration period while the remaining period was the validation period locations with the smallest ci and mabe values are considered as the rls to test whether temporal stability properties of the rls could persist over different years the rls identified in 2012 were also used to estimate the field mean of all sampling days in 2013 and 2014 we also included random sampling of 1000 runs into the comparison to evaluate whether the temporal stability analysis would perform better than the simple random sampling method performance of the different estimation methods were evaluated based on root mean square error rmse and the maximum absolute error mae between the predicted and calculated field mean of each sampling day calculated as 7 r m s e 1 m j 1 m θ j θ j 2 8 m a e max j 1 m θ j θ j where θ j and θ j are the predicted and observed mean swc for jth sampling day respectively the mean swc of all sampling points at each sampling time was considered as the observed field mean at that specific day for indirect index mabe spatial average was obtained by dividing observed swc by 1 mrdi differences in sdrd between different layers of the three years were compared using two way analysis of variance anova with year and depth as factors while one way anova was used to compare the difference in sdrd of average swc of 0 60 cm between the three years spearman correlation was conducted for ts indices of mrd sdrd ci and mabe between the different layers of the same year and the same depth of different years spearman correlation was also conducted between ci and mabe with soil properties of clay silt sand content organic matter and ks for the surface layer of the three years statistical analyses were performed using sas 9 1 3 version 9 1 3 sas institute 3 results 3 1 temporal change of spatial soil water content fig 3 shows the evolution of the field mean and standard deviation of swc for each layer of the three years overall field mean of swc of the three layers along with the average of 0 60 cm changed in a similar pattern i e soil water content decreasing continuously until an irrigation or effective precipitation 5 mm bringing it to a larger value then repeating the decrease in 2012 swc of the three layers was similar while swc of deeper soil layers both 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm was obviously larger in comparison to the surface 20 cm soil in 2013 and 2014 especially during the later period of the season the average difference of swc between the surface layer and the two deeper layers was less than 1 in 2012 while larger than 2 5 and 3 5 in 2013 and 2014 respectively standard deviation of swc was fairly stable over the season for each layer of the three years for all three years sd increased with the deeper soil and was about 4 for the surface layer in each year of the three years and 8 for 40 60 cm to detect the mean difference at the prescribed probability level sample size could be obtained following 9 n t α 2 n σ e 2 where n is the sample size t is the value of student distribution at probability of α 2 σ is the sample standard deviation and e is the absolute mean difference number of samples required to obtain the absolute error of 2 of mean swc was obtained with repetitive method sample size change mirrored the change of sd over the period and the deeper soil the greater sd and larger sample size fig 3 for the surface layer of the three years about 20 samples were needed to obtain the prescribed precision while for deeper soil layers much more samples had to be collected for the same level of precision specifically at least 60 samples needed for 40 60 cm of the three years 50 for 20 40 cm of 2013 and 2014 table 2 3 2 temporal stability analysis fig 4 displays the ranked mrd beginning from the smallest for different layers of the three years along with one standard deviation of mrd ci and mabe for all layers mrd ranged between 0 77 and 1 03 both occurring in 40 60 cm of 2012 also notably magnitude of mrd in the top two layers of 2012 was relatively smaller around 30 compared to more than 40 for the three layers in 2013 and 2014 the range of mrd and sdmrd generally increased with soil depth for the three years with mean sdmrd of 0 16 0 22 and 0 32 for soil depths of 0 20 20 40 and 60 80 cm respectively standard deviation of relative difference for each location was often used to evaluate temporal stability level of different fields generally speaking mean sdrd of 2012 was relatively larger than that of 2013 and 2014 there was no significant difference in sdrd between the three depths in 2012 and 2014 while sdrd of 40 60 cm was significantly larger in 2013 than the other two depths of the same year for averaged swc over 0 60 cm anova of sdrd showed no significant difference between the three years on the other hand ci was relatively larger for 40 60 cm in 2012 and 2013 than the other cases while it was similar between the three layers in 2014 similarly mabe fluctuated more drastically for 40 60 cm in 2012 and 2013 while for other depths of the three years variation of mabe was fairly stable significant correlation was found between the same depth of the three years and between the adjacent layers of the same year for all four ts indices p 0 05 table 3 in general the strength of the correlation between the same depth of different years has the order mrd ci mabe sdrd with the mean correlation coefficient of 0 65 0 44 0 33 and 0 20 for mrd ci mabe and sdrd respectively actually the correlation of sdrd was mostly insignificant for subsurface soils between the three years indicating that spread of mrd for each location tended to vary depending on different soil conditions in the three years as a result correlation coefficients of ci and mabe for the same layer of the three years were relatively smaller than those of mrd given that both ci and mabe account for some form of the deviation of mrd on the other hand correlation coefficient of these indices between different soil layers of the same year was generally smaller than those between the same layer of different years and for most cases the correlation was not significant between the surface layer and 40 60 cm 3 3 effect of sampling times on identifying representative locations the five rls identified by the smallest ci and mabe based on different calibration sampling times of each year were compared between different soil depths and different years representative locations were generally different for different layers for the same year and also the same layer for different years this was the case for both indices used figs s1 2 the identification became more stable with larger number of sampling times i e same rls were repetitively identified with the increase of sampling times apparently identification of rls by ci was more consistent than that by mabe as fewer number of locations was ever identified as the five most stable points when sampling times changed from 2 to all 17 2012 and 2013 or 19 2014 times fig 5 3 4 predicting field mean soil water content using the identified representative locations during the calibration period swc at the single representative point could represent well the spatial mean for both indices fig 6 the average rmse of the three layers of the three years was 0 64 and 0 28 while the average mae was 1 0 and 0 48 for ci and mabe respectively during the calibration relative to calibration mean rmse and mae during validation was much larger for both indices with both rmse and mae about three times and six times larger than the calibration for ci and mabe respectively table 4 relative to mabe ci led to smaller rmse and mae for validation largely due to poor performance of mabe for 40 60 cm of the three years table 4 and fig 6 for the top two layers and mean swc of 0 60 cm mabe had similar or smaller rmse than ci for the average swc of 0 60 cm rmse was less than 1 and mae less than 2 for both ci and mabe with an exception of 2012 using ci where rmse and mae were 1 57 and 2 45 respectively as expected using a single rl identified in 2012 led to larger mean rmse and mae when predicting mean soil moisture of 2013 and 2014 than using one rl identified with the same year data of 2013 and 2014 on average ci showed advantages compared to mabe with smaller rmse mean rmse of the individual layers of the two years was 2 76 and 3 61 for ci and mabe respectively compared to 1 65 and 1 93 with the rl identified by the same year data using the point identified by mabe of 2012 tended to perform better than ci in predicting of field mean swc of the top two layers in 2013 in terms of both rmse and mae while worse for the three layers in 2014 it seems that the single point identified by both indices of 2012 had difficulties in correctly predicting mean swc of 40 60 cm of 2013 with rmse greater than 6 and mae greater than 10 for the layer for the average swc of 0 60 cm rmse and mae was much smaller for 2013 than 2014 in 2013 ci and mabe led to similar rmse and mae with rmse of approximate 1 0 and mae of 2 7 while in 2014 rmse was 3 1 and 6 0 and mae was 4 4 and 8 5 for ci and mabe respectively in practice multiple sampling points were often recommended to improve data reliability and reduce sampling error using four points identified by the same year mean rmse of the individual layers was generally reduced by 40 for ci and about 50 for mabe and random method for the average of 0 60 cm the improvement was less pronounced for ci with only about 10 mean rmse reduction table 4 the largest rmse for ci was 3 0 and 1 8 with one and four points respectively both occurring at 20 40 cm of 2012 while the largest rmse for mabe was 3 1 and 1 5 occurring at 40 60 cm of 2012 with four points mabe achieved slightly smaller mean rmse and similar mean mae with ci over different layers for the three years similarly increasing sampling points from one to four reduced rmse greatly for all methods when points identified with 2012 data were used to predict mean swc of 2013 and 2014 with four points mean rmse was 1 7 and 1 4 for ci and mabe respectively with a reduction percentage of 38 and 62 when compared to single point estimation for the average swc of 0 60 cm rmse and mae with four points for ci were larger in both 2013 and 2014 when compared to one point estimation while for mabe using four points reduced both rmse and mae in 2014 greatly as a result mean rmse and mae was lower for mabe than ci when four points were used in prediction with increasing sample numbers mean rmse generally decreased for all methods and the difference in rmse and mae between different methods became smaller fig 7 and fig s3 with number of rl less than 5 ts analysis outperformed random method with smaller mean rmse and mae and the advantage was greater for deeper soil layers for most layers three rls from ts analysis based on the same year measurements could achieve rmse and mae of less than 2 while as many as 35 points still led to mae greater than 2 with the random method when rls identified based on 2012 data were used to estimate swc of 2013 and 2014 change of rmse and mae were found not always consistent with the increase of the number of sampling points especially for mabe and for subsurface layers of 2013 meanwhile prediction for 2014 was found better than 2013 when ts indices based on 2012 data were used in most cases four representative points identified by ts in 2012 were good enough to obtain rmse and mae less than 3 3 5 relationship of tsa indices with ancillary variables the correlations between ts indices in 2012 and soil variables of clay silt sand organic matter and ks are shown in table 5 among the indices mrd had the largest correlation coefficients and was found significantly correlated with soil texture and organic matter for both soil depths both ci and mabe were found significantly correlated with soil sand and silt content for 20 40 cm with negative correlation with sand content and positive with silt content fig 8 shows the descriptive statistics of standardized soil variables for the 20 rls identified by ci and mabe mean soil sand content of the 20 representative points identified by ci was significantly higher while mean silt content significantly lower than average for 40 cm soil layer of all three years which was also the case for 0 20 cm in 2012 soil organic matter content was significantly larger than average at the 20 points identified by ci for 0 20 cm in 2013 on the other hand mean soil variables were not significantly different to the average at rls identified by mabe for all cases except soil silt content and sand content for 20 40 cm in 2012 4 discussion 4 1 temporal stability pattern at different soil depths of different seasons the range and standard deviation of mrd were relatively larger than those reported at a similar spatial scale brocca et al 2010 liu and shao 2014 barker et al 2017 pedrera parrilla et al 2017 for example barker et al 2017 found that mrd of surface soil water content was in the range between 10 and 10 in a 25 ha agricultural field and mrd was found within the range of 0 5 between 0 25 to 0 25 in a 6 7 ha rainfed olive orchard for surface 0 20 cm soil water content pedrera parrilla et al 2017 the observed sdmrd in this study was close to the largest sdmrd for spatial extent of 200 m obtained from analyzing 157 graphs in 37 publications in a review paper vanderlinden et al 2012 the relatively greater mrd range and larger sdmrd in the vineyard and in deeper soils could be partially attributed to wider soil texture range in the studied vineyard area previous studies have shown that field with wider textural range could lead to greater mrd range hu et al 2012 martínez et al 2013 while smaller mrd range was found for relatively homogeneous clay soil martínez et al 2010 soil sand content was within the range of 53 75 and silt content of 8 35 for 0 20 cm while for 20 40 cm texture fluctuated more widely with sand content ranging from 24 to 77 and silt from 4 to 68 soil texture information was not available for 40 60 cm soil and it might have similar or even wider textural range given that sdmrd was larger in the layer than the other two layers for all three years spatial variation in water input furrow irrigation used in the study might also contribute to the overall larger sdmrd observed in the vineyard as ran et al 2017 argued that non uniform water input reduced the temporal stability of soil moisture spatial pattern by increasing random error in estimating spatial mean swc in terms of the change of sdmrd with soil depth previous studies have shown that sdmrd could increase or decrease depending on different environmental settings of the studies vanderlinden et al 2012 agricultural activity could lower sdmrd of surfaces soils in agricultural fields while root water uptake might lead to unstable spatial pattern of swc and larger sdmrd guber et al 2008 for the vineyard root density was the largest in 40 60 cm layer which might contribute to the larger sdmrd of the layer relative to the surface soil the persistence of swc temporal stability pattern in different vegetation periods or different years has been reported although methods used to evaluate the temporal stability might vary among different studies martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 schneider et al 2008 our results were consistent with those previous studies significantly positive correlation of ts indices between the same soil depths of different years indicates that temporal stability pattern was largely maintained and locations consistently had higher lower swc than the field mean spatial pattern change of temporal stability indices with depths could be attributed to that factors e g climate topography controlling the soil water dynamics at different depths especially between 0 20 and 40 60 cm depth were different biswas 2014 suggested that environmental forcing having great impact on swc dynamics on surface soil might not have pronounced effect on subsurface soils in compliance with the relatively weaker correlation of ci and mabe rls identified by both ci and mabe were generally different between different soil depths of the same year and between different years of the same depth which was consistent with previous studies e g martínez fernández and ceballos 2005 pachepsky et al 2005 guber et al 2008 biswas 2014 biswas 2014 found that the rls identified by the smallest mrd and sdrd was different for the surface soil 0 20 cm the root zone soil 0 60 cm and the whole soil profile 0 100 cm therefore different locations are recommended for estimating field mean of swc when the change of soil water storage is used to schedule irrigation events 4 2 predicting field mean using the representative locations identified by temporal stability analysis our results are consistent with previous studies that rls identified by ts analysis outperformed greatly the random method in estimating spatial average of swc good performance of ts indices is generally considered a result from temporally invariant factors associated with soil water dynamics such as soil texture vegetation type and topography ran et al 2017 our study shows that ts could perform reasonably well in an intensively managed agricultural field although it is believed that under such conditions human activities irrigation fertilization etc add large random error in soil water spatio temporal distribution patterns most previous studies reported rmse during the calibration period as the representative error of ts methods which likely underestimated the representative error for the validation ran et al 2017 as rmse provides the mean error of rls in estimating mean swc of multiple sampling times mae provides the maximum error for a given sampling time which is important in determining whether the method achieves a certain level of precision for a given sampling day our results indicate that ts showed greater advantage over random sampling in terms of reducing the maximum absolute error than rmse as mentioned above many studies have proven that swc at different scales generally displayed a certain degree of temporal stability in different years using rls identified in an earlier year did increase representative errors compared with those from rls in the same year which is in agreement with previous studies when rls identified by the data of earlier years were used multiple points are recommended as using one single rl could potentially lead to larger representative errors in some cases such as 40 60 cm of 2013 in our study in such cases there was no advantage of using ts method over the random method however four points identified by 2012 data could represent well the temporal change of the spatial mean in 2013 and 2014 with overall rmse less than 2 and mae less than 3 for the length of calibration period in ts a time span that captures the full range of spatial mean of swc during the whole monitoring period was considered necessary ran et al 2017 suggested that one irrigation cycle i e the period between two consecutive irrigation events was needed to identify rls for a relatively larger scale field while for a smaller scale field with spatially uniform water input half of an irrigation cycle was sufficient in the study five sampling times or half of an irrigation cycle appeared to be sufficient to identify rls therefore the period that can capture the temporal highest and lowest of swc for an agricultural field of arid or semiarid area is recommended to identify rls it is agreed that there was some correlation between ts indices with soil properties e g jacobs et al 2004 cosh et al 2008 however whether the correlation could help identify rls is not clear in the study there was strong correlation between ci and mabe in 2012 with soil silt content for 20 40 cm we used the locations with the lowest silt content to estimate field mean of 0 20 and 20 40 cm during the three years fig s4 and the results showed that both rmse and mae were above 2 with a few exceptions when number of samples was within the range of 2 to 35 the estimation error was actually greater than the mean error of about 6 from 1000 runs of simple random sampling fig 7 therefore the selected soil properties alone seem not enough to identify rls even though they were significantly correlated with ts indices he et al 2019 reported that mrd was significantly positively correlated with ks of 0 20 cm soil depth in a natural forest in northwest china in this study ks was found correlated with sdrd and mabe but not mrd and ci for the surface soils probably due to different landscapes between the two studies many factors including but not limited to soil properties topography and vegetation and their interactions in practice could affect swc temporal stability vegetation and intensive management practices in an agricultural field like irrigation likely add uncertainty and difficulties in pinpointing the link between ts indices and soil properties relative to a natural landscape 5 conclusions applicability of temporal stability analysis method in identifying rls to estimate field mean in an intensively irrigated vineyard was evaluated based on monitoring swc regularly at 135 locations at three different depths in the three years of 2012 2014 there was a strong correlation of mrd between the same depth layer of different years and between different layers of the same year compared to that the correlations of ci and mabe used in identifying rls were relatively much weaker consequently rls identified were generally different between different depths in different years temporal stability analysis is an effective method to identify locations where swc could reflect the change of the field mean when the same year data were used to identify the rl one single rl could achieve rmse less than 2 and mae less than 4 and four rls led to much lower error with both rmse and mae reduced by about 40 on the other hand using the four rls identified by 2012 data could achieve average rmse lower than 2 and mae lower than 3 when used for predicting field mean in 2013 and 2014 in an irrigated field half an irrigation cycle including temporal high and low swc seems good enough to identify rls based on ts analysis the soil properties including soil texture organic matter and saturated hydraulic conductivity were not enough to identify rls that could accurately estimate field mean therefore intensive sampling of multiple times at the field is needed to identify rls credit authorship contribution statement xinmei hao conceptualization methodology investigation funding acquisition yuan qiu data curation software methodology yaqiong fan data

5334,the point predictions of stochastic processes such as evaporation by data driven methods such as artificial neural network ann are associated with uncertainties furthermore the performance of data driven models as well as their uncertainty are dependent on the quality and quantity of the used data the main aim of this research was the uncertainty quantifying uq of the ann based evaporation predictions by prediction intervals pis analysis using the data from three stations in iran i e tabriz urmia and ardabil in this way data pre processing methods i e wavelet based de noising wd training with jitted data jd and also their combination i e hybrid wavelet de noising and jitted data hwdjd were applied to examine their effects on the estimated values of pis the lower upper bound estimation lube method as the direct nn based pi construction was utilized for estimating the pi values since the efficiency of any ann model and consequently the robustness of the uncertainty analysis is sensitive to the correct selection of input variables the first order partial derivation pad sensitivity analysis method was also used to select dominant inputs among all potential input variables the results indicated that the lube technique could provide acceptable results in estimating the uncertainty bounds whereas the uncertainty quantity would be affected by the used data pre processing methods the reduction of uncertainty effect via data pre processing methods was significant in modeling urmia and ardabil stations results showed that the reduction of pi bandwidths via hwdjd wd and jd methods were up to 30 21 and 9 respectively it means that to reduce the ann based modeling uncertainty due to the uncertainty involved in the input data set at first the contaminant noise of the available data should be eliminated from the time series then artificially generated time series jd that mimic the smoothed time series pattern can be generated and used in the training

evaporation plays a key role in climate change and water resources studies evaporation estimations in hydrological practice can be achieved by direct or indirect methods indirect methods are developed based on meteorological data through empirical methodologies or statistical and stochastic approaches such as the water budget energy budget and aerodynamic approaches whereas direct methods are based on the field observations on a water body such as evaporation pan class a pan us weather bureau that are used extensively throughout the world as an index of evapotranspiration and for estimating lake and reservoir evaporation due to the non linearity complex and unsteady inherent of this process it is difficult to define an accurate physical based formula that covers all involved physical parameters and in this case data driven black box models may be a reliable alternative for the modeling artificial neural networks anns as such data driven models have been gained significant attention of hydro climatologists because of their simplicity in the model implementation and acceptable level of accuracy in their point predictions these statistical models can be addressing the inherent non linearities in the pan evaporation process and provide better performance with regard to the classical available approaches numerous conducted researches already approved the merit of ann models for point predictions of the evaporation process e g see chang et al 2010 nourani and sayyah fard 2012 tezel and buyukyildiz 2016 adamala et al 2018 nourani et al 2019a ferreira et al 2019 wang et al 2020 although anns are powerful tools for recognizing the complex relationship among inputs and outputs similar to other models their point predictions are associated with the uncertainty caused by various error sources the majority of the papers have investigated the generalization ability of anns i e accurate point predictions and only little researches have been quantified the amount of associated uncertainty with the output of such models determining the uncertainty values is necessary to trust the reliability of these models in practical applications most of the methods for expressing uncertainty in ann models are usually based on the concepts of inferential statistics two frequently used intervals as uncertainty analysis criteria are confidence and prediction intervals ci and pi respectively a pi describes the uncertainty bound on a single observation instead a ci is bound on the population parameter such as a mean or standard deviation in the hydro climatological studies mostly the concept of ci has been used for uncertainty measuring rather the pi concept e g see chen et al 2013 sugimoto et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 nn based pi construction methods are usually classified into two categories kabir et al 2018 the first category is the multi step methods or classical methods such as delta bayesian bootstrap mean variance estimation methods mvem and modifications of these methods in addition to difficult implementation applications of these methods involve some limitations such as assumption of homogeneous and normally distributed noise in the delta method massive computational burden and necessity of hessian matrix calculation of the cost function in bayesian and delta method computational cost for large data sets in bootstrap method and underestimating the variance of data in the mvem method that can lead to low empirical coverage probability khosravi et al 2011 the second category includes recently developed nn based direct pi construction methods the base technique in this category is lower upper bound estimation lube method khosravi et al 2011 that most of the others in this category are various versions of this method obtained by the modification of the cost function or and its optimization algorithm quan et al 2014 marin et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 some advantages of lube methods over classical methods are optimal pis are generated via an optimization problem similar to the procedure for the point predictions in a very convenient manner with regard to the classical methods these methods are distribution free and the computational burden is virtually ignorable compared to the classical methods kabir et al 2018 in spite of the importance of pi concept in hydro climatological studies focused by several researchers e g srivastav et al 2007 kasiviswanathan et al 2013 kumar et al 2015 kasiviswanathan and sudheer 2016 nourani et al 2019b and successful applications of lube method at different engineering fields e g taormina and chau 2015 lian et al 2016 wang et al 2018 the lube has not been served for pis of evaporation time series furthermore since the efficiency of anns as data driven models are highly dependent on the quality of data the improvement of the model performance as well as reduction of uncertainty effect of data using appropriate data pre possessing methods are important issues there are considerable research papers about qualifying data uncertainty for hydrologic processes as a novelty this paper was devoted for adopting reasonable pre processing approaches to reduce the uncertainty effect of data for modeling of the evaporation process natural observed time series are usually contaminated with unwanted noise that can lead to the bias in the learning process of the ann models so one of the pre processing methods in ann modeling can be related to the noise elimination from the input data sets there are several methods for noise elimination but due to the multi resolution multi scale nature of hydro climatic processes such as evaporation the application of wavelet based de noising wd could lead to successful simulations e g see campisi pinto et al 2012 nourani et al 2017 on the other hand in the training step of ann models each time dependent process has temporal variations within the sampling time interval particularly in longer time interval such as daily weekly etc where because of the difficulty or impossibility of recording a large amounts of data only a constant value is assigned as a representative of all possible values for the given time interval which this in turn can be associated with the uncertainty training with jittered data jd as a data pre processing method aims to increase generalization of the network matsuoka 1992 singh 1999 brown et al 2003 seghouane et al 2004 zur et al 2009 nourani and partoviyan 2018 as well as to reduce the uncertainty effect of data in this paper the effect of wd jd and also hybrid form of wavelet de noising and jitter data hwdjd as data pre processing methods was investigated on the quality of the data uncertainty in this way since the accuracy of the ann models as well as their associated uncertainty are sensitive to the correct choice of input variables the convenient partial derivatives pad sensitivity analysis method gevrey et al 2003 nourani and sayyah fard 2012 was also used to determine the most dominant inputs of the models data from three stations with almost different climatic conditions in the northwest of iran namely tabriz urmia and ardabil were used to investigate the uncertainty caused by data effects on the evaporation predictions in different climates through wd jd and hwdjd 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data in this study the daily pan evaporation was estimated for three stations located in the northwest of iran namely tabriz urmia and ardabil locations of these cities and their koppen climate classifications have been shown in fig 1 ardabil is about 70 km from the caspian sea and 210 km from the city of tabriz it has an average altitude of 1263 m and a total area of 18 011 km2 it is located on an open plain just east of mount sabalan 4811 m the average annual rainfall in ardabil is 325 mm tabriz is the most populated city in the northwest of iran located in the quru river valley between long ridges of volcanic cones in the sahand and eynali mountains tabriz elevation ranges between 1350 m and 1600 m above sea level the valley opens up into a plain that gently slopes down to the eastern shores of urmia lake 60 km to the west the average annual rainfall is 318 mm finally urmia situated at an altitude of 1330 m above sea level and is located along the shahar chay river city river on the urmia plain it is the 10th most populated city in iran urmia lake one of the world s largest salt lakes lies to the east of the city about 390 mm of precipitation falls there annually the meteorological data set used in this study has been collected from synoptic stations of tabriz urmia and ardabil and is included daily observations of air temperature t c pan evaporation et mm day 1 solar radiation rs j cm 2 day 1 air pressure p hpa relative humidity rh and wind speed u m s 1 that were used for estimating evaporation through ann models and construct nn based pis some statistical characteristics of the used data in terms of mean maximum minimum and standard deviation for each of three stations are tabulated in table 1 the daily data are from 1992 to 2018 and from 2006 to 2018 for tabriz and ardabil stations respectively for urmia station also daily data have been recorded from 1992 to 2003 and from 2007 to 2018 in all steps and for all stations the whole data set was allocated to 70 and 30 ratios for training and testing subsets respectively according to table 1 it can be seen that ardabil city with a mean of rh equal to 73 is wetter than other cities the average values of et t and rs are almost 4 mm day 1 10 c and 1661 j cm 2 day 1 respectively for ardabil station that are lower than other stations the averages of et and t in tabriz station are almost equal to 6 mm day 1 and 13 c respectively which are more than other stations the average value of rh is almost equal to 51 in this station that has the lowest value in comparison to the other stations see table 1 the average of rs and u in the urmia station are almost equal to 1779 j cm 2 day 1 and 2 m s 1 respectively as the highest and lowest values compared to the others according to fig 1 the climate of tabriz urmia and ardabil cities are cold and continental and or the mediterranean although both urmia and tabriz cities have an almost similar climate according to the koppen classifications field surveys and meteorological parameters measured in both stations shown in table 1 are slightly different while tabriz city has ordinary seasons cold winters and hot dry summers can usually be felt in urmia the geographical feature of the cities is effective in making minor differences of weather in these two cities such as high altitude differences in tabriz city which exacerbates the wind factor or the urmia location that is in the plain which is a factor to attract more solar radiation on the other hand koppen climate classification as the most widely used classification is based on the annual and monthly averages of temperature and precipitation none of the climate classification methods considers the simultaneous effect of all climate variables on the classification therefore the similarity of the climatic zones in this study does not mean that all effective variables on the evaporation process are the same in the selected study areas it means that the effect of climate variables on the evaporation condition in similar climatic zones may not be the same 2 2 proposed methodology the schematic of the proposed methodology followed in this study is seen in fig 2 a as it can be seen in this figure the study was conducted in five steps in the first step the sensitivity analysis for ann models was utilized to select the most effective inputs via the pad method for the evaporation modeling of all three stations in the second step in order to construct pis for raw original data the lube method was applied to the original data without any data pre processing application in this way the nn based pi cost function was minimized via a heuristic optimization algorithm of simulated annealing sa the third and fourth steps involved constructing pis by feeding input data under pre processing methods of jd and wd respectively in the fifth step the simultaneous effect of application of both wd and jd data pre processing methods as a hybrid form was investigated for pis estimation and finally overall obtained results of all steps were compared together components of the applied methodology are briefly described as follows 2 2 1 point predictions by anns an ann is a computational model that mimics the structure and functions of biological nns in receiving processing and transmitting information the principle of learning in anns is on the repetition several times that the data set is injected into the learning algorithm differences in learning data can detect by changing and improving the weight and bias vectors one of the most widely used methods for repeating and training in anns is the back propagation of error named back propagation bp algorithm in this algorithm and in each iteration there are two moves the first motion will be feed forward in which input and weight vectors are multiplied and sum with bias vector in feed forward motion the values of the nn output are obtained and compared with the actual values i e targets then the error values are measured in this way the algorithm finds out about error values concerning weights and bias and goes to the second stage namely back propagation on the same iteration i e go back and modify the weights and bias these iterations feed forward and back propagation are done as far as the predicted output be very close to the desired output target it is better to scale the data into the given interval before training an ann model because the cost function topology that is determined by the parameter values in the network improves by putting all of the data upon the same scale without scaling data into the given scale the optimization algorithm may fail to find the optimal value and stuck at the saddle points by scaling data in the given interval the network is allowed to more quickly learn the optimal parameters nourani 2017 in this paper the simplest and most commonly transformation rule i e min max was used to map the original values into the new interval between 0 1 and 0 9 in a linear form 2 2 1 1 performance criteria for point prediction classical anns are used for point prediction of time series and both statistical indexes i e root mean squared error rmse as eq 1 and determination coefficient dc or nash sutcliffe efficiency as eq 2 are usually sufficient for evaluating model s performance nourani 2017 also used in the current paper 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i 2 2 dc 1 i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where xi is the observed value x i is the computed value by model and x is the average of observed data with n observations the variation ranges of these indicators are as r m s e 0 and d c 1 index values near to 1 and 0 for dc and rmse respectively are desired in the modeling 2 2 1 2 ann dominant inputs selection choosing a set of the most effective input variables is an important issue in the ann modeling the existence of the redundant or weakly informative variables not only does not help in modeling but also causes some problems for the network training taking into account the tangent hyperbolic as the transfer function of hidden layer and the linear transfer function in the output layer for a three layer perceptron the final equation of the output sensitivity regarding the input p in the pad method is obtained by gevrey et al 2003 nourani and sayyah fard 2012 3 n o x p h 1 nh w oh 1 n h 2 w hp where n is the output signal from the neuron o and h refer to the output and hidden neurons respectively x p is the pth input to the network w refers to connection weight between subtitle neurons by summing the squares of obtained partial derivatives per input variable the relative contribution of the ann output with respect to any input can be calculated as 4 ss d p d 1 n n o x p d 2 i 1 ni s s d i 100 where ni is the total number of inputs ann dominant input variables can be chosen according to ssd values the large value of this index indicates the more effectiveness of the corresponding input on the output 2 2 2 estimation of prediction intervals by lube technique uncertainty quantifying uq has a key role in the process of decision making and optimization in many fields of science and engineering this concept tries to determine how likely the model output of a not exactly known system can be true and reliable there are multi sources of uncertainty that affect on the point predictions of any real system modeling ai based models are also affected by several sources of uncertainty namely uncertainty of model and training data lube method is a direct nn based technique for uq through the pi concept there are following differences between the conventional use of the anns i e point predications with what lube methods are used firstly in lube method the structure of ann has 2 outputs unlike traditional ones that usually have only one output secondary the cost function is unlike the traditional ones which is based on error reduction between the network output and the target here it is based on the combination of pi index on the real value of the ann point predictions it was stated that network optimization in lube method is incompatible via gradient descent as a classical local optimization algorithm because its cost function is highly nonlinear complex and discontinuous that caused by combining two conflicting objectives i e both high coverage and small width higher coverage probabilities typically result in wider pis khosravi et al 2011 therefore non gradient based methods namely meta heuristic optimization algorithms that do not require derivatives of the cost function are useful to establish trade off between coverage and bandwidth of pis via the cost function such as sa in contrast to the traditional ones which can use both non gradient and gradient descent optimization algorithms sa is developed on the basis of the annealing process in metallurgy and used in the current study annealing simulation can model the physical process of heating a material and then slowly lowering the temperature to decrease defects thus minimizing the system energy and reaching the thermodynamic equilibrium it is not derivative based and it can seek and explore the parameter space without being trapped in local optima kirkpatrick et al 1983 aarts and korst 1990 the last and third difference of this kind of ann with the traditional one is that its output is pi bound unlike former that it is point prediction fig 2b shows a typical nn structure that is used for lube technique as already mentioned the lube technique has two outputs as upper and lower pi bounds the maximum of the outputs is the upper and the minimum is the lower bound the cost function in this technique is termed as coverage width criterion cwc which is based on the quality of pis via the combination of two key characteristics of pis namely pi coverage probability picp and pi average width piaw picp is the probability that the corresponding targets with the input pattern lie within the pi this probability has a nominal value of 1 α the difference between the estimated upper and lower bounds is measured as the bandwidth by piaw the math formula of picp is as khosravi et al 2011 5 picp 1 n i 1 n c i provided that 6 c i 1 y i y l i y u i 0 else where n is the number of samples y l i and y u i are predicted lower and upper bounds respectively and y i is the target for ith sample the normalized pi average width pinaw is defined as 7 pinaw 1 nr i 1 n y u i y l i where r is the range of the underlying target i e y max y min cwc is a nonlinear combination of eqs 5 and 7 and is defined by khosravi et al 2011 8 cwc p i n a w γ picp e η μ picp provided that 9 γ p i c p 1 picp μ 0 picp μ where η and μ are two hyper parameters and are set to 80 through trial and error and 1 α as nominal confidence level respectively the role of η is to magnify any small difference between 1 α and picp these two hyper parameters set penalties on pis for the low picp as picp μ means that picp is satisfied with a nominal confidence level so the exponential term effect removed and then pinaw becomes dominant in this case the optimization algorithm here sa deals with only pinaw and tries to reduce the width of pis if picp μ it means that picp is not desired then the cwc value exponentially increases 2 2 3 wavelet based de noising method almost all types of hydrological data are infected by some noises that may arise from various sources such as measurement error human error conversion or transmission error there are some approaches for noise reduction such as wavelet based technique wavelet transform was presented in the 1980s morlet et al 1982a b grossman and morlet 1984 initially as a mathematical approach to spectral analysis wavelet threshold de noising wtd method that is commonly performed through discrete wavelet transform dwt has been introduced by donoho et al 1995 in the idea of thresholding all of the wavelet coefficients below a given threshold value are eliminated in summary the noise removal by the wavelet can be summarized in the three steps at first the wavelet transform of the noisy signal is calculated i e the original data are decomposed into the various sub signals an approximation and some detailed signals in the second step the noisy wavelet coefficients are modified through thresholding modified wavelet coefficients w j k can be estimated mathematically via two well known thresholding rules introduced by donoho and johnstone 1995 and donoho 1995 i e hard and soft threshold rules the hard thresholding can be unstable and sensitive to small perturbations in the data antoniadis 2007 but less information is lost through soft thresholding rule as wang et al 2014 10 w j k sgn w j k w j k t j w j k t j 0 w j k t j where t j and w j k are threshold value and the detailed coefficient respectively the last step is to compute inverse wavelet transform to reconstruct the denoised signal by utilizing modified coefficients the reasonable value of threshold in wd plays a key role in the noise elimination from the signal if a small threshold value is selected the recovered signal still has a percentage of noise on the other hand if a large threshold value is selected some components of the signal are also deleted so the recovered signal will be destroyed in compared to the original signal there are several methods for applying thresholds for example universal thresholding ut is a type of global thresholding methods presented by donoho and johnstone 1994 for the white gaussian noise as 11 t j σ 2 ln n where n is the number of samples in the noisy signal and σ is the standard deviation of noise as 12 σ median w j k t 0 6745 where w j k t is the first level of detail coefficients for the sub signal in the current paper the soft thresholding rule using same threshold values for all detailed signals was utilized for wd 2 2 4 data pattern generation jitterd data the training data set is only one random sample from the associated infinite population and therefore it may feed random pattern to the model which can be associated with uncertainty it means that if the available data set is not a good representative for all of the population the modeling can get some biases relative to what actually existed jittering by injecting random numbers into the original data set is based on an idea to create the artificial time series by mimicking the original time series pattern and aiming to increase the input patterns into the model different researches argue the following reasons for increasing network performance so its generalizability when using jd because the network tries to fit point to point and ultimately to reduce the error feeding single data pattern for each input during the training process causes the network function to be disturbed and rugged and to be sensitive to the smallest changes in the input space following with sharp responses for not experienced new data set test data by feeding different patterns jd to the network during the training step it is difficult for the network to fit on the individual data points exactly therefore the network function can be expected to be continuous smoother and less sensitive to the small changes in the input space the network generally works poorly due to inadequate constraints in its cost function jd indirectly leads to altering and improving the training cost function by adding a penalty term this extra term acts as a regulator term and is a function of the variance of added random data in which it controls the smoothness degree of the cost function holmstrom and koistinen 1992 guozhong 1996 bishop 2005 zhang 2007 nourani and partoviyan 2018 in this method random data are generated with an average of zero and a small standard deviation there is no particular method provided for selecting the amount of standard deviation of the random data very low standard deviation may have no effect on the smoothing of the cost function and vice versa high standard deviation may lead to the destruction of the main pattern of the data set to generate random numbers such as for jittering in the current paper with any statistical distribution first random numbers are generated with uniform distribution and then they are used to generate random numbers with any statistical distribution there are some techniques to generate random numbers with arbitrary distribution by utilizing numbers obtained by the uniform distribution among all methods the reverse transform technique is more common in this field according to this technique if random variable x has a cumulative distribution function cdf of f x so u f x will have uniform pdf of u 0 1 conversely for u u 0 1 x f 1 u will have cdf of f thus to generate random variable y with arbitrary cdf of g eq 13 can be used bowker and lieberman 1972 13 y g 1 f x almost all papers in this field focus on the effects of jd on the generalizability of anns in this study a different glance was taken to this issue to investigate the effects of training with jd on the pis in estimating the daily pan evaporation via ann models it can be said that this approach uses somewhat the bootstrap method based on the repetition perspective for investigating uncertainty quality but it seems that jd be better than the bootstrap method bootstrap is based on random sampling from the recorded range of variables constant recorded pattern but jd allows the network to experience new patterns of any variables and also unlike bootstrap its computational cost encountering large data sets is not high 3 results and discussion the obtained results via the proposed methodology are presented in 5 subsections in the first part the results of the dominant input selection for anns are presented the second part presents the results of the pis not using any data pre processing method and just by applying original raw data in the next two subsections the pi estimation results are presented after applying jd and wd data pre processing methods respectively finally the results of the effect of both data pre processing methods on pis are presented and all results are compared with together 3 1 results of sensitivity analysis input selection after linearly scaling the original data sets to the interval between 0 1 and 0 9 in this step before modeling the evaporation and constructing pis the sensitivity analysis was performed on the ann models at each of the next steps the results of sensitivity analysis were utilized to arrange inputs for anns it has been mathematically proven that a bpnn with only three layers one hidden layer is sufficient for the simulation of any process hornik et al 1989 so three layer bpnns were utilized with tangent hyperbolic as hidden layer transfer function and a linear transfer function in the output layer the levenberg marquardt algorithm for training the networks as an approximation of newton s method that has been shown to be one of the fastest algorithms for training mlps hagan and menhaj 1994 was also used to train the ann models due to the instability of relative sensitivity values and so to get better performance in the input selection procedure different networks were generated and finally the best responses in each of the three stations modeling were selected among the most frequented results with regard to efficiency criteria i e dc and rmse which are used for evaluating the point predictions by anns due to markovian autoregressive property of the daily evaporation it is expected that the evaporation value of each time step is highly related to its value at previous time steps up to the memory lag of l for the accurate selection of the most effective evaporation lags along with other inputs in modeling the evaporation process the pad sensitivity analysis method was used therefore in the step of dominant inputs selection the et i where i 1 2 l according to partial autocorrelation function pacf plot not presented in the paper l can be considered as 4 for all models of stations t rh rs p and u were considered as the potential inputs of the ann models to predict et as output the final results of the relative importance for the input variables for each of the three stations modelings were tabulated in table 2 in all cases the most important inputs with regard to their ssd see eq 4 were selected as the ann input variables the large values of this index indicate the more effectiveness of the corresponding inputs on the output regarding ssd values two t and et 1 four t et 1 rs and et 2 and three t et 1 and rh variables were selected as more effective inputs in modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively other variables had low values of ssd accordingly t and et 1 in all cases were identified as the first or second most dominant components on the daily evaporation process as can be seen from table 2 the third most dominant variables were u rs and rh in the tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively perhaps the difference in the third governing variable as a result of sensitivity analysis in addition to the climatic properties can be found in the geographical feature of each city from this perspective the topography of tabriz consists of two mountainous and plain areas the altitude difference in an area results in non uniform warming of the earth by solar radiation and so resulting in the formation of areas with high and low pressures and eventually the formation of wind tong 2010 so it can be a reason for the windward condition in this city urmia city on the other hand is located in the foothill and plain areas these topography areas receive more solar radiation because mountainous areas oceans and large lakes participate more than the plains in the formation of clouds as the predominant atmospheric condition in the amount of reached solar radiation to the earth calabrò and magazù 2016 so according to the results of the sensitivity analysis the selection of solar radiation as the third most effective climate factor in this city could be justified also regarding to table 1 and the low standard deviation dev of et at the urmia station it can be inferred that et has almost stable condition highly dependent on the previous time steps and as so high ssd values of et up to the memory lag of 2 days can be justified from this point of view finally ardebil is affected by the marine areas due to its proximity to the astara port which may be a reason for the predomination of humidity rh in this city 3 2 results of pis estimation for each of the four steps pis were constructed by the lube method for two levels of nominal confidence of 95 and 90 corresponding to α 0 05 and 0 1 respectively fig 3 only for tabriz station modeling as the instance shows sa evolutionary during the training step the convergence rate of temperature as a controller sa parameter and cwc like the internal energy of molten solid in the annealing process are shown in fig 3a b in which for better graphical visualization of the optimization algorithm effort extreme values of cwc have not been displayed in fig 3a on the other hand the overall behavior of cwc in the logarithmic scale simultaneously with temperature is seen in fig 3b at the beginning of the optimization process picp was less than its nominal value picp 1 α so cwc got very large amounts because the picp term dominated and led to cwc was punished exponentially with the parameter η and therefore the picp was rapidly increased it means that at the beginning of the optimization process more attention in cwc was paid for the increase of picp so the pinaw increased without any limitation once picp was reached to its nominal value then cwc started to reduce pinaw and the penalty due to unsatisfying picp exponentially decreased and then the pinaw term reached to the dominant value see fig 3d finally a trade off between the picp and pinaw through the optimization process was established the parameter of η 80 for controlling the cwc values was obtained through trial and error so that for the lower η the value of the cwc function is more likely to fail i e pinaw and picp values approach zero due to cwc definition in the training step the primary population set ann s parameters was generated by the traditional ann i e network trained with a classical optimization algorithm considering rmse and dc as performance functions having two outputs corresponding to the target values these two outputs only made the initial guess of pis for the optimization algorithm then these initial weights were used to handle the sa algorithm table 3 shows some controller parameters of sa used in this paper according to the technical literature e g khosravi et al 2011 one of the controller parameters of this algorithm is temperature ann s parameters were allowed to modify 30 times at each constant temperature until these parameters reached the stability i e there was no significant change in the value of cwc then the temperature was decreased with the determined step by geometric cooling schedule tk l which sets the decrease of the temperature at each search iteration the new population set ann parameters was generated at any iteration of the optimization process these new parameters then set the mentioned traditional ann with two outputs to achieve upper and lower bounds fig 3c shows the evolutionary variations of some ann s weights during the training step via sa in the next step by utilizing the obtained pi uncertainty indexes pinaw and picp and subsequently cwc were calculated this process was continued to reach the lowest defined temperature for the algorithm this is the point where the optimal population the network parameters is obtained which is equivalent to the lowest internal energy in the annealing algorithm as the lowest cost function finally pis were generated with a certain confidence level 1 α to cover the targets a lower cwc indicates a better pi this quantity will be high for invalid pis after completing the training process the performance of the trained network was examined by the test set through feeding these optimal parameters into the ann and simulating for the test data set once the pi was achieved for the test data its related index could be evaluated in all the following subsections the results are presented only for the test step for the training step only the results of the evolutionary process of sa are presented in general after picp is met its nominal value the best models can be determined only based on pinaw values presented in table 5 and figs 4 7 3 2 1 results of pis estimation appling raw data od the results of this section were used as the benchmark to compare with the results obtained after applying data pre processing methods in this step using the normalized data and not applying any other data pre processing method the pis of the daily evaporation process were estimated to avoid the high computational burden and constructing benchmark pis the optimal hidden layer structure in the terms of the number of neurons was selected through trial and error examining 3 12 hidden neurons the best selective structure was fixed for each station modeling in this step then utilized for any other steps and the best pis were reported in this way the number of neurons of 8 9 and 7 in the hidden layer resulted in the best pis evaluated by the cwc for three stations of tabriz urmia and ardabil respectively in all cases due to the low picp and high pinaw the high values of cwc were changed approximately between 100 and 5000 but it was clear that the picp even as much as 1 or 2 below its given nominal value led to the sharp and exponential increase in the cwc values fig 4 shows the best results obtained in this step i e od along with the obtained results in other steps i e jd wd and hwdjd it can be seen from fig 4 that for α 0 05 and picp values up to 97 98 and 99 the pinaws were obtained approximately as 31 40 and 60 for modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively also for α 0 1 with picp values up to 93 92 and 95 the pinaws were obtained approximately as 24 31 and 48 for modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively pinaw values got wider range respectively for tabriz urmia and then ardabil stations for both α 0 05 and 0 1 whereas picps in all cases were met their nominal values i e 95 or 90 one reason for this behavior can be justified due to the number of inputs of ann models for each station and so propagating the noise included in the inputs through the model the model for tabriz station had the lowest number of inputs among three stations these two input variables contribute to the modeling with a total sensitivity of 82 31 this figure is equal to 90 49 for urmia with four input variables and is equal to 92 2 for ardabil station with three input variables the purpose of sensitivity analysis is to obtain variables that generate large contributions and sensitivities at the output so that it is expected that the greater the total sensitivity of the input variables the more accurate the modeling of the process this issue can be true when the input variables which lead to the high sensitivity values in the modeling are at the low level of noise pollution or error otherwise they may cause propagating of random error and noise with high sensitivity in the modeling as can be seen from the results for modeling urmia and more especially for ardabil stations and so leading to some bias and increasing the model output uncertainty the high uncertainty of two other stations could also be justified from this point of view meaning that the probability of noise contamination in the time series of et in its previous time steps i e et 1 and et 2 rh and rs is expected to be significant 3 2 2 results of pis estimation appling jd the third step was related to estimate pis after applying jd as a data pre processing method firstly random numbers with a normal distribution i e mean of zero and small standard deviations were generated by the randn function of matlab to inject into the original time series there is no specific criterion to determine standard deviation content and usually values in the range of 0 to 1 are tested in trial and error way to find the most suitable jd zhang 2007 nourani and partoviyan 2018 in this study the values of 0 0005 0 001 0 003 0 005 0 01 0 05 and 0 075 were examined as standard deviation values of the generated random data in accordance with the sensitivity analysis results two t and et 1 four t et 1 rs and et 2 and three t et 1 and rh main time series for modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations were selected as inputs respectively to avoid the high number of inputs to the models only two artificial time series were generated by adding jittered normal random data on the original time series these two artificial series had zero means and similar fixed standard deviations but different randomly generated values thus the number of input variables in this step includes original and generated artificial time series increased to 6 12 and 9 for modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively for each content of the standard deviation the training process was repeated finally the best results were chosen concerning the cwc values in the lube method the best ones for both α 0 05 and α 0 1 were obtained with the standard deviations of 0 001 0 005 and 0 05 for modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively therefore the standard deviation values of random data in the construction of the artificial patterns show increasing order from tabriz to urmia and then ardabil stations which may denote to an increase of sampling error of the input data for these stations in the same direction for α 0 05 with picps up to 96 97 and 97 the pinaw values were obtained approximately as 29 36 and 54 for modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively also for α 0 1 with picp values up to 92 92 and 95 the pinaw values were obtained approximately as 22 28 and 47 for the three stations in the same direction see fig 4 the maximum reduction of pinaws via jd was up to 9 related to the urmia station model due to the higher number of input variables of model for this station the probability of imposing the sampling noise to et modeling increases using jd the input patterns at this station increased to 12 both original and artificial time series i e the deviations of sampling error at this station somewhat could be reformed through applying the standard deviation of 0 005 into the original time series which led to reduction of the pinaws in this station this issue may be more highlighted for rs as an input variable in urmia station with a higher standard deviation see table 1 3 2 3 results of pis estimation appling wd the fourth step of modeling was about removing the contaminant and natural noise from the input time series using the dwt to obtain the best smoothed signals the soft thresholding rule was applied along with universal thresholding on the input signals different kinds of symlet family wavelets symn i e sym5 sym6 sym7 sym8 and daubechies family wavelets dbn i e db3 db4 db5 were examined along with different decomposition levels from 2 to 7 obtained by wmaxlev function of matlab software that returns the maximum decomposition level of a signal or image based on the wavelet type and the size of the signal to determine the threshold value eq 11 was utilized table 4 shows ann performance for the point prediction of et via feeding smoothed time series obtained via wd technique the selected through sensitivity analysis and smoothed time series through wd used as inputs to the ann models to construct pis the best results for α 0 05 were obtained with picps up to 96 96 and 97 and the pinaw values approximately as 28 33 and 50 for modeling the stations of tabriz urmia and ardabil respectively also for α 0 1 with picp values up to 92 91 and 94 the pinaw values were obtained approximately as 22 24 and 40 for the three stations in the same direction see fig 4 the maximum and minimum reductions of pinaws via wd were up to 21 and 10 and are related to the urmia and tabriz stations respectively models for tabriz station with two input variables and total sensitivity of 82 31 and urmia with four input variables and total sensitivity of 90 49 have been participated in the modeling therefore the error or noise pollution of data might be propagated with higher sensitivity in the modeling of urmia station than tabriz station modeling so the pinaws reduction via wd in model of urmia station is more significant than models of tabriz and ardabil stations furthermore for model of urmia station a smoothed time series of rs as an input with higher standard deviation see table 1 can be very helpful in reducing the pinaws in model of urmia station while the input variables in model for tabriz station had almost low standard deviations in modeling the ardabil station also there is an almost higher standard deviation in recorded values of rh see table 1 in which via wd pinaw values in the modeling of this station experienced a greater reduction than the corresponding values in tabriz station modeling 3 2 4 results of pis estimation appling hwdjd the final step of the modeling was the combination of mentioned data pre processing techniques to generate the artificial time series by adding normal random data step 3 on the smoothed de noised time series obtained in step 4 similar to step 3 in this step two artificial time series were generated from each smoothed time series and fed simultaneously to the ann models as different patterns for each input in total in this step 6 12 and 9 inputs were fed to the models of tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively similar to step 3 the best results were chosen among different data with standard deviations that led to better network performance i e cwc the best results of this step for α 0 05 were obtained approximately up to 96 95 and 97 of picps and the pinaw values approximately were equal to 25 28 and 46 for model of tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively also for α 0 1 with almost picp values up to 90 90 and 93 the pinaw values were obtained approximately equal to 19 21 and 37 in the same direction see fig 4 the maximum and minimum reductions of pinaws via hwdjd were up to 30 and 19 4 again related to the urmia and tabriz stations respectively the combination of interpretations on the results of both wd and jd about different behaviors of models of the stations i e tabriz urmia and ardabil could be also true about applying hwdjd 3 2 5 discussion the overall results of the comparison between the different steps in terms of pi index changes i e δ picp and δ pinaw with the benchmark od results are presented in table 5 the positive sign in this table denotes the superiority of the pre processing based results i e jd wd or hwdjd in comparison to the od result and vice versa for the negative sign it can be seen from table 5 the highest reduction of pinaw value i e δ pinaw as a representative of reduction of uncertainty effect of data was caused by using the hwdjd up to 30 whereas it was up to 21 and 9 through using the wd and jd respectively however in all cases picp was a bit lower with regard to the results of od but in all cases it met its nominal values it should be noted that the smoothed time series through wd lead to the narrower pis according to the results because of the variance reduction however this conclusion is only valid if the user is certain in the decision of removing noise from the input data since that the removed noise could disrupt the purpose of the pis of representing the interval in which future observation could fall including variability added by the removed noise jd technique almost overcome this problem when used as data pre processing of the input vector to construct pis in which tries to almost handle actual fluctuations of the ann output so pis figs 5 7 show the pis for the best results of each method and both nominal values of 95 and 90 for modeling of tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively there was considerable uncertainty effect of data in terms of pis associated with the evaporation estimates for model of ardabil and urmia stations with regard to the tabriz station modeling see figs 4 7 the third input variable of the models for urmia station was rs in which it s higher standard deviation value see table 1 could be an additional factor to get higher pinaw value in the evaporation modeling furthermore rs as solar shortwave radiation also named global solar radiation received at earth s surface does not participate directly in estimating evaporation from evaporating surfaces such as an aquatic environment the difference between incoming and outgoing rs called net radiation rn is the potential amount of radiation that participates in evaporation from an evaporating surface where it can convert to the internal heat energy of the surface allen et al 1998 e g shallow water of pan in this study the amount of the rn is a function of the evaporating surface characteristics for example the albedo coefficient meteorological stations usually just record rs and then rn can be estimated through some mathematical relationships in which they themselves contain uncertainties that is why rs was selected as the dominant input for the urmia station modeling but anyway this variable can also increase the uncertainty presented by pinaws see od results of this station in modeling the ardabil station on the other hand low quality of data short length of recorded data compared to the others and also a small displacement of the station to its vicinity perhaps was the reason to get higher pinaw values with regard to the other stations in modeling tabriz station all two input variables had relatively low standard deviations and also the length of recorded data was bigger than the data of two other stations in which these two factors might be considered as the reasons for narrow pinaws better quality data in comparison to the others the results of this paper showed that the effect of uncertainty in the data due to assigning a fixed number to a time dependent variable when combined with natural noise can be significant according to the pinaw values the data pre processing methods for modeling urmia station especially the hwdjd method were more effective than other stations for reducing the effect of data uncertainty according to table 2 in addition to a greater number of inputs than two other stations the difference among the sensitivity values of all four selected inputs i e t rs et 1 and et 2 in the model of urmia station was less than the models of other stations from this point of view the ann output sensitivity to the existence of error at all four inputs for the urmia station model was severe than the other stations therefore the error reduction of all four input variables because of applying pre processing methods led to a higher reduction of pinaws for this station than two other stations moreover higher reduction of pinaws at ardebil station regarding tabriz station may be also justified from this perspective i e more inputs at ardebil station model than model of tabriz station which has only two inputs while third input rh at model of this station had higher value of ssd and led to more sensitivity in the output of evaporation modeling so more sensitive to the existence of error in this station since a large part of the error in the point predictions of ai models is related to the uncertainty involved in the input data set so the quality of recorded data can be ordered descending from tabriz to urmia and then ardabil stations because of descending pinaw values in the same direction since the input data bias is propagated through the model and creates uncertainty in the output mcmillan et al 2018 the model structure may control characteristics of this propagation linear or nonlinear when data uncertainty is high such as in ardabil station more precision selection of model structure can help a better reduction of the uncertainty effect of data furthermore the interaction of input variables if they include noise and sampling error also can lead to emerge fake information in the modeling of et and so increase the effect of data uncertainty as a whole accurate prediction of evaporation through the complete elimination of the uncertainty effect of data in addition to model uncertainty is not possible any pre processing method may capture only a part of the total uncertainty effect of data evaporation phenomenon is the result of a coupling system of the atmosphere meteorological parameters and the water body physical chemical properties of water this complex mechanism of air water interaction ambient conditions also effect on evaporation rate and its feedback on the evaporation rate is not entirely understood in its details water solutes such as the amount of salinity or water temperature such as for water of pan as internal properties of water medium are additional effective parameters on the evaporation rate as well as external conditions of the atmosphere but their measurements are not common in any weather station furthermore an incomplete understanding of the nature of individual components of the earth system e g any meteorological parameter etc in affecting the evaporation process et their interactions and feedbacks on the et as well as hydrological cycle e g interactions and feedback of rh t on the et and or an incomplete understanding of the environmental system under consideration such as water medium and its surrounding can also participate in increasing uncertainty effect of data in such a complex system 4 conclusions the core of understanding from hydrologic processes and their simulation models are based on the data and ignoring the effect of uncertainty involved in the used data can lead to some deviations in predictions and simulations of the hydrologic processes and consequently water resources management in this paper the lube technique as a direct method based on the ann and pi concepts were utilized to qualify the amount of effect of uncertainty involved in the used data set in the modeling of the evaporation process as one of the most important and complex processes of the hydrologic cycle moreover the reduction of uncertainty effect of the used data as the most important part of the uncertainty of black box models in estimating the evaporation process was investigated through pre processing of input time series in this way three techniques of jd wd and hwdjd utilized as data pre processing methods different data pre processing methods i e jd wd and hwdjd led to different levels of uncertainty effect reduction determined via pis the reduction of pinaws by applying hwdjd wd and jd methods were up to 30 21 and 9 respectively therefore compared to the rest the hybrid method which uses both jd and wd can be considered as the best and most effective data pre processing method in order to reduce the uncertainty effect at each station the uncertainty effect of data is also depended on the type of selected input variables so that from the authors point of view in addition to climatic effects the topography structure of each area was also important in choosing the dominant inputs the value of standard deviation the length of the recorded data systematic noise assigning a fixed number to a time dependent variable the number of input variables according to sensitivity analysis results and sensitivity to propagation of error that contributed on the output uncertainty which achieved through ssd in this paper were factors contributing to the uncertainty effect of the data for future research the effects of other data pre processing methods for noise elimination such as kalman and wiener filters in combination with jd can be studied and compared to the results of the current paper because there was not stated any comment on the way of accessing the optimal content of noise in jd technique so trial and error way in the range of small values of 0 1 0 9 for normalized data was utilized in the current paper for shifting any time series events at its fix time position however it may be possible to use the error distribution variance on the predictive values as an initial guess for only minimizing the trial and error range by adding subtracting small values around this value as well as reducing the computational load for example in this study this value increased from tabriz to urmia and then ardabil station in the same direction that noise variance increased in jd technique to receive minimum cwcs the results of the traditional uncertainty quantifying techniques such as bootstrap and delta methods in reducing the effects of data uncertainty after applying proposed data pre processing methods can be compared with the results of the present paper as another future study credit authorship contribution statement vahid nourani conceptualization supervision methodology writing review

5334,the point predictions of stochastic processes such as evaporation by data driven methods such as artificial neural network ann are associated with uncertainties furthermore the performance of data driven models as well as their uncertainty are dependent on the quality and quantity of the used data the main aim of this research was the uncertainty quantifying uq of the ann based evaporation predictions by prediction intervals pis analysis using the data from three stations in iran i e tabriz urmia and ardabil in this way data pre processing methods i e wavelet based de noising wd training with jitted data jd and also their combination i e hybrid wavelet de noising and jitted data hwdjd were applied to examine their effects on the estimated values of pis the lower upper bound estimation lube method as the direct nn based pi construction was utilized for estimating the pi values since the efficiency of any ann model and consequently the robustness of the uncertainty analysis is sensitive to the correct selection of input variables the first order partial derivation pad sensitivity analysis method was also used to select dominant inputs among all potential input variables the results indicated that the lube technique could provide acceptable results in estimating the uncertainty bounds whereas the uncertainty quantity would be affected by the used data pre processing methods the reduction of uncertainty effect via data pre processing methods was significant in modeling urmia and ardabil stations results showed that the reduction of pi bandwidths via hwdjd wd and jd methods were up to 30 21 and 9 respectively it means that to reduce the ann based modeling uncertainty due to the uncertainty involved in the input data set at first the contaminant noise of the available data should be eliminated from the time series then artificially generated time series jd that mimic the smoothed time series pattern can be generated and used in the training process keywords evaporation neural network prediction interval uncertainty quantifying wavelet de noising jitterd data 1 introduction as a major meteorological component of the hydrological cycle evaporation plays a key role in climate change and water resources studies evaporation estimations in hydrological practice can be achieved by direct or indirect methods indirect methods are developed based on meteorological data through empirical methodologies or statistical and stochastic approaches such as the water budget energy budget and aerodynamic approaches whereas direct methods are based on the field observations on a water body such as evaporation pan class a pan us weather bureau that are used extensively throughout the world as an index of evapotranspiration and for estimating lake and reservoir evaporation due to the non linearity complex and unsteady inherent of this process it is difficult to define an accurate physical based formula that covers all involved physical parameters and in this case data driven black box models may be a reliable alternative for the modeling artificial neural networks anns as such data driven models have been gained significant attention of hydro climatologists because of their simplicity in the model implementation and acceptable level of accuracy in their point predictions these statistical models can be addressing the inherent non linearities in the pan evaporation process and provide better performance with regard to the classical available approaches numerous conducted researches already approved the merit of ann models for point predictions of the evaporation process e g see chang et al 2010 nourani and sayyah fard 2012 tezel and buyukyildiz 2016 adamala et al 2018 nourani et al 2019a ferreira et al 2019 wang et al 2020 although anns are powerful tools for recognizing the complex relationship among inputs and outputs similar to other models their point predictions are associated with the uncertainty caused by various error sources the majority of the papers have investigated the generalization ability of anns i e accurate point predictions and only little researches have been quantified the amount of associated uncertainty with the output of such models determining the uncertainty values is necessary to trust the reliability of these models in practical applications most of the methods for expressing uncertainty in ann models are usually based on the concepts of inferential statistics two frequently used intervals as uncertainty analysis criteria are confidence and prediction intervals ci and pi respectively a pi describes the uncertainty bound on a single observation instead a ci is bound on the population parameter such as a mean or standard deviation in the hydro climatological studies mostly the concept of ci has been used for uncertainty measuring rather the pi concept e g see chen et al 2013 sugimoto et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 nn based pi construction methods are usually classified into two categories kabir et al 2018 the first category is the multi step methods or classical methods such as delta bayesian bootstrap mean variance estimation methods mvem and modifications of these methods in addition to difficult implementation applications of these methods involve some limitations such as assumption of homogeneous and normally distributed noise in the delta method massive computational burden and necessity of hessian matrix calculation of the cost function in bayesian and delta method computational cost for large data sets in bootstrap method and underestimating the variance of data in the mvem method that can lead to low empirical coverage probability khosravi et al 2011 the second category includes recently developed nn based direct pi construction methods the base technique in this category is lower upper bound estimation lube method khosravi et al 2011 that most of the others in this category are various versions of this method obtained by the modification of the cost function or and its optimization algorithm quan et al 2014 marin et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 some advantages of lube methods over classical methods are optimal pis are generated via an optimization problem similar to the procedure for the point predictions in a very convenient manner with regard to the classical methods these methods are distribution free and the computational burden is virtually ignorable compared to the classical methods kabir et al 2018 in spite of the importance of pi concept in hydro climatological studies focused by several researchers e g srivastav et al 2007 kasiviswanathan et al 2013 kumar et al 2015 kasiviswanathan and sudheer 2016 nourani et al 2019b and successful applications of lube method at different engineering fields e g taormina and chau 2015 lian et al 2016 wang et al 2018 the lube has not been served for pis of evaporation time series furthermore since the efficiency of anns as data driven models are highly dependent on the quality of data the improvement of the model performance as well as reduction of uncertainty effect of data using appropriate data pre possessing methods are important issues there are considerable research papers about qualifying data uncertainty for hydrologic processes as a novelty this paper was devoted for adopting reasonable pre processing approaches to reduce the uncertainty effect of data for modeling of the evaporation process natural observed time series are usually contaminated with unwanted noise that can lead to the bias in the learning process of the ann models so one of the pre processing methods in ann modeling can be related to the noise elimination from the input data sets there are several methods for noise elimination but due to the multi resolution multi scale nature of hydro climatic processes such as evaporation the application of wavelet based de noising wd could lead to successful simulations e g see campisi pinto et al 2012 nourani et al 2017 on the other hand in the training step of ann models each time dependent process has temporal variations within the sampling time interval particularly in longer time interval such as daily weekly etc where because of the difficulty or impossibility of recording a large amounts of data only a constant value is assigned as a representative of all possible values for the given time interval which this in turn can be associated with the uncertainty training with jittered data jd as a data pre processing method aims to increase generalization of the network matsuoka 1992 singh 1999 brown et al 2003 seghouane et al 2004 zur et al 2009 nourani and partoviyan 2018 as well as to reduce the uncertainty effect of data in this paper the effect of wd jd and also hybrid form of wavelet de noising and jitter data hwdjd as data pre processing methods was investigated on the quality of the data uncertainty in this way since the accuracy of the ann models as well as their associated uncertainty are sensitive to the correct choice of input variables the convenient partial derivatives pad sensitivity analysis method gevrey et al 2003 nourani and sayyah fard 2012 was also used to determine the most dominant inputs of the models data from three stations with almost different climatic conditions in the northwest of iran namely tabriz urmia and ardabil were used to investigate the uncertainty caused by data effects on the evaporation predictions in different climates through wd jd and hwdjd 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data in this study the daily pan evaporation was estimated for three stations located in the northwest of iran namely tabriz urmia and ardabil locations of these cities and their koppen climate classifications have been shown in fig 1 ardabil is about 70 km from the caspian sea and 210 km from the city of tabriz it has an average altitude of 1263 m and a total area of 18 011 km2 it is located on an open plain just east of mount sabalan 4811 m the average annual rainfall in ardabil is 325 mm tabriz is the most populated city in the northwest of iran located in the quru river valley between long ridges of volcanic cones in the sahand and eynali mountains tabriz elevation ranges between 1350 m and 1600 m above sea level the valley opens up into a plain that gently slopes down to the eastern shores of urmia lake 60 km to the west the average annual rainfall is 318 mm finally urmia situated at an altitude of 1330 m above sea level and is located along the shahar chay river city river on the urmia plain it is the 10th most populated city in iran urmia lake one of the world s largest salt lakes lies to the east of the city about 390 mm of precipitation falls there annually the meteorological data set used in this study has been collected from synoptic stations of tabriz urmia and ardabil and is included daily observations of air temperature t c pan evaporation et mm day 1 solar radiation rs j cm 2 day 1 air pressure p hpa relative humidity rh and wind speed u m s 1 that were used for estimating evaporation through ann models and construct nn based pis some statistical characteristics of the used data in terms of mean maximum minimum and standard deviation for each of three stations are tabulated in table 1 the daily data are from 1992 to 2018 and from 2006 to 2018 for tabriz and ardabil stations respectively for urmia station also daily data have been recorded from 1992 to 2003 and from 2007 to 2018 in all steps and for all stations the whole data set was allocated to 70 and 30 ratios for training and testing subsets respectively according to table 1 it can be seen that ardabil city with a mean of rh equal to 73 is wetter than other cities the average values of et t and rs are almost 4 mm day 1 10 c and 1661 j cm 2 day 1 respectively for ardabil station that are lower than other stations the averages of et and t in tabriz station are almost equal to 6 mm day 1 and 13 c respectively which are more than other stations the average value of rh is almost equal to 51 in this station that has the lowest value in comparison to the other stations see table 1 the average of rs and u in the urmia station are almost equal to 1779 j cm 2 day 1 and 2 m s 1 respectively as the highest and lowest values compared to the others according to fig 1 the climate of tabriz urmia and ardabil cities are cold and continental and or the mediterranean although both urmia and tabriz cities have an almost similar climate according to the koppen classifications field surveys and meteorological parameters measured in both stations shown in table 1 are slightly different while tabriz city has ordinary seasons cold winters and hot dry summers can usually be felt in urmia the geographical feature of the cities is effective in making minor differences of weather in these two cities such as high altitude differences in tabriz city which exacerbates the wind factor or the urmia location that is in the plain which is a factor to attract more solar radiation on the other hand koppen climate classification as the most widely used classification is based on the annual and monthly averages of temperature and precipitation none of the climate classification methods considers the simultaneous effect of all climate variables on the classification therefore the similarity of the climatic zones in this study does not mean that all effective variables on the evaporation process are the same in the selected study areas it means that the effect of climate variables on the evaporation condition in similar climatic zones may not be the same 2 2 proposed methodology the schematic of the proposed methodology followed in this study is seen in fig 2 a as it can be seen in this figure the study was conducted in five steps in the first step the sensitivity analysis for ann models was utilized to select the most effective inputs via the pad method for the evaporation modeling of all three stations in the second step in order to construct pis for raw original data the lube method was applied to the original data without any data pre processing application in this way the nn based pi cost function was minimized via a heuristic optimization algorithm of simulated annealing sa the third and fourth steps involved constructing pis by feeding input data under pre processing methods of jd and wd respectively in the fifth step the simultaneous effect of application of both wd and jd data pre processing methods as a hybrid form was investigated for pis estimation and finally overall obtained results of all steps were compared together components of the applied methodology are briefly described as follows 2 2 1 point predictions by anns an ann is a computational model that mimics the structure and functions of biological nns in receiving processing and transmitting information the principle of learning in anns is on the repetition several times that the data set is injected into the learning algorithm differences in learning data can detect by changing and improving the weight and bias vectors one of the most widely used methods for repeating and training in anns is the back propagation of error named back propagation bp algorithm in this algorithm and in each iteration there are two moves the first motion will be feed forward in which input and weight vectors are multiplied and sum with bias vector in feed forward motion the values of the nn output are obtained and compared with the actual values i e targets then the error values are measured in this way the algorithm finds out about error values concerning weights and bias and goes to the second stage namely back propagation on the same iteration i e go back and modify the weights and bias these iterations feed forward and back propagation are done as far as the predicted output be very close to the desired output target it is better to scale the data into the given interval before training an ann model because the cost function topology that is determined by the parameter values in the network improves by putting all of the data upon the same scale without scaling data into the given scale the optimization algorithm may fail to find the optimal value and stuck at the saddle points by scaling data in the given interval the network is allowed to more quickly learn the optimal parameters nourani 2017 in this paper the simplest and most commonly transformation rule i e min max was used to map the original values into the new interval between 0 1 and 0 9 in a linear form 2 2 1 1 performance criteria for point prediction classical anns are used for point prediction of time series and both statistical indexes i e root mean squared error rmse as eq 1 and determination coefficient dc or nash sutcliffe efficiency as eq 2 are usually sufficient for evaluating model s performance nourani 2017 also used in the current paper 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i 2 2 dc 1 i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where xi is the observed value x i is the computed value by model and x is the average of observed data with n observations the variation ranges of these indicators are as r m s e 0 and d c 1 index values near to 1 and 0 for dc and rmse respectively are desired in the modeling 2 2 1 2 ann dominant inputs selection choosing a set of the most effective input variables is an important issue in the ann modeling the existence of the redundant or weakly informative variables not only does not help in modeling but also causes some problems for the network training taking into account the tangent hyperbolic as the transfer function of hidden layer and the linear transfer function in the output layer for a three layer perceptron the final equation of the output sensitivity regarding the input p in the pad method is obtained by gevrey et al 2003 nourani and sayyah fard 2012 3 n o x p h 1 nh w oh 1 n h 2 w hp where n is the output signal from the neuron o and h refer to the output and hidden neurons respectively x p is the pth input to the network w refers to connection weight between subtitle neurons by summing the squares of obtained partial derivatives per input variable the relative contribution of the ann output with respect to any input can be calculated as 4 ss d p d 1 n n o x p d 2 i 1 ni s s d i 100 where ni is the total number of inputs ann dominant input variables can be chosen according to ssd values the large value of this index indicates the more effectiveness of the corresponding input on the output 2 2 2 estimation of prediction intervals by lube technique uncertainty quantifying uq has a key role in the process of decision making and optimization in many fields of science and engineering this concept tries to determine how likely the model output of a not exactly known system can be true and reliable there are multi sources of uncertainty that affect on the point predictions of any real system modeling ai based models are also affected by several sources of uncertainty namely uncertainty of model and training data lube method is a direct nn based technique for uq through the pi concept there are following differences between the conventional use of the anns i e point predications with what lube methods are used firstly in lube method the structure of ann has 2 outputs unlike traditional ones that usually have only one output secondary the cost function is unlike the traditional ones which is based on error reduction between the network output and the target here it is based on the combination of pi index on the real value of the ann point predictions it was stated that network optimization in lube method is incompatible via gradient descent as a classical local optimization algorithm because its cost function is highly nonlinear complex and discontinuous that caused by combining two conflicting objectives i e both high coverage and small width higher coverage probabilities typically result in wider pis khosravi et al 2011 therefore non gradient based methods namely meta heuristic optimization algorithms that do not require derivatives of the cost function are useful to establish trade off between coverage and bandwidth of pis via the cost function such as sa in contrast to the traditional ones which can use both non gradient and gradient descent optimization algorithms sa is developed on the basis of the annealing process in metallurgy and used in the current study annealing simulation can model the physical process of heating a material and then slowly lowering the temperature to decrease defects thus minimizing the system energy and reaching the thermodynamic equilibrium it is not derivative based and it can seek and explore the parameter space without being trapped in local optima kirkpatrick et al 1983 aarts and korst 1990 the last and third difference of this kind of ann with the traditional one is that its output is pi bound unlike former that it is point prediction fig 2b shows a typical nn structure that is used for lube technique as already mentioned the lube technique has two outputs as upper and lower pi bounds the maximum of the outputs is the upper and the minimum is the lower bound the cost function in this technique is termed as coverage width criterion cwc which is based on the quality of pis via the combination of two key characteristics of pis namely pi coverage probability picp and pi average width piaw picp is the probability that the corresponding targets with the input pattern lie within the pi this probability has a nominal value of 1 α the difference between the estimated upper and lower bounds is measured as the bandwidth by piaw the math formula of picp is as khosravi et al 2011 5 picp 1 n i 1 n c i provided that 6 c i 1 y i y l i y u i 0 else where n is the number of samples y l i and y u i are predicted lower and upper bounds respectively and y i is the target for ith sample the normalized pi average width pinaw is defined as 7 pinaw 1 nr i 1 n y u i y l i where r is the range of the underlying target i e y max y min cwc is a nonlinear combination of eqs 5 and 7 and is defined by khosravi et al 2011 8 cwc p i n a w γ picp e η μ picp provided that 9 γ p i c p 1 picp μ 0 picp μ where η and μ are two hyper parameters and are set to 80 through trial and error and 1 α as nominal confidence level respectively the role of η is to magnify any small difference between 1 α and picp these two hyper parameters set penalties on pis for the low picp as picp μ means that picp is satisfied with a nominal confidence level so the exponential term effect removed and then pinaw becomes dominant in this case the optimization algorithm here sa deals with only pinaw and tries to reduce the width of pis if picp μ it means that picp is not desired then the cwc value exponentially increases 2 2 3 wavelet based de noising method almost all types of hydrological data are infected by some noises that may arise from various sources such as measurement error human error conversion or transmission error there are some approaches for noise reduction such as wavelet based technique wavelet transform was presented in the 1980s morlet et al 1982a b grossman and morlet 1984 initially as a mathematical approach to spectral analysis wavelet threshold de noising wtd method that is commonly performed through discrete wavelet transform dwt has been introduced by donoho et al 1995 in the idea of thresholding all of the wavelet coefficients below a given threshold value are eliminated in summary the noise removal by the wavelet can be summarized in the three steps at first the wavelet transform of the noisy signal is calculated i e the original data are decomposed into the various sub signals an approximation and some detailed signals in the second step the noisy wavelet coefficients are modified through thresholding modified wavelet coefficients w j k can be estimated mathematically via two well known thresholding rules introduced by donoho and johnstone 1995 and donoho 1995 i e hard and soft threshold rules the hard thresholding can be unstable and sensitive to small perturbations in the data antoniadis 2007 but less information is lost through soft thresholding rule as wang et al 2014 10 w j k sgn w j k w j k t j w j k t j 0 w j k t j where t j and w j k are threshold value and the detailed coefficient respectively the last step is to compute inverse wavelet transform to reconstruct the denoised signal by utilizing modified coefficients the reasonable value of threshold in wd plays a key role in the noise elimination from the signal if a small threshold value is selected the recovered signal still has a percentage of noise on the other hand if a large threshold value is selected some components of the signal are also deleted so the recovered signal will be destroyed in compared to the original signal there are several methods for applying thresholds for example universal thresholding ut is a type of global thresholding methods presented by donoho and johnstone 1994 for the white gaussian noise as 11 t j σ 2 ln n where n is the number of samples in the noisy signal and σ is the standard deviation of noise as 12 σ median w j k t 0 6745 where w j k t is the first level of detail coefficients for the sub signal in the current paper the soft thresholding rule using same threshold values for all detailed signals was utilized for wd 2 2 4 data pattern generation jitterd data the training data set is only one random sample from the associated infinite population and therefore it may feed random pattern to the model which can be associated with uncertainty it means that if the available data set is not a good representative for all of the population the modeling can get some biases relative to what actually existed jittering by injecting random numbers into the original data set is based on an idea to create the artificial time series by mimicking the original time series pattern and aiming to increase the input patterns into the model different researches argue the following reasons for increasing network performance so its generalizability when using jd because the network tries to fit point to point and ultimately to reduce the error feeding single data pattern for each input during the training process causes the network function to be disturbed and rugged and to be sensitive to the smallest changes in the input space following with sharp responses for not experienced new data set test data by feeding different patterns jd to the network during the training step it is difficult for the network to fit on the individual data points exactly therefore the network function can be expected to be continuous smoother and less sensitive to the small changes in the input space the network generally works poorly due to inadequate constraints in its cost function jd indirectly leads to altering and improving the training cost function by adding a penalty term this extra term acts as a regulator term and is a function of the variance of added random data in which it controls the smoothness degree of the cost function holmstrom and koistinen 1992 guozhong 1996 bishop 2005 zhang 2007 nourani and partoviyan 2018 in this method random data are generated with an average of zero and a small standard deviation there is no particular method provided for selecting the amount of standard deviation of the random data very low standard deviation may have no effect on the smoothing of the cost function and vice versa high standard deviation may lead to the destruction of the main pattern of the data set to generate random numbers such as for jittering in the current paper with any statistical distribution first random numbers are generated with uniform distribution and then they are used to generate random numbers with any statistical distribution there are some techniques to generate random numbers with arbitrary distribution by utilizing numbers obtained by the uniform distribution among all methods the reverse transform technique is more common in this field according to this technique if random variable x has a cumulative distribution function cdf of f x so u f x will have uniform pdf of u 0 1 conversely for u u 0 1 x f 1 u will have cdf of f thus to generate random variable y with arbitrary cdf of g eq 13 can be used bowker and lieberman 1972 13 y g 1 f x almost all papers in this field focus on the effects of jd on the generalizability of anns in this study a different glance was taken to this issue to investigate the effects of training with jd on the pis in estimating the daily pan evaporation via ann models it can be said that this approach uses somewhat the bootstrap method based on the repetition perspective for investigating uncertainty quality but it seems that jd be better than the bootstrap method bootstrap is based on random sampling from the recorded range of variables constant recorded pattern but jd allows the network to experience new patterns of any variables and also unlike bootstrap its computational cost encountering large data sets is not high 3 results and discussion the obtained results via the proposed methodology are presented in 5 subsections in the first part the results of the dominant input selection for anns are presented the second part presents the results of the pis not using any data pre processing method and just by applying original raw data in the next two subsections the pi estimation results are presented after applying jd and wd data pre processing methods respectively finally the results of the effect of both data pre processing methods on pis are presented and all results are compared with together 3 1 results of sensitivity analysis input selection after linearly scaling the original data sets to the interval between 0 1 and 0 9 in this step before modeling the evaporation and constructing pis the sensitivity analysis was performed on the ann models at each of the next steps the results of sensitivity analysis were utilized to arrange inputs for anns it has been mathematically proven that a bpnn with only three layers one hidden layer is sufficient for the simulation of any process hornik et al 1989 so three layer bpnns were utilized with tangent hyperbolic as hidden layer transfer function and a linear transfer function in the output layer the levenberg marquardt algorithm for training the networks as an approximation of newton s method that has been shown to be one of the fastest algorithms for training mlps hagan and menhaj 1994 was also used to train the ann models due to the instability of relative sensitivity values and so to get better performance in the input selection procedure different networks were generated and finally the best responses in each of the three stations modeling were selected among the most frequented results with regard to efficiency criteria i e dc and rmse which are used for evaluating the point predictions by anns due to markovian autoregressive property of the daily evaporation it is expected that the evaporation value of each time step is highly related to its value at previous time steps up to the memory lag of l for the accurate selection of the most effective evaporation lags along with other inputs in modeling the evaporation process the pad sensitivity analysis method was used therefore in the step of dominant inputs selection the et i where i 1 2 l according to partial autocorrelation function pacf plot not presented in the paper l can be considered as 4 for all models of stations t rh rs p and u were considered as the potential inputs of the ann models to predict et as output the final results of the relative importance for the input variables for each of the three stations modelings were tabulated in table 2 in all cases the most important inputs with regard to their ssd see eq 4 were selected as the ann input variables the large values of this index indicate the more effectiveness of the corresponding inputs on the output regarding ssd values two t and et 1 four t et 1 rs and et 2 and three t et 1 and rh variables were selected as more effective inputs in modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively other variables had low values of ssd accordingly t and et 1 in all cases were identified as the first or second most dominant components on the daily evaporation process as can be seen from table 2 the third most dominant variables were u rs and rh in the tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively perhaps the difference in the third governing variable as a result of sensitivity analysis in addition to the climatic properties can be found in the geographical feature of each city from this perspective the topography of tabriz consists of two mountainous and plain areas the altitude difference in an area results in non uniform warming of the earth by solar radiation and so resulting in the formation of areas with high and low pressures and eventually the formation of wind tong 2010 so it can be a reason for the windward condition in this city urmia city on the other hand is located in the foothill and plain areas these topography areas receive more solar radiation because mountainous areas oceans and large lakes participate more than the plains in the formation of clouds as the predominant atmospheric condition in the amount of reached solar radiation to the earth calabrò and magazù 2016 so according to the results of the sensitivity analysis the selection of solar radiation as the third most effective climate factor in this city could be justified also regarding to table 1 and the low standard deviation dev of et at the urmia station it can be inferred that et has almost stable condition highly dependent on the previous time steps and as so high ssd values of et up to the memory lag of 2 days can be justified from this point of view finally ardebil is affected by the marine areas due to its proximity to the astara port which may be a reason for the predomination of humidity rh in this city 3 2 results of pis estimation for each of the four steps pis were constructed by the lube method for two levels of nominal confidence of 95 and 90 corresponding to α 0 05 and 0 1 respectively fig 3 only for tabriz station modeling as the instance shows sa evolutionary during the training step the convergence rate of temperature as a controller sa parameter and cwc like the internal energy of molten solid in the annealing process are shown in fig 3a b in which for better graphical visualization of the optimization algorithm effort extreme values of cwc have not been displayed in fig 3a on the other hand the overall behavior of cwc in the logarithmic scale simultaneously with temperature is seen in fig 3b at the beginning of the optimization process picp was less than its nominal value picp 1 α so cwc got very large amounts because the picp term dominated and led to cwc was punished exponentially with the parameter η and therefore the picp was rapidly increased it means that at the beginning of the optimization process more attention in cwc was paid for the increase of picp so the pinaw increased without any limitation once picp was reached to its nominal value then cwc started to reduce pinaw and the penalty due to unsatisfying picp exponentially decreased and then the pinaw term reached to the dominant value see fig 3d finally a trade off between the picp and pinaw through the optimization process was established the parameter of η 80 for controlling the cwc values was obtained through trial and error so that for the lower η the value of the cwc function is more likely to fail i e pinaw and picp values approach zero due to cwc definition in the training step the primary population set ann s parameters was generated by the traditional ann i e network trained with a classical optimization algorithm considering rmse and dc as performance functions having two outputs corresponding to the target values these two outputs only made the initial guess of pis for the optimization algorithm then these initial weights were used to handle the sa algorithm table 3 shows some controller parameters of sa used in this paper according to the technical literature e g khosravi et al 2011 one of the controller parameters of this algorithm is temperature ann s parameters were allowed to modify 30 times at each constant temperature until these parameters reached the stability i e there was no significant change in the value of cwc then the temperature was decreased with the determined step by geometric cooling schedule tk l which sets the decrease of the temperature at each search iteration the new population set ann parameters was generated at any iteration of the optimization process these new parameters then set the mentioned traditional ann with two outputs to achieve upper and lower bounds fig 3c shows the evolutionary variations of some ann s weights during the training step via sa in the next step by utilizing the obtained pi uncertainty indexes pinaw and picp and subsequently cwc were calculated this process was continued to reach the lowest defined temperature for the algorithm this is the point where the optimal population the network parameters is obtained which is equivalent to the lowest internal energy in the annealing algorithm as the lowest cost function finally pis were generated with a certain confidence level 1 α to cover the targets a lower cwc indicates a better pi this quantity will be high for invalid pis after completing the training process the performance of the trained network was examined by the test set through feeding these optimal parameters into the ann and simulating for the test data set once the pi was achieved for the test data its related index could be evaluated in all the following subsections the results are presented only for the test step for the training step only the results of the evolutionary process of sa are presented in general after picp is met its nominal value the best models can be determined only based on pinaw values presented in table 5 and figs 4 7 3 2 1 results of pis estimation appling raw data od the results of this section were used as the benchmark to compare with the results obtained after applying data pre processing methods in this step using the normalized data and not applying any other data pre processing method the pis of the daily evaporation process were estimated to avoid the high computational burden and constructing benchmark pis the optimal hidden layer structure in the terms of the number of neurons was selected through trial and error examining 3 12 hidden neurons the best selective structure was fixed for each station modeling in this step then utilized for any other steps and the best pis were reported in this way the number of neurons of 8 9 and 7 in the hidden layer resulted in the best pis evaluated by the cwc for three stations of tabriz urmia and ardabil respectively in all cases due to the low picp and high pinaw the high values of cwc were changed approximately between 100 and 5000 but it was clear that the picp even as much as 1 or 2 below its given nominal value led to the sharp and exponential increase in the cwc values fig 4 shows the best results obtained in this step i e od along with the obtained results in other steps i e jd wd and hwdjd it can be seen from fig 4 that for α 0 05 and picp values up to 97 98 and 99 the pinaws were obtained approximately as 31 40 and 60 for modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively also for α 0 1 with picp values up to 93 92 and 95 the pinaws were obtained approximately as 24 31 and 48 for modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively pinaw values got wider range respectively for tabriz urmia and then ardabil stations for both α 0 05 and 0 1 whereas picps in all cases were met their nominal values i e 95 or 90 one reason for this behavior can be justified due to the number of inputs of ann models for each station and so propagating the noise included in the inputs through the model the model for tabriz station had the lowest number of inputs among three stations these two input variables contribute to the modeling with a total sensitivity of 82 31 this figure is equal to 90 49 for urmia with four input variables and is equal to 92 2 for ardabil station with three input variables the purpose of sensitivity analysis is to obtain variables that generate large contributions and sensitivities at the output so that it is expected that the greater the total sensitivity of the input variables the more accurate the modeling of the process this issue can be true when the input variables which lead to the high sensitivity values in the modeling are at the low level of noise pollution or error otherwise they may cause propagating of random error and noise with high sensitivity in the modeling as can be seen from the results for modeling urmia and more especially for ardabil stations and so leading to some bias and increasing the model output uncertainty the high uncertainty of two other stations could also be justified from this point of view meaning that the probability of noise contamination in the time series of et in its previous time steps i e et 1 and et 2 rh and rs is expected to be significant 3 2 2 results of pis estimation appling jd the third step was related to estimate pis after applying jd as a data pre processing method firstly random numbers with a normal distribution i e mean of zero and small standard deviations were generated by the randn function of matlab to inject into the original time series there is no specific criterion to determine standard deviation content and usually values in the range of 0 to 1 are tested in trial and error way to find the most suitable jd zhang 2007 nourani and partoviyan 2018 in this study the values of 0 0005 0 001 0 003 0 005 0 01 0 05 and 0 075 were examined as standard deviation values of the generated random data in accordance with the sensitivity analysis results two t and et 1 four t et 1 rs and et 2 and three t et 1 and rh main time series for modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations were selected as inputs respectively to avoid the high number of inputs to the models only two artificial time series were generated by adding jittered normal random data on the original time series these two artificial series had zero means and similar fixed standard deviations but different randomly generated values thus the number of input variables in this step includes original and generated artificial time series increased to 6 12 and 9 for modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively for each content of the standard deviation the training process was repeated finally the best results were chosen concerning the cwc values in the lube method the best ones for both α 0 05 and α 0 1 were obtained with the standard deviations of 0 001 0 005 and 0 05 for modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively therefore the standard deviation values of random data in the construction of the artificial patterns show increasing order from tabriz to urmia and then ardabil stations which may denote to an increase of sampling error of the input data for these stations in the same direction for α 0 05 with picps up to 96 97 and 97 the pinaw values were obtained approximately as 29 36 and 54 for modeling tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively also for α 0 1 with picp values up to 92 92 and 95 the pinaw values were obtained approximately as 22 28 and 47 for the three stations in the same direction see fig 4 the maximum reduction of pinaws via jd was up to 9 related to the urmia station model due to the higher number of input variables of model for this station the probability of imposing the sampling noise to et modeling increases using jd the input patterns at this station increased to 12 both original and artificial time series i e the deviations of sampling error at this station somewhat could be reformed through applying the standard deviation of 0 005 into the original time series which led to reduction of the pinaws in this station this issue may be more highlighted for rs as an input variable in urmia station with a higher standard deviation see table 1 3 2 3 results of pis estimation appling wd the fourth step of modeling was about removing the contaminant and natural noise from the input time series using the dwt to obtain the best smoothed signals the soft thresholding rule was applied along with universal thresholding on the input signals different kinds of symlet family wavelets symn i e sym5 sym6 sym7 sym8 and daubechies family wavelets dbn i e db3 db4 db5 were examined along with different decomposition levels from 2 to 7 obtained by wmaxlev function of matlab software that returns the maximum decomposition level of a signal or image based on the wavelet type and the size of the signal to determine the threshold value eq 11 was utilized table 4 shows ann performance for the point prediction of et via feeding smoothed time series obtained via wd technique the selected through sensitivity analysis and smoothed time series through wd used as inputs to the ann models to construct pis the best results for α 0 05 were obtained with picps up to 96 96 and 97 and the pinaw values approximately as 28 33 and 50 for modeling the stations of tabriz urmia and ardabil respectively also for α 0 1 with picp values up to 92 91 and 94 the pinaw values were obtained approximately as 22 24 and 40 for the three stations in the same direction see fig 4 the maximum and minimum reductions of pinaws via wd were up to 21 and 10 and are related to the urmia and tabriz stations respectively models for tabriz station with two input variables and total sensitivity of 82 31 and urmia with four input variables and total sensitivity of 90 49 have been participated in the modeling therefore the error or noise pollution of data might be propagated with higher sensitivity in the modeling of urmia station than tabriz station modeling so the pinaws reduction via wd in model of urmia station is more significant than models of tabriz and ardabil stations furthermore for model of urmia station a smoothed time series of rs as an input with higher standard deviation see table 1 can be very helpful in reducing the pinaws in model of urmia station while the input variables in model for tabriz station had almost low standard deviations in modeling the ardabil station also there is an almost higher standard deviation in recorded values of rh see table 1 in which via wd pinaw values in the modeling of this station experienced a greater reduction than the corresponding values in tabriz station modeling 3 2 4 results of pis estimation appling hwdjd the final step of the modeling was the combination of mentioned data pre processing techniques to generate the artificial time series by adding normal random data step 3 on the smoothed de noised time series obtained in step 4 similar to step 3 in this step two artificial time series were generated from each smoothed time series and fed simultaneously to the ann models as different patterns for each input in total in this step 6 12 and 9 inputs were fed to the models of tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively similar to step 3 the best results were chosen among different data with standard deviations that led to better network performance i e cwc the best results of this step for α 0 05 were obtained approximately up to 96 95 and 97 of picps and the pinaw values approximately were equal to 25 28 and 46 for model of tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively also for α 0 1 with almost picp values up to 90 90 and 93 the pinaw values were obtained approximately equal to 19 21 and 37 in the same direction see fig 4 the maximum and minimum reductions of pinaws via hwdjd were up to 30 and 19 4 again related to the urmia and tabriz stations respectively the combination of interpretations on the results of both wd and jd about different behaviors of models of the stations i e tabriz urmia and ardabil could be also true about applying hwdjd 3 2 5 discussion the overall results of the comparison between the different steps in terms of pi index changes i e δ picp and δ pinaw with the benchmark od results are presented in table 5 the positive sign in this table denotes the superiority of the pre processing based results i e jd wd or hwdjd in comparison to the od result and vice versa for the negative sign it can be seen from table 5 the highest reduction of pinaw value i e δ pinaw as a representative of reduction of uncertainty effect of data was caused by using the hwdjd up to 30 whereas it was up to 21 and 9 through using the wd and jd respectively however in all cases picp was a bit lower with regard to the results of od but in all cases it met its nominal values it should be noted that the smoothed time series through wd lead to the narrower pis according to the results because of the variance reduction however this conclusion is only valid if the user is certain in the decision of removing noise from the input data since that the removed noise could disrupt the purpose of the pis of representing the interval in which future observation could fall including variability added by the removed noise jd technique almost overcome this problem when used as data pre processing of the input vector to construct pis in which tries to almost handle actual fluctuations of the ann output so pis figs 5 7 show the pis for the best results of each method and both nominal values of 95 and 90 for modeling of tabriz urmia and ardabil stations respectively there was considerable uncertainty effect of data in terms of pis associated with the evaporation estimates for model of ardabil and urmia stations with regard to the tabriz station modeling see figs 4 7 the third input variable of the models for urmia station was rs in which it s higher standard deviation value see table 1 could be an additional factor to get higher pinaw value in the evaporation modeling furthermore rs as solar shortwave radiation also named global solar radiation received at earth s surface does not participate directly in estimating evaporation from evaporating surfaces such as an aquatic environment the difference between incoming and outgoing rs called net radiation rn is the potential amount of radiation that participates in evaporation from an evaporating surface where it can convert to the internal heat energy of the surface allen et al 1998 e g shallow water of pan in this study the amount of the rn is a function of the evaporating surface characteristics for example the albedo coefficient meteorological stations usually just record rs and then rn can be estimated through some mathematical relationships in which they themselves contain uncertainties that is why rs was selected as the dominant input for the urmia station modeling but anyway this variable can also increase the uncertainty presented by pinaws see od results of this station in modeling the ardabil station on the other hand low quality of data short length of recorded data compared to the others and also a small displacement of the station to its vicinity perhaps was the reason to get higher pinaw values with regard to the other stations in modeling tabriz station all two input variables had relatively low standard deviations and also the length of recorded data was bigger than the data of two other stations in which these two factors might be considered as the reasons for narrow pinaws better quality data in comparison to the others the results of this paper showed that the effect of uncertainty in the data due to assigning a fixed number to a time dependent variable when combined with natural noise can be significant according to the pinaw values the data pre processing methods for modeling urmia station especially the hwdjd method were more effective than other stations for reducing the effect of data uncertainty according to table 2 in addition to a greater number of inputs than two other stations the difference among the sensitivity values of all four selected inputs i e t rs et 1 and et 2 in the model of urmia station was less than the models of other stations from this point of view the ann output sensitivity to the existence of error at all four inputs for the urmia station model was severe than the other stations therefore the error reduction of all four input variables because of applying pre processing methods led to a higher reduction of pinaws for this station than two other stations moreover higher reduction of pinaws at ardebil station regarding tabriz station may be also justified from this perspective i e more inputs at ardebil station model than model of tabriz station which has only two inputs while third input rh at model of this station had higher value of ssd and led to more sensitivity in the output of evaporation modeling so more sensitive to the existence of error in this station since a large part of the error in the point predictions of ai models is related to the uncertainty involved in the input data set so the quality of recorded data can be ordered descending from tabriz to urmia and then ardabil stations because of descending pinaw values in the same direction since the input data bias is propagated through the model and creates uncertainty in the output mcmillan et al 2018 the model structure may control characteristics of this propagation linear or nonlinear when data uncertainty is high such as in ardabil station more precision selection of model structure can help a better reduction of the uncertainty effect of data furthermore the interaction of input variables if they include noise and sampling error also can lead to emerge fake information in the modeling of et and so increase the effect of data uncertainty as a whole accurate prediction of evaporation through the complete elimination of the uncertainty effect of data in addition to model uncertainty is not possible any pre processing method may capture only a part of the total uncertainty effect of data evaporation phenomenon is the result of a coupling system of the atmosphere meteorological parameters and the water body physical chemical properties of water this complex mechanism of air water interaction ambient conditions also effect on evaporation rate and its feedback on the evaporation rate is not entirely understood in its details water solutes such as the amount of salinity or water temperature such as for water of pan as internal properties of water medium are additional effective parameters on the evaporation rate as well as external conditions of the atmosphere but their measurements are not common in any weather station furthermore an incomplete understanding of the nature of individual components of the earth system e g any meteorological parameter etc in affecting the evaporation process et their interactions and feedbacks on the et as well as hydrological cycle e g interactions and feedback of rh t on the et and or an incomplete understanding of the environmental system under consideration such as water medium and its surrounding can also participate in increasing uncertainty effect of data in such a complex system 4 conclusions the core of understanding from hydrologic processes and their simulation models are based on the data and ignoring the effect of uncertainty involved in the used data can lead to some deviations in predictions and simulations of the hydrologic processes and consequently water resources management in this paper the lube technique as a direct method based on the ann and pi concepts were utilized to qualify the amount of effect of uncertainty involved in the used data set in the modeling of the evaporation process as one of the most important and complex processes of the hydrologic cycle moreover the reduction of uncertainty effect of the used data as the most important part of the uncertainty of black box models in estimating the evaporation process was investigated through pre processing of input time series in this way three techniques of jd wd and hwdjd utilized as data pre processing methods different data pre processing methods i e jd wd and hwdjd led to different levels of uncertainty effect reduction determined via pis the reduction of pinaws by applying hwdjd wd and jd methods were up to 30 21 and 9 respectively therefore compared to the rest the hybrid method which uses both jd and wd can be considered as the best and most effective data pre processing method in order to reduce the uncertainty effect at each station the uncertainty effect of data is also depended on the type of selected input variables so that from the authors point of view in addition to climatic effects the topography structure of each area was also important in choosing the dominant inputs the value of standard deviation the length of the recorded data systematic noise assigning a fixed number to a time dependent variable the number of input variables according to sensitivity analysis results and sensitivity to propagation of error that contributed on the output uncertainty which achieved through ssd in this paper were factors contributing to the uncertainty effect of the data for future research the effects of other data pre processing methods for noise elimination such as kalman and wiener filters in combination with jd can be studied and compared to the results of the current paper because there was not stated any comment on the way of accessing the optimal content of noise in jd technique so trial and error way in the range of small values of 0 1 0 9 for normalized data was utilized in the current paper for shifting any time series events at its fix time position however it may be possible to use the error distribution variance on the predictive values as an initial guess for only minimizing the trial and error range by adding subtracting small values around this value as well as reducing the computational load for example in this study this value increased from tabriz to urmia and then ardabil station in the same direction that noise variance increased in jd technique to receive minimum cwcs the results of the traditional uncertainty quantifying techniques such as bootstrap and delta methods in reducing the effects of data uncertainty after applying proposed data pre processing methods can be compared with the results of the present paper as another future study credit authorship contribution statement vahid nourani conceptualization supervision methodology writing review
