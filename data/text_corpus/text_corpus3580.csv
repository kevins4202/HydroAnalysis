17900,resilience has become a regulatory concept influencing investment decisions in the water and wastewater sector however current assessments predominantly focus on technical resilience and on engineering solutions here we propose an alternative more holistic approach that captures multiple perspectives of resilience by eliciting and comparing cognitive maps of diverse agents both from within as well as external to a wastewater utility we use fuzzy cognitive mapping as a practical tool to elicit subjective views on resilience mechanisms and illustrate the methodology in co production with professionals from the wastewater sector in the belfast area northern ireland we find that the proposed participatory process facilitates a more reflective inclusive and integrated assessment than current approaches screening for risks and vulnerabilities using this new approach can foster an integrated system perspective by i systematically identifying connections between sub systems which are normally assessed separately ii detecting feedbacks between system components which may reveal unintended consequences of resilience interventions and by iii obtaining a wider portfolio of potential interventions to increase overall resilience we conclude that the suggested approach may be useful for strategic planning purposes within a utility and for improving cross departmental communication among both internal and external agents graphical abstract image 1 keywords resilience risk screening vulnerability co production cognitive maps wastewater management 1 introduction resilience has been at the centre of recent reflections on sustainability in the water and wastewater sector it expands the usual scope of service reliability under standard loading to exceptional low probability high impact events which have traditionally been neglected butler et al 2016 the concept of resilience has become increasingly popular and is used in investment decisions however the focus of resilience in the water and wastewater industry is still predominantly technical in nature mullin and kirchhoff 2018 in addition despite interdisciplinary ambitions of the resilience community the scientific literature shows that there are important dialectical forces at play between the natural engineering sciences resilience and the social sciences vulnerability that are shaped by different world views and interpretations olsson et al 2015 the distinction between engineering resilience which aims at maintaining efficiency of functions and ecological resilience which aims at maintaining existence of functions are so fundamental that they can become alternative paradigms whose devotees reflect traditions of a discipline or of an attitude rather than a reality of nature holling 1996 similarly resilience has different meanings in wastewater management depending on the specific domain and objective it is applied to juan garcía et al 2017 in this paper we intend to move beyond the variety of definitions that exist in the literature juan garcía et al 2017 and do not seek a precise definition of resilience at the onset of our study we are interested in revealing how wastewater management practitioners perceive vulnerabilities and resilience of the wastewater system they are working in our goal is twofold firstly to propose to practitioners a methodology that contributes to a better understanding of the wastewater system under study bringing together various points of view that usually do not meet secondly to contribute to addressing some of the gaps that juan garcía et al 2017 identified in the wastewater sector table 1 to foster incorporation of resilience in wastewater management practice to do this we develop an approach in which starting from open ended questions we obtain cognitive maps in an engagement process with wastewater professionals cognitive maps are graphical illustrations of a person s internal associative representations gray et al 2015 these representations are elicited with logical structures such as causal diagrams we test this new approach for the belfast area with ni water northern ireland water where we obtain multiple perspectives of resilience informed by a wide range of agents both internal and external to the water utility our approach enables to identify opportunities for change conflicting issues as well as potential barriers and unintended consequences of resilience interventions which may not be revealed by more narrowly defined resilience perspectives it facilitates the development of a reflective inclusive and integrated view of resilience features that have been found to be largely missing in current practices juan garcía et al 2017 this permits to obtain a broader view in which human driven resilience complements technical resilience and in which different urban systems and resources are interlinked table 1 the holistic assessment therefore may uncover more meaningful resilience interventions that address vulnerabilities at their origin the methodology is intended for screening purposes prior to targeting specific resilience aspects with more technical and quantitative approaches including statistical and phenomenological modelling carpenter et al 2009 oppenheimer et al 2007 the following sections present our resilience screening approach section 2 and the results from its application to the belfast wastewater system section 3 section 4 discusses to what extent our study contributes to address some of the gaps identified in the literature and its potential value added for the water industry in general section 5 concludes with a summary of the main findings 2 methodology materials and case study with origins in cognitive psychology which studies human learning and behaviour cognitive maps are graphics for structuring and illustrating knowledge and beliefs gray et al 2014 cognitive maps are drawn around a specific question of interest by agents that are familiar with this domain thus participants can structure visualise and share their experience understanding and interpretation 2 1 fuzzy cognitive mapping fuzzy cognitive mapping fcm is an extension of cognitive maps characterised by the use of cause effect relationships to link cognitive concepts axelrod 1976 in addition fcm enables to indicate the perceived strength of cause to effect relations kosko 1986 including for complex and abstract variables such as responsibility or political will which may be difficult to quantify otherwise özesmi and özesmi 2004 fuzzy cognitive maps have been reported to be of particular interest in domains characterised by complexity vagueness uncertainty subjectivity and data scarcity gray et al 2014 as cognitive maps fcm allows to capture knowledge experience and beliefs from participants about the functioning of a specific system to make such implicit assumptions or mental models explicit jetter and kok 2014 this is done during interviews in which professionals identify core variables and their interrelations using causal diagrams participants characterise the influence of one variable onto another by assigning a positive or negative sign and a metric between 0 and 1 where 0 indicates no influence and 1 a very strong influence interviews are based on one or several open ended questions that are the leading thread through the entire mapping process the analyst s role is to guide the participants through the mapping exercise and mediate between the practical experience of practitioners and the requirements of the elicitation methodology participants take part in the process either in individual interviews or in working groups in the latter case participants discuss their views cause to effect relationships signs and strengths of each connection that altogether lead to a common model because there are no requirements on the interview question itself fcm is a flexible tool with many different possible applications beyond its initial use in the psychological realm fcm has also been applied to topics as varied as the potential deployment of photovoltaic solar panels jetter and schweinfort 2011 vulnerability assessments of livelihoods murungweni et al 2011 risk assessments medina and moreno 2007 including financial systemic risk mezei and sarlin 2016 environmental management applications and ecology mehryar et al 2017 özesmi and özesmi 2004 water resources management kafetzis et al 2014 and climate change research olazabal et al 2018 reckien 2014 2 2 a holistic resilience assessment approach 2 2 1 defining the objective and interview questions to set up the participatory experiment we design a questionnaire appendix a1 of the supplementary materials that seeks to address the problematic at hand while guiding the participants through the mapping process the development of the questions results from interactions with ni water senior managers and reflections about the focus and objective of our study on capturing multiple resilience perspectives and obtaining a broad set of potential interventions the interview guidelines address two questions that shall be elicited during the interviews question 1 according to your experience knowledge and expertise how are drivers and characteristics of the system affecting resilience of wastewater management at northern ireland water ni water for the belfast area in the short medium and long term question 2 according to your experience knowledge and expertise which interventions changes could increase resilience of wastewater management at ni water for the belfast area in the short medium and long term we deliberately chose to leave the system resilience and belfast area undefined with the intention that the participants specify boundaries and reveal their own interpretations of these concepts besides we introduce the notion of timescales short medium and long term in order to capture the widest possible range of resilience drivers that can be identified and reduce the bias towards short term priorities that professionals deal with on a daily basis 2 2 2 identifying relevant participants motivated by the idea of widening the range of resilience perspectives the aim is to conduct mapping sessions with representatives from all departments and several hierarchical levels of the wastewater utility in addition we identify principle agents as potential interviewees outside ni water in view of identifying relevant participants we conduct a series of preliminary meetings with the heads of departments at the water utility in some cases one professional is selected to represent a department and individual interviews are conducted in other cases several people representing different areas of responsibility within the same department are nominated to participate in a group interview 2 2 3 planning the mapping sessions we plan resilience mapping sessions to last 90 min with the interest of encouraging experts participation balancing their limited time availability with the need to introduce them to the methodology and develop the narratives and maps at the beginning of the mapping sessions the analyst needs to guide the participants step by step through the interview guidelines appendix a1 and to clarify any questions and doubts that arise during the interviews the analyst needs to assimilate as well as possible the knowledge of the participants and ensure it is correctly captured according to the requirements of the fcm methodology this necessarily demands a dialogue between the analyst and the participants 2 2 4 conducting mapping sessions mapping sessions are structured in three different phases olazabal et al 2018 see appendix a1 in the first phase participants are given time to individually brainstorm on the first interview question about drivers and characteristics of the system that affect resilience they are then invited to start drawing the map with one of the concepts they have identified and to add further concepts revealing the cascading cause to effect relations if participants do not feel comfortable with the drawing process the analyst can step in and draw the map based on the instructions of the participants the process finalises once participants feel they have covered all their concerns in the second phase the same process is followed with the second interview question on resilience interventions in the third phase interviewees are asked to reflect on the sign and strength of each connection the positive sign of a relationship refers to a positive influence of one variable on another variables move in the same direction while a negative sign means a negative influence variables move in opposite directions weights are proposed to be a decimal number on a scale between 0 and 1 referring to the strength of each cause to effect linkage between two variables 2 2 5 narratives of resilience maps to be able to capture the storyline revealed in the interview we solicited agreement from the participants to be able to voice record the sessions that are later transcribed by the analyst for confidentiality reasons these are not available to the reader these recordings and transcripts serve to develop a qualitative narrative that supplements the maps and facilitates comparison between them this also allows to obtain clarifications of elicited resilience drivers and rationales of system mechanisms and to revise maps if necessary 2 2 6 digitalisation of resilience maps the digitalisation process consists in a post processing of hand drawn maps it includes a structuring of the information clarifying of concepts removing relations that are double counted revising incoherencies encountered and the translation of the causal diagrams into matrices 2 2 7 storylines and analysis to complement the maps the accompanying narratives are captured in order to do this the transcripts of the interviews are used to develop two types of accompanying documents for each meeting the storyline provides a summary of resilience mechanisms as uncovered in the original interview and the analysis provides information about i the analysts interpretation of debated topics that are seen as potentially valuable points to further explore content and ii methodological fcm related issues that may have been encountered during each interview methodology appendix a4 2 2 8 comparing resilience maps the analysis of multiple perspectives of resilience is obtained by comparing maps and storylines across interviews and by disentangling various resilience and vulnerability propagation mechanisms as elicited by the participants we initially identify main themes that were discussed in all interviews each map is then screened for concepts that relate to each of these themes so that resilience variables can be grouped accordingly any new theme that is not previously listed and that surfaces through the single map analysis can be added for each resilience theme the analyst then identifies common and divergent mechanisms at work in the different resilience perspectives within and across maps 3 results 3 1 belfast case study in our case study 15 mapping sessions were conducted with a total of 31 internal and external participants from different backgrounds and areas of responsibility appendix a2 the mapping sessions took place during november 2018 the analyst needed to clarify the methodology to agents as these were often more familiar with process engineering diagrams rather than with causal diagrams the analyst also invited participants to elaborate further on their explanations to be able to capture their rationale recordings and transcripts ensured that the original information could be accessed when processing the data the analyst worked with the resulting maps appendix a3 narratives and storylines appendix a4 in parallel in order to clarify resilience mechanisms and to analyse core themes as well as similarities and differences between resilience discourses that are examined in section 3 2 3 2 emerging resilience themes in belfast in this section we examine what kind of information our suggested approach allows to reveal in our analysis of resilience issues with regard to wastewater management specific to the belfast area we identify and explore in the next paragraphs seven relevant resilience themes in each subsection we disentangle similarities and divergences across maps we additionally explore the interconnectivity among themes 3 2 1 capacity in belfast capacity emerges as a central cross cutting issue touching upon the different aspects of resilience illustratively map 10 fig 1 displays typical capacity limitations that are usually considered in the wastewater system drainage capacity and wastewater treatment plant capacity in terms of volume and quality it specifically relates capacity with investment for storm tanks maintenance of ageing assets to avoid sewer blockages and technology to improve effluent quality and monitoring in other maps participants related capacity to other complementary issues that are further elaborated in other sections they include divergent interests and a lack of alignment among governmental departments that may generate inefficiencies see section 3 2 3 the misuse of sewers that create frequent blockages and opportunity costs for the utility as well as illegal discharges into sewers and water bodies see section 3 2 4 the capacity to meet standards see section 3 2 5 skills and labour capacity that may put service delivery at risk and slow down innovation see section 3 2 6 various insights on unintended consequences are obtained firstly incineration effluents of sludge treatment can potentially put a wastewater treatment plant at risk of insufficient capacity map 5 secondly as a consequence of shutting down frequently spilling combined sewer overflows more water is diverted to treatment plants exacerbating the capacity of networks and treatment map 5 thirdly as improvements in treatment efficiency lead to better effluent quality regulations may be further tightened which puts additional pressure on the utility map 1 lastly increased drainage and treatment capacity is considered to allow for economic growth which is commonly regarded as a driver of social welfare however economic development can have major consequences on the production of wastewater as well as on the acceleration of storm water runoff through increased soil imperviousness map 11 this then reduces drainage and treatment capacity map 2 eventually putting a strain on development objectives map 8 map 13 map 14 such negative feedbacks can also be envisaged alternatively if economic growth is oriented towards appropriate channelling of funding map 14 for example towards solutions such as sustainable urban drainage system suds then development constraints themselves can become opportunities for further economic growth map 7 the portfolio of interventions to increase capacity spans across various domains table 2 besides engineering and hard infrastructure solutions soft interventions emerge to be equally important examples include the value of human capital in order to retain fundamental knowledge in the company map 4 and policy alignment to foster coherent policies in separate departments 3 2 2 costs finance and investment limited funding in the belfast wastewater sector has been historically leading to considerable investment needs map 15 narratives to address these the living with water programme lwwp has recently proposed a drainage and wastewater investment programme with a budget of approximatively 900 m over the next 10 years map 12 its objectives are to reduce the flooding risk in belfast comply with environmental legislation for example the urban wastewater treatment directive and the water framework directive and enable regional growth that has been constrained due to a lack of drainage and treatment capacity ten out of 15 maps acknowledge funding and investment as a central component for resilience map 1 map 2 map 3 map 5 map 6 map 8 map 10 map 12 map 13 map 15 the wastewater sector is highly capital intensive and constantly forced to keep pace with change firstly urban development puts the wastewater sector under pressure because of the associated increasing sewer and drainage capacity requirements see section 3 2 1 secondly the wastewater sector needs to permanently adapt to tightening discharge standards map 1 map 5 map 10 map 11 see section 3 2 5 this involves a complex dynamic between how fast the capacity requirements of the wastewater sector can react to changing demands from economic growth and shifting societal behaviour and norms at the same time the frequent drain blockages generate recurrent repair interventions in the city map 3 map 11 map 12 which represent a high opportunity cost in terms of regular base maintenance map 11 it was highlighted that as a state owned company regulated by a regional economic regulator the utility ni water has little financial autonomy on budgets and decisions regarding total capital and operational expenditures totex capex and opex as well as on salary levels see section 3 2 6 according to some interviewees there is also a strong political barrier regarding the introduction of sewage and water charges that could reduce wastewater volumes due to lower water consumption see section 3 2 3 alternatively some participants argued that even when the utility does not get all the funding it requests the most important investments usually do get funded and that together with re prioritisation map 12 narratives as well as risk management the highest possible value for the money invested can be obtained map 13 narratives other participants identified drivers that can facilitate a more effective use of available funds map 9 it was argued that accurate information map 9 network data map 6 and monitoring map 10 may demand some initial financial support map 10 but in turn may improve justification for funding requirements and therefore facilitate budget approval in other maps interdepartmental policy alignment and collaboration are seen as levers to optimise the use of funding map 2 map 8 map 12 see section 3 2 3 3 2 3 governance and legal capacity policy alignment and cooperation between governmental departments was mentioned in many interviews as crucial for improving resilience it was argued that cooperation favours coherent decision making among policy departments leads to a more effective use of funding as well as to incentives that foster a more responsible use of water resources and assets the recent lwwp was seen as successful in addressing this issue because it takes a basin wide perspective for drainage and deliberately set up a board of various governmental authorities that are committed to working together cooperation between governmental departments was deemed important to foster a common understanding of problems and identification of adequate solutions map 9 narratives in this way synergies and economies of scale may be generated through a more effective use of funding maps 3 9 11 12 examples include river desilting by the department for rivers would reduce flooding map 3 which would provide ni water with additional discharge capacity into natural water bodies map 11 narratives cooperation between the urban planning and rivers departments to prevent new urban developments in flood risk areas map 12 appropriate desilting of sewers by road services would reduce maintenance costs for ni water map 3 the need for integrated catchment wide water quality control was identified especially the recognition of diffuse pollution from agricultural land use map 11 sharing the burden with the agriculture sector could release pressure on the utility with a positive impact on water quality compliance map 9 the environment as well as on human health and wellbeing map 11 policy alignment and collaboration would also facilitate the identification of appropriate incentives for wastewater management as well as negative externalities that can arise from other socio economic sectors for example wastewater services provided to residential users are financed through general taxes this means that customers may not be aware of the value provided by the services and that there are no explicit stimuli that promote a responsible water consumption however although water charges could sensitise customers to an appropriate use of the wastewater system through lower water consumption it was argued such charges have always been unpopular in northern ireland map 2 narratives map 6 see section 3 2 4 in addition many participants identified that political will resistance to change and civil responsibility are part of more complex societal processes that eventually affect the resilience of the wastewater system as an example we illustrate map 6 fig 2 in which such dynamics are made explicit for instance legislation developed at higher levels of governance paves the way to social responsibility of individuals on the one hand and to coherent policies within governmental and non governmental bodies on the other hand map 6 map 9 map 12 in northern ireland the current absence of a functional government map 2 map 6 map 8 confers little credibility regarding the scope of policy to address the public interest map 6 narratives and this in turn provides little motivation for individuals to change behaviours besides it was also stressed that ni water depends on decisions taken at higher political levels its competitiveness relies on budgets and salary regulations decided by the central government which provides limited autonomy and thus limited space for innovation within the water utility map 6 such influences of decisions at higher governance levels also become visible with the brexit process which increases uncertainties about ni water s logistical procurement modalities and costs map 2 in other maps participants argued that governance can also be driven by individual action this may be influenced by a societal context with increased public awareness about the imperatives of protecting natural resources and in which preferences of socially responsible individuals and businesses prevail in this perspective the voice of individuals plays a crucial role in striving for policy changes map 2 a counter example was illustrated by the challenges of implementing suds currently there is no clear assignment of responsibility for their maintenance map 8 though suds should increase resilience in theory they may therefore end up introducing new vulnerabilities map 8 see section 3 2 7 3 2 4 customer behaviour and responsibility the misuse of sewers was identified as a core vulnerability in belfast s wastewater system map 1 map 11 blockages are frequent due to inadequate amounts and types of solids in the network such as fats oils and greases fogs or inappropriate materials the system is not designed to cope with baby wipes clothes or kitchen paper this was mentioned to be caused by a lack of awareness of the general public the misuse of sewers often leads to in street or out of sewer flooding and to combined sewer overflow discharges that pollute water bodies participants highlighted that in northern ireland there are issues of illegal discharges into the sewer network and also directly into the environment these come either from industries searching to reduce costs or from illegal activities in northern ireland high electricity costs and taxes do not incentivise industries to discharge wastewater correctly map 1 neither does the absence of awareness about the impact of such discharges map 1 map 2 map 6 map 1 map 11 map 13 interviewees reckoned that not all hotels or fast food chains would make the effort of legal discharges if more convenient otherwise even if discharges were free of charge map 1 in northern ireland there is also illicit diesel produced through a transformation of agricultural diesel toxic by products stemming from this illegal activity are released into the environment or into sewers conversely it was argued that individual behaviours can also positively influence and promote legal changes through civil engagements lobbies and the media map 2 see section 3 2 3 3 2 5 standards and compliance tightening of environmental standards were identified as a potential vulnerability for the utility as changes in standards can often occur at a faster pace than the infrastructure upgrades of wastewater facilities at the same time population growth and development make it more and more difficult to maintain the required thresholds the associated increased likelihood of non compliance can eventually lead to development constraints map 9 or to legal prosecution of the utility map 1 map 5 map 15 this leads to a permanent pressure on the utility to keep up with increasing demands map 13 see section 3 2 1 it was observed that both worsening and improving surface water quality can trigger a tightening of standards standards may tighten even if the performance of water utilities in terms of the quality of their final effluent increases as water companies are expected to further improve on their performance map 1 this constitutes an unintended consequence for the water utility as by performing well it puts further pressure on operations to address increasing expectations this is especially relevant in a catchment with sensitive water bodies such as belfast 3 2 6 human capital continued high quality delivery of wastewater services relies heavily on human capital with about 30 of ni water personnel expected to leave the utility in the next ten years the company faces potential vulnerabilities in terms of human resources map 4 narratives and fig 3 according to the interviewees the company needs to prepare for substantial changes on the one hand the ageing workforce at ni water and a competitive labour market with high turnover rates among new employees may trigger a loss of skills and knowledge within the company map 4 this was said to particularly affect the wastewater side of the company as its ageing profile is higher than average on the other hand senior workers may become less familiar with new technologies leading to barriers in their implementation and maintenance in this regard suds are already seen as a barrier for resilience see section 3 2 7 because they require a different expertise compared to historical drainage infrastructure map 12 however the participants also identified drivers beyond the control of the company for instance the brexit process may limit the company s access to skilled labour map 2 ni water is also limited by the public sector pay agreement and decisions at central government reducing leeway to increase the competitiveness of salaries within the company map 4 participants provided the example of difficulties in recruiting electricians at ni water because the company could not offer sufficiently competitive salaries phased retirement policies training of new and young workers career development plans and school campaigns to attract students into a diverse employment pool for ni water were suggested as interventions to address this potential brain drain within the utility 3 2 7 knowledge and uncertainties the lack of knowledge and the uncertainties it creates were identified as a fundamental barrier to resilience in the wastewater sector map 9 particularly unpacks this theme in more detail participants suggested that uncertainties about local climate change impacts economic development as well as lack of sewer network data hinder the appropriate assessment of network needs map 9 participants pointed to trade offs between drainage and treatment capacity that need to be well understood in order to make optimal investment decisions on storm water separation vs treatment capacity if there are higher expenditures on discharge arrangements in the catchment implying longer outfall and different discharge points more water can be captured and less water may need to be drained and treated conversely reduced discharge arrangements require to increase drainage and treatment capacity however there are deemed to be insufficient drainage area studies and models that can inform such decisions this applies also to diffuse pollution water bodies are polluted not only by wastewater effluents but also by road and agricultural drainage thus accurate knowledge of the sources and pathways of pollution are deemed to be required map 9 map 11 uncertainties were also linked to political processes such as the outcomes of the brexit negotiations map 2 map 11 see section 3 2 3 ultimately the lack of information and knowledge can lead to cascading vulnerabilities inaccurate information may lead to resilience deficiency of solutions entailing for example increased energy consumption sub optimal investment decisions see section 3 2 2 non compliance with requested water quality standards see section 3 2 5 lower capacity to cope with exceedance see section 3 2 1 or a degradation in wellbeing and human health map 9 it was argued that in the face of new societal challenges like climate change innovation uptake is required for resilient solutions map 6 yet technological transition periods are inherently associated with uncertainty for instance despite promising results in terms of flood risk reduction there is currently uncertainty about the effectiveness of suds in northern ireland map 8 given the multitude of typologies and settings of suds these may require a shift in expertise of water utility staff as well as real estate developers accompanied by increased funds compared to what has traditionally been done map 12 see sections 3 2 3 and 3 2 6 3 3 participant feedback questions and observations from participants provided insight into some of the methodological issues linked to fcm 3 3 1 weighting of connections one of the most frequent issues raised concerned the quantitative scoring process of fcm in some instances the interpretation of the weights was not clear in such cases the analyst suggested participants to subjectively define the strength of relationships according to their own experience and knowledge and provide their rationale as proposed by the interview guidelines appendix a1 in some cases the weights were interpreted by participants as being dynamic or conditional upon circumstances in other cases questions were raised as to whether the weights should reflect the current situation in the belfast area or what should occur in an ideal case participants recognised the subjectivity of the process as well as their imperfect knowledge about specific weights for example participants were uncertain about the role of wastewater services for the global attractiveness of the city or the consequences of pollution on human health similarly some interviewees considered the effectiveness of specific interventions to be uncertain such as the effects of human resource policies within the water utility policy change at governmental levels or the awareness campaigns to change customers behaviour different interpretations of scores were also related to the temporal and spatial scales that resilience drivers refer to for example while some argue that there is a strong link between wastewater treatment and greenhouse gas emissions other participants consider the impact negligible because belfast s wastewater system contributes little to global emissions the two interpretations reflect different but equally legitimate cognitive reasonings of the participants there is a priori no reason to discard either of them providing the accompanying storylines appendix a4 can help in reducing such ambiguities 3 3 2 complexity and limitations of fcm structure the bulk of resilience concepts and connections that were expressed during the interviews could be drawn as networks in some cases however conditionality dynamics non monotonous relations that were touched upon during interviews could not be mapped and needed to be reflected in the storylines appendix a4 3 3 3 consensual and conflicting issues within group sessions we did not experience conflicting issues we attribute this to having nominated the participants together with ni water senior managers selecting participants within current working teams however when comparing the perspectives across interviews we identified cases with divergent views this was observed for example around the issue of who holds the responsibility of water pollution depending on the interview this could be the water utility farming individual customers decision makers within the agricultural department or policy makers at other levels of governance a second example with conflicting views was the question about the sufficiency of funding or the necessity to better manage granted funds a third example was the issue about who should be responsible for suds implementation 4 discussion in this study we propose a new approach that systematically screens for sources of vulnerability and simultaneously identifies resilience interventions we believe this approach to be useful as it integrates a wide range of perspectives to identify possible vulnerabilities as well as resilience actions in a wastewater utility that could not be easily detected with purely quantitative methods 4 1 complementary views and the value of subjectivity as from our experience in belfast resilience was usually better understood by participants through its vulnerability lens this suggests that for wastewater practitioners the academic divide between natural sciences resilience lens and social sciences vulnerability lens actually represents two complementary facets of the same coin for the wastewater practitioners resilience was perceived not to be necessarily associated to extreme conditions but to drivers related to daily practice including for instance governance human capital and civil responsibility failures in these domains may amplify failures of the wastewater system under extreme events we here sought to move beyond the different existing definitions of resilience that exist in the literature juan garcía et al 2017 and elicit subjective views of what resilience implies for different actors eliciting diverse views allows us to capture topics and reveal connections that are not necessarily obtained by single and tightly defined impressions by consensual perspectives or by quantitative approaches of resilience carpenter et al 2009 oppenheimer et al 2007 in such approaches concepts such as political will and civil responsibility could be difficult to capture ultimately the resulting wide range of resilience perspectives obtained can be used to screen for issues that warrant a more detailed exploration using traditional quantitative assessments based on statistical analysis or phenomenological modelling resilience views are necessarily those of the participating agents our outcomes therefore are a reflection of the choice of the interviewees thus it is important to be explicit and transparent about which agents were selected and why appendix a2 this selection should be done together with the final beneficiary of the study for example the senior management of the wastewater utility despite this subjectivity the approach is open in that it allows for addition of further participants to include more backgrounds and hierarchical levels 4 2 sensing complexity the approach develops a network view of a complex system the building blocks are simple cause to effect relationships revealed by the reasoning of participants in this way they are able to develop a complex model which could not be held in the mind in its entirety studying such a network provides the possibility to better appreciate how interventions may propagate in unexpected ways and produce feedbacks by revealing interconnectivity the methodology can also uncover potential unintended consequences which may be central in determining whether interventions increase resilience globally or whether it improves it in one domain while reducing it in others because of fcm limitations in capturing dynamic non monotonous and conditional relations we propose that the maps should necessarily be evaluated together with the accompanying narratives which provide the rationales for the choices made when drawing the maps 4 3 reflectiveness inclusiveness and integration we regard this participatory process as leading towards a more reflective inclusive and integrated view of resilience compared to existing resilience approaches table 1 it is reflective and inclusive in that it reflects on experiences and knowledge of a variety of actors it recognises resilience perspectives across hierarchical levels as equally legitimate to be accounted for it is also integrated because it considers wastewater management as part of a more complex urban system in which multiple domains interact for instance we find that resilience in the wastewater sector may be strongly influenced by issues in water supply agriculture and in political and cultural domains which are often underrepresented in technical resilience studies 4 4 transferability and flexibility of approach the flexibility of this approach allows for transferability to other locations zooming in and out to different levels of detail and aspects of the water system importantly as resilience perspectives are a reflection of the knowledge of participants the application of our approach to different sites will naturally highlight different dominating themes than those encountered in belfast thereby the approach simultaneously addresses the need for a standard framework with the necessity of being case specific making possible comparisons between cases juan garcía et al 2017 by linking sources of vulnerability with drivers of resilience the methodology illustrates perceived relationships between stressors impacts and interventions which makes it intuitively applicable by practitioners by doing this the approach can also be used to operationalise other existing frameworks such as the safe to fail framework developed by butler et al 2016 4 5 ancillary benefits and implications for practice the suggested approach can empower the involved participants to better appreciate the complexity of the system they work in and may improve the communication between departments with different interests and perspectives in our study both strategic and operation managers mentioned the benefits of such an exercise as the participants reflect on their system in a way they are not accustomed to do the results consisting of maps and narratives may be used to inform and initiate discussions between department heads risk and asset managers of water utilities as well as their external partners such as funders regulators or associated departments transport agriculture energy etc it might prove to be especially useful for studying nexus issues for instance when addressing complexities at catchment level it might prove equally beneficial to employ it as a monitoring tool by repeating the screening process periodically with changing agents we deem this type of exercise to be a useful precursor to the identification of specific issues of concern that may then be studied in more detail with more traditional quantitative methods 5 conclusions taking a systems perspective we suggested a new methodology to capture a wide spectrum of different understandings and interpretations of resilience in a wastewater system in an engagement process with practitioners cognitive maps were elicited the methodology reveals major drivers of vulnerability their propagation mechanisms and identifies resilience measures we believe that this vulnerability screening approach can support directors risk and asset managers of wastewater utilities to identify interventions from an integrated system perspective our approach facilitated a participatory process that is reflective capturing reflexions of practitioners in a discussion with the analyst inclusive that includes internal and external participants with diverse responsibilities and integrated that enables to account for feedbacks to and from other departments of the water utility and in interrelation to larger urban resources and networks such as legal social and governance systems the questionnaire used for this assessment can be adapted for studying other issues at different spatial scales levels of detail and domains in the water sector for instance in the context of pollutants of emerging concern this approach may be useful to decision makers for risk screening including the identification of different issues of concern shared or conflicting points of view feedbacks to and from other systems including detecting unintended consequences of measures that may increase resilience in one sector while reducing it in another the methodology with the resulting maps and narratives can be a useful precursor to more quantitative and detailed resilience assessments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this study was undertaken within the european project alice accelerating innovation in urban

17900,resilience has become a regulatory concept influencing investment decisions in the water and wastewater sector however current assessments predominantly focus on technical resilience and on engineering solutions here we propose an alternative more holistic approach that captures multiple perspectives of resilience by eliciting and comparing cognitive maps of diverse agents both from within as well as external to a wastewater utility we use fuzzy cognitive mapping as a practical tool to elicit subjective views on resilience mechanisms and illustrate the methodology in co production with professionals from the wastewater sector in the belfast area northern ireland we find that the proposed participatory process facilitates a more reflective inclusive and integrated assessment than current approaches screening for risks and vulnerabilities using this new approach can foster an integrated system perspective by i systematically identifying connections between sub systems which are normally assessed separately ii detecting feedbacks between system components which may reveal unintended consequences of resilience interventions and by iii obtaining a wider portfolio of potential interventions to increase overall resilience we conclude that the suggested approach may be useful for strategic planning purposes within a utility and for improving cross departmental communication among both internal and external agents graphical abstract image 1 keywords resilience risk screening vulnerability co production cognitive maps wastewater management 1 introduction resilience has been at the centre of recent reflections on sustainability in the water and wastewater sector it expands the usual scope of service reliability under standard loading to exceptional low probability high impact events which have traditionally been neglected butler et al 2016 the concept of resilience has become increasingly popular and is used in investment decisions however the focus of resilience in the water and wastewater industry is still predominantly technical in nature mullin and kirchhoff 2018 in addition despite interdisciplinary ambitions of the resilience community the scientific literature shows that there are important dialectical forces at play between the natural engineering sciences resilience and the social sciences vulnerability that are shaped by different world views and interpretations olsson et al 2015 the distinction between engineering resilience which aims at maintaining efficiency of functions and ecological resilience which aims at maintaining existence of functions are so fundamental that they can become alternative paradigms whose devotees reflect traditions of a discipline or of an attitude rather than a reality of nature holling 1996 similarly resilience has different meanings in wastewater management depending on the specific domain and objective it is applied to juan garcía et al 2017 in this paper we intend to move beyond the variety of definitions that exist in the literature juan garcía et al 2017 and do not seek a precise definition of resilience at the onset of our study we are interested in revealing how wastewater management practitioners perceive vulnerabilities and resilience of the wastewater system they are working in our goal is twofold firstly to propose to practitioners a methodology that contributes to a better understanding of the wastewater system under study bringing together various points of view that usually do not meet secondly to contribute to addressing some of the gaps that juan garcía et al 2017 identified in the wastewater sector table 1 to foster incorporation of resilience in wastewater management practice to do this we develop an approach in which starting from open ended questions we obtain cognitive maps in an engagement process with wastewater professionals cognitive maps are graphical illustrations of a person s internal associative representations gray et al 2015 these representations are elicited with logical structures such as causal diagrams we test this new approach for the belfast area with ni water northern ireland water where we obtain multiple perspectives of resilience informed by a wide range of agents both internal and external to the water utility our approach enables to identify opportunities for change conflicting issues as well as potential barriers and unintended consequences of resilience interventions which may not be revealed by more narrowly defined resilience perspectives it facilitates the development of a reflective inclusive and integrated view of resilience features that have been found to be largely missing in current practices juan garcía et al 2017 this permits to obtain a broader view in which human driven resilience complements technical resilience and in which different urban systems and resources are interlinked table 1 the holistic assessment therefore may uncover more meaningful resilience interventions that address vulnerabilities at their origin the methodology is intended for screening purposes prior to targeting specific resilience aspects with more technical and quantitative approaches including statistical and phenomenological modelling carpenter et al 2009 oppenheimer et al 2007 the following sections present our resilience screening approach section 2 and the results from its application to the belfast wastewater system section 3 section 4 discusses to what extent our study contributes to address some of the gaps identified in the literature and its potential value added for the water industry in general section 5 concludes with a summary of the main findings 2 methodology materials and case study with origins in cognitive psychology which studies human learning and behaviour cognitive maps are graphics for structuring and illustrating knowledge and beliefs gray et al 2014 cognitive maps are drawn around a specific question of interest by agents that are familiar with this domain thus participants can structure visualise and share their experience understanding and interpretation 2 1 fuzzy cognitive mapping fuzzy cognitive mapping fcm is an extension of cognitive maps characterised by the use of cause effect relationships to link cognitive concepts axelrod 1976 in addition fcm enables to indicate the perceived strength of cause to effect relations kosko 1986 including for complex and abstract variables such as responsibility or political will which may be difficult to quantify otherwise özesmi and özesmi 2004 fuzzy cognitive maps have been reported to be of particular interest in domains characterised by complexity vagueness uncertainty subjectivity and data scarcity gray et al 2014 as cognitive maps fcm allows to capture knowledge experience and beliefs from participants about the functioning of a specific system to make such implicit assumptions or mental models explicit jetter and kok 2014 this is done during interviews in which professionals identify core variables and their interrelations using causal diagrams participants characterise the influence of one variable onto another by assigning a positive or negative sign and a metric between 0 and 1 where 0 indicates no influence and 1 a very strong influence interviews are based on one or several open ended questions that are the leading thread through the entire mapping process the analyst s role is to guide the participants through the mapping exercise and mediate between the practical experience of practitioners and the requirements of the elicitation methodology participants take part in the process either in individual interviews or in working groups in the latter case participants discuss their views cause to effect relationships signs and strengths of each connection that altogether lead to a common model because there are no requirements on the interview question itself fcm is a flexible tool with many different possible applications beyond its initial use in the psychological realm fcm has also been applied to topics as varied as the potential deployment of photovoltaic solar panels jetter and schweinfort 2011 vulnerability assessments of livelihoods murungweni et al 2011 risk assessments medina and moreno 2007 including financial systemic risk mezei and sarlin 2016 environmental management applications and ecology mehryar et al 2017 özesmi and özesmi 2004 water resources management kafetzis et al 2014 and climate change research olazabal et al 2018 reckien 2014 2 2 a holistic resilience assessment approach 2 2 1 defining the objective and interview questions to set up the participatory experiment we design a questionnaire appendix a1 of the supplementary materials that seeks to address the problematic at hand while guiding the participants through the mapping process the development of the questions results from interactions with ni water senior managers and reflections about the focus and objective of our study on capturing multiple resilience perspectives and obtaining a broad set of potential interventions the interview guidelines address two questions that shall be elicited during the interviews question 1 according to your experience knowledge and expertise how are drivers and characteristics of the system affecting resilience of wastewater management at northern ireland water ni water for the belfast area in the short medium and long term question 2 according to your experience knowledge and expertise which interventions changes could increase resilience of wastewater management at ni water for the belfast area in the short medium and long term we deliberately chose to leave the system resilience and belfast area undefined with the intention that the participants specify boundaries and reveal their own interpretations of these concepts besides we introduce the notion of timescales short medium and long term in order to capture the widest possible range of resilience drivers that can be identified and reduce the bias towards short term priorities that professionals deal with on a daily basis 2 2 2 identifying relevant participants motivated by the idea of widening the range of resilience perspectives the aim is to conduct mapping sessions with representatives from all departments and several hierarchical levels of the wastewater utility in addition we identify principle agents as potential interviewees outside ni water in view of identifying relevant participants we conduct a series of preliminary meetings with the heads of departments at the water utility in some cases one professional is selected to represent a department and individual interviews are conducted in other cases several people representing different areas of responsibility within the same department are nominated to participate in a group interview 2 2 3 planning the mapping sessions we plan resilience mapping sessions to last 90 min with the interest of encouraging experts participation balancing their limited time availability with the need to introduce them to the methodology and develop the narratives and maps at the beginning of the mapping sessions the analyst needs to guide the participants step by step through the interview guidelines appendix a1 and to clarify any questions and doubts that arise during the interviews the analyst needs to assimilate as well as possible the knowledge of the participants and ensure it is correctly captured according to the requirements of the fcm methodology this necessarily demands a dialogue between the analyst and the participants 2 2 4 conducting mapping sessions mapping sessions are structured in three different phases olazabal et al 2018 see appendix a1 in the first phase participants are given time to individually brainstorm on the first interview question about drivers and characteristics of the system that affect resilience they are then invited to start drawing the map with one of the concepts they have identified and to add further concepts revealing the cascading cause to effect relations if participants do not feel comfortable with the drawing process the analyst can step in and draw the map based on the instructions of the participants the process finalises once participants feel they have covered all their concerns in the second phase the same process is followed with the second interview question on resilience interventions in the third phase interviewees are asked to reflect on the sign and strength of each connection the positive sign of a relationship refers to a positive influence of one variable on another variables move in the same direction while a negative sign means a negative influence variables move in opposite directions weights are proposed to be a decimal number on a scale between 0 and 1 referring to the strength of each cause to effect linkage between two variables 2 2 5 narratives of resilience maps to be able to capture the storyline revealed in the interview we solicited agreement from the participants to be able to voice record the sessions that are later transcribed by the analyst for confidentiality reasons these are not available to the reader these recordings and transcripts serve to develop a qualitative narrative that supplements the maps and facilitates comparison between them this also allows to obtain clarifications of elicited resilience drivers and rationales of system mechanisms and to revise maps if necessary 2 2 6 digitalisation of resilience maps the digitalisation process consists in a post processing of hand drawn maps it includes a structuring of the information clarifying of concepts removing relations that are double counted revising incoherencies encountered and the translation of the causal diagrams into matrices 2 2 7 storylines and analysis to complement the maps the accompanying narratives are captured in order to do this the transcripts of the interviews are used to develop two types of accompanying documents for each meeting the storyline provides a summary of resilience mechanisms as uncovered in the original interview and the analysis provides information about i the analysts interpretation of debated topics that are seen as potentially valuable points to further explore content and ii methodological fcm related issues that may have been encountered during each interview methodology appendix a4 2 2 8 comparing resilience maps the analysis of multiple perspectives of resilience is obtained by comparing maps and storylines across interviews and by disentangling various resilience and vulnerability propagation mechanisms as elicited by the participants we initially identify main themes that were discussed in all interviews each map is then screened for concepts that relate to each of these themes so that resilience variables can be grouped accordingly any new theme that is not previously listed and that surfaces through the single map analysis can be added for each resilience theme the analyst then identifies common and divergent mechanisms at work in the different resilience perspectives within and across maps 3 results 3 1 belfast case study in our case study 15 mapping sessions were conducted with a total of 31 internal and external participants from different backgrounds and areas of responsibility appendix a2 the mapping sessions took place during november 2018 the analyst needed to clarify the methodology to agents as these were often more familiar with process engineering diagrams rather than with causal diagrams the analyst also invited participants to elaborate further on their explanations to be able to capture their rationale recordings and transcripts ensured that the original information could be accessed when processing the data the analyst worked with the resulting maps appendix a3 narratives and storylines appendix a4 in parallel in order to clarify resilience mechanisms and to analyse core themes as well as similarities and differences between resilience discourses that are examined in section 3 2 3 2 emerging resilience themes in belfast in this section we examine what kind of information our suggested approach allows to reveal in our analysis of resilience issues with regard to wastewater management specific to the belfast area we identify and explore in the next paragraphs seven relevant resilience themes in each subsection we disentangle similarities and divergences across maps we additionally explore the interconnectivity among themes 3 2 1 capacity in belfast capacity emerges as a central cross cutting issue touching upon the different aspects of resilience illustratively map 10 fig 1 displays typical capacity limitations that are usually considered in the wastewater system drainage capacity and wastewater treatment plant capacity in terms of volume and quality it specifically relates capacity with investment for storm tanks maintenance of ageing assets to avoid sewer blockages and technology to improve effluent quality and monitoring in other maps participants related capacity to other complementary issues that are further elaborated in other sections they include divergent interests and a lack of alignment among governmental departments that may generate inefficiencies see section 3 2 3 the misuse of sewers that create frequent blockages and opportunity costs for the utility as well as illegal discharges into sewers and water bodies see section 3 2 4 the capacity to meet standards see section 3 2 5 skills and labour capacity that may put service delivery at risk and slow down innovation see section 3 2 6 various insights on unintended consequences are obtained firstly incineration effluents of sludge treatment can potentially put a wastewater treatment plant at risk of insufficient capacity map 5 secondly as a consequence of shutting down frequently spilling combined sewer overflows more water is diverted to treatment plants exacerbating the capacity of networks and treatment map 5 thirdly as improvements in treatment efficiency lead to better effluent quality regulations may be further tightened which puts additional pressure on the utility map 1 lastly increased drainage and treatment capacity is considered to allow for economic growth which is commonly regarded as a driver of social welfare however economic development can have major consequences on the production of wastewater as well as on the acceleration of storm water runoff through increased soil imperviousness map 11 this then reduces drainage and treatment capacity map 2 eventually putting a strain on development objectives map 8 map 13 map 14 such negative feedbacks can also be envisaged alternatively if economic growth is oriented towards appropriate channelling of funding map 14 for example towards solutions such as sustainable urban drainage system suds then development constraints themselves can become opportunities for further economic growth map 7 the portfolio of interventions to increase capacity spans across various domains table 2 besides engineering and hard infrastructure solutions soft interventions emerge to be equally important examples include the value of human capital in order to retain fundamental knowledge in the company map 4 and policy alignment to foster coherent policies in separate departments 3 2 2 costs finance and investment limited funding in the belfast wastewater sector has been historically leading to considerable investment needs map 15 narratives to address these the living with water programme lwwp has recently proposed a drainage and wastewater investment programme with a budget of approximatively 900 m over the next 10 years map 12 its objectives are to reduce the flooding risk in belfast comply with environmental legislation for example the urban wastewater treatment directive and the water framework directive and enable regional growth that has been constrained due to a lack of drainage and treatment capacity ten out of 15 maps acknowledge funding and investment as a central component for resilience map 1 map 2 map 3 map 5 map 6 map 8 map 10 map 12 map 13 map 15 the wastewater sector is highly capital intensive and constantly forced to keep pace with change firstly urban development puts the wastewater sector under pressure because of the associated increasing sewer and drainage capacity requirements see section 3 2 1 secondly the wastewater sector needs to permanently adapt to tightening discharge standards map 1 map 5 map 10 map 11 see section 3 2 5 this involves a complex dynamic between how fast the capacity requirements of the wastewater sector can react to changing demands from economic growth and shifting societal behaviour and norms at the same time the frequent drain blockages generate recurrent repair interventions in the city map 3 map 11 map 12 which represent a high opportunity cost in terms of regular base maintenance map 11 it was highlighted that as a state owned company regulated by a regional economic regulator the utility ni water has little financial autonomy on budgets and decisions regarding total capital and operational expenditures totex capex and opex as well as on salary levels see section 3 2 6 according to some interviewees there is also a strong political barrier regarding the introduction of sewage and water charges that could reduce wastewater volumes due to lower water consumption see section 3 2 3 alternatively some participants argued that even when the utility does not get all the funding it requests the most important investments usually do get funded and that together with re prioritisation map 12 narratives as well as risk management the highest possible value for the money invested can be obtained map 13 narratives other participants identified drivers that can facilitate a more effective use of available funds map 9 it was argued that accurate information map 9 network data map 6 and monitoring map 10 may demand some initial financial support map 10 but in turn may improve justification for funding requirements and therefore facilitate budget approval in other maps interdepartmental policy alignment and collaboration are seen as levers to optimise the use of funding map 2 map 8 map 12 see section 3 2 3 3 2 3 governance and legal capacity policy alignment and cooperation between governmental departments was mentioned in many interviews as crucial for improving resilience it was argued that cooperation favours coherent decision making among policy departments leads to a more effective use of funding as well as to incentives that foster a more responsible use of water resources and assets the recent lwwp was seen as successful in addressing this issue because it takes a basin wide perspective for drainage and deliberately set up a board of various governmental authorities that are committed to working together cooperation between governmental departments was deemed important to foster a common understanding of problems and identification of adequate solutions map 9 narratives in this way synergies and economies of scale may be generated through a more effective use of funding maps 3 9 11 12 examples include river desilting by the department for rivers would reduce flooding map 3 which would provide ni water with additional discharge capacity into natural water bodies map 11 narratives cooperation between the urban planning and rivers departments to prevent new urban developments in flood risk areas map 12 appropriate desilting of sewers by road services would reduce maintenance costs for ni water map 3 the need for integrated catchment wide water quality control was identified especially the recognition of diffuse pollution from agricultural land use map 11 sharing the burden with the agriculture sector could release pressure on the utility with a positive impact on water quality compliance map 9 the environment as well as on human health and wellbeing map 11 policy alignment and collaboration would also facilitate the identification of appropriate incentives for wastewater management as well as negative externalities that can arise from other socio economic sectors for example wastewater services provided to residential users are financed through general taxes this means that customers may not be aware of the value provided by the services and that there are no explicit stimuli that promote a responsible water consumption however although water charges could sensitise customers to an appropriate use of the wastewater system through lower water consumption it was argued such charges have always been unpopular in northern ireland map 2 narratives map 6 see section 3 2 4 in addition many participants identified that political will resistance to change and civil responsibility are part of more complex societal processes that eventually affect the resilience of the wastewater system as an example we illustrate map 6 fig 2 in which such dynamics are made explicit for instance legislation developed at higher levels of governance paves the way to social responsibility of individuals on the one hand and to coherent policies within governmental and non governmental bodies on the other hand map 6 map 9 map 12 in northern ireland the current absence of a functional government map 2 map 6 map 8 confers little credibility regarding the scope of policy to address the public interest map 6 narratives and this in turn provides little motivation for individuals to change behaviours besides it was also stressed that ni water depends on decisions taken at higher political levels its competitiveness relies on budgets and salary regulations decided by the central government which provides limited autonomy and thus limited space for innovation within the water utility map 6 such influences of decisions at higher governance levels also become visible with the brexit process which increases uncertainties about ni water s logistical procurement modalities and costs map 2 in other maps participants argued that governance can also be driven by individual action this may be influenced by a societal context with increased public awareness about the imperatives of protecting natural resources and in which preferences of socially responsible individuals and businesses prevail in this perspective the voice of individuals plays a crucial role in striving for policy changes map 2 a counter example was illustrated by the challenges of implementing suds currently there is no clear assignment of responsibility for their maintenance map 8 though suds should increase resilience in theory they may therefore end up introducing new vulnerabilities map 8 see section 3 2 7 3 2 4 customer behaviour and responsibility the misuse of sewers was identified as a core vulnerability in belfast s wastewater system map 1 map 11 blockages are frequent due to inadequate amounts and types of solids in the network such as fats oils and greases fogs or inappropriate materials the system is not designed to cope with baby wipes clothes or kitchen paper this was mentioned to be caused by a lack of awareness of the general public the misuse of sewers often leads to in street or out of sewer flooding and to combined sewer overflow discharges that pollute water bodies participants highlighted that in northern ireland there are issues of illegal discharges into the sewer network and also directly into the environment these come either from industries searching to reduce costs or from illegal activities in northern ireland high electricity costs and taxes do not incentivise industries to discharge wastewater correctly map 1 neither does the absence of awareness about the impact of such discharges map 1 map 2 map 6 map 1 map 11 map 13 interviewees reckoned that not all hotels or fast food chains would make the effort of legal discharges if more convenient otherwise even if discharges were free of charge map 1 in northern ireland there is also illicit diesel produced through a transformation of agricultural diesel toxic by products stemming from this illegal activity are released into the environment or into sewers conversely it was argued that individual behaviours can also positively influence and promote legal changes through civil engagements lobbies and the media map 2 see section 3 2 3 3 2 5 standards and compliance tightening of environmental standards were identified as a potential vulnerability for the utility as changes in standards can often occur at a faster pace than the infrastructure upgrades of wastewater facilities at the same time population growth and development make it more and more difficult to maintain the required thresholds the associated increased likelihood of non compliance can eventually lead to development constraints map 9 or to legal prosecution of the utility map 1 map 5 map 15 this leads to a permanent pressure on the utility to keep up with increasing demands map 13 see section 3 2 1 it was observed that both worsening and improving surface water quality can trigger a tightening of standards standards may tighten even if the performance of water utilities in terms of the quality of their final effluent increases as water companies are expected to further improve on their performance map 1 this constitutes an unintended consequence for the water utility as by performing well it puts further pressure on operations to address increasing expectations this is especially relevant in a catchment with sensitive water bodies such as belfast 3 2 6 human capital continued high quality delivery of wastewater services relies heavily on human capital with about 30 of ni water personnel expected to leave the utility in the next ten years the company faces potential vulnerabilities in terms of human resources map 4 narratives and fig 3 according to the interviewees the company needs to prepare for substantial changes on the one hand the ageing workforce at ni water and a competitive labour market with high turnover rates among new employees may trigger a loss of skills and knowledge within the company map 4 this was said to particularly affect the wastewater side of the company as its ageing profile is higher than average on the other hand senior workers may become less familiar with new technologies leading to barriers in their implementation and maintenance in this regard suds are already seen as a barrier for resilience see section 3 2 7 because they require a different expertise compared to historical drainage infrastructure map 12 however the participants also identified drivers beyond the control of the company for instance the brexit process may limit the company s access to skilled labour map 2 ni water is also limited by the public sector pay agreement and decisions at central government reducing leeway to increase the competitiveness of salaries within the company map 4 participants provided the example of difficulties in recruiting electricians at ni water because the company could not offer sufficiently competitive salaries phased retirement policies training of new and young workers career development plans and school campaigns to attract students into a diverse employment pool for ni water were suggested as interventions to address this potential brain drain within the utility 3 2 7 knowledge and uncertainties the lack of knowledge and the uncertainties it creates were identified as a fundamental barrier to resilience in the wastewater sector map 9 particularly unpacks this theme in more detail participants suggested that uncertainties about local climate change impacts economic development as well as lack of sewer network data hinder the appropriate assessment of network needs map 9 participants pointed to trade offs between drainage and treatment capacity that need to be well understood in order to make optimal investment decisions on storm water separation vs treatment capacity if there are higher expenditures on discharge arrangements in the catchment implying longer outfall and different discharge points more water can be captured and less water may need to be drained and treated conversely reduced discharge arrangements require to increase drainage and treatment capacity however there are deemed to be insufficient drainage area studies and models that can inform such decisions this applies also to diffuse pollution water bodies are polluted not only by wastewater effluents but also by road and agricultural drainage thus accurate knowledge of the sources and pathways of pollution are deemed to be required map 9 map 11 uncertainties were also linked to political processes such as the outcomes of the brexit negotiations map 2 map 11 see section 3 2 3 ultimately the lack of information and knowledge can lead to cascading vulnerabilities inaccurate information may lead to resilience deficiency of solutions entailing for example increased energy consumption sub optimal investment decisions see section 3 2 2 non compliance with requested water quality standards see section 3 2 5 lower capacity to cope with exceedance see section 3 2 1 or a degradation in wellbeing and human health map 9 it was argued that in the face of new societal challenges like climate change innovation uptake is required for resilient solutions map 6 yet technological transition periods are inherently associated with uncertainty for instance despite promising results in terms of flood risk reduction there is currently uncertainty about the effectiveness of suds in northern ireland map 8 given the multitude of typologies and settings of suds these may require a shift in expertise of water utility staff as well as real estate developers accompanied by increased funds compared to what has traditionally been done map 12 see sections 3 2 3 and 3 2 6 3 3 participant feedback questions and observations from participants provided insight into some of the methodological issues linked to fcm 3 3 1 weighting of connections one of the most frequent issues raised concerned the quantitative scoring process of fcm in some instances the interpretation of the weights was not clear in such cases the analyst suggested participants to subjectively define the strength of relationships according to their own experience and knowledge and provide their rationale as proposed by the interview guidelines appendix a1 in some cases the weights were interpreted by participants as being dynamic or conditional upon circumstances in other cases questions were raised as to whether the weights should reflect the current situation in the belfast area or what should occur in an ideal case participants recognised the subjectivity of the process as well as their imperfect knowledge about specific weights for example participants were uncertain about the role of wastewater services for the global attractiveness of the city or the consequences of pollution on human health similarly some interviewees considered the effectiveness of specific interventions to be uncertain such as the effects of human resource policies within the water utility policy change at governmental levels or the awareness campaigns to change customers behaviour different interpretations of scores were also related to the temporal and spatial scales that resilience drivers refer to for example while some argue that there is a strong link between wastewater treatment and greenhouse gas emissions other participants consider the impact negligible because belfast s wastewater system contributes little to global emissions the two interpretations reflect different but equally legitimate cognitive reasonings of the participants there is a priori no reason to discard either of them providing the accompanying storylines appendix a4 can help in reducing such ambiguities 3 3 2 complexity and limitations of fcm structure the bulk of resilience concepts and connections that were expressed during the interviews could be drawn as networks in some cases however conditionality dynamics non monotonous relations that were touched upon during interviews could not be mapped and needed to be reflected in the storylines appendix a4 3 3 3 consensual and conflicting issues within group sessions we did not experience conflicting issues we attribute this to having nominated the participants together with ni water senior managers selecting participants within current working teams however when comparing the perspectives across interviews we identified cases with divergent views this was observed for example around the issue of who holds the responsibility of water pollution depending on the interview this could be the water utility farming individual customers decision makers within the agricultural department or policy makers at other levels of governance a second example with conflicting views was the question about the sufficiency of funding or the necessity to better manage granted funds a third example was the issue about who should be responsible for suds implementation 4 discussion in this study we propose a new approach that systematically screens for sources of vulnerability and simultaneously identifies resilience interventions we believe this approach to be useful as it integrates a wide range of perspectives to identify possible vulnerabilities as well as resilience actions in a wastewater utility that could not be easily detected with purely quantitative methods 4 1 complementary views and the value of subjectivity as from our experience in belfast resilience was usually better understood by participants through its vulnerability lens this suggests that for wastewater practitioners the academic divide between natural sciences resilience lens and social sciences vulnerability lens actually represents two complementary facets of the same coin for the wastewater practitioners resilience was perceived not to be necessarily associated to extreme conditions but to drivers related to daily practice including for instance governance human capital and civil responsibility failures in these domains may amplify failures of the wastewater system under extreme events we here sought to move beyond the different existing definitions of resilience that exist in the literature juan garcía et al 2017 and elicit subjective views of what resilience implies for different actors eliciting diverse views allows us to capture topics and reveal connections that are not necessarily obtained by single and tightly defined impressions by consensual perspectives or by quantitative approaches of resilience carpenter et al 2009 oppenheimer et al 2007 in such approaches concepts such as political will and civil responsibility could be difficult to capture ultimately the resulting wide range of resilience perspectives obtained can be used to screen for issues that warrant a more detailed exploration using traditional quantitative assessments based on statistical analysis or phenomenological modelling resilience views are necessarily those of the participating agents our outcomes therefore are a reflection of the choice of the interviewees thus it is important to be explicit and transparent about which agents were selected and why appendix a2 this selection should be done together with the final beneficiary of the study for example the senior management of the wastewater utility despite this subjectivity the approach is open in that it allows for addition of further participants to include more backgrounds and hierarchical levels 4 2 sensing complexity the approach develops a network view of a complex system the building blocks are simple cause to effect relationships revealed by the reasoning of participants in this way they are able to develop a complex model which could not be held in the mind in its entirety studying such a network provides the possibility to better appreciate how interventions may propagate in unexpected ways and produce feedbacks by revealing interconnectivity the methodology can also uncover potential unintended consequences which may be central in determining whether interventions increase resilience globally or whether it improves it in one domain while reducing it in others because of fcm limitations in capturing dynamic non monotonous and conditional relations we propose that the maps should necessarily be evaluated together with the accompanying narratives which provide the rationales for the choices made when drawing the maps 4 3 reflectiveness inclusiveness and integration we regard this participatory process as leading towards a more reflective inclusive and integrated view of resilience compared to existing resilience approaches table 1 it is reflective and inclusive in that it reflects on experiences and knowledge of a variety of actors it recognises resilience perspectives across hierarchical levels as equally legitimate to be accounted for it is also integrated because it considers wastewater management as part of a more complex urban system in which multiple domains interact for instance we find that resilience in the wastewater sector may be strongly influenced by issues in water supply agriculture and in political and cultural domains which are often underrepresented in technical resilience studies 4 4 transferability and flexibility of approach the flexibility of this approach allows for transferability to other locations zooming in and out to different levels of detail and aspects of the water system importantly as resilience perspectives are a reflection of the knowledge of participants the application of our approach to different sites will naturally highlight different dominating themes than those encountered in belfast thereby the approach simultaneously addresses the need for a standard framework with the necessity of being case specific making possible comparisons between cases juan garcía et al 2017 by linking sources of vulnerability with drivers of resilience the methodology illustrates perceived relationships between stressors impacts and interventions which makes it intuitively applicable by practitioners by doing this the approach can also be used to operationalise other existing frameworks such as the safe to fail framework developed by butler et al 2016 4 5 ancillary benefits and implications for practice the suggested approach can empower the involved participants to better appreciate the complexity of the system they work in and may improve the communication between departments with different interests and perspectives in our study both strategic and operation managers mentioned the benefits of such an exercise as the participants reflect on their system in a way they are not accustomed to do the results consisting of maps and narratives may be used to inform and initiate discussions between department heads risk and asset managers of water utilities as well as their external partners such as funders regulators or associated departments transport agriculture energy etc it might prove to be especially useful for studying nexus issues for instance when addressing complexities at catchment level it might prove equally beneficial to employ it as a monitoring tool by repeating the screening process periodically with changing agents we deem this type of exercise to be a useful precursor to the identification of specific issues of concern that may then be studied in more detail with more traditional quantitative methods 5 conclusions taking a systems perspective we suggested a new methodology to capture a wide spectrum of different understandings and interpretations of resilience in a wastewater system in an engagement process with practitioners cognitive maps were elicited the methodology reveals major drivers of vulnerability their propagation mechanisms and identifies resilience measures we believe that this vulnerability screening approach can support directors risk and asset managers of wastewater utilities to identify interventions from an integrated system perspective our approach facilitated a participatory process that is reflective capturing reflexions of practitioners in a discussion with the analyst inclusive that includes internal and external participants with diverse responsibilities and integrated that enables to account for feedbacks to and from other departments of the water utility and in interrelation to larger urban resources and networks such as legal social and governance systems the questionnaire used for this assessment can be adapted for studying other issues at different spatial scales levels of detail and domains in the water sector for instance in the context of pollutants of emerging

17901,the potential benefits of reclaimed water rw uses for environmental enhancement and restoration could become adverse impacts if rw does not meet the quality criteria that ensure wildlife preservation rw can contain complex mixtures of micropollutants that may accumulate in sediment after environmental uses and affect benthic fauna therefore we designed this study to assess the effects of rw on a sediment insect species used mainly in ecotoxicology chironomus riparius whole organism effects and gene expression were measured in a water sediment system after spiking rw as overlying water which was renewed 3 times during the test development rate emergence rate and fecundity were monitored after the 21 day exposure endocrine related genes ecr err e75 vtg cellular stress genes hsp70 hsc70 hsp24 hsp10 and biotransformation genes gp93 gstd3 gpx cyp4g were assessed in larvae after the 10 day exposure the experimental design also included single or binary fortifications of both test medium and rw obtained by adding two emerging pollutants carbamazepine 100 μg l cbz and triclosan 20 μg l tcs the chemical characterisation of rw showed that 20 of the 23 screened emerging pollutants fell within the detection limit 10 exceeded 0 01 μg l including cbz and three exceeded 0 1 μg l hydrochlorothiazide atenolol ibuprofen the analytical measures of sediment day 21 and overlying water days 7 14 and 21 were taken to know the water sediment distribution of cbz and tcs added to fortifications cbz distributed mainly in overlying water 110 164 μg l and 73 100 μg kg while tcs showed a higher affinity to sediment 2 8 5 1 μg l and 36 55 μg kg rw had significant effects in molecular terms vtg hsp70 hsc70 but had no significant effects on the whole organism nevertheless the single rw fortifications impaired both the development rate and fecundity while the binary rw fortification impaired only fecundity the most marked increase in ecr expression was observed for the binary rw fortification hsps gstd3 and cyp4g showed a similar tendency to that observed for ecr and vtg in the binary and single rw fortifications the binary mixture cbz and tcs together in rw was toxic but not in the medium tests therefore the major concern of rw uses is apparently related to the interactivity between this complex matrix and any other pollutants possibly present in the environment where rw is applied our results underscore the need for raising awareness about rw effects which can be achieved by ecotoxicological testing graphical abstract image 1 keywords water sediment test reclaimed water carbamazepine triclosan gene expression apical endpoints 1 introduction it is widely recognised that effect based methods and chemical analyses are complementary tools to assess water quality especially to address mixture issues pollutants co occur at low concentrations in mixtures of many chemicals which spells concerns about potential combined effects busch et al 2016 both approaches chemical and bioanalytical analyses have been proposed to establish causal links between chemical exposures and ecological effects in line with the eu water framework directive altenburger et al 2018 furthermore effect based assessments have been successfully applied to study toxicity removal during wastewater treatment välitalo et al 2017 after being treated wastewater can be directly discharged to receiving surface water or can be reused as reclaimed water rw among other uses environmental restoration is a valuable use of rw nevertheless rw disposal in natural environments can pose a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems because complex mixtures of pollutants remain and are not eliminated after conventional wastewater treatment processes rw should meet quality standards to be considered an eco friendly practice in recent years the efforts made to develop rw use guidelines and regulations have paid attention the main rw uses in europe namely agricultural irrigation and aquifer recharge eu 2016a it is worth noting that legally defined standards are usually developed to protect human health but both health and environmental aspects have to be sufficiently considered when developing rw quality standards eu 2016b the development of quality criteria for specific environmental rw uses such as wetland recovery preservation or stream augmentation for ecological flows is necessary to protect freshwater organisms including sediment species for instance wetland loss mitigation has been especially encouraged from not only an environmental point of view i e biodiversity conservation flood protection water quality enhancement but also from an agricultural point of view verhoeven and setter 2010 therefore rw reuse projects for aquatic ecosystem restoration require high quality wastewater treatment because otherwise residues of the pollutant mixtures present in rw can be retained in water mainly in the sediments of restored rivers and wetlands chironomus riparius is a sediment dwelling organism used largely for ecotoxicological studies di veroli et al 2014 kunce et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2018 the life cycle of c riparius includes four different stages egg larva pupa and adult there are four oecd standardised guidelines used to assess acute and chronic effects after both spiked water and spiked sediment exposures oecd 2004a oecd 2004b oecd 2010 oecd 2011 these guidelines focus on apical endpoints such as survival larval growth adult emergence sex ratio development rate and reproduction even during life cycle exposure apart from these approaches genomic analysis technologies have allowed a vast amount of data on gene expression induced by environmental contaminants on quironomid species to be acquired planelló et al 2015 mantilla et al 2018 herrero et al 2018 despite having a collection of developed methods to assess both ecologically relevant and transcriptional responses very few examples combine these approaches simultaneously in an experimental design using c riparius marinkovic et al 2012a studies designed to simultaneously assess changes in gene expression and adverse effects at the individual level are useful for establishing causal relations among endpoints moreover the elucidation of molecular mechanisms and their contribution to relevant toxicity outcomes across different biological organisation levels are key aspects to be solved in order to apply the adverse outcome pathway framework in environmental risk assessment groh et al 2015 fay et al 2017 the joint effects of the complex mixture of micropollutants in reclaimed water can be approached by fortification with a simple laboratory mixture aquilino et al 2018 two emerging pollutants were selected in this study for rw fortification carbamazepine cbz an antiepileptic drug and triclosan tcs an antibacterial agent used in personal care and consumer products cbz and tcs are expected to show an affinity for sorption to sediment because of the log kow 2 45 and 4 80 respectively martínez hernández et al 2014 peng et al 2013 indeed the study of dussault et al 2008 has shown that the risk of tcs for benthic organisms is such that it requires an urgent detailed ecological risk assessment recently guo and iwata 2017 have confirmed a risk of tcs to the organisms dwelling in sediment by a probabilistic risk assessment approach on a global scale similarly cbz has been identified as a pharmaceutical for which more studies are needed to rule out its potential risk for aquatic environments ferrari et al 2004 a severe cbz risk for sediment dwellers in the environment has been stated by heye et al 2016 whereas a medium risk has been estimated by nieto et al 2017 both cbz and tcs lethal effects have been studied in chironomus sp dussualt et al 2008 other studies have focused on chronic effects heye et al 2016 nieto et al 2017 and gene expression endpoints martínez paz et al 2014 2017 although both emerging pollutants have been tested in c riparius they have been studied in single exposures and not as part of a mixture this study aims to deal with the quality assessment of rw by combining effect and exposure characterisations in a c riparius water sediment test the exposure characterisation included rw testing after single fortification with cbz cbz rw or tcs tcs rw and fortification with their binary mixture fortified rw frw the rw concentrations of 23 selected emerging pollutants including tcs and cbz were monitored additionally the sediment water partitioning of cbz and tcs was studied by analysing water concentrations throughout the test and sediment concentrations at the end of test day 21 in treatments tcs rw cbz rw and frw the effect characterisation consisted of assessing apical endpoints after pupation 21 day exposure of spiked rw and gene expression prior to pupation 10 day exposure of spiked rw the measured apical endpoints were developmental rate adult emergence and fecundity finally endocrine related genes ecr err e75 vtg genes of cellular stress response hsp70 hsc70 hsp24 hsp10 and biotransformation genes gp93 gstd3 gpx cyp4g were monitored the genes selected to assess transcriptional alterations under the studied conditions have been extensively studied in c riparius toxicity assays under both laboratory and field conditions they belong to relevant metabolic pathways for functioning and survival in insects planelló et al 2015 arambourou et al 2020 2 material and methods 2 1 sediment water test c riparius has been cultured for many generations in our lab sánchez argüello et al 2009 the 2nd instar larvae were used for both the 21 day exposure apical endpoints and 10 day exposure gene expression tests the water sediment system was prepared following oecd recommendations oecd 2010 industrial sand was sieved through two meshes 2 mm and 0 7 mm afterwards 2 7 peat and 6 5 kaolin clay were added this formulated sediment 300 g allowed good separation between the water and sediment phases overlying water consisted in rw or reconstituted test water oecd 2004c for the control the effects of fortification obtained by adding carbamazepine 100 μg l cbz and triclosan 20 μg l tcs to rw namely cbz rw and tcs rw respectively were also assessed additionally the joint effects of cbz 100 μg l and tcs 20 μg l were assessed after both pollutants and were added to the reconstituted test water control f and to rw frw overlying water was renewed weekly two additional weekly collected rw samples were used cbz tcs solutions were freshly prepared for rw fortification frw cbz rw and tcs rw and of control f and were chemically characterised for making comparisons between the nominal and actual concentrations likewise both the cbz and tcs concentrations were analysed after renewing the overlying water of frw cbz rw and tcs rw on days 7 14 and 21 and in sediment at the end of the test day 21 tests were conducted in 24 glass vessels 2 litres the sediment water systems were built to produce a sediment water volume ratio of 1 4 and were left 3 days prior to adding larvae to allow for the partitioning of pollutants from rw to sediment c riparius 25 larvae were added to three replicates 75 larvae per treatment and were used to assess the apical endpoints 21 day exposure test moreover 50 larvae were added to another glass vessel used to assess gene expression 10 day exposure test the test system temperature was maintained at 20 2 c during an 8 h dark 16h light photoperiod larvae were fed 1mg larvae once a week with commercial fish food tetradiscus slight aeration was supplied throughout exposure the larvae that survived 47 50 the 10 day exposure tests were recovered and stored at 80 c for rna extraction purposes the other replicates were left for 21 days to allow midges to emerge and oviposition then adult emergence was monitored daily from assay day 12 first midge emerged in the control until full emergence of male and female midges in all the treatments day 19 the deposition of egg ropes was observed until the end of the experiment the following endpoints were assessed 1 the development rate which represents the portion of larval development to take place per day units 1 day 2 the emergence ratio which is the sum of the emerged midges divided by the number of introduced larvae 3 fecundity calculated as the number of egg ropes per female data were generated according to oecd guidelines oecd 2010 2 2 chemical characterisation of rw reclaimed water was sampled once every 3 consecutive weeks from a wastewater treatment plant for urban effluents with ultrafiltration treatment and two additional disinfection and purification steps chlorination and uv for its reuse the physico chemical parameters of the three rw samples were as follows ph 7 3 7 6 and 8 1 conductivity 0 6 ms cm 1 total hardness 102 115 and 119 as mg l ca co3 total organic carbon 24 13 and 21 mg l rw was slightly aerated 2 days at 20 c when received to be used for testing to extract the 23 selected emerging pollutants in rw the solid phase extraction procedure was applied using cartridges strata x 33 mg ml phenomenex 8bs100 fch according to fernández et al 2010 cbz and tcs in the overlying water from control f frw cbz rw and tcs rw were analysed by sampling 1 ml which was filtered 0 45 μm and transferred to an autosampler phial to be inserted directly into the hplc injector cbz and tcs from sediments were extracted according to huang et al 2015 shortly afterwards the frozen dried sediment 1 g with 25 ng of an internal quantification standard cbz d 10 and trc d 3 chemical purity 99 sigma aldrich germany was extracted by ultrasonication 3 15 min with acetone 5 ml finally acetone was evaporated to dryness genevac ipswich england and extracts were reconstituted with methanol 1 ml immediately before injecting the sample into the hplc system the selected emerging pollutants in rw and cbz tcs in the fortified treatments overlying water and sediment were analysed in an hplc system hp 1200 series agilent technologies santa clara ca usa equipped with an ms triple quadrupole detector agilent technologies 6410 triple quad lc ms compounds were separated with a luna 5 μm c18 2 250 4 6 mm column phenomenex 2 3 transcriptional studies the total rna of the 20 larvae per treatment distributed in four independent rna extracting procedures each with 5 larvae from the 10 day exposure tests was isolated using trizol reagent invitrogen germany following the manufacturer s protocol afterwards rna was treated with rnase free dnase roche germany and extracted with phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol fluka germany using 5prime phase lock gel light tubes quantabio usa purified rna was resuspended in rnase free water quantified by spectrophotometry at 260 nm using a biophotometer eppendorf germany and stored at 80 c for each sample 7 μg of isolated rna were used for retrotranscription using iscript reverse transcription supermix for rt qpcr bio rad according to the manufacturer s instructions the obtained cdna was stored at 80 c and used as the template for the subsequent qpcr analyses the expression profiles of ecr err e75 vtg hsp70 hsc70 hsp24 hsp10 gp93 gstd3 gpx and cyp4g were analysed by real time pcr quantitative real time pcr rt qpcr was carried out in a cfx96 real time detection system bio rad using the quantimix easy kit biotools spain genes encoding actin and the 26s ribosomal subunit were used as endogenous references quantitative real time pcr rt qpcr was run as described in herrero et al 2018 the primer sequences are shown in the supplementary material table sm1 the mrna level of each target gene was normalised against the expression of the two reference genes and the 2 δδct method was used to analyse relative changes in gene expression with the cfx96 real time detection system and the cfx manager 3 1 software biorad each sample was run in duplicate wells technical replicates 2 4 statistical analyses the data of the apical endpoints development rate emergence ratio and fecundity showed normal distributions kolmorov smirnov test and only the emergence ratio variable did not show variance homogeneity levene test a one way anova was applied for the other two variables development rate and fecundity to discern statistically significant differences among effects possibly due to treatments finally t tests were performed to study which of the treatments including control f differed significantly from the control and if the treatments with fortifications frw cbz rw and tcs rw differed from control f no significant differences were found for any apical endpoints when comparisons were made using rw and frw as reference controls the relative expression of each target gene was calculated with a one way anova and duncan s new multiple range tests p 0 05 the normality and homoscedasticity of data were assessed by shapiro wilk s test and levene s test respectively as the data were neither homogeneous nor normally distributed kruskal wallis test was used and the differences of pairs from the control control f rw and frw were established by mann whitney s tests p 0 05 3 results 3 1 results of the analytical measurements table 1 summarises the concentrations of the 23 selected emerging pollutants measured in rw the cbz average concentration of the three collected rw samples was 74 ng l and the tcs concentration was below the detection limit the three highest pollutant concentrations ranged between 1 1 and 0 28 μg l and corresponded to three pharmaceuticals two antihypertensive drugs hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol and one analgesic drug ibuprofen the other analysed compounds were below 0 1 μg l fig 1 shows the cbz and tcs overlying water concentrations for the 3 measurement days days 7 14 and 21 along with the cbz tcs sediment concentrations at the end of the test day 21 cbz and tcs were also measured in freshly prepared single and binary fortifications average concentrations 104 μg l cbz and 26 μg l tcs and in overlying water after renewal the total recovery from the water sediment systems was lower in the tcs treatments 43 36 and 40 for control f frw and tcs rw respectively than in the cbz treatments 89 85 and 69 for control f frw and cbz rw respectively sorption to sediment was much higher for tcs than for cbz which was expected according to their log kow see the introduction the average percentages measured in sediments in relation to the total recovered amounts were 11 73 100 μg kg and 63 36 55 μg kg for cbz and tcs respectively in fact the tcs concentrations in the overlying water remained low throughout the test 2 8 5 1 μg l the cbz overlying water concentrations remained almost steady but exceeded the nominal concentration 110 164 μg l especially in frw on day 7 this can be explained by cbz desorption from sediment after overlying water renewal 3 2 developmental and reproductive endpoints the one way anova of the pool data run by setting the treatment level as a factor showed no significant differences for any apical endpoint although the development rate was almost significant f 2 7 p 0 07 df 17 the development rate of cbz rw and tcs rw varied significantly compared to the control fig 2 a emergence ratio was similar for the control and control f fig 2b while a slight increase took place after fortification control f the opposite effect was observed with rw and frw as a lower emergence ratio was observed in frw than in rw rw and its single fortifications had similar emergence ratios the one way anova performed by setting the treatment level with the pool data of fortifications control f tcs rw cbz rw and frw gave significant differences for both the development rate f 4 02 p 0 05 df 11 and fecundity f 5 95 p 0 05 df 11 regarding the fecundity results the rw fortifications with tcs tcs rw cbz cbz rw or with their binary mixture control f and frw did not significantly vary from the control fig 2c however significant differences were observed for fecundity and the development rate compared to control f cbz rw had significant effects on both endpoints development rate and fecundity while all the fortifications frw cbz rw and tcs rw significantly affected fecundity in relation to control f 3 3 gene expression variations for the transcriptional activity studies alterations in the expression profiles of the ecdysone related genes were observed most significant differences were observed in the larvae exposed to treatments with fortifications the gene coding for the ecdysone receptor ecr fig 3 a was significantly up regulated in the larvae exposed to frw cbz rw and tcs rw with a mean increase in relation to the control of up to 3 8 fold and 2 fold in frw and cbz rw respectively a concomitant albeit non statistically significant tendency was also observed in the e75 gene an early response gene of the ecdysone related pathway fig 3c in contrast no significant alteration was observed in the transcriptional activity of the oestrogen related receptor err fig 3b finally the results of the effector gene of the ecdysone related pathway vtg showed statistically significant increases in mrna abundance in the larvae exposed to rw up to 2 4 fold frw and tcs rw fig 3d the hsps genes generally showed a similar trend under the different conditions and were induced significantly under most studied conditions versus the different controls fig 3e h the response of the genes in the larvae exposed to rw was always less marked than the fortifications the rw condition was able to induce a significant up regulation of the stress response via hsp70 and its constitutive form hsc70 compared to the control fig 3e and f fortifications significantly increased the gene expression of hsp70 with mean values of up to 34 fold 15 fold and 4 5 fold for frw cbz rw and tcs rw respectively in contrast the genes coding for small hsps hsp24 and hsp10 were not affected in rw fig 3g and h while the fortification conditions induced a significant overexpression the highest of which was for the frw condition frw cbz rw tcs rw in terms of detoxification processes a similar response and tendency to those followed by the hsps genes were observed in gstd3 and cyp4g with mean significant overexpression values of up to 1 8 fold and 3 3 fold for the frw condition respectively fig 3j and l in contrast gpx remained constant except for control f and tcs rw whose expression activity was significantly induced fig 3k finally the induction of gp93 activity was significant only after the exposure to the binary fortification in rw frw 4 discussion major advances have been made since angelakis et al 1999 reviewed the status of rw uses and existing guidelines around the mediterranean basin at that time no wastewater reuse regulation existed in europe nevertheless the first steps towards a european regulatory and institutional framework were already ongoing in particular rw requirements have been proposed for water reuse for both agricultural irrigation and managed aquifer recharging alcalde sanz and gawlik 2017 despite it being well accepted that environmental uses need less restrictive regulations about rw quality standards than those posing a direct indirect public health risk the practice of developing guidelines must be extended to rw uses in environmental improvement programmes to protect wildlife both required treatment levels and recommended values are important aspects to consider when developing rw use guidelines li et al 2009 most of the specific values developed for rw quality standards are microbial indicators chhipi shrestha et al 2017 turbidity nutrient parameters and limit concentrations of some inorganic metals and organic pollutants jeong et al 2016 müller and cornel 2016 nevertheless no existing guideline considers criteria for emerging contaminants which often exist in effluents and are of potential concern yuang et al 2017 the spanish criteria adopted for urban agricultural industrial recreational and environmental rw reuses are based on microbial helminthic indicators turbidity and nutrient parameters while a case by case assessment is stated for other contaminants boe 2007 this study and other spanish ones conducted for monitoring programmes have shown that emerging pollutants are present at low concentrations in rw and only a few cases exceed 0 1 μg l teijon et al 2010 estévez et al 2012 pablos et al 2018 concentrations above 0 5 or even 1 μg l are rarely detected for frequently used drugs which was the case of the antihypertensive hydrochlorothiazide drug detected in this study rw use to maintain a spanish river flow rate led to an increase in concentrations of pharmaceuticals albeit a negligible one in ecotoxicological assessment terms lópez serna et al 2012 we must bear in mind that in line with european legislation an environmental effect analysis is required for the pharmaceuticals found in ambient water at concentrations above 0 01 μg l emea 2018 lack of quality standards along with concern about the mixture effects of emerging pollutants in rw can be managed by prioritising chemicals on which to focus rw hazard assessments drewers et al 2013 this study focused on two emerging pollutants of concern with sediment affinity cbz and tcs the environmental presence of cbz may be linked to its abundant use and inefficient removal cbz has been found in effluents 4 6 μg l untreated drinking water supplies 0 61 μg l and ambient water 0 5 1 μg l after the infiltration of secondary effluent via wetlands wintgens et al 2008 yaun et al 2017 the cbz herein detected 74 ng l was similar to the concentrations reported in different rws and even from other countries teijon et al 2010 li et al 2015 cbz was proposed as a substance subject to review its possible identification as a priority substance epc 2007 for all these reasons we identified it as a sewage marker tcs was not herein detected in reclaimed water but its presence in reclaimed water at low concentrations 24 ng l has been described by pablos et al 2018 although tcs can be efficiently removed from wastewater tcs residuals were still detected in effluents within the 2 2 ng l to 47800 ng l range and also in surface water between 1 4 and 40000 ng l thomaidi et al 2017 parenti et al 2019 as tcs is on the list of the 10 most frequently detected organic micropollutants in the environment it should be considered a candidate for monitoring and prioritisation besides some examples for deriving tcs water quality criteria have been proposed hill et al 2018 the release of tcs into the environment is connected to mostly wastewater and may have long term adverse effects on aquatic organisms ding et al 2018 however very little is known about the fate and behaviour of tcs in sediments the total recovery of tcs in this study after 21 days was around 40 of the amount applied in fortifications which comes close to that observed by huang et al 2014 who found a tcs half life from 32 to 62 days in water sediment systems the sediment concentrations for tcs measured in this study 36 55 μg kg fell within the range of environmental concentrations in sediments for example tcs levels in brazilian marine sediments are quantified at 15 μg kg pusceddu et al 2017 at 53 μg kg in swiss lake sediments at 35 7 μg kg in spanish sediments and in the order of tens to 100 μg kg in japanese sediments tamura et al 2013 tcs showed a strong affinity to sediment because 63 of all that spiked in overlying water was found in sediment which agrees with previous observations huang et al 2014 2015 cbz showed less partitioning to sediment and only 11 of all that applied by spiking overlying water was found in sediment this can be explained by its low hydrophobicity and or uncharged form at typical phs of natural water or rw martínez hernández et al 2014 the presence of transformation cbz products in river sediment has been described azuma et al 2017 vulliet et al 2014 observed cbz concentrations within a similar range 31 μg kg as that measured herein 73 100 μg kg finally cbz can be considered persistent and non sorptive in sediment which falls in line with radke and maier 2014 and would explain the cbz partitioning observed from sediment after overlying water renewal which would thus allow higher cbz water concentrations than nominal ones while testing in spite of cbz and tcs being present in sediment very few studies have addressed their risk assessment for benthic invertebrates nieto et al 2017 heye et al 2016 pusceddu et al 2017 together with chemical prioritisation bioanalytical methods should be applied to make hazard assessments of complex mixtures furthermore bioassays can act as a powerful method to detect hazards induced by using rw in the environment mano et al 2017 research into pollution from using rw requires sediment studies as the mobility of micropollutants in rw discharged to aquatic environments depends essentially on both their sorption into and desorption from sediments martínez hernández et al 2014 recently ao et al 2018 observed that rw replenishment presents a significant impact from pond sediment as far as we know this is the only study to evaluate the effects of rw by a laboratory water sediment test we combined molecular biomarkers and apical endpoints using the sediment dwelling organism c riparius in molecular terms the expression profiles of the different evaluated genes were affected by exposure to either rw or its fortification but this was not the case with apical endpoints as their statistically significant differences were observed only after rw fortification in spite of the reduction observed in development rate and fecundity after exposure to rw not statistical differences appeared in relation to both controls control and control f the expression of the ecdysone receptor gene ecr a well known biomarker of endocrine disruption and the early response gene of the ecdysone pathway e75 was analysed as they are two key genes involved in the control of insect development alterations in the ecdysone pathway could ultimately affect ecdysteroids such as 20 hydroxyecdysone the active form of ecdysone that controls moulting and metamorphosis in insects henrich et al 1999 as well as tissue and body growth lin and smagghe 2018 thus development rate could be ecdysone dependent at the individual level in our study the single rw fortifications cbz rw and tcs rw led to the up regulation of ecr and e75 and also cut the larval development time development rate which reinforces the idea that the regulation of c riparius development is mediated by ecdysone the less marked reduction in development rate by the binary mixture suggests an antogonic effect which could not be mediated by ecr heye et al 2016 have concluded that the binding affinity of cbz to ecr is very low but this affirmation was based on qualitative calculations using classic molecular dynamics simulations martínez paz et al 2017 have demonstrated the activation of ecr in c riparius by tcs water exposures at 1000 μg l herein we demonstrated a quantitative increase in the ecr transcription induced by cbz and tcs single and binary fortifications when added to rw but this effect was not observed for control f presence of cbz and tcs without rw this scenario allows to conclude that the agonist action of fortifications on ecr could be increased by the synergistic action of an extremely variable amount of compounds present in rw as observed by the dramatic induction of hsp70 in frw the synergetic effects of rw after fortification with other emerging pollutants have been observed in a previous rw effect based assessment aquilino et al 2018 despite the effect of single rw fortification on development rate it was not reflected in the emergence ratio which was the same for all the treatments and became even lower for the controls lower sediment cbz concentrations 38 ng kg than those measured at the end of this study 73 100 μg kg had no effect on the emergence ratio of c riparius er nieto et al 2017 with tcs the emergence ratio of chironomus sp lowered for sediment concentrations above 10 mg kg tamura et al 2013 which are much higher than the concentrations herein measured 11 24 μg kg after reaching sexual maturity the reproductive success of all species including insects relies on vitellogenin biosynthesis and its uptake in developing oocytes ecdysteroids also regulate vitellogenin in body fat throughout a conserved set of ecdysone responsive early and early late genes swevers and iatrou 2009 the concomitant up regulation observed in the ecdysone responsive early e75 gene and the vitellogenin gene vtg suggests that the ecdysone signalling pathway was affected downstream as vitellus is the main energy source to fuel embryo development this may result in significant reproductive impairment roy et al 2007 as it might affect yolk synthesis and egg production vtg expression and fecundity profiles were inversely associated in this study as vtg up regulation led to reduced egg production as far as we know no previous studies have compared vtg gene expression and the fecundity of c riparius impaired fecundity could not therefore be due to defective vtg transcription but there could be other causes such as defective vitellogenesis or disturbed uptake of vtg into oocytes as proposed by hagele 1990 finally stress response genes hsps genes and the gene expression of gstd3 and cyp4g involved in biotransformation processes showed a similar tendency to that observed for ecr and vtg in binary and single rw fortifications these findings agree with previous authors insights into the usefulness of transcriptional data for ecotoxicity testing with c riparius marinkovic et al 2012b lencioni et al 2016 particularly ecr expression as a target for moulting disruption in arthropods song et al 2017 5 conclusion the development of quality rw standards poses a challenge mainly for its content in a complex mixture of micropollutants herein 20 of the 23 screened emerging pollutants were detected in rw within the detection limit 10 exceeded 0 01 μg l and three exceeded 0 1 μg l hydrochlorothiazide atenolol ibuprofen this study tackles the potential impact of rw use on a sediment organism c riparius with an effect based assessment for the first time it followed the same approach that we used in a previous rw effect based assessment for water column organisms which consisted in 1 examining a range of endpoints at different biological organisation levels after exposure to rw 2 extending the study with rw fortifications addition of cbz tcs and their binary mixture exposure to rw produced statistical effects but only at the molecular level hsps and vtg which indicates that rw use did not compromise c riparius growth and reproduction cbz and tcs added to the fortifications reached environmentally relevant concentrations in sediment and altered both gene expression and developmental reproductive endpoints when used for rw fortification in these cases the comparisons made between both biological levels of response showed that ecr can act as a good biomarker and that it is able to predict larval development and fecundity effect this suggests that ecologically relevant responses in insects can be mediated by this receptor exactly as many studies have proposed finally lack of effects for the binary mixture cbz and tcs together in a medium test unlike its effects in frw suggests that the major concern about rw uses is apparently associated with the synergisms between this complex matrix and other pollutants that may be present in the environment where applying rw this finding allowed us to conclude that ecotoxicity testing can be an effective tool to help identify

17901,the potential benefits of reclaimed water rw uses for environmental enhancement and restoration could become adverse impacts if rw does not meet the quality criteria that ensure wildlife preservation rw can contain complex mixtures of micropollutants that may accumulate in sediment after environmental uses and affect benthic fauna therefore we designed this study to assess the effects of rw on a sediment insect species used mainly in ecotoxicology chironomus riparius whole organism effects and gene expression were measured in a water sediment system after spiking rw as overlying water which was renewed 3 times during the test development rate emergence rate and fecundity were monitored after the 21 day exposure endocrine related genes ecr err e75 vtg cellular stress genes hsp70 hsc70 hsp24 hsp10 and biotransformation genes gp93 gstd3 gpx cyp4g were assessed in larvae after the 10 day exposure the experimental design also included single or binary fortifications of both test medium and rw obtained by adding two emerging pollutants carbamazepine 100 μg l cbz and triclosan 20 μg l tcs the chemical characterisation of rw showed that 20 of the 23 screened emerging pollutants fell within the detection limit 10 exceeded 0 01 μg l including cbz and three exceeded 0 1 μg l hydrochlorothiazide atenolol ibuprofen the analytical measures of sediment day 21 and overlying water days 7 14 and 21 were taken to know the water sediment distribution of cbz and tcs added to fortifications cbz distributed mainly in overlying water 110 164 μg l and 73 100 μg kg while tcs showed a higher affinity to sediment 2 8 5 1 μg l and 36 55 μg kg rw had significant effects in molecular terms vtg hsp70 hsc70 but had no significant effects on the whole organism nevertheless the single rw fortifications impaired both the development rate and fecundity while the binary rw fortification impaired only fecundity the most marked increase in ecr expression was observed for the binary rw fortification hsps gstd3 and cyp4g showed a similar tendency to that observed for ecr and vtg in the binary and single rw fortifications the binary mixture cbz and tcs together in rw was toxic but not in the medium tests therefore the major concern of rw uses is apparently related to the interactivity between this complex matrix and any other pollutants possibly present in the environment where rw is applied our results underscore the need for raising awareness about rw effects which can be achieved by ecotoxicological testing graphical abstract image 1 keywords water sediment test reclaimed water carbamazepine triclosan gene expression apical endpoints 1 introduction it is widely recognised that effect based methods and chemical analyses are complementary tools to assess water quality especially to address mixture issues pollutants co occur at low concentrations in mixtures of many chemicals which spells concerns about potential combined effects busch et al 2016 both approaches chemical and bioanalytical analyses have been proposed to establish causal links between chemical exposures and ecological effects in line with the eu water framework directive altenburger et al 2018 furthermore effect based assessments have been successfully applied to study toxicity removal during wastewater treatment välitalo et al 2017 after being treated wastewater can be directly discharged to receiving surface water or can be reused as reclaimed water rw among other uses environmental restoration is a valuable use of rw nevertheless rw disposal in natural environments can pose a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems because complex mixtures of pollutants remain and are not eliminated after conventional wastewater treatment processes rw should meet quality standards to be considered an eco friendly practice in recent years the efforts made to develop rw use guidelines and regulations have paid attention the main rw uses in europe namely agricultural irrigation and aquifer recharge eu 2016a it is worth noting that legally defined standards are usually developed to protect human health but both health and environmental aspects have to be sufficiently considered when developing rw quality standards eu 2016b the development of quality criteria for specific environmental rw uses such as wetland recovery preservation or stream augmentation for ecological flows is necessary to protect freshwater organisms including sediment species for instance wetland loss mitigation has been especially encouraged from not only an environmental point of view i e biodiversity conservation flood protection water quality enhancement but also from an agricultural point of view verhoeven and setter 2010 therefore rw reuse projects for aquatic ecosystem restoration require high quality wastewater treatment because otherwise residues of the pollutant mixtures present in rw can be retained in water mainly in the sediments of restored rivers and wetlands chironomus riparius is a sediment dwelling organism used largely for ecotoxicological studies di veroli et al 2014 kunce et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2018 the life cycle of c riparius includes four different stages egg larva pupa and adult there are four oecd standardised guidelines used to assess acute and chronic effects after both spiked water and spiked sediment exposures oecd 2004a oecd 2004b oecd 2010 oecd 2011 these guidelines focus on apical endpoints such as survival larval growth adult emergence sex ratio development rate and reproduction even during life cycle exposure apart from these approaches genomic analysis technologies have allowed a vast amount of data on gene expression induced by environmental contaminants on quironomid species to be acquired planelló et al 2015 mantilla et al 2018 herrero et al 2018 despite having a collection of developed methods to assess both ecologically relevant and transcriptional responses very few examples combine these approaches simultaneously in an experimental design using c riparius marinkovic et al 2012a studies designed to simultaneously assess changes in gene expression and adverse effects at the individual level are useful for establishing causal relations among endpoints moreover the elucidation of molecular mechanisms and their contribution to relevant toxicity outcomes across different biological organisation levels are key aspects to be solved in order to apply the adverse outcome pathway framework in environmental risk assessment groh et al 2015 fay et al 2017 the joint effects of the complex mixture of micropollutants in reclaimed water can be approached by fortification with a simple laboratory mixture aquilino et al 2018 two emerging pollutants were selected in this study for rw fortification carbamazepine cbz an antiepileptic drug and triclosan tcs an antibacterial agent used in personal care and consumer products cbz and tcs are expected to show an affinity for sorption to sediment because of the log kow 2 45 and 4 80 respectively martínez hernández et al 2014 peng et al 2013 indeed the study of dussault et al 2008 has shown that the risk of tcs for benthic organisms is such that it requires an urgent detailed ecological risk assessment recently guo and iwata 2017 have confirmed a risk of tcs to the organisms dwelling in sediment by a probabilistic risk assessment approach on a global scale similarly cbz has been identified as a pharmaceutical for which more studies are needed to rule out its potential risk for aquatic environments ferrari et al 2004 a severe cbz risk for sediment dwellers in the environment has been stated by heye et al 2016 whereas a medium risk has been estimated by nieto et al 2017 both cbz and tcs lethal effects have been studied in chironomus sp dussualt et al 2008 other studies have focused on chronic effects heye et al 2016 nieto et al 2017 and gene expression endpoints martínez paz et al 2014 2017 although both emerging pollutants have been tested in c riparius they have been studied in single exposures and not as part of a mixture this study aims to deal with the quality assessment of rw by combining effect and exposure characterisations in a c riparius water sediment test the exposure characterisation included rw testing after single fortification with cbz cbz rw or tcs tcs rw and fortification with their binary mixture fortified rw frw the rw concentrations of 23 selected emerging pollutants including tcs and cbz were monitored additionally the sediment water partitioning of cbz and tcs was studied by analysing water concentrations throughout the test and sediment concentrations at the end of test day 21 in treatments tcs rw cbz rw and frw the effect characterisation consisted of assessing apical endpoints after pupation 21 day exposure of spiked rw and gene expression prior to pupation 10 day exposure of spiked rw the measured apical endpoints were developmental rate adult emergence and fecundity finally endocrine related genes ecr err e75 vtg genes of cellular stress response hsp70 hsc70 hsp24 hsp10 and biotransformation genes gp93 gstd3 gpx cyp4g were monitored the genes selected to assess transcriptional alterations under the studied conditions have been extensively studied in c riparius toxicity assays under both laboratory and field conditions they belong to relevant metabolic pathways for functioning and survival in insects planelló et al 2015 arambourou et al 2020 2 material and methods 2 1 sediment water test c riparius has been cultured for many generations in our lab sánchez argüello et al 2009 the 2nd instar larvae were used for both the 21 day exposure apical endpoints and 10 day exposure gene expression tests the water sediment system was prepared following oecd recommendations oecd 2010 industrial sand was sieved through two meshes 2 mm and 0 7 mm afterwards 2 7 peat and 6 5 kaolin clay were added this formulated sediment 300 g allowed good separation between the water and sediment phases overlying water consisted in rw or reconstituted test water oecd 2004c for the control the effects of fortification obtained by adding carbamazepine 100 μg l cbz and triclosan 20 μg l tcs to rw namely cbz rw and tcs rw respectively were also assessed additionally the joint effects of cbz 100 μg l and tcs 20 μg l were assessed after both pollutants and were added to the reconstituted test water control f and to rw frw overlying water was renewed weekly two additional weekly collected rw samples were used cbz tcs solutions were freshly prepared for rw fortification frw cbz rw and tcs rw and of control f and were chemically characterised for making comparisons between the nominal and actual concentrations likewise both the cbz and tcs concentrations were analysed after renewing the overlying water of frw cbz rw and tcs rw on days 7 14 and 21 and in sediment at the end of the test day 21 tests were conducted in 24 glass vessels 2 litres the sediment water systems were built to produce a sediment water volume ratio of 1 4 and were left 3 days prior to adding larvae to allow for the partitioning of pollutants from rw to sediment c riparius 25 larvae were added to three replicates 75 larvae per treatment and were used to assess the apical endpoints 21 day exposure test moreover 50 larvae were added to another glass vessel used to assess gene expression 10 day exposure test the test system temperature was maintained at 20 2 c during an 8 h dark 16h light photoperiod larvae were fed 1mg larvae once a week with commercial fish food tetradiscus slight aeration was supplied throughout exposure the larvae that survived 47 50 the 10 day exposure tests were recovered and stored at 80 c for rna extraction purposes the other replicates were left for 21 days to allow midges to emerge and oviposition then adult emergence was monitored daily from assay day 12 first midge emerged in the control until full emergence of male and female midges in all the treatments day 19 the deposition of egg ropes was observed until the end of the experiment the following endpoints were assessed 1 the development rate which represents the portion of larval development to take place per day units 1 day 2 the emergence ratio which is the sum of the emerged midges divided by the number of introduced larvae 3 fecundity calculated as the number of egg ropes per female data were generated according to oecd guidelines oecd 2010 2 2 chemical characterisation of rw reclaimed water was sampled once every 3 consecutive weeks from a wastewater treatment plant for urban effluents with ultrafiltration treatment and two additional disinfection and purification steps chlorination and uv for its reuse

rw was slightly aerated 2 days at 20 c when received to be used for testing to extract the 23 selected emerging pollutants in rw the solid phase extraction procedure was applied using cartridges strata x 33 mg ml phenomenex 8bs100 fch according to fernández et al 2010 cbz and tcs in the overlying water from control f frw cbz rw and tcs rw were analysed by sampling 1 ml which was filtered 0 45 μm and transferred to an autosampler phial to be inserted directly into the hplc injector cbz and tcs from sediments were extracted according to huang et al 2015 shortly afterwards the frozen dried sediment 1 g with 25 ng of an internal quantification standard cbz d 10 and trc d 3 chemical purity 99 sigma aldrich germany was extracted by ultrasonication 3 15 min with acetone 5 ml finally acetone was evaporated to dryness genevac ipswich england and extracts were reconstituted with methanol 1 ml immediately before injecting the sample into the hplc system the selected emerging pollutants in rw and cbz tcs in the fortified treatments overlying water and sediment were analysed in an hplc system hp 1200 series agilent technologies santa clara ca usa equipped with an ms triple quadrupole detector agilent technologies 6410 triple quad lc ms compounds were separated with a luna 5 μm c18 2 250 4 6 mm column phenomenex 2 3 transcriptional studies the total rna of the 20 larvae per treatment distributed in four independent rna extracting procedures each with 5 larvae from the 10 day exposure tests was isolated using trizol reagent invitrogen germany following the manufacturer s protocol afterwards rna was treated with rnase free dnase roche germany and extracted with phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol fluka germany using 5prime phase lock gel light tubes quantabio usa purified rna was resuspended in rnase free water quantified by spectrophotometry at 260 nm using a biophotometer eppendorf germany and stored at 80 c for each sample 7 μg of isolated rna were used for retrotranscription using iscript reverse transcription supermix for rt qpcr bio rad according to the manufacturer s instructions the obtained cdna was stored at 80 c and used as the template for the subsequent qpcr analyses the expression profiles of ecr err e75 vtg hsp70 hsc70 hsp24 hsp10 gp93 gstd3 gpx and cyp4g were analysed by real time pcr quantitative real time pcr rt qpcr was carried out in a cfx96 real time detection system bio rad using the quantimix easy kit biotools spain genes encoding actin and the 26s ribosomal subunit were used as endogenous references quantitative real time pcr rt qpcr was run as described in herrero et al 2018 the primer sequences are shown in the supplementary material table sm1 the mrna level of each target gene was normalised against the expression of the two reference genes and the 2 δδct method was used to analyse relative changes in gene expression with the cfx96 real time detection system and the cfx manager 3 1 software biorad each sample was run in duplicate wells technical replicates 2 4 statistical analyses the data of the apical endpoints development rate emergence ratio and fecundity showed normal distributions kolmorov smirnov test and only the emergence ratio variable did not show variance homogeneity levene test a one way anova was applied for the other two variables development rate and fecundity to discern statistically significant differences among effects possibly due to treatments finally t tests were performed to study which of the treatments including control f differed significantly from the control and if the treatments with fortifications frw cbz rw and tcs rw differed from control f no significant differences were found for any apical endpoints when comparisons were made using rw and frw as reference controls the relative expression of each target gene was calculated with a one way anova and duncan s new multiple range tests p 0 05 the normality and homoscedasticity of data were assessed by shapiro wilk s test and levene s test respectively as the data were neither homogeneous nor normally distributed kruskal wallis test was used and the differences of pairs from the control control f rw and frw were established by mann whitney s tests p 0 05 3 results 3 1 results of the analytical measurements table 1 summarises the concentrations of the 23 selected emerging pollutants measured in rw the cbz average concentration of the three collected rw samples was 74 ng l and the tcs concentration was below the detection limit the three highest pollutant concentrations ranged between 1 1 and 0 28 μg l and corresponded to three pharmaceuticals two antihypertensive drugs hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol and one analgesic drug ibuprofen the other analysed compounds were below 0 1 μg l fig 1 shows the cbz and tcs overlying water concentrations for the 3 measurement days days 7 14 and 21 along with the cbz tcs sediment concentrations at the end of the test day 21 cbz and tcs were also measured in freshly prepared single and binary fortifications average concentrations 104 μg l cbz and 26 μg l tcs and in overlying water after renewal the total recovery from the water sediment systems was lower in the tcs treatments 43 36 and 40 for control f frw and tcs rw respectively than in the cbz treatments 89 85 and 69 for control f frw and cbz rw respectively sorption to sediment was much higher for tcs than for cbz which was expected according to their log kow see the introduction the average percentages measured in sediments in relation to the total recovered amounts were 11 73 100 μg kg and 63 36 55 μg kg for cbz and tcs respectively in fact the tcs concentrations in the overlying water remained low throughout the test 2 8 5 1 μg l the cbz overlying water concentrations remained almost steady but exceeded the nominal concentration 110 164 μg l especially in frw on day 7 this can be explained by cbz desorption from sediment after overlying water renewal 3 2 developmental and reproductive endpoints the one way anova of the pool data run by setting the treatment level as a factor showed no significant differences for any apical endpoint although the development rate was almost significant f 2 7 p 0 07 df 17 the development rate of cbz rw and tcs rw varied significantly compared to the control fig 2 a emergence ratio was similar for the control and control f fig 2b while a slight increase took place after fortification control f the opposite effect was observed with rw and frw as a lower emergence ratio was observed in frw than in rw rw and its single fortifications had similar emergence ratios the one way anova performed by setting the treatment level with the pool data of fortifications control f tcs rw cbz rw and frw gave significant differences for both the development rate f 4 02 p 0 05 df 11 and fecundity f 5 95 p 0 05 df 11 regarding the fecundity results the rw fortifications with tcs tcs rw cbz cbz rw or with their binary mixture control f and frw did not significantly vary from the control fig 2c however significant differences were observed for fecundity and the development rate compared to control f cbz rw had significant effects on both endpoints development rate and fecundity while all the fortifications frw cbz rw and tcs rw significantly affected fecundity in relation to control f 3 3 gene expression variations for the transcriptional activity studies alterations in the expression profiles of the ecdysone related genes were observed most significant differences were observed in the larvae exposed to treatments with fortifications the gene coding for the ecdysone receptor ecr fig 3 a was significantly up regulated in the larvae exposed to frw cbz rw and tcs rw with a mean increase in relation to the control of up to 3 8 fold and 2 fold in frw and cbz rw respectively a concomitant albeit non statistically significant tendency was also observed in the e75 gene an early response gene of the ecdysone related pathway fig 3c in contrast no significant alteration was observed in the transcriptional activity of the oestrogen related receptor err fig 3b finally the results of the effector gene of the ecdysone related pathway vtg showed statistically significant increases in mrna abundance in the larvae exposed to rw up to 2 4 fold frw and tcs rw fig 3d the hsps genes generally showed a similar trend under the different conditions and were induced significantly under most studied conditions versus the different controls fig 3e h the response of the genes in the larvae exposed to rw was always less marked than the fortifications the rw condition was able to induce a significant up regulation of the stress response via hsp70 and its constitutive form hsc70 compared to the control fig 3e and f fortifications significantly increased the gene expression of hsp70 with mean values of up to 34 fold 15 fold and 4 5 fold for frw cbz rw and tcs rw respectively in contrast the genes coding for small hsps hsp24 and hsp10 were not affected in rw fig 3g and h while the fortification conditions induced a significant overexpression the highest of which was for the frw condition frw cbz rw tcs rw in terms of detoxification processes a similar response and tendency to those followed by the hsps genes were observed in gstd3 and cyp4g with mean significant overexpression values of up to 1 8 fold and 3 3 fold for the frw condition respectively fig 3j and l in contrast gpx remained constant except for control f and tcs rw whose expression activity was significantly induced fig 3k finally the induction of gp93 activity was significant only after the exposure to the binary fortification in rw frw 4 discussion major advances have been made since angelakis et al 1999 reviewed the status of rw uses and existing guidelines around the mediterranean basin at that time no wastewater reuse regulation existed in europe nevertheless the first steps towards a european regulatory and institutional framework were already ongoing in particular rw requirements have been proposed for water reuse for both agricultural irrigation and managed aquifer recharging alcalde sanz and gawlik 2017 despite it being well accepted that environmental uses need less restrictive regulations about rw quality standards than those posing a direct indirect public health risk the practice of developing guidelines must be extended to rw uses in environmental improvement programmes to protect wildlife both required treatment levels and recommended values are important aspects to consider when developing rw use guidelines li et al 2009 most of the specific values developed for rw quality standards are microbial indicators chhipi shrestha et al 2017 turbidity nutrient parameters and limit concentrations of some inorganic metals and organic pollutants jeong et al 2016 müller and cornel 2016 nevertheless no existing guideline considers criteria for emerging contaminants which often exist in effluents and are of potential concern yuang et al 2017 the spanish criteria adopted for urban agricultural industrial recreational and environmental rw reuses are based on microbial helminthic indicators turbidity and nutrient parameters while a case by case assessment is stated for other contaminants boe 2007 this study and other spanish ones conducted for monitoring programmes have shown that emerging pollutants are present at low concentrations in rw and only a few cases exceed 0 1 μg l teijon et al 2010 estévez et al 2012 pablos et al 2018 concentrations above 0 5 or even 1 μg l are rarely detected for frequently used drugs which was the case of the antihypertensive hydrochlorothiazide drug detected in this study rw use to maintain a spanish river flow rate led to an increase in concentrations of pharmaceuticals albeit a negligible one in ecotoxicological assessment terms lópez serna et al 2012 we must bear in mind that in line with european legislation an environmental effect analysis is required for the pharmaceuticals found in ambient water at concentrations above 0 01 μg l emea 2018 lack of quality standards along with concern about the mixture effects of emerging pollutants in rw can be managed by prioritising chemicals on which to focus rw hazard assessments drewers et al 2013 this study focused on two emerging pollutants of concern with sediment affinity cbz and tcs the environmental presence of cbz may be linked to its abundant use and inefficient removal cbz has been found in effluents 4 6 μg l untreated drinking water supplies 0 61 μg l and ambient water 0 5 1 μg l after the infiltration of secondary effluent via wetlands wintgens et al 2008 yaun et al 2017 the cbz herein detected 74 ng l was similar to the concentrations reported in different rws and even from other countries teijon et al 2010 li et al 2015 cbz was proposed as a substance subject to review its possible identification as a priority substance epc 2007 for all these reasons we identified it as a sewage marker tcs was not herein detected in reclaimed water but its presence in reclaimed water at low concentrations 24 ng l has been described by pablos et al 2018 although tcs can be efficiently removed from wastewater tcs residuals were still detected in effluents within the 2 2 ng l to 47800 ng l range and also in surface water between 1 4 and 40000 ng l thomaidi et al 2017 parenti et al 2019 as tcs is on the list of the 10 most frequently detected organic micropollutants in the environment it should be considered a candidate for monitoring and prioritisation besides some examples for deriving tcs water quality criteria have been proposed hill et al 2018 the release of tcs into the environment is connected to mostly wastewater and may have long term adverse effects on aquatic organisms ding et al 2018 however very little is known about the fate and behaviour of tcs in sediments the total recovery of tcs in this study after 21 days was around 40 of the amount applied in fortifications which comes close to that observed by huang et al 2014 who found a tcs half life from 32 to 62 days in water sediment systems the sediment concentrations for tcs measured in this study 36 55 μg kg fell within the range of environmental concentrations in sediments for example tcs levels in brazilian marine sediments are quantified at 15 μg kg pusceddu et al 2017 at 53 μg kg in swiss lake sediments at 35 7 μg kg in spanish sediments and in the order of tens to 100 μg kg in japanese sediments tamura et al 2013 tcs showed a strong affinity to sediment because 63 of all that spiked in overlying water was found in sediment which agrees with previous observations huang et al 2014 2015 cbz showed less partitioning to sediment and only 11 of all that applied by spiking overlying water was found in sediment this can be explained by its low hydrophobicity and or uncharged form at typical phs of natural water or rw martínez hernández et al 2014 the presence of transformation cbz products in river sediment has been described azuma et al 2017 vulliet et al 2014 observed cbz concentrations within a similar range 31 μg kg as that measured herein 73 100 μg kg finally cbz can be considered persistent and non sorptive in sediment which falls in line with radke and maier 2014 and would explain the cbz partitioning observed from sediment after overlying water renewal which would thus allow higher cbz water concentrations than nominal ones while testing in spite of cbz and tcs being present in sediment very few studies have addressed their risk assessment for benthic invertebrates nieto et al 2017 heye et al 2016 pusceddu et al 2017 together with chemical prioritisation bioanalytical methods should be applied to make hazard assessments of complex mixtures furthermore bioassays can act as a powerful method to detect hazards induced by using rw in the environment mano et al 2017 research into pollution from using rw requires sediment studies as the mobility of micropollutants in rw discharged to aquatic environments depends essentially on both their sorption into and desorption from sediments martínez hernández et al 2014 recently ao et al 2018 observed that rw replenishment presents a significant impact from pond sediment as far as we know this is the only study to evaluate the effects of rw by a laboratory water sediment test we combined molecular biomarkers and apical endpoints using the sediment dwelling organism c riparius in molecular terms the expression profiles of the different evaluated genes were affected by exposure to either rw or its fortification but this was not the case with apical endpoints as their statistically significant differences were observed only after rw fortification in spite of the reduction observed in development rate and fecundity after exposure to rw not statistical differences appeared in relation to both controls control and control f the expression of the ecdysone receptor gene ecr a well known biomarker of endocrine disruption and the early response gene of the ecdysone pathway e75 was analysed as they are two key genes involved in the control of insect development alterations in the ecdysone pathway could ultimately affect ecdysteroids such as 20 hydroxyecdysone the active form of ecdysone that controls moulting and metamorphosis in insects henrich et al 1999 as well as tissue and body growth lin and smagghe 2018 thus development rate could be ecdysone dependent at the individual level in our study the single rw fortifications cbz rw and tcs rw led to the up regulation of ecr and e75 and also cut the larval development time development rate which reinforces the idea that the regulation of c riparius development is mediated by ecdysone the less marked reduction in development rate by the binary mixture suggests an antogonic effect which could not be mediated by ecr heye et al 2016 have concluded that the binding affinity of cbz to ecr is very low but this affirmation was based on qualitative calculations using classic molecular dynamics simulations martínez paz et al 2017 have demonstrated the activation of ecr in c riparius by tcs water exposures at 1000 μg l herein we demonstrated a quantitative increase in the ecr transcription induced by cbz and tcs single and binary fortifications when added to rw but this effect was not observed for control f presence of cbz and tcs without rw this scenario allows to conclude that the agonist action of fortifications on ecr could be increased by the synergistic action of an extremely variable amount of compounds present in rw as observed by the dramatic induction of hsp70 in frw the synergetic effects of rw after fortification with other emerging pollutants have been observed in a previous rw effect based assessment aquilino et al 2018 despite the effect of single rw fortification on development rate it was not reflected in the emergence ratio which was the same for all the treatments and became even lower for the controls lower sediment cbz concentrations 38 ng kg than those measured at the end of this study 73 100 μg kg had no effect on the emergence ratio of c riparius er nieto et al 2017 with tcs the emergence ratio of chironomus sp lowered for sediment concentrations above 10 mg kg tamura et al 2013 which are much higher than the concentrations herein measured 11 24 μg kg after reaching sexual maturity the reproductive success of all species including insects relies on vitellogenin biosynthesis and its uptake in developing oocytes ecdysteroids also regulate vitellogenin in body fat throughout a conserved set of ecdysone responsive early and early late genes swevers and iatrou 2009 the concomitant up regulation observed in the ecdysone responsive early e75 gene and the vitellogenin gene vtg suggests that the ecdysone signalling pathway was affected downstream as vitellus is the main energy source to fuel embryo development this may result in significant reproductive impairment roy et al 2007 as it might affect yolk synthesis and egg production vtg expression and fecundity profiles were inversely associated in this study as vtg up regulation led to reduced egg production as far as we know no previous studies have compared vtg gene expression and the fecundity of c riparius impaired fecundity could not therefore be due to defective vtg transcription but there could be other causes such as defective vitellogenesis or disturbed uptake of vtg into oocytes as proposed by hagele 1990 finally stress response genes hsps genes and the gene expression of gstd3 and cyp4g involved in biotransformation processes showed a similar tendency to that observed for ecr and vtg in binary and single rw fortifications these findings agree with previous authors insights into the usefulness of transcriptional data for ecotoxicity testing with c riparius marinkovic et al 2012b lencioni et al 2016 particularly ecr expression as a target for moulting disruption in arthropods song et al 2017 5 conclusion the development of quality rw standards poses a challenge mainly for its content in a complex mixture of micropollutants herein 20 of the 23 screened emerging pollutants were detected in rw within the detection limit 10 exceeded 0 01 μg l and three exceeded 0 1 μg l hydrochlorothiazide atenolol ibuprofen this study tackles the potential impact of rw use on a sediment organism c riparius with an effect based assessment for the first time it followed the same approach that we used in a previous rw effect based assessment for water column organisms which consisted in 1 examining a range of endpoints at different biological organisation levels after exposure to rw 2 extending the study with rw fortifications addition of cbz tcs and their binary mixture exposure to rw produced statistical effects but only at the molecular level hsps and vtg which indicates that rw use did not compromise c riparius growth and reproduction cbz and tcs added to the fortifications reached environmentally relevant concentrations in sediment and altered both gene expression and developmental reproductive endpoints when used for rw fortification in these cases the comparisons made between both biological levels of response showed that ecr can act as a good biomarker and that it is able to predict larval development and fecundity effect this suggests that ecologically relevant responses in insects can be mediated by this receptor exactly as many studies have proposed finally lack of effects for the binary mixture cbz and tcs together in a medium test unlike its effects in frw suggests that the major concern about rw uses is apparently associated with the synergisms between this complex matrix and other pollutants that may be present in the environment where applying rw this finding allowed us to conclude that ecotoxicity testing can be an effective tool to help identify hazards associated with environmental rw uses declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17902,the effects on the activity of anaerobic digestion ad of interactions between extracellular polymeric substances eps a protective barrier of microorganisms towards toxic compounds and nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi remain incompletely understood in this work eps induced a dosage dependent dispersion of nzvi clusters due to their effective accumulation on the nzvi surface the small size of nzvi clusters and the formation of stable fe eps complex promoted the dissolution of nzvi with a final increase of 15 20 h2 yield further characterizations of eps demonstrated the presence of some semiquinones like riboflavin which may work as a sink to accept electrons from nzvi this likely explains the eps dosage related reduction of h2 release rate in the initial stage and the possible decrease in nzvi reducibility responsible for disrupting cell integrity interactions between nzvi and eps could improve the electrochemical activity of eps favoring microbial extracellular electron transfer therefore the presence of eps at relatively higher concentrations may 1 reduce the inhibition of nzvi to ad process by avoiding the fast accumulation of h2 and restricting damage to cell integrity 2 benefit the methanogenesis process by providing more exogenous h2 from complete nzvi dissolution with higher electrochemical activity of eps this study provides insight into the interactions between eps and nanoparticles with strong reducibility in biological wastewater treatment systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords extracellular polymeric substances nanoscale zero valent iron interactions anaerobic digestion h2 release 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a series of biological processes in which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen ad is one of the most widely used and cost effective processes for high strength wastewater treatment and renewable energy recovery ganzoury and allam 2015 ma et al 2013 and requires the functions of microorganisms which are typically present in either floccular or granular forms due to its superior reactivity strong reducibility and environmental friendliness nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been the most commonly used nanomaterial in the united states and europe for groundwater remediation and wastewater treatment lefevre et al 2016 yang et al 2013 in particular nzvi is often directly injected into the pollution zone for in situ remediation xie et al 2017 given its growing recent use there have been an increasing number of studies investigating the effects of nzvi on the activity of ad some reports describe nzvi as a promising candidate to improve methane yield of ad due to the release of h2 from nzvi corrosion oxidation to boost the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis process hu et al 2015 and or an effect to promote the growth of microorganisms via decreasing the oxidative reductive potential orp of the anaerobic system li et al 2019 however a dose dependent inhibition of methane generation was observed for anaerobic flocs exposed to nzvi with fast h2 generation and accumulation during nzvi dissolution as well as the reductive decomposition of bacterial cell membrane after direct contact with nzvi huang et al 2016b yang et al 2013 extracellular polymeric substances eps are macromolecular biopolymers produced by activated sludge as a result of active secretion cell lysis and adsorbed organic matters from the wastewater seviour et al 2019 wei et al 2012 the total mass of eps varies with sludge type and growth conditions within 80 of the sludge mass affecting its flocculation settling and dewatering characteristics huangfu et al 2019 wei et al 2012 eps are commonly composed of high molecular weight polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids humic acids and phospholipids which can contain charged functional groups like carboxyl amine hydroxyl phosphoryl and phosphate groups adeleye et al 2014 adeleye and keller 2016 henriques and love 2007 eps on the surface of bacteria can interact with hydrophobic and positively charged toxins to protect the bacteria in activated sludge from the attack of some toxic compounds via reducing their bioavailability adeleye and keller 2014 interactions between nanoparticles nps and hydrophobic fractions present in the eps would modify the surface properties affect the surface valence and change the electrostatic repulsion force of nps and thus influence their overall stability adeleye and keller 2014 henriques and love 2007 huangfu et al 2019 the effect of eps on the stability of engineered nps was proposed to be nanomaterial chemical composition and coating specific adeleye and keller 2016 but this has not been assessed in nzvi systems the importance of h2 release rate and reducibility of nzvi were mentioned above but particular considerations must also be given to evaluate the effect of eps on the corrosion of nzvi the proteins and humic substances in eps are both strong ligands for metal ions sheng et al 2013 which may facilitate the possible complexing of eps with fe2 released from nzvi dissolution this complexing might suppress the formation and aggregation of iron corrosion passivation products and thus partially affect the rates of nzvi corrosion and h2 release karlsson and persson 2012 in addition some components of eps such as humic acid and riboflavin can work as electron acceptors chen et al 2014 suggesting that the eps likely could accept electrons from nzvi and consequently reduce electron transfer from nzvi to h particularly our previous study has implied that surrounded eps located outer surface of anaerobic granule might play an important role in weakening the toxicity of nzvi to anaerobic microorganisms he et al 2017 however more studies are required to systematically understand how and which components of eps affect the fate and the toxicity of nzvi under anaerobic conditions which would help to effectively utilize the advantages of nzvi but evade its drawbacks in enhancing the ad performance the goal of this study was to comprehensively explore the interactions between eps derived from anaerobic sludge and nzvi at neutral ph in respective of their potential in affecting the ad activity the stability corrosion degree and h2 release of nzvi were investigated at the presence and absence of eps next the structural responses and electrochemical activity of eps after exposure to nzvi were carefully studied by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectrometry ftir three dimensional excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eem ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis and cyclic voltammetry cv based on the results the inherent mechanisms of eps that affect nzvi fate and their interactions in potentially affecting the ad process were finally discussed this study provides a better understanding of the roles of eps in protecting microbial cells against nps with strong reducibility in biological wastewater treatment systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 eps extraction and characterization anaerobic sludge was sampled from a mesophilic full scale expanded sludge bed reactor treating starch wastewater with a treatment capacity of about 1200 m3 d binzhou china eps was immediately extracted from the obtained sludge via heating method as described previously wang et al 2009b previous studies have revealed that all the methods used to extract eps from activated sludge including cation exchange resin cer formaldehyde hcho sodium hydroxide naoh ethanol edta heating sonication centrifugation and their combination cannot avoid the simultaneous cell lysis d abzac et al 2010 hong et al 2017 however it was found that heating method could acquire high extraction efficiency of eps with less cell lysis among these methods after comparison hong et al 2017 therefore the heating method was chosen in this study in order to minimize the effect of intracellular material on the composition of eps briefly the sludge was washed three times with 0 9 nacl after being dewatered by centrifugation in a 50 ml tube at 8000 rpm for 5 min the sludge pellet in the tube was subsequently resuspended in 15 ml of 0 9 nacl solution subjected to heat treatment at 80 c for 1 h and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min the total eps material was obtained after collecting the centrifuged supernatant removing any microorganisms by passing through a 0 22 μm filter and then stored at 20 c after freeze drying the concentration of organic carbon in the eps solution was measured with a total organic carbon toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena germany polysaccharides proteins and humic substances present in the eps extracted material were quantified by the phenol sulfuric acid method by comparison to glucose as the standard a bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china and a modified lowry method respectively he et al 2017 sheng et al 2008 the zeta potential of eps was determined using a nanosized zs instrument malvern instruments co uk xps escalab 250 thermo fisher scientific usa was applied to determine the bond states and the relative contents of c n and o elements in the eps 2 2 nzvi stability and dissolution determination at the presence of eps the nzvi used in this study were freshly prepared by liquid phase reduction method as detailed in our previous study he et al 2017 the synthesized nanoparticles suspension was diluted with deoxygenated water to 20 g l and stored in an anaerobic chamber shellab bactron ez usa for further use the characterization of freshly prepared nzvi was described previously he et al 2017 as shown in fig s1 the size of individual particles was in the range of 20 100 nm assessed by transmission electron microscope tem jem 2011 jeol ltd japan image analysis before the experiments freeze dried eps samples were dissolved in deionized water to final concentrations of 5 13 10 26 20 52 51 30 and 102 60 c mg l the initial ph of the eps solution was adjusted to 7 3 by addition of 0 2 m hcl or naoh the zeta ζ potential and z average size of nzvi in the absence and presence of eps 5 13 102 60 mg c l were recorded via the nanosized zs instrument each test was repeated at least three times to explore the effect of eps on the corrosion process of nzvi 100 ml samples of eps at different concentrations 0 102 6 mg c l were separately added into 250 ml serum bottles and purged with high purity n2 for 30 min to remove the oxygen to avoid potential interference of nacl since 0 9 nacl solution was used when extracting the eps nacl solutions at concentrations corresponding to those contained in 0 102 6 mg c l eps were used as control samples the serum bottles were then transferred into the anaerobic chamber for the addition of 1 0 g l nzvi and were immediately sealed tightly with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps afterwards the following reactions were conducted in an air bath shaker at a mild operating temperature 35 c and 200 rpm with a light shield each experiment was repeated in triplicate gas liquid and solids samples were periodically acquired for analysis the collected iron residues were freeze dried for subsequent iron speciation transformation analysis by x ray diffraction xrd ttr iii rigaku japan with a 2θ range from 30 60 for gas chromatography analysis 0 5 ml headspace gas was removed using a gas tight syringe for h2 analysis by gas chromatograph lunan co model sp 6800a china zhang et al 2012 the mole amount of ch4 generated was calculated based on the measured partial pressure of ch4 he et al 2017 due to the rapid hydrogen production from nzvi dissolution and the extremely low solubility of hydrogen in water 2 mg l the following model from borja et al 1995 was applied to estimate the cumulative h2 generation process 1 v t v m 1 е kt where v m mmol is the maximum h2 yield obtained at an infinite reaction time v t mmol represents the cumulative h2 volume at a given time t d and k d 1 is the kinetic constant for h2 generation the parameters v m and k were determined by fitting the model to the experimental data using origin pro8 2 3 eps characterization after exposure to nzvi the acquired liquid samples after filtration during the reaction of eps with nzvi were used to analyze the variations of protein polysaccharides and humic acid in eps according to the methods described in section 2 1 the samples were collected and filtered in an anaerobic chamber and then measured by uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent usa and eem spectrophotometer aqualog horiba scientific usa lu et al 2014 meng et al 2016 the uv vis spectra were recorded with absorbance scanning from 190 to 600 nm and presented as absorbance eem spectra were obtained with subsequent scanning emission spectra from 300 to 550 nm at 0 5 nm increments by varying the excitation wavelength from 250 to 450 nm at 5 nm increments wang et al 2019 additionally cv was carried out using a bio logic vmp3 electrochemical workstation france between voltages 0 0 and 1 0 v vs ag agcl at a scan rate of 5 mv s to explore the electrochemical behavior of eps before and after reaction with nzvi chen et al 2014 the residues after 7 d reaction were lyophilized and analyzed by xps and ftir nicolet 8700 thermo scientific instrument co u s a in absorbance mode 16 scans in the range 4000 400 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 wang et al 2020 note that during preliminary measurements we found that the fluorescent intensities of samples with 102 6 mg c l eps were too high to be reliable when conducting the eem tests therefore a much lower concentration of 20 52 mg c l was adopted during the eem tests of eps while 102 6 mg c l was used as a representative in other analysis 2 4 interaction between eps and fe2 since fe2 is generated during nzvi dissolution under anaerobic conditions the capacity of eps to complex with fe2 was next investigated to do this 3 mm feso4 and 102 6 mg c l eps were mixed in serum bottles and the ph was adjusted to 6 0 to prevent the precipitation of fe2 the uv vis and eem spectra of eps were determined during the reaction according to the methods provided in section 2 3 the binding capacity of eps with aqueous fe2 was analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry itc on an itc 200 calorimeter microcal co usa sheng et al 2013 briefly 3 mm fe2 and 102 6 mg c l eps solutions were separately centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatants were collected experiments were carried out in a titration cell with a working volume of 250 μl at 25 c with magnetica stirring at a rate of 300 rpm the fe2 solution was slowly titrated into the eps solution with 120 s between each injection non linear fitting analysis of the raw data was performed using origin 8 5 to determine the molar heat of fe2 binding to eps δh and the binding constant indicating the affinity of the binding sites k sheng et al 2013 3 results 3 1 properties of eps from anaerobic sludge in this study 102 6 mg c l extracted eps consisted of 99 3 2 7 mg l protein 22 6 0 6 mg l polysaccharides and 66 8 3 1 mg l humic acid the extracted eps fraction had an average ζ potential of 25 5 1 0 mv the atomic compositions of c o and n were estimated as 67 51 20 65 and 11 84 respectively as illustrated in fig 1 a the c 1s signal was resolved into three component peaks the peaks at 284 8 47 42 286 2 31 70 and 288 2 ev 20 88 were respectively attributed to the c c h in side chains of lipids or amino acids c o n in the form of ether ethanol or amine and co o c o which is commonly observed in carboxylic esters carbonyls amides acetals or semiacetals ding et al 2018 song et al 2014 the o 1s signal contained two peaks at 531 5 and 532 5 ev fig 1c which are associated with co and c oh c o respectively ding et al 2018 song et al 2014 fig 1e clearly shows the presence of two n 1s peaks the n 1s peak at 400 1 ev correlated to nonprotonated nitrogen nnonprotonated which is commonly found in amines and amides yuan et al 2010 the second n 1s peak at 401 5 ev is related to protonated nitrogen nprotonated from amino acids and amino sugars yuan et al 2010 3 2 effect of eps on size and surface charge of nzvi the adsorption of various materials e g ions biomolecules polymers and colloids onto the surface of engineered nps often influences their surface charge resulting in altered stability in different media henriques and love 2007 as illustrated in fig 2 the ζ potential of nzvi showed a gradual decrease from 16 9 to 22 4 mv at the presence of 0 20 5 mg c l eps and then showed little additional change as eps concentration further increased to 51 3 and 102 6 mg c l the ζ potential decline of nzvi suggests that eps might impart negative charges to the surface of nzvi wang et al 2015 moreover the z average size of nzvi clusters significantly decreased from 862 2 54 6 to 425 0 35 1 nm when eps was increased from 0 to 102 6 mg c l indicating partial dispersion of nzvi clusters at the presence of eps the easier dispersion and smaller size of nzvi clusters might result from increased electrostatic and steric repulsion between nzvi and surface accumulated eps adeleye et al 2014 wang et al 2015 3 3 effect of eps on nzvi dissolution accumulation of high partial pressures of h2 as a result of fast h2 release from nzvi dissolution would inhibit methanogenesis yang et al 2013 to investigate this further the h2 release was measured after exposure of nzvi to varied concentrations of eps and the results are presented in fig 3 compared to the theoretical h2 generation 1 79 mmol estimated by the complete dissolution of 1 g l nzvi the measured 1 13 1 17 mmol of h2 obtained in control systems reveals 63 65 of h2 recovery efficiency from nzvi dissolution consistent with the results of a previous report huang et al 2016b eq 1 was adopted to analyze the h2 release rate and the results displayed in table s1 demonstrated that the h2 generation in control systems fit well to first order kinetics as indicated by a high r2 value regardless of initial nacl concentration the h2 release rates in control systems showed little change with an average value of 0 11 0 006 d 1 table s1 interestingly the addition of eps exhibited dosage dependent inhibition of h2 generation in the first few days but with further continuous h2 release when the h2 production became stable in control systems the kinetic constant for h2 generation was 0 10 d 1 after addition of 10 26 mg c l eps but could not be estimated when eps concentration increased to 20 52 mg c l and higher as attributed by initially slowing of h2 release surprisingly the final cumulative h2 amounts at the presence of 10 26 20 52 51 30 and 102 6 mg c l eps were 1 29 0 06 1 32 0 11 1 38 0 03 and 1 40 0 05 mmol respectively which are almost 15 20 higher than that in the corresponding control systems the solid phase transformation of nzvi over 15 d of reaction was investigated via xrd analysis the resultant xrd spectra of the control systems suggested incomplete fe0 dissolution and the appearance of iron oxide hydrate fig 4 which should be the oxidative products of fe oh 2 produced by exposure to air during sample collection and analysis as the released fe2 is easily hydrolyzed to the precipitation of iron related oxides on the nzvi surface at experimental ph the inner fe0 is readily deactivated with incomplete fe0 dissolution and lower h2 recovery efficiency compared to the efficiency at the presence of eps as presented in fig 3 however the presence of eps increased the dissolution of fe0 throughout the process with the total disappearance of the fe0 peak after a 15 d reaction 3 4 effect of nzvi on the properties of eps 3 4 1 variation of eps components as illustrated in fig 5 proteins polysaccharides and humic substance concentrations decreased by 15 4 26 7 and 14 5 respectively after exposure to 1 g l nzvi for 1 day the concentrations of the three components subsequently reduced slowly over the next 20 days and gradually stabilized at 65 53 and 80 respectively of the initial concentration as shown in fig s2 only 1 1 3 1 proteins polysaccharides and humic substance decreased after a 20 day incubation of eps in the absence of nzvi as a consequent the significant reduction in the concentration of eps components in fig 5 might ascribe to the reaction between nzvi and eps or adsorption of eps onto the iron oxide surface due to the complex interaction between eps and positively charged fe2 3 4 2 ftir results the chemical functional groups of eps are the binding sites that interact with metal ions mu et al 2012 so the possible variations of the functional groups in eps after reaction with nzvi were therefore explored by ftir spectra characterization as depicted in fig s3 and table s2 amide ii band of protein shifted from 1535 to 1543 cm 1 the c o bond in polysaccharides shifted from 1110 to 1080 cm 1 and the peak at 1240 cm 1 associated with the vibration or deformation of co significantly decreased after addition of nzvi particles these changes may reflect strong interactions between iron ions or oxides and the corresponding functional groups in eps he et al 2017 mu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 3 4 3 three dimensional excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eem is a rapid and sensitive technique that was applied to rapidly characterize interaction between the fluorescence compounds present in eps and nzvi zhen et al 2012 two peaks located at ex em wavelengths of 279 360 nm peak a and 396 468 nm peak b were observed in pristine eps fig 6 a indicative of the presence of tryptophan like and humic acid like substances chen et al 2003 wang et al 2009b zhang et al 2010 as shown in fig 6b at the presence of nzvi peak b disappeared and the intensity of peak a exhibited an approximate 9 fold increase relative to control eps table 2 two additional peaks appeared in the nzvi treated eps sample peak c ex em of 354 445 nm and peak d ex em of 249 446 nm which represent visible humic acid like and fulvic acid like fluorescence respectively appearance of peak c can be regarded as the result of blue shift of peak b along the excitation and emission axis which has been observed during photocatalytic removal of humic acid ha uyguner and bekbolet 2005 valencia et al 2013 a blue shift in this study might be associated with the break up of ha into smaller fragments the decrease of conjugated bonds or and elimination of some functional groups like carbonyl hydroxyl groups in ha valencia et al 2013 wang et al 2009a furthermore the complexation of eps with metal ions would be predicted to promote fluorescence quenching sheng et al 2013 however the substantial increase in the fluorescence intensity of peak c compared with peak b further support the decreased molecular weight of ha after treatment of nzvi since fluorescence intensity per weight concentration unit of ha was previously discovered to increase with the reduction in molecular weight hayase and tsubota 1985 more importantly it s found that an increase in intensity of fluorescent peaks would be occurred after electrochemical reduction of humic substance fimmen et al 2007 in general these changes of the eem spectra suggest that the addition of nzvi might result in structural changes in the fluorescent humic compounds due to effects of the chemical activity of nzvi cai et al 2018 3 4 4 xps results high resolution spectra of c1s o1s and n1s regions of eps with and without nzvi treatment were determined and are shown in fig 1 with the peak integration results presented in table 1 the binding energies of c1s at 284 8 and 286 2 ev transformed into 248 6 and 285 2 ev respectively with a slight decrease observed at binding energy of nnonprotonated from 400 1 to 399 9 ev after treatment with nzvi these shifts may be explained by increases in the electronic density around the c atoms in c c h and c o n and the n atoms in nnonprotonated probably arising from the electron draining from fe0 or fe2 sun et al 2009 the decrease of c atomic content in c c h from 50 6 to 35 4 of o atomic content in c o c or c o h from 30 3 to 5 6 and the disappearance of nprotonated signal suggest the possible complexation of these groups with fe2 agreeing well with the ftir results 3 4 5 uv vis analysis of eps uv vis spectra of eps were obtained over seven days to spectroscopically observe changes during nzvi treatment fig 7 a two apparent absorption bonds located at 200 215 nm and 245 290 nm were identified in the spectra the absorbance within the 200 215 nm range is usually attributed to π σ and or π π transitions of amide carboxyl carbonyl bonds lu et al 2014 the 245 290 nm wavelength area commonly is correlated with n π and π π electron transition of co and cc structure of aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine lu et al 2014 meng et al 2016 after nzvi treatment the intensities of the two adsorption bonds decreased as the reaction time increased from 0 to 7 days fig 7a supporting the ftir finding that eps can complex with fe2 via amide carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups meng et al 2016 interestingly the absorption peak at 425 nm shown in the inset of fig 7a decreased in intensity after exposure of eps to nzvi together with an increase in the absorption peak between 370 and 355 nm these changes are consistent with the transformation of oxidized riboflavin to its reduced form chen et al 2014 3 4 6 electrochemical properties of eps in order to explore the effect of nzvi on the redox activity of eps cyclic voltamograms of 102 6 mg c l pristine eps and eps after nzvi treatment for 1 and 7 days were obtained although fe2 possessing redox activity would be generated during nzvi dissolution under anaerobic conditions it should be noted that the interference of fe2 could be excluded during cv measurements of eps after nzvi treatment because the released fe2 was readily precipitated under the experimental ph 7 3 and then removed during collection of the supernatant as indicated in fig s4 as shown in fig 8 the reductive and oxidative peaks of pristine eps were barely detectable but the reductive peak currents of eps after exposure to nzvi for 1 and 7 days were 13 5 and 30 5 μa respectively suggesting enhanced electrochemical activity of eps due to the presence of nzvi the pair of reversible faradaic peaks centered at 535 mv vs ag agcl kcl sat correspond to those of riboflavin as observed previously pinto et al 2018 the enhanced currents manifest that the presence of nzvi caused the exposure of more riboflavin allowing increased interaction with the electrode or accelerated electron transfer between riboflavin and the electrode however conductive iron oxide such as fe3o4 was not detected during nzvi dissolution fig 4 and the increase in current together with fe0 decrease on day 7 indicate that the introduction of conductive materials by adding nzvi to accelerate electron transfer is not an effective strategy the effective binding of released fe2 with proteins and polysaccharides that might block the riboflavin or damage eps structure via the strong reducibility of nzvi as observed in eem spectra fig 6 would promote exposure of more riboflavin 3 5 interaction between eps and fe2 the results presented above highlighted the importance of binding between eps and iron ions produced during nzvi corrosion so itc analysis was next conducted to estimate the thermodynamic parameters for this process fig s5a shows that a clear thermopositive peak was observed after injection of fe2 into eps solution non linear regression analysis of heat vs fe2 dosage fig s5b allows the calculation of the mean binding capacity n binding enthalpy δh and binding constant k for the binding of fe2 to various compounds in eps as 2 45 0 137 mmol g 2 75 0 129 kj mol and 1 03 0 056 103 l mol respectively table s3 the negative value of δh indicates that reaction between eps and fe2 is an exothermic reaction applying the equation δg rtlnk the change of gibbs energy of the binding between eps and fe2 was calculated as 17 19 0 134 kj mol revealing that the binding reaction was thermodynamically favorable with formation of a stable fe2 eps complex sheng et al 2013 the entropy change of the reaction was calculated from the equation δh δg tδs as 48 45 3 89 j mol k implying an increase in structural disorder of the eps after complexing with fe2 sheng et al 2013 only one fold increment of intensity of peak a and no other visible changes were observed in the eem spectra of fe2 and eps as illustrated in fig 6c however reaction with nzvi resulted in an 8 fold increase of the intensity of peak a the disappearance of peak b and generation of peaks c and d fig 6b this implies a dominant role of fe0 rather than fe2 indirectly affecting the eps fluorescent structure furthermore the addition of fe2 resulted in a time dependent decrease of the intensities of the absorption bonds located at 200 215 nm and 245 290 nm of uv vis spectra of eps fig 7b probably arising from the complexing of fe2 with amide carboxyl carbonyl groups of eps the lack of distinguishable changes in the 350 430 nm region as depicted in the inset of fig 7b indicates that the riboflavin cannot accept electrons from fe2 emphasizing a role of fe0 in reducing semiquinones that are present in the eps 4 discussion the present study demonstrates that the presence of eps can accelerate the corrosion of nzvi under neutral ph with small particle size and large specific surface areas nzvi particles can easily aggregate as clusters with a z average size of 862 2 54 56 nm observed in this study fig 2 which would reduce overall reactivity huang et al 2016a however the observed eps dosage dependent decrease of z average size of nzvi fig 2 reveals that the presence of eps can enhance the specific surface area and reactivity of nzvi and facilitate the contact of these particles with eps wang et al 2015 additionally the formation of stable fe2 eps complex has been recognized to partially suppress the formation of iron corrosion passivation products and thus potentially accelerate the rate of nzvi corrosion karlsson and persson 2012 accordingly the enhanced nzvi corrosion would cause a faster h2 release rate whereas this was not observed in the eps systems relative to the control the faster nzvi corrosion but slower h2 release in the first few days raises the possibility that certain components existed in eps might act as electron acceptors to consume some electrons transferred from fe0 indeed transformation of oxidized riboflavin to its reduced form was observed in the uv vis spectra of eps following their exposure to nzvi fig 7a this is in accordance with the xps fig 1 and eem fig 6 results which show the increase in the electronic density around the c and n atoms and structural variations of the fluorescent humic compounds after nzvi treatment respectively particularly a previous study has already demonstrated that direct electron transfer from fe0 e0 fe2 fe0 0 44 vnhe to semiquinones and quinones like benzoquinone bq e0 bq hq 0 70 vnhe and ha e haox hared 0 7 vnhe fulvic acid fa e faox fared 0 5 vnhe is thermodynamically favorable resulting in the enhanced dissolution of zvi kang and choi 2009 this implies that some semiquinones present in eps such as riboflavin and humic substances could act as sinks to accept electrons from nzvi which might explain the observed reduction in h2 release rate in the first few days this can also explain the measured 78 h2 recovery efficiency with the complete corrosion of nzvi at the presence of 102 6 mg c l eps actually the h2 release from nzvi dissolution is highly significant for the ad process on one hand fast hydrogen generation and accumulation is not beneficial for methanogenesis because the acidogenesis and the decomposition of some vfas become thermodynamically unfavorable at high h2 partial pressure huang et al 2016b yang et al 2013 therefore a slower h2 generation rate from nzvi dissolution caused by the presence of eps could somewhat reduce the occurrence of high h2 partial pressure on the other hand due to the complete nzvi corrosion promoted by eps the resulting 15 20 higher h2 yield compared to the control is also in favor of methane generation since an increased supply of exogenous h2 can enhance ch4 yield via endogenous co2 fixation hu et al 2015 furthermore the consumption of electron from fe0 by the semiquinones contained in eps would decrease the reducibility of nzvi thus probably restricting their damage to the cell integrity huang et al 2016b additionally the improved electrochemical activity of eps after exposure to nzvi fig 6 favors anaerobic microbial extracellular electron transfer generally the interactions between nzvi and eps not only potentially attenuate the toxicity of nzvi to inner cells but also can assist in anaerobic digestion as concluded above the eps widely present in an ad system can work as an effective barrier to attenuate the toxicity of nzvi but both stimulatory and inhibitory effects of nzvi on the activity of anaerobic digestion have been reported in previous studies he et al 2017 hu et al 2015 suanon et al 2017 yang et al 2013 as can be seen from figs 2 and 3 the effect of eps on the average size of nzvi cluster and the h2 release was highly dependent on the dosage of eps specially the presence of a low amount of eps such as 10 26 mg c l exhibited almost no effect on the h2 release rate with subsequently no effect on nzvi dissolution particularly the total mass and biochemical compounds present in eps can vary by an order of magnitude with the sludge type the nature of the wastewater characteristics and growth conditions d abzac et al 2010 huangfu et al 2019 wei et al 2012 for instance d abzac et al d abzac et al 2010 found significant variation in total eps contents extracted from four kinds of granular sludge with 340 15 198 8 184 2 and 33 2 mg c g dry weight of the sludge for samples collected from two upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors one expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor and an anaerobic digester with recirculation treatment of different wastewater respectively there was 50 more eps in anaerobic granular sludge compared to the amount in the flocs as indicated by the protein dosage mcswain et al 2005 notably the eps of flocs was mainly focused in the center whereas 50 of the eps in granules was distributed in a 40 mm surface layer de beer et al 1996 this likely explains the observed enhancement of methane production in an anaerobic granular system but the inhibition of methanogenesis in anaerobic flocculent sludge after addition of 30 mm nzvi he et al 2017 yang et al 2013 5 conclusion this study explored the interactions between eps and nzvi from the view of their potential in affecting ad activity the presence of eps at 20 52 102 6 mg c l effectively reduced the h2 generation rate from nzvi dissolution in the early stage some semiquinones present in eps like riboflavin and humic substances could accept electrons from nzvi contributing to the eps dosage dependent inhibition of h2 release rate and a possible decrease of the reducibility of nzvi as such the co existence of eps at relatively higher concentrations could potentially reduce the inhibition of nzvi to the methanogenesis process via avoiding the fast release and acculumation of h2 and restricting the damage of nzvi to cell integrity additionally the effective coating of negatively charged eps on the nzvi surface with further formation of stable fe eps complex could disperse nzvi clusters to partially suppress the formation of iron corrosion passivation products together these contributed to the complete corrosion of nzvi and higher h2 production with the potential to generate more ch4 in ad the conclusions obtained in this study can also be applied to other ad systems while the fractionation and speciation of the eps as well as the concentration should be fully taken into consideration moreover it can be speculated that adding some conditioners to stimulate eps secretion or dosing eps like substances might be an alternative strategy to relieve the toxicity of nzvi and in turn utilize the advantages of nzvi to benefit the ad however this needs careful explorations in more complicated biological systems in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17902,the effects on the activity of anaerobic digestion ad of interactions between extracellular polymeric substances eps a protective barrier of microorganisms towards toxic compounds and nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi remain incompletely understood in this work eps induced a dosage dependent dispersion of nzvi clusters due to their effective accumulation on the nzvi surface the small size of nzvi clusters and the formation of stable fe eps complex promoted the dissolution of nzvi with a final increase of 15 20 h2 yield further characterizations of eps demonstrated the presence of some semiquinones like riboflavin which may work as a sink to accept electrons from nzvi this likely explains the eps dosage related reduction of h2 release rate in the initial stage and the possible decrease in nzvi reducibility responsible for disrupting cell integrity interactions between nzvi and eps could improve the electrochemical activity of eps favoring microbial extracellular electron transfer therefore the presence of eps at relatively higher concentrations may 1 reduce the inhibition of nzvi to ad process by avoiding the fast accumulation of h2 and restricting damage to cell integrity 2 benefit the methanogenesis process by providing more exogenous h2 from complete nzvi dissolution with higher electrochemical activity of eps this study provides insight into the interactions between eps and nanoparticles with strong reducibility in biological wastewater treatment systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords extracellular polymeric substances nanoscale zero valent iron interactions anaerobic digestion h2 release 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a series of biological processes in which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen ad is one of the most widely used and cost effective processes for high strength wastewater treatment and renewable energy recovery ganzoury and allam 2015 ma et al 2013 and requires the functions of microorganisms which are typically present in either floccular or granular forms due to its superior reactivity strong reducibility and environmental friendliness nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been the most commonly used nanomaterial in the united states and europe for groundwater remediation and wastewater treatment lefevre et al 2016 yang et al 2013 in particular nzvi is often directly injected into the pollution zone for in situ remediation xie et al 2017 given its growing recent use there have been an increasing number of studies investigating the effects of nzvi on the activity of ad some reports describe nzvi as a promising candidate to improve methane yield of ad due to the release of h2 from nzvi corrosion oxidation to boost the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis process hu et al 2015 and or an effect to promote the growth of microorganisms via decreasing the oxidative reductive potential orp of the anaerobic system li et al 2019 however a dose dependent inhibition of methane generation was observed for anaerobic flocs exposed to nzvi with fast h2 generation and accumulation during nzvi dissolution as well as the reductive decomposition of bacterial cell membrane after direct contact with nzvi huang et al 2016b yang et al 2013 extracellular polymeric substances eps are macromolecular biopolymers produced by activated sludge as a result of active secretion cell lysis and adsorbed organic matters from the wastewater seviour et al 2019 wei et al 2012 the total mass of eps varies with sludge type and growth conditions within 80 of the sludge mass affecting its flocculation settling and dewatering characteristics huangfu et al 2019 wei et al 2012 eps are commonly composed of high molecular weight polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids humic acids and phospholipids which can contain charged functional groups like carboxyl amine hydroxyl phosphoryl and phosphate groups adeleye et al 2014 adeleye and keller 2016 henriques and love 2007 eps on the surface of bacteria can interact with hydrophobic and positively charged toxins to protect the bacteria in activated sludge from the attack of some toxic compounds via reducing their bioavailability adeleye and keller 2014 interactions between nanoparticles nps and hydrophobic fractions present in the eps would modify the surface properties affect the surface valence and change the electrostatic repulsion force of nps and thus influence their overall stability adeleye and keller 2014 henriques and love 2007 huangfu et al 2019 the effect of eps on the stability of engineered nps was proposed to be nanomaterial chemical composition and coating specific adeleye and keller 2016 but this has not been assessed in nzvi systems the importance of h2 release rate and reducibility of nzvi were mentioned above but particular considerations must also be given to evaluate the effect of eps on the corrosion of nzvi the proteins and humic substances in eps are both strong ligands for metal ions sheng et al 2013 which may facilitate the possible complexing of eps with fe2 released from nzvi dissolution this complexing might suppress the formation and aggregation of iron corrosion passivation products and thus partially affect the rates of nzvi corrosion and h2 release karlsson and persson 2012 in addition some components of eps such as humic acid and riboflavin can work as electron acceptors chen et al 2014 suggesting that the eps likely could accept electrons from nzvi and consequently reduce electron transfer from nzvi to h particularly our previous study has implied that surrounded eps located outer surface of anaerobic granule might play an important role in weakening the toxicity of nzvi to anaerobic microorganisms he et al 2017 however more studies are required to systematically understand how and which components of eps affect the fate and the toxicity of nzvi under anaerobic conditions which would help to effectively utilize the advantages of nzvi but evade its drawbacks in enhancing the ad performance the goal of this study was to comprehensively explore the interactions between eps derived from anaerobic sludge and nzvi at neutral ph in respective of their potential in affecting the ad activity the stability corrosion degree and h2 release of nzvi were investigated at the presence and absence of eps next the structural responses and electrochemical activity of eps after exposure to nzvi were carefully studied by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectrometry ftir three dimensional excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eem ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis and cyclic voltammetry cv based on the results the inherent mechanisms of eps that affect nzvi fate and their interactions in potentially affecting the ad process were finally discussed this study provides a better understanding of the roles of eps in protecting microbial cells against nps with strong reducibility in biological wastewater treatment systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 eps extraction and characterization anaerobic sludge was sampled from a mesophilic full scale expanded sludge bed reactor treating starch wastewater with a treatment capacity of about 1200 m3 d binzhou china eps was immediately extracted from the obtained sludge via heating method as described previously wang et al 2009b previous studies have revealed that all the methods used to extract eps from activated sludge including cation exchange resin cer formaldehyde hcho sodium hydroxide naoh ethanol edta heating sonication centrifugation and their combination cannot avoid the simultaneous cell lysis d abzac et al 2010 hong et al 2017 however it was found that heating method could acquire high extraction efficiency of eps with less cell lysis among these methods after comparison hong et al 2017 therefore the heating method was chosen in this study in order to minimize the effect of intracellular material on the composition of eps briefly the sludge was washed three times with 0 9 nacl after being dewatered by centrifugation in a 50 ml tube at 8000 rpm for 5 min the sludge pellet in the tube was subsequently resuspended in 15 ml of 0 9 nacl solution subjected to heat treatment at 80 c for 1 h and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min the total eps material was obtained after collecting the centrifuged supernatant removing any microorganisms by passing through a 0 22 μm filter and then stored at 20 c after freeze drying the concentration of organic carbon in the eps solution was measured with a total organic carbon toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena germany polysaccharides proteins and humic substances present in the eps extracted material were quantified by the phenol sulfuric acid method by comparison to glucose as the standard a bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china and a modified lowry method respectively he et al 2017 sheng et al 2008 the zeta potential of eps was determined using a nanosized zs instrument malvern instruments co uk xps escalab 250 thermo fisher scientific usa was applied to determine the bond states and the relative contents of c n and o elements in the eps 2 2 nzvi stability and dissolution determination at the presence of eps the nzvi used in this study were freshly prepared by liquid phase reduction method as detailed in our previous study he et al 2017 the synthesized nanoparticles suspension was diluted with deoxygenated water to 20 g l and stored in an anaerobic chamber shellab bactron ez usa for further use the characterization of freshly prepared nzvi was described previously he et al 2017 as shown in fig s1 the size of individual particles was in the range of 20 100 nm assessed by transmission electron microscope tem jem 2011 jeol ltd japan image analysis before the experiments freeze dried eps samples were dissolved in deionized water to final concentrations of 5 13 10 26 20 52 51 30 and 102 60 c mg l the initial ph of the eps solution was adjusted to 7 3 by addition of 0 2 m hcl or naoh the zeta ζ potential and z average size of nzvi in the absence and presence of eps 5 13 102 60 mg c l were recorded via the nanosized zs instrument each test was repeated at least three times to explore the effect of eps on the corrosion process of nzvi 100 ml samples of eps at different concentrations 0 102 6 mg c l were separately added into 250 ml serum bottles and purged with high purity n2 for 30 min to remove the oxygen to avoid potential interference of nacl since 0 9 nacl solution was used when extracting the eps nacl solutions at concentrations corresponding to those contained in 0 102 6 mg c l eps were used as control samples the serum bottles were then transferred into the anaerobic chamber for the addition of 1 0 g l nzvi and were immediately sealed tightly with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps afterwards the following reactions were conducted in an air bath shaker at a mild operating temperature 35 c and 200 rpm with a light shield each experiment was repeated in triplicate gas liquid and solids samples were periodically acquired for analysis the collected iron residues were freeze dried for subsequent iron speciation transformation analysis by x ray diffraction xrd ttr iii rigaku japan with a 2θ range from 30 60 for gas chromatography analysis 0 5 ml headspace gas was removed using a gas tight syringe for h2 analysis by gas chromatograph lunan co model sp 6800a china zhang et al 2012 the mole amount of ch4 generated was calculated based on the measured partial pressure of ch4 he et al 2017 due to the rapid hydrogen production from nzvi dissolution and the extremely low solubility of hydrogen in water 2 mg l the following model from borja et al 1995 was applied to estimate the cumulative h2 generation process 1 v t v m 1 е kt where v m mmol is the maximum h2 yield obtained at an infinite reaction time v t mmol represents the cumulative h2 volume at a given time t d and k d 1 is the kinetic constant for h2 generation the parameters v m and k were determined by fitting the model to the experimental data using origin pro8 2 3 eps characterization after exposure to nzvi the acquired liquid samples after filtration during the reaction of eps with nzvi were used to analyze the variations of protein polysaccharides and humic acid in eps according to the methods described in section 2 1 the samples were collected and filtered in an anaerobic chamber and then measured by uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent usa and eem spectrophotometer aqualog horiba scientific usa lu et al 2014 meng et al 2016 the uv vis spectra were recorded with absorbance scanning from 190 to 600 nm and presented as absorbance eem spectra were obtained with subsequent scanning emission spectra from 300 to 550 nm at 0 5 nm increments by varying the excitation wavelength from 250 to 450 nm at 5 nm increments wang et al 2019 additionally cv was carried out using a bio logic vmp3 electrochemical workstation france between voltages 0 0 and 1 0 v vs ag agcl at a scan rate of 5 mv s to explore the electrochemical behavior of eps before and after reaction with nzvi chen et al 2014 the residues after 7 d reaction were lyophilized and analyzed by xps and ftir nicolet 8700 thermo scientific instrument co u s a in absorbance mode 16 scans in the range 4000 400 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 wang et al 2020 note that during preliminary measurements we found that the fluorescent intensities of samples with 102 6 mg c l eps were too high to be reliable when conducting the eem tests therefore a much lower concentration of 20 52 mg c l was adopted during the eem tests of eps while 102 6 mg c l was used as a representative in other analysis 2 4 interaction between eps and fe2 since fe2 is generated during nzvi dissolution under anaerobic conditions the capacity of eps to complex with fe2 was next investigated to do this 3 mm feso4 and 102 6 mg c l eps were mixed in serum bottles and the ph was adjusted to 6 0 to prevent the precipitation of fe2 the uv vis and eem spectra of eps were determined during the reaction according to the methods provided in section 2 3 the binding capacity of eps with aqueous fe2 was analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry itc on an itc 200 calorimeter microcal co usa sheng et al 2013 briefly 3 mm fe2 and 102 6 mg c l eps solutions were separately centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatants were collected experiments were carried out in a titration cell with a working volume of 250 μl at 25 c with magnetica stirring at a rate of 300 rpm the fe2 solution was slowly titrated into the eps solution with 120 s between each injection non linear fitting analysis of the raw data was performed using origin 8 5 to determine the molar heat of fe2 binding to eps δh and the binding constant indicating the affinity of the binding sites k sheng et al 2013 3 results 3 1 properties of eps from anaerobic sludge in this study 102 6 mg c l extracted eps consisted of 99 3 2 7 mg l protein 22 6 0 6 mg l polysaccharides and 66 8 3 1 mg l humic acid the extracted eps fraction had an average ζ potential of 25 5 1 0 mv the atomic compositions of c o and n were estimated as 67 51 20 65 and 11 84 respectively as illustrated in fig 1 a the c 1s signal was resolved into three component peaks the peaks at 284 8 47 42 286 2 31 70 and 288 2 ev 20 88 were respectively attributed to the c c h in side chains of lipids or amino acids c o n in the form of ether ethanol or amine and co o c o which is commonly observed in carboxylic esters carbonyls amides acetals or semiacetals ding et al 2018 song et al 2014 the o 1s signal contained two peaks at 531 5 and 532 5 ev fig 1c which are associated with co and c oh c o respectively ding et al 2018 song et al 2014 fig 1e clearly shows the presence of two n 1s peaks the n 1s peak at 400 1 ev correlated to nonprotonated nitrogen nnonprotonated which is commonly found in amines and amides yuan et al 2010 the second n 1s peak at 401 5 ev is related to protonated nitrogen nprotonated from amino acids and amino sugars yuan et al 2010 3 2 effect of eps on size and surface charge of nzvi the adsorption of various materials e g ions biomolecules polymers and colloids onto the surface of engineered nps often influences their surface charge resulting in altered stability in different media henriques and love 2007 as illustrated in fig 2 the ζ potential of nzvi showed a gradual decrease from 16 9 to 22 4 mv at the presence of 0 20 5 mg c l eps and then showed little additional change as eps concentration further increased to 51 3 and 102 6 mg c l the ζ potential decline of nzvi suggests that eps might impart negative charges to the surface of nzvi wang et al 2015 moreover the z average size of nzvi clusters significantly decreased from 862 2 54 6 to 425 0 35 1 nm when eps was increased from 0 to 102 6 mg c l indicating partial dispersion of nzvi clusters at the presence of eps the easier dispersion and smaller size of nzvi clusters might result from increased electrostatic and steric repulsion between nzvi and surface accumulated eps adeleye et al 2014 wang et al 2015 3 3 effect of eps on nzvi dissolution accumulation of high partial pressures of h2 as a result of fast h2 release from nzvi dissolution would inhibit methanogenesis yang et al 2013 to investigate this further the h2 release was measured after exposure of nzvi to varied concentrations of eps and the results are presented in fig 3 compared to the theoretical h2 generation 1 79 mmol estimated by the complete dissolution of 1 g l nzvi the measured 1 13 1 17 mmol of h2 obtained in control systems reveals 63 65 of h2 recovery efficiency from nzvi dissolution consistent with the results of a previous report huang et al 2016b eq 1 was adopted to analyze the h2 release rate and the results displayed in table s1 demonstrated that the h2 generation in control systems fit well to first order kinetics as indicated by a high r2 value regardless of initial nacl concentration the h2 release rates in control systems showed little change with an average value of 0 11 0 006 d 1 table s1 interestingly the addition of eps exhibited dosage dependent inhibition of h2 generation in the first few days but with further continuous h2 release when the h2 production became stable in control systems the kinetic constant for h2 generation was 0 10 d 1 after addition of 10 26 mg c l eps but could not be estimated when eps concentration increased to 20 52 mg c l and higher as attributed by initially slowing of h2 release surprisingly the final cumulative h2 amounts at the presence of 10 26 20 52 51 30 and 102 6 mg c l eps were 1 29 0 06 1 32 0 11 1 38 0 03 and 1 40 0 05 mmol respectively which are almost 15 20 higher than that in the corresponding control systems the solid phase transformation of nzvi over 15 d of reaction was investigated via xrd analysis the resultant xrd spectra of the control systems suggested incomplete fe0 dissolution and the appearance of iron oxide hydrate fig 4 which should be the oxidative products of fe oh 2 produced by exposure to air during sample collection and analysis as the released fe2 is easily hydrolyzed to the precipitation of iron related oxides on the nzvi surface at experimental ph the inner fe0 is readily deactivated with incomplete fe0 dissolution and lower h2 recovery efficiency compared to the efficiency at the presence of eps as presented in fig 3 however the presence of eps increased the dissolution of fe0 throughout the process with the total disappearance of the fe0 peak after a 15 d reaction 3 4 effect of nzvi on the properties of eps 3 4 1 variation of eps components as illustrated in fig 5 proteins polysaccharides and humic substance concentrations decreased by 15 4 26 7 and 14 5 respectively after exposure to 1 g l nzvi for 1 day the concentrations of the three components subsequently reduced slowly over the next 20 days and gradually stabilized at 65 53 and 80 respectively of the initial concentration as shown in fig s2 only 1 1 3 1 proteins polysaccharides and humic substance decreased after a 20 day incubation of eps in the absence of nzvi as a consequent the significant reduction in the concentration of eps components in fig 5 might ascribe to the reaction between nzvi and eps or adsorption of eps onto the iron oxide surface due to the complex interaction between eps and positively charged fe2 3 4 2 ftir results the chemical functional groups of eps are the binding sites that interact with metal ions mu et al 2012 so the possible variations of the functional groups in eps after reaction with nzvi were therefore explored by ftir spectra characterization as depicted in fig s3 and table s2 amide ii band of protein shifted from 1535 to 1543 cm 1 the c o bond in polysaccharides shifted from 1110 to 1080 cm 1 and the peak at 1240 cm 1 associated with the vibration or deformation of co significantly decreased after addition of nzvi particles these changes may reflect strong interactions between iron ions or oxides and the corresponding functional groups in eps he et al 2017 mu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 3 4 3 three dimensional excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eem is a rapid and sensitive technique that was applied to rapidly characterize interaction between the fluorescence compounds present in eps and nzvi zhen et al 2012 two peaks located at ex em wavelengths of 279 360 nm peak a and 396 468 nm peak b were observed in pristine eps fig 6 a indicative of the presence of tryptophan like and humic acid like substances chen et al 2003 wang et al 2009b zhang et al 2010 as shown in fig 6b at the presence of nzvi peak b disappeared and the intensity of peak a exhibited an approximate 9 fold increase relative to control eps table 2 two additional peaks appeared in the nzvi treated eps sample peak c ex em of 354 445 nm and peak d ex em of 249 446 nm which represent visible humic acid like and fulvic acid like fluorescence respectively appearance of peak c can be regarded as the result of blue shift of peak b along the excitation and emission axis which has been observed during photocatalytic removal of humic acid ha uyguner and bekbolet 2005 valencia et al 2013 a blue shift in this study might be associated with the break up of ha into smaller fragments the decrease of conjugated bonds or and elimination of some functional groups like carbonyl hydroxyl groups in ha valencia et al 2013 wang et al 2009a furthermore the complexation of eps with metal ions would be predicted to promote fluorescence quenching sheng et al 2013 however the substantial increase in the fluorescence intensity of peak c compared with peak b further support the decreased molecular weight of ha after treatment of nzvi since fluorescence intensity per weight concentration unit of ha was previously discovered to increase with the reduction in molecular weight hayase and tsubota 1985 more importantly it s found that an increase in intensity of fluorescent peaks would be occurred after electrochemical reduction of humic substance fimmen et al 2007 in general these changes of the eem spectra suggest that the addition of nzvi might result in structural changes in the fluorescent humic compounds due to effects of the chemical activity of nzvi cai et al 2018 3 4 4 xps results high resolution spectra of c1s o1s and n1s regions of eps with and without nzvi treatment were determined and are shown in fig 1 with the peak integration results presented in table 1 the binding energies of c1s at 284 8 and 286 2 ev transformed into 248 6 and 285 2 ev respectively with a slight decrease observed at binding energy of nnonprotonated from 400 1 to 399 9 ev after treatment with nzvi these shifts may be explained by increases in the electronic density around the c atoms in c c h and c o n and the n atoms in nnonprotonated probably arising from the electron draining from fe0 or fe2 sun et al 2009 the decrease of c atomic content in c c h from 50 6 to 35 4 of o atomic content in c o c or c o h from 30 3 to 5 6 and the disappearance of nprotonated signal suggest the possible complexation of these groups with fe2 agreeing well with the ftir results 3 4 5 uv vis analysis of eps uv vis spectra of eps were obtained over seven days to spectroscopically observe changes during nzvi treatment fig 7 a two apparent absorption bonds located at 200 215 nm and 245 290 nm were identified in the spectra the absorbance within the 200 215 nm range is usually attributed to π σ and or π π transitions of amide carboxyl carbonyl bonds lu et al 2014 the 245 290 nm wavelength area commonly is correlated with n π and π π electron transition of co and cc structure of aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine lu et al 2014 meng et al 2016 after nzvi treatment the intensities of the two adsorption bonds decreased as the reaction time increased from 0 to 7 days fig 7a supporting the ftir finding that eps can complex with fe2 via amide carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups meng et al 2016 interestingly the absorption peak at 425 nm shown in the inset of fig 7a decreased in intensity after exposure of eps to nzvi together with an increase in the absorption peak between 370 and 355 nm these changes are consistent with the transformation of oxidized riboflavin to its reduced form chen et al 2014 3 4 6 electrochemical properties of eps in order to explore the effect of nzvi on the redox activity of eps cyclic voltamograms of 102 6 mg c l pristine eps and eps after nzvi treatment for 1 and 7 days were obtained although fe2 possessing redox activity would be generated during nzvi dissolution under anaerobic conditions it should be noted that the interference of fe2 could be excluded during cv measurements of eps after nzvi treatment because the released fe2 was readily precipitated under the experimental ph 7 3 and then removed during collection of the supernatant as indicated in fig s4 as shown in fig 8 the reductive and oxidative peaks of pristine eps were barely detectable but the reductive peak currents of eps after exposure to nzvi for 1 and 7 days were 13 5 and 30 5 μa respectively suggesting enhanced electrochemical activity of eps due to the presence of nzvi the pair of reversible faradaic peaks centered at 535 mv vs ag agcl kcl sat correspond to those of riboflavin as observed previously pinto et al 2018 the enhanced currents manifest that the presence of nzvi caused the exposure of more riboflavin allowing increased interaction with the electrode or accelerated electron transfer between riboflavin and the electrode however conductive iron oxide such as fe3o4 was not detected during nzvi dissolution fig 4 and the increase in current together with fe0 decrease on day 7 indicate that the introduction of conductive materials by adding nzvi to accelerate electron transfer is not an effective strategy the effective binding of released fe2 with proteins and polysaccharides that might block the riboflavin or damage eps structure via the strong reducibility of nzvi as observed in eem spectra fig 6 would promote exposure of more riboflavin 3 5 interaction between eps and fe2 the results presented above highlighted the importance of binding between eps and iron ions produced during nzvi corrosion so itc analysis was next conducted to estimate the thermodynamic parameters for this process fig s5a shows that a clear thermopositive peak was observed after injection of fe2 into eps solution non linear regression analysis of heat vs fe2 dosage fig s5b allows the calculation of the mean binding capacity n binding enthalpy δh and binding constant k for the binding of fe2 to various compounds in eps as 2 45 0 137 mmol g 2 75 0 129 kj mol and 1 03 0 056 103 l mol respectively table s3 the negative value of δh indicates that reaction between eps and fe2 is an exothermic reaction applying the equation δg rtlnk the change of gibbs energy of the binding between eps and fe2 was calculated as 17 19 0 134 kj mol revealing that the binding reaction was thermodynamically favorable with formation of a stable fe2 eps complex sheng et al 2013 the entropy change of the reaction was calculated from the equation δh δg tδs as 48 45 3 89 j mol k implying an increase in structural disorder of the eps after complexing with fe2 sheng et al 2013 only one fold increment of intensity of peak a and no other visible changes were observed in the eem spectra of fe2 and eps as illustrated in fig 6c however reaction with nzvi resulted in an 8 fold increase of the intensity of peak a the disappearance of peak b and generation of peaks c and d fig 6b this implies a dominant role of fe0 rather than fe2 indirectly affecting the eps fluorescent structure furthermore the addition of fe2 resulted in a time dependent decrease of the intensities of the absorption bonds located at 200 215 nm and 245 290 nm of uv vis spectra of eps fig 7b probably arising from the complexing of fe2 with amide carboxyl carbonyl groups of eps the lack of distinguishable changes in the 350 430 nm region as depicted in the inset of fig 7b indicates that the riboflavin cannot accept electrons from fe2 emphasizing a role of fe0 in reducing semiquinones that are present in the eps 4 discussion the present study demonstrates that the presence of eps can accelerate the corrosion of nzvi under neutral ph with small particle size and large specific surface areas nzvi particles can easily aggregate as clusters with a z average size of 862 2 54 56 nm observed in this study fig 2 which would reduce overall reactivity huang et al 2016a however the observed eps dosage dependent decrease of z average size of nzvi fig 2 reveals that the presence of eps can enhance the specific surface area and reactivity of nzvi and facilitate the contact of these particles with eps wang et al 2015 additionally the formation of stable fe2 eps complex has been recognized to partially suppress the formation of iron corrosion passivation products and thus potentially accelerate the rate of nzvi corrosion karlsson and persson 2012 accordingly the enhanced nzvi corrosion would cause a faster h2 release rate whereas this was not observed in the eps systems relative to the control the faster nzvi corrosion but slower h2 release in the first few days raises the possibility that certain components existed in eps might act as electron acceptors to consume some electrons transferred from fe0 indeed transformation of oxidized riboflavin to its reduced form was observed in the uv vis spectra of eps following their exposure to nzvi fig 7a this is in accordance with the xps fig 1 and eem fig 6 results which show the increase in the electronic density around the c and n atoms and structural variations of the fluorescent humic compounds after nzvi treatment respectively particularly a previous study has already demonstrated that direct electron transfer from fe0 e0 fe2 fe0 0 44 vnhe to semiquinones and quinones like benzoquinone bq e0 bq hq 0 70 vnhe and ha e haox hared 0 7 vnhe fulvic acid fa e faox fared 0 5 vnhe is thermodynamically favorable resulting in the enhanced dissolution of zvi kang and choi 2009 this implies that some semiquinones present in eps such as riboflavin and humic substances could act as sinks to accept electrons from nzvi which might explain the observed reduction in h2 release rate in the first few days this can also explain the measured 78 h2 recovery efficiency with the complete corrosion of nzvi at the presence of 102 6 mg c l eps actually the h2 release from nzvi dissolution is highly significant for the ad process on one hand fast hydrogen generation and accumulation is not beneficial for methanogenesis because the acidogenesis and the decomposition of some vfas become thermodynamically unfavorable at high h2 partial pressure huang et al 2016b yang et al 2013 therefore a slower h2 generation rate from nzvi dissolution caused by the presence of eps could somewhat reduce the occurrence of high h2 partial pressure on the other hand due to the complete nzvi corrosion promoted by eps the resulting 15 20 higher h2 yield compared to the control is also in favor of methane generation since an increased supply of exogenous h2 can enhance ch4 yield via endogenous co2 fixation hu et al 2015 furthermore the consumption of electron from fe0 by the semiquinones contained in eps would decrease the reducibility of nzvi thus probably restricting their damage to the cell integrity huang et al 2016b additionally the improved electrochemical activity of eps after exposure to nzvi fig 6 favors anaerobic microbial extracellular electron transfer generally the interactions between nzvi and eps not only potentially attenuate the toxicity of nzvi to inner cells but also can assist in anaerobic digestion as concluded above the eps widely present in an ad system can work as an effective barrier to attenuate the toxicity of nzvi but both stimulatory and inhibitory effects of nzvi on the activity of anaerobic digestion have been reported in previous studies he et al 2017 hu et al 2015 suanon et al 2017 yang et al 2013 as can be seen from figs 2 and 3 the effect of eps on the average size of nzvi cluster and the h2 release was highly dependent on the dosage of eps specially the presence of a low amount of eps such as 10 26 mg c l exhibited almost no effect on the h2 release rate with subsequently no effect on nzvi dissolution particularly the total mass and biochemical compounds present in eps can vary by an order of magnitude with the sludge type the nature of the wastewater characteristics and growth conditions d abzac et al 2010 huangfu et al 2019 wei et al 2012 for instance d abzac et al d abzac et al 2010 found significant variation in total eps contents extracted from four kinds of granular sludge with 340 15 198 8 184 2 and 33 2 mg c g dry weight of the sludge for samples collected from two upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors one expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor and an anaerobic digester with recirculation treatment of different wastewater respectively there was 50 more eps in anaerobic granular sludge compared to the amount in the flocs as indicated by the protein dosage mcswain et al 2005 notably the eps of flocs was mainly focused in the center whereas 50 of the eps in granules was distributed in a 40 mm surface layer de beer et al 1996 this likely explains the observed enhancement of methane production in an anaerobic granular system but the inhibition of methanogenesis in anaerobic flocculent sludge after addition of 30 mm nzvi he et al 2017 yang et al 2013 5 conclusion this study explored the interactions between eps and nzvi from the view of their potential in affecting ad activity the presence of eps at 20 52 102 6 mg c l effectively reduced the h2 generation rate from nzvi dissolution in the early stage some semiquinones present in eps like riboflavin and humic substances could accept electrons from nzvi contributing to the eps dosage dependent inhibition of h2 release rate and a possible decrease of the reducibility of nzvi as such the co existence of eps at relatively higher concentrations could potentially reduce the inhibition of nzvi to the methanogenesis process via avoiding the fast release and acculumation of h2 and restricting the damage of nzvi to cell integrity additionally the effective coating of negatively charged eps on the nzvi surface with further formation of stable fe eps complex could disperse nzvi clusters to partially suppress the formation of iron corrosion passivation products together these contributed to the complete corrosion of nzvi and higher h2 production with the potential to generate more ch4 in ad the conclusions obtained in this study can also be applied to other ad systems while the fractionation and speciation of the eps as well as the concentration should be fully taken into consideration moreover it can be speculated that adding some conditioners to stimulate eps secretion or dosing eps like substances might be an alternative strategy to relieve the toxicity of nzvi and in turn utilize the advantages of nzvi to benefit the ad however this needs careful explorations in more complicated biological systems in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17903,fecal coliform bacteria are a key indicator of human health risks however the spatiotemporal variability and key influencing factors of river fecal coliform have yet to be explored in a rural suburban urban watershed with multiple land uses in this study the fecal coliform concentrations in 21 river sections were monitored for 20 months and 441 samples were analyzed multivariable regressions were used to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of fecal coliform the results showed that spatial differences were mainly dominated by urbanization level and environmental factors could explain the temporal dynamics of fecal coliform in different urban patterns except in areas with high urbanization levels reducing suspended solids is a direct way to manage fecal coliform in the beiyun river when the natural factors are difficulty to change such as temperature and solar radiation the export of fecal coliform from urban areas showed a quick and sensitive response to rainfall events and increased dozens of times in the short term landscape patterns such as the fragmentation of impervious surfaces and the overall landscape were identified as key factors influencing urban non point source bacteria the results obtained from this study will provide insight into the management of river fecal pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords fecal coliform complex watershed urban patterns multivariable regressions spatiotemporal dynamics non point source pollution 1 introduction with the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 in the world the spatiotemporal distribution and influencing factors of microbial pollution in rivers especially in urban rivers have become the focus of scientific research microbial pollution around the world is routinely assessed using concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria fib including escherichia coli and enterococci as proxies for pathogenic organisms wyn jones et al 2011 such bacteria are present in the feces stachler et al 2017 runoff molina et al 2014 and sewage discharges jennings et al 2018 and their presence is a considerable issue concerning river risk management and human health risk chenar and deng 2018 as a type of fib fecal coliform fc has been widely used in the risk assessment of microbial pollution in water boehm et al 2018 uprety et al 2020 the national health and medical research council of australia and the european environment agency eea both use fc as one of the microbiological indicators of drinking water quality the fc index is particularly important especially in areas where marine products are abundant wang and deng 2019 previous studies have reported two significant observations of the worldwide fc situation on the one hand fc is inherently bioactive differing from other physical and chemical pollutants and the reported amount of microbial pollution in the environment has raised concerns regarding ecosystem and human health frena et al 2019 on the other hand the state and concentration of fc in water bodies are dynamic and are related to environmental factors chen and liu 2017 carpenter et al 2019 jeon et al 2019 a growing body of research has proven that the dynamic nature of fc survival and concentration in surface water bodies is driven by emissions and environmental factors that determine fc transport and fate mitch et al 2010 liu et al 2015 fc can reproduce rapidly under optimal environmental conditions for growth and reproduction varies with factors such as water temperature temperature solar radiation rainfall and turbidity leight et al 2016 chen and liu 2017 regression models can be applied to explore how one environmental factor affects fc levels while the remaining factors are fixed however it usually has poor fitness this result may be due to the complicated and nonlinear relationship between environmental factors and fc fan et al 2015 tong et al 2016 wang and deng 2019 several additional studies have investigated the link between land use types and fc concentration including urban development levels agriculture dominated watersheds and comparisons of different watershed types sliva 2001 walters et al 2011 chow et al 2013 mcmichael et al 2013 badgley et al 2019 vitro et al 2017 found that road density was positively correlated with fc contamination and negatively related to the area of water body in addition regions with water quality degradation due to nutrients usually have high fc concentrations and this result has been found in other studies mallin et al 2000 forest and grass may be positively correlated with fc concentrations in water bodies because these landscapes provide places for poultry breeding smith et al 2001 together these studies have indicated that the watershed scale fc dynamics could be predicted by examining fc occurrence and concentration data coupled with environmental factors however the limited scope of these monitoring datasets and the combination of landscape patterns related to the transmission path of non point source pollution nps have not allowed for generalizable conclusions regarding how such programs coupled with environmental factors impact the contaminant levels in a complex watershed with mixed land use types in this study a typical urbanized watershed with a drainage area greater than 4000 km2 was monitored at both the monthly scale and the event scale the primary goal of this study was to improve our fundamental understanding of the drivers of fc in surface water systems the objectives of the study were to 1 investigate the spatiotemporal variation in fc in a mixed land use watershed 2 quantify the impacts of urbanization processes and environmental factors on the fc dynamics and 3 identify the key landscape metrics influencing the event scale fc concentration variation 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area description and division the beiyun river flows through the eastern suburbs of beijing and tianjin and it is a tributary of the haihe river which is one of the seven major river basins in china the study area is located in beijing city spanning from the middle northwest to the southeast covering eight districts with a total basin area of 4348 km2 and a total river length of 89 4 km details on the beiyun watershed including the digital elevation model dem 30 m resolution climate river system conventional water quality and function are provided elsewhere shen et al 2015 liu et al 2018 the land use in 2017 showed approximately 20 of forest land 30 agricultural land and 40 urban land the urban areas are mainly located in the middle of the watershed and spread up and down gradually showing a rural suburban urban gradient eight main tributaries exist in the beiyun watershed most of which are suffering serious fc pollution because of a series of anthropogenic activities however water environment management in the beiyun river is extremely challenging the region is experiencing rapid urbanization and fc management should have regional characteristics accordingly a total of 21 water quality sampling sites s1 s21 were selected along the mainstream and its tributaries as well as the confluence considering the characteristics of the main stream urbanization level land use patterns and accessibility thereafter the watershed boundaries and river network were delineated in arcgis with the hydrological module based on the digital elevation model dem 30 m resolution taking each of the sampling sites as the outlet of a delineated catchment the catchment areas c1 c21 responding to s1 s21 were determined for further study the catchments could be divided into five categories represented by five urban patterns with different urbanization levels fig 1 considering spatial land use types fig 2 in pattern 1 p1 c1 c3 and pattern 5 p5 c19 c21 impervious surfaces accounted for less than 30 which represented a low urbanization level however the difference between p1 and p5 was that there was a large part of forestland in p1 while cultivated land was dominant in p5 in p2 c4 c10 and p4 c17 c18 the impervious surface ratio was between 30 and 60 indicating a moderate urbanization level the central areas were characterized by a relatively higher percentage of impervious surfaces occupying approximately 80 which were regarded as urban pattern with high urbanization level p3 2 2 sample collection and analysis a total of 441 water samples for fecal bacteria 21 samples from 21 sites for each of 20 months and a rainfall event were collected using sterilized 500 ml plastic bottles sampling was conducted monthly from march 2017 to december 2018 sampling occurred on approximately the same date each month regardless of weather conditions with the hope of reducing sampling errors additionally a rainfall event on may 22 2017 with an average rainfall of 29 2 mm was also included pre drying days of almost 2 months samples were collected before the rainfall event on may 20 and after the event on may 25 2017 manual sampling was performed due to the limitation of automatic sampling equipment in the study area to ensure that no contamination occurred sample collection was taken prior to field measurements at each sampling site sample bottles were conditioned in stream by rinsing three times with stream water before retaining the sample samples were immediately placed in a cooler after sampling and shipped to the research centre for eco environmental science chinese academy of sciences in beijing china for fc analysis within 24 h water physicochemical samples for chemical oxygen demand cod and suspended solids ss were also collected at the time and were analyzed at an accredited laboratory using the determination methods for the examination of water and wastewater 4th edition field measurements were conducted for ph dissolved oxygen and water temperature in the experiment blank samples and quality control samples were operated first to verify the accuracy of the experimental instrument and operation then the water quality indicators of cod and ss were conducted 2 3 selection of environmental variables we aimed to explore the drivers of fc fate in a mixed land use watershed and thereby compiled a set of environmental factors that have been previously reported or are expected to contribute to fc dynamics at watershed scales chen and liu 2017 jeon et al 2019 the environmental factors are summarized in table 1 including meteorological factors urbanization factors and water physicochemical factors meteorological factors came from daily monitoring data of the five national meteorological stations in and around the study area available at http www resdc cn default aspx and the values were converted into monthly averages the ordinary kriging method tukimat et al 2019 used in geographical spatial interpolation was adopted to calculate the rainfall amount temperature and solar radiation in each catchment area and the results are detailed in the figs s1 s6 the urbanization factors represented by population density and road density were also calculated fig s7 water physicochemical factors were manually measured figs s8 s12 to study the effect of landscape configuration on nps fc landscape metrics were calculated from land use by fragstats 4 2 software mcgarigal and marks 1995 six landscape metrics at the landscape level and eight metrics at the class level were selected to represent the shape structure diversity and aggregation of the landscape 2 4 global autocorrelation global autocorrelation was calculated to evaluate the spatial independence of the monitoring sites by moran s i briefly the spatial statistics toolbox in arcgis was applied to generate the result the sampling sites should cover the spatial characteristics of the watershed but should avoid the spatial interference of the upstream sites on downstream sites the spatial randomness of the selected sampling sites ensured the statistical significance of the spatiotemporal variability and the key influencing factors of river fc the moran s i ranged from 1 to 1 the scenario with a lower absolute value of moran s i and z score 1 65 z 1 65 shows a weaker autocorrelation and these indexes are defined as follows 1 i n s 0 i 1 n j 1 n w i j z i z j i 1 n z i 2 2 s 0 i 1 n j 1 n w i j 3 z i i e i v i where z i is the deviation of element i from its mean value of x i x w i j is the spatial weight between i and j n is the total number of elements and s 0 is the sum of all spatial weights 2 5 multivariable regression 2 5 1 lasso regression to find the best combinations of environmental variables for the explanation of spatiotemporal variability of fc in different regions p1 p5 the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso tibshirani 1996 was conducted eight environmental factors including three meteorological factors and five water environment factors table 1 were added for temporal regression in the fiver urban patterns a total of 17 factors were added to the spatial regression including three meteorological factors five water environment factors two urbanization factors and seven land use areas as shown in fig 2 except for bare land briefly the five independent datasets of p1 p5 were temporally analyzed the spatial analysis was conducted with annual averaging in different catchment areas however this approach may have an impact on the regression analysis of urban region p3 due to more point source inputs therefore to weaken the influence of point sources fc analysis in p3 was divided into the rainy season and dry season the pollution load increment in the rainy season was regarded as the nps input many researchers employ the rainy season and dry season when exploring the spatiotemporal changes in water quality according to precipitation luo et al 2018 han et al 2020 therefore june july and august were regarded as the rainy season in this study march april and november were the dry seasons of 2017 while october november and december were the dry months of 2018 according to the monthly rainfall amount in fig s2 simultaneously the selected dry seasons excluded the snow months the fc concentration caused by nps was calculated by eq 4 the monthly flow data of each sampling section were necessary when calculating the increment of pollution load the monthly flow data from 2013 to 2018 of two hydrological stations in the beiyun watershed were obtained from the local environmental protection bureau based on which swat soil and water assessment tool model was calibrated and verified to simulate the monthly average streamflow of each river section model performance and parameter selection are shown in fig 3 and table 2 monthly swat simulated streamflow can be judged as satisfactory with r2 0 6 and e ns 0 5 according to previous study moriasi et al 2015 thereafter the response relationship between nps pollution and landscape patterns in urban areas was carried out using lasso 4 c n p s c r a i n y q r a i n y c d r y q d r y q r a i n y where c n p s is the concentration of fc caused by nps c r a i n y and c d r y are the fc concentrations in the rainy seasons and dry seasons respectively and q r a i n y and q d r y are the streamflow in the rainy seasons and dry seasons respectively a penalty function was constructed in lasso to compress some variable coefficients to 0 this process is done to measure the goodness of fit and penalize against overfitting therefore an optimal fitting model can be obtained the 10 fold cross validation was introduced to minimize spurious relations when selecting variables the final regression models were selected by the optimal λ from the cross validation zhao and bondell 2020 and the regression coefficients were obtained with statistical significance t statistic p 0 05 data analyses were performed using r version 3 6 1 with the glmnet package friedman et al 2010 2 5 2 all subsets regression concentrations of fc will change significantly after rainfall events therefore the key landscape metrics influencing the event scale fc concentration variation should be discussed the computation of the fc concentration variation level r a was based upon the following equation 5 r a c a c b where c a and c b correspond to the river fc concentration after and before a rainfall event respectively the inherent diversity and complexity of landscape patterns requires diversity models to better understand how landscape patterns may influence the transport process of nps fc all subsets regression provides all possible combinations of variable selection with different fitting performances this method provides a variety of model selections thus all subsets regression wasserman and sudjianto 1994 for samples that were collected before and after rainfall events were used to explore key landscape metrics to help explain r a all possible combinations of important landscape metrics for each independent multivariable regression technique were created and the covariate coefficients were determined to be statistically significant data analysis was performed using excel and r with the glmulti package calcagno and claire 2010 3 results 3 1 fc pollution in the beiyun watershed the fc concentrations were calculated at 21 monitoring sites for global autocorrelation analysis using a gis based method the results of this study with a z score of 0 29 and a p value of 0 77 fig s13 showed that the pattern did not appear to be significantly different than that caused by random chance therefore the arrangement of sampling sites in this study was reasonable according to two years of monitoring the fc concentrations of 441 samples ranged from 20 3 50 107 mpn l 60 76 of which were greater than 1 00 105 mpn l many studies have shown that fecal pollution may cause serious health risk to humans shibata and solo gabriele 2012 corsi et al 2016 boehm et al 2018 gonzález saldía et al 2019 and shibata and solo gabrieleet 2012 indicated that the enterovirus was 5 500 mpn g in beach sand for a normal child with a risk level of 1 9 10 2 gonzález saldía et al 2019 suggested that the monitoring area with fc concentration of more than 1 00 105 mpn l resulted higher health risk including ear ailments gastrointestinal illness and symptoms of many illnesses therefore if we take the fc concentration of 1 00 105 mpn l as the pollution threshold the pollution rate of river sections which refers to the ratio of sample quantity over the threshold to the total samples was between 10 05 and 100 fig 4 the river sections in which more than half of the samples were above the threshold occurred at all urban patterns p1 p5 the proportion of these river sections increased to 76 19 after the rainfall compared with a value of 28 57 before the rainfall event and this change could increase the threat to human health 3 2 spatiotemporal dynamics of fc in the beiyun watershed the monthly concentration of p1 p5 varied greatly during different spatiotemporal conditions from 10 to 1 00 106 mpn l as shown in fig 5 in most of the months the samples collected from watershed regions of lower urban density p1 and p5 had higher concentrations than those collected from regions with higher urban density incomplete sewage treatment facilities would be responsible for this phenomenon similar results were also obtained by badgley et al 2019 who analyzed fc samples collected from nine watersheds in southwestern virginia usa this result illustrated different spatiotemporal changes compared with other water quality indicators such as tn tp and no3 in the beiyun watershed liu et al 2018 furthermore the fc concentration in the region of p3 which represented a higher urban density was higher in the wet season june to august shown in fig s2 than in the dry season it was also slightly higher than that in urban rural areas p2 and p4 in the wet season so the nps pollution caused by runoff may be responsible for this situation it should be noted that the fc concentration increased in april and may with less precipitation which may have been due to the advance of the rainy season and the long antecedent dry days according to the previous studies in which the runoff associated with rainfall was a driver of degraded water quality in receiving waters dila et al 2018 and antecedent dry days increased the chance of pollutant accumulation nabiul afrooz and boehm 2017 in addition the whole watershed was highly polluted by fc in december and january studies have shown that the fc concentration was approximately 10 times higher in snowmelt runoff galfi et al 2016 dila et al 2018 which corresponds to the snowy months of january and december in the beiyun watershed consequently the existence of fc in the dry seasons would be more complicated indicating a detailed study should be carried out in the next step 3 3 influence of event scale rainfall on fc concentration the change in fc concentration before and after rainfall was analyzed to explore the response of fc concentration and rainfall runoff as shown in fig 6 ra values of 10 100 and 100 1000 were mainly concentrated in the areas with high urbanization level leight et al 2016 claimed that rainfall events larger than 1 inch tended to result in a significant increase in fc for the following two days the large area of impermeable surface in urban areas is more conducive to fc entering the stream with stormwater runoff thus a higher ra meant a quick and sensitive response to rainfall input in areas with a high urbanization level p3 ra values of 1 10 were mainly distributed along the lower beiyun river the regions of p4 and p5 which were urban rural mixed areas and rural cultivated dominated areas respectively however the monitoring sites located at upstream exhibited different degrees of dilution where the land use types were dominated by forest forestland as a sink landscape can reduce nps pollutants into water bodies which supports the conclusion of a previous study in which the proportion of forest cover was negatively correlated with fc within a watershed mello et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 environmental factors affecting fc concentration in different urban patterns lasso regression analysis was conducted between fc concentration log transformed and environmental factors during the monitoring period excluding december and january because of complications and the regression was examined by cross validation figs s14 s19 the spatiotemporal regression models are shown in table 3 in this study the fc concentration in the beiyun river responded more actively to a combination of environmental factors indicating that multiple environmental factors should be used to explain fc levels in water bodies this result is consistent with previous studies thoe et al 2014 leight et al 2016 badgley et al 2019 wang and deng 2019 however the temporal dynamics of fc in p3 failed due to other complex anthropogenic influences in the urban areas particularly from the point source input as shown in fig s20 it was found that most failures in the regression models were consistent with the distribution and annual discharge of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the beiyun watershed this result agrees with boehm et al 2018 who found that fc pollution in surface water will greatly increase due to the discharge of sewage water it can be seen that the wwtps with high discharge are mainly located in p3 indicating that point source discharge is another important source of fc pollution in this region consequently this may be the main reason why fc cannot be explained by environmental factors in p3 furthermore four environmental factors were selected for the models of p1 p4 and p5 while eight factors were selected for p2 it seems that the urban pattern of p2 which was characterized by a typical urban rural mixed region was undergoing a complex fc source situation all of the models showed a positive correlation between fc and ss zimmer faust et al 2018 previous studies have also reported that ss was positively associated with fc concentration indicating that suspended solid might be as a more suitable place to survive than in water fang et al 2018 there is a negative correlation between rainfall and fc concentration in p1 where the forest land accounted for a considerable proportion badgley et al 2019 also found that natural forest negatively associated with fc interestingly solar radiation was identified as another significant predictor of fc having a negative association which may mask the high concentration of fc caused by stormwater runoff in the wet season this result may be especially true in april june which have the highest solar radiation fig s6 and initial rainfall events that will bring numerous pollutants due to long antecedent dry days the lower fc concentration during the months of september november was mainly inhabited by living conditions such as lower air temperature and water temperature a positive correlation between fc and them a previous study also showed that the optimal growth water temperatures of e coli ranged from 25 c to 37 c noor et al 2013 for spatial regression the annual averaging data from 21 catchments were analyzed table 2 shows the spatial regression model ms with the factor selection process in fig s19 the spatial difference was mainly driven by the land use distribution that was used to distinguish different urban patterns the spatial model in this study suggested that agricultural land impervious land and industry were the dominant sources of the fecal pollution this result is consistent with crim et al 2012 who focused on watersheds with different land uses in four countries unexpectedly forest was identified as a significant factor with a positive correlation in previous studies forest was negatively associated with fecal pollution in surface water and has been suggested as a sink landscape vitro et al 2017 badgley et al 2019 while only some studies such as smith et al 2001 indicated a positive correlation this may depend to a large extent on the characteristics of the watersheds and for the studied urban watershed the artificial forest is planted in the urban areas with a large amount of added fertilizer which may be the source landscape of fc besides population density and road density together represent the urbanization level but show opposite trends for the interpretation of fc roads are an important place for pollutant accumulation while areas with high population density often have complete sewage treatment systems that reduce the discharge of fc in domestic sewage same conclusion was made by vitro et al 2017 importantly the sustained urban nps caused by rapid urbanization may account for a considerable proportion of fc pollution bonkosky et al 2009 liao et al 2015 mattioli et al 2017 the correlations between environmental factors and fecal pollution are expected to be conserved across watersheds with similar land use patterns although specific relationships may need to be recalibrated to more accurately explain fecal pollution and identify the main source 4 2 influence of landscape on fc concentration variation in urban areas due to the influence of point sources in urban areas it failed to explain the temporal difference in fc by environmental factors however the river water quality was indeed affected by nps which has been confirmed by many researchers bonkosky et al 2009 chen et al 2017 fig s21 also shows that there is a positive correlation between the monthly rainfall amount and the streamflow thus a large amount of nps pollution caused by rainfall runoff entered the river consequently to explore the relationship between urban landscape pattern and nps pollution the fc concentration caused by nps was calculated based on eq 4 the regression model is shown in table 4 and cross validation is shown in fig s22 as shown in table 4 only one landscape variable patch density pd which reflects the degree of fragmentation of an area was selected to explain nps pollution of fc in urban areas the model showed that the fragmentation of impervious surfaces could effectively reduce nps fc because of the negative correlation between fc nps and pdurban thus in areas with high urbanization levels reducing the connectivity of impervious surfaces can significantly decrease the nps fc as a result low impact development lid could be used as an effective measure to alleviate this problem ishaq et al 2019 li et al 2019 however numerous authors have observed that streambeds may be the bacterial reservoir for fc which could be released during high flow events garzio hadzick et al 2010 kim et al 2010 at the same time kim et al 2010 noted that streambed release could not be considered during rainfall events as the stream would be dominated by surface runoff during that period even at high streamflow in this study nps fc pollution at both seasonal and event scales was discussed without considering streambed release thus an underestimation or overestimation of runoff impact may exist 4 3 key landscape metrics influencing event scale fc concentration variation the impact of landscape patterns on fc concentration distribution was explored at the rainfall event scale as meteorological and water quality factors did not affect microbial growth during a rainfall event regression analysis was conducted with ra values at 21 monitoring sites as the response variables fig 7 exhibits the results of variable selection all subsets regression for the best three models are reported in table 5 using these results this study for the first time explained the spatial characteristics of nps fc in a complex watershed based on landscape metrics at the event scale the variables of grassland forest and water which refer to the proportions of land use types showed negative effects on the nps fc while impervious surface and cultivated land showed positive correlations this result was also demonstrated in previous studies schoonover and lockaby 2006 shen et al 2014 holcomb et al 2018 nel et al 2018 in regions of p2 and p4 where urban rural areas with medium levels of urbanization existed the fragmentation of rural areas and forests as well as the complexity of impervious surfaces and rural areas characterized by pdrural pdfor lsiurban and lsirural explained the vulnerability of water bodies affected by nps fc pollution input moreover the fragmentation of impervious surfaces characterized by pdurban could be an effective way to indicate nps fc based on the negative relationship between them interestingly by considering the spatial heterogeneity of forestland the high density forests characterized by forest and lpifor located upstream showed a negative correlation with nps fc while the fragmented forests located in urban areas showed a positive correlation with nps fc in the beiyun river the detailed classifications of forest land in remote sensing data were merged into one class in this study however the nurseries orchards and wetlands were distributed in areas other than upstream and these land types require artificial maintenance and fertilization research conducted by liu et al 2018 in the beiyun watershed also showed the spatial instability in the response of forestland to pollutants indicating the importance of considering the detailed classification of land use our study expounded the terrestrial transmission process of fc from the perspective of landscape patterns which will be more targeted for fc management 4 4 management implications fc reproduction under suitable environmental conditions seems to be one of the primary causes for its pollution during which urbanization levels provided significant differences therefore water management strategies in complex watersheds should be reconsidered based on more detailed characteristics so that managers might identify the best policy decisions for regional watershed management variables that are driven by natural forces are difficult to change but the impact of ss and landscape may be altered by the thoughtful design of city planning and runoff management facilities for instance in this study controlling ss can effectively reduce fc because of the strong correlation between them in different urban patterns however more factors should be considered in urban areas kim et al 2010 indicated that turbidity might be the best indicator of fecal pollution at low streamflow thus the combination of source and process control realized by lid may effectively relieve fecal pollution in water bodies fletcher et al 2015 few studies have reported that macrophyte roots provide a larger surface area for microbe removal in water shingare et al 2019 specifically the control of pollutant build up and wash off processes on roads and the restoration of the ecological function of water bodies would be a long term strategy for fc management jeon et al 2019 a better understanding of the relationships between nps fc and landscape patterns will help integrate nps fc management into lid process and help with water quality improvements in the future the study of the correlation between nps fc and landscape patterns showed that fc can be improved by reducing the connectivity of impervious surfaces with grasslands for example ra will decrease by 5 10 times with a doubled level of fragmentation of impervious land according to the all subsets regression it is especially true in areas with high urbanization levels that the nps concentration of fc decreased exponentially with the increase in fragmentation of impervious surface in addition the forestland affected by human activities should be considered due to its spatial instability future site specific work is needed to track the sources of fc at different urban levels and explore the efficiency of lid facilities on fc the results from the current study provide key information that may be helpful for complex watershed management 5 conclusion the present study reports the dynamics and influencing factors of river fecal coliform collected from 21 sampling sites with 5 urban patterns over a period of two years the introduction of urban patterns coupled with landscape metrics allowed the targeted and accurate prediction of spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics despite high serious fc pollution occurred in all urban patterns relatively high monthly concentrations were found in p1 and p5 where high density villages are located rainfall events increased the polluted river sections by 47 62 and ra values of 10 100 and 100 1000 were mainly concentrated in the areas with high urbanization levels in addition the prediction models between fc concentration and environmental factors could be highly variable depending on urbanization levels regression analyses revealed that controlling ss can effectively reduce fc because of the strong correlation between them in different urban patterns while more factors should be considered in urban as such future prediction of fecal pollution may require an urbanization context rather than a universal situation both the event scale and seasonal scale regression analyses showed that key landscape metrics could successfully explain the nps fc in a complex watershed reducing the connectivity of impervious surfaces in urban areas can be an effective measure to control nps pollution of fc this will aid in management strategies of optimal landscape planning for restoration of water quality it is noteworthy that the nps fc concentration calculated in this study contains some possible uncertainties the nps fc concentration was calculated without considering streambed release thus an underestimation or overestimation of runoff impact may exist more efforts are needed to obtain more data to analyze

17903,fecal coliform bacteria are a key indicator of human health risks however the spatiotemporal variability and key influencing factors of river fecal coliform have yet to be explored in a rural suburban urban watershed with multiple land uses in this study the fecal coliform concentrations in 21 river sections were monitored for 20 months and 441 samples were analyzed multivariable regressions were used to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of fecal coliform the results showed that spatial differences were mainly dominated by urbanization level and environmental factors could explain the temporal dynamics of fecal coliform in different urban patterns except in areas with high urbanization levels reducing suspended solids is a direct way to manage fecal coliform in the beiyun river when the natural factors are difficulty to change such as temperature and solar radiation the export of fecal coliform from urban areas showed a quick and sensitive response to rainfall events and increased dozens of times in the short term landscape patterns such as the fragmentation of impervious surfaces and the overall landscape were identified as key factors influencing urban non point source bacteria the results obtained from this study will provide insight into the management of river fecal pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords fecal coliform complex watershed urban patterns multivariable regressions spatiotemporal dynamics non point source pollution 1 introduction with the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 in the world the spatiotemporal distribution and influencing factors of microbial pollution in rivers especially in urban rivers have become the focus of scientific research microbial pollution around the world is routinely assessed using concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria fib including escherichia coli and enterococci as proxies for pathogenic organisms wyn jones et al 2011 such bacteria are present in the feces stachler et al 2017 runoff molina et al 2014 and sewage discharges jennings et al 2018 and their presence is a considerable issue concerning river risk management and human health risk chenar and deng 2018 as a type of fib fecal coliform fc has been widely used in the risk assessment of microbial pollution in water boehm et al 2018 uprety et al 2020 the national health and medical research council of australia and the european environment agency eea both use fc as one of the microbiological indicators of drinking water quality the fc index is particularly important especially in areas where marine products are abundant wang and deng 2019 previous studies have reported two significant observations of the worldwide fc situation on the one hand fc is inherently bioactive differing from other physical and chemical pollutants and the reported amount of microbial pollution in the environment has raised concerns regarding ecosystem and human health frena et al 2019 on the other hand the state and concentration of fc in water bodies are dynamic and are related to environmental factors chen and liu 2017 carpenter et al 2019 jeon et al 2019 a growing body of research has proven that the dynamic nature of fc survival and concentration in surface water bodies is driven by emissions and environmental factors that determine fc transport and fate mitch et al 2010 liu et al 2015 fc can reproduce rapidly under optimal environmental conditions for growth and reproduction varies with factors such as water temperature temperature solar radiation rainfall and turbidity leight et al 2016 chen and liu 2017 regression models can be applied to explore how one environmental factor affects fc levels while the remaining factors are fixed however it usually has poor fitness this result may be due to the complicated and nonlinear relationship between environmental factors and fc fan et al 2015 tong et al 2016 wang and deng 2019 several additional studies have investigated the link between land use types and fc concentration including urban development levels agriculture dominated watersheds and comparisons of different watershed types sliva 2001 walters et al 2011 chow et al 2013 mcmichael et al 2013 badgley et al 2019 vitro et al 2017 found that road density was positively correlated with fc contamination and negatively related to the area of water body in addition regions with water quality degradation due to nutrients usually have high fc concentrations and this result has been found in other studies mallin et al 2000 forest and grass may be positively correlated with fc concentrations in water bodies because these landscapes provide places for poultry breeding smith et al 2001 together these studies have indicated that the watershed scale fc dynamics could be predicted by examining fc occurrence and concentration data coupled with environmental factors however the limited scope of these monitoring datasets and the combination of landscape patterns related to the transmission path of non point source pollution nps have not allowed for generalizable conclusions regarding how such programs coupled with environmental factors impact the contaminant levels in a complex watershed with mixed land use types in this study a typical urbanized watershed with a drainage area greater than 4000 km2 was monitored at both the monthly scale and the event scale the primary goal of this study was to improve our fundamental understanding of the drivers of fc in surface water systems the objectives of the study were to 1 investigate the spatiotemporal variation in fc in a mixed land use watershed 2 quantify the impacts of urbanization processes and environmental factors on the fc dynamics and 3 identify the key landscape metrics influencing the event scale fc concentration variation 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area description and division the beiyun river flows through the eastern suburbs of beijing and tianjin and it is a tributary of the haihe river which is one of the seven major river basins in china the study area is located in beijing city spanning from the middle northwest to the southeast covering eight districts with a total basin area of 4348 km2 and a total river length of 89 4 km details on the beiyun watershed including the digital elevation model dem 30 m resolution climate river system conventional water quality and function are provided elsewhere shen et al 2015 liu et al 2018 the land use in 2017 showed approximately 20 of forest land 30 agricultural land and 40 urban land the urban areas are mainly located in the middle of the watershed and spread up and down gradually showing a rural suburban urban gradient eight main tributaries exist in the beiyun watershed most of which are suffering serious fc pollution because of a series of anthropogenic activities however water environment management in the beiyun river is extremely challenging the region is experiencing rapid urbanization and fc management should have regional characteristics accordingly a total of 21 water quality sampling sites s1 s21 were selected along the mainstream and its tributaries as well as the confluence considering the characteristics of the main stream urbanization level land use patterns and accessibility thereafter the watershed boundaries and river network were delineated in arcgis with the hydrological module based on the digital elevation model dem 30 m resolution taking each of the sampling sites as the outlet of a delineated catchment the catchment areas c1 c21 responding to s1 s21 were determined for further study the catchments could be divided into five categories represented by five urban patterns with different urbanization levels fig 1 considering spatial land use types fig 2 in pattern 1 p1 c1 c3 and pattern 5 p5 c19 c21 impervious surfaces accounted for less than 30 which represented a low urbanization level however the difference between p1 and p5 was that there was a large part of forestland in p1 while cultivated land was dominant in p5 in p2 c4 c10 and p4 c17 c18 the impervious surface ratio was between 30 and 60 indicating a moderate urbanization level the central areas were characterized by a relatively higher percentage of impervious surfaces occupying approximately 80 which were regarded as urban pattern with high urbanization level p3 2 2 sample collection and analysis a total of 441 water samples for fecal bacteria 21 samples from 21 sites for each of 20 months and a rainfall event were collected using sterilized 500 ml plastic bottles sampling was conducted monthly from march 2017 to december 2018 sampling occurred on approximately the same date each month regardless of weather conditions with the hope of reducing sampling errors additionally a rainfall event on may 22 2017 with an average rainfall of 29 2 mm was also included pre drying days of almost 2 months samples were collected before the rainfall event on may 20 and after the event on may 25 2017 manual sampling was performed due to the limitation of automatic sampling equipment in the study area to ensure that no contamination occurred sample collection was taken prior to field measurements at each sampling site sample bottles were conditioned in stream by rinsing three times with stream water before retaining the sample samples were immediately placed in a cooler after sampling and shipped to the research centre for eco environmental science chinese academy of sciences in beijing china for fc analysis within 24 h water physicochemical samples for chemical oxygen demand cod and suspended solids ss were also collected at the time and were analyzed at an accredited laboratory using the determination methods for the examination of water and wastewater 4th edition field measurements were conducted for ph dissolved oxygen and water temperature in the experiment blank samples and quality control samples were operated first to verify the accuracy of the experimental instrument and operation then the water quality indicators of cod and ss were conducted 2 3 selection of environmental variables we aimed to explore the drivers of fc fate in a mixed land use watershed and thereby compiled a set of environmental factors that have been previously reported or are expected to contribute to fc dynamics at watershed scales chen and liu 2017 jeon et al 2019 the environmental factors are summarized in table 1 including meteorological factors urbanization factors and water physicochemical factors meteorological factors came from daily monitoring data of the five national meteorological stations in and around the study area available at http www resdc cn default aspx and the values were converted into monthly averages the ordinary kriging method tukimat et al 2019 used in geographical spatial interpolation was adopted to calculate the rainfall amount temperature and solar radiation in each catchment area and the results are detailed in the figs s1 s6 the urbanization factors represented by population density and road density were also calculated fig s7 water physicochemical factors were manually measured figs s8 s12 to study the effect of landscape configuration on nps fc landscape metrics were calculated from land use by fragstats 4 2 software mcgarigal and marks 1995 six landscape metrics at the landscape level and eight metrics at the class level were selected to represent the shape structure diversity and aggregation of the landscape 2 4 global autocorrelation global autocorrelation was calculated to evaluate the spatial independence of the monitoring sites by moran s i briefly the spatial statistics toolbox in arcgis was applied to generate the result the sampling sites should cover the spatial characteristics of the watershed but should avoid the spatial interference of the upstream sites on downstream sites the spatial randomness of the selected sampling sites ensured the statistical significance of the spatiotemporal variability and the key influencing factors of river fc the moran s i ranged from 1 to 1 the scenario with a lower absolute value of moran s i and z score 1 65 z 1 65 shows a weaker autocorrelation and these indexes are defined as follows 1 i n s 0 i 1 n j 1 n w i j z i z j i 1 n z i 2 2 s 0 i 1 n j 1 n w i j 3 z i i e i v i where z i is the deviation of element i from its mean value of x i x w i j is the spatial weight between i and j n is the total number of elements and s 0 is the sum of all spatial weights 2 5 multivariable regression 2 5 1 lasso regression to find the best combinations of environmental variables for the explanation of spatiotemporal variability of fc in different regions p1 p5 the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso tibshirani 1996 was conducted eight environmental factors including three meteorological factors and five water environment factors table 1 were added for temporal regression in the fiver urban patterns a total of 17 factors were added to the spatial regression including three meteorological factors five water environment factors two urbanization factors and seven land use areas as shown in fig 2 except for bare land briefly the five independent datasets of p1 p5 were temporally analyzed the spatial analysis was conducted with annual averaging in different catchment areas however this approach may have an impact on the regression analysis of urban region p3 due to more point source inputs therefore to weaken the influence of point sources fc analysis in p3 was divided into the rainy season and dry season the pollution load increment in the rainy season was regarded as the nps input many researchers employ the rainy season and dry season when exploring the spatiotemporal changes in water quality according to precipitation luo et al 2018 han et al 2020 therefore june july and august were regarded as the rainy season in this study march april and november were the dry seasons of 2017 while october november and december were the dry months of 2018 according to the monthly rainfall amount in fig s2 simultaneously the selected dry seasons excluded the snow months the fc concentration caused by nps was calculated by eq 4 the monthly flow data of each sampling section were necessary when calculating the increment of pollution load the monthly flow data from 2013 to 2018 of two hydrological stations in the beiyun watershed were obtained from the local environmental protection bureau based on which swat soil and water assessment tool model was calibrated and verified to simulate the monthly average streamflow of each river section model performance and parameter selection are shown in fig 3 and table 2 monthly swat simulated streamflow can be judged as satisfactory with r2 0 6 and e ns 0 5 according to previous study moriasi et al 2015 thereafter the response relationship between nps pollution and landscape patterns in urban areas was carried out using lasso 4 c n p s c r a i n y q r a i n y c d r y q d r y q r a i n y where c n p s is the concentration of fc caused by nps c r a i n y and c d r y are the fc concentrations in the rainy seasons and dry seasons respectively and q r a i n y and q d r y are the streamflow in the rainy seasons and dry seasons respectively a penalty function was constructed in lasso to compress some variable coefficients to 0 this process is done to measure the goodness of fit and penalize against overfitting therefore an optimal fitting model can be obtained the 10 fold cross validation was introduced to minimize spurious relations when selecting variables the final regression models were selected by the optimal λ from the cross validation zhao and bondell 2020 and the regression coefficients were obtained with statistical significance t statistic p 0 05 data analyses were performed using r version 3 6 1 with the glmnet package friedman et al 2010 2 5 2 all subsets regression concentrations of fc will change significantly after rainfall events therefore the key landscape metrics influencing the event scale fc concentration variation should be discussed the computation of the fc concentration variation level r a was based upon the following equation 5 r a c a c b where c a and c b correspond to the river fc concentration after and before a rainfall event respectively the inherent diversity and complexity of landscape patterns requires diversity models to better understand how landscape patterns may influence the transport process of nps fc all subsets regression provides all possible combinations of variable selection with different fitting performances this method provides a variety of model selections thus all subsets regression wasserman and sudjianto 1994 for samples that were collected before and after rainfall events were used to explore key landscape metrics to help explain r a all possible combinations of important landscape metrics for each independent multivariable regression technique were created and the covariate coefficients were determined to be statistically significant data analysis was performed using excel and r with the glmulti package calcagno and claire 2010 3 results 3 1 fc pollution in the beiyun watershed the fc concentrations were calculated at 21 monitoring sites for global autocorrelation analysis using a gis based method the results of this study with a z score of 0 29 and a p value of 0 77 fig s13 showed that the pattern did not appear to be significantly different than that caused by random chance therefore the arrangement of sampling sites in this study was reasonable according to two years of monitoring the fc concentrations of 441 samples ranged from 20 3 50 107 mpn l 60 76 of which were greater than 1 00 105 mpn l many studies have shown that fecal pollution may cause serious health risk to humans shibata and solo gabriele 2012 corsi et al 2016 boehm et al 2018 gonzález saldía et al 2019 and shibata and solo gabrieleet 2012 indicated that the enterovirus was 5 500 mpn g in beach sand for a normal child with a risk level of 1 9 10 2 gonzález saldía et al 2019 suggested that the monitoring area with fc concentration of more than 1 00 105 mpn l resulted higher health risk including ear ailments gastrointestinal illness and symptoms of many illnesses therefore if we take the fc concentration of 1 00 105 mpn l as the pollution threshold the pollution rate of river sections which refers to the ratio of sample quantity over the threshold to the total samples was between 10 05 and 100 fig 4 the river sections in which more than half of the samples were above the threshold occurred at all urban patterns p1 p5 the proportion of these river sections increased to 76 19 after the rainfall compared with a value of 28 57 before the rainfall event and this change could increase the threat to human health 3 2 spatiotemporal dynamics of fc in the beiyun watershed the monthly concentration of p1 p5 varied greatly during different spatiotemporal conditions from 10 to 1 00 106 mpn l as shown in fig 5 in most of the months the samples collected from watershed regions of lower urban density p1 and p5 had higher concentrations than those collected from regions with higher urban density incomplete sewage treatment facilities would be responsible for this phenomenon similar results were also obtained by badgley et al 2019 who analyzed fc samples collected from nine watersheds in southwestern virginia usa this result illustrated different spatiotemporal changes compared with other water quality indicators such as tn tp and no3 in the beiyun watershed liu et al 2018 furthermore the fc concentration in the region of p3 which represented a higher urban density was higher in the wet season june to august shown in fig s2 than in the dry season it was also slightly higher than that in urban rural areas p2 and p4 in the wet season so the nps pollution caused by runoff may be responsible for this situation it should be noted that the fc concentration increased in april and may with less precipitation which may have been due to the advance of the rainy season and the long antecedent dry days according to the previous studies in which the runoff associated with rainfall was a driver of degraded water quality in receiving waters dila et al 2018 and antecedent dry days increased the chance of pollutant accumulation nabiul afrooz and boehm 2017 in addition the whole watershed was highly polluted by fc in december and january studies have shown that the fc concentration was approximately 10 times higher in snowmelt runoff galfi et al 2016 dila et al 2018 which corresponds to the snowy months of january and december in the beiyun watershed consequently the existence of fc in the dry seasons would be more complicated indicating a detailed study should be carried out in the next step 3 3 influence of event scale rainfall on fc concentration the change in fc concentration before and after rainfall was analyzed to explore the response of fc concentration and rainfall runoff as shown in fig 6 ra values of 10 100 and 100 1000 were mainly concentrated in the areas with high urbanization level leight et al 2016 claimed that rainfall events larger than 1 inch tended to result in a significant increase in fc for the following two days the large area of impermeable surface in urban areas is more conducive to fc entering the stream with stormwater runoff thus a higher ra meant a quick and sensitive response to rainfall input in areas with a high urbanization level p3 ra values of 1 10 were mainly distributed along the lower beiyun river the regions of p4 and p5 which were urban rural mixed areas and rural cultivated dominated areas respectively however the monitoring sites located at upstream exhibited different degrees of dilution where the land use types were dominated by forest forestland as a sink landscape can reduce nps pollutants into water bodies which supports the conclusion of a previous study in which the proportion of forest cover was negatively correlated with fc within a watershed mello et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 environmental factors affecting fc concentration in different urban patterns lasso regression analysis was conducted between fc concentration log transformed and environmental factors during the monitoring period excluding december and january because of complications and the regression was examined by cross validation figs s14 s19 the spatiotemporal regression models are shown in table 3 in this study the fc concentration in the beiyun river responded more actively to a combination of environmental factors indicating that multiple environmental factors should be used to explain fc levels in water bodies this result is consistent with previous studies thoe et al 2014 leight et al 2016 badgley et al 2019 wang and deng 2019 however the temporal dynamics of fc in p3 failed due to other complex anthropogenic influences in the urban areas particularly from the point source input as shown in fig s20 it was found that most failures in the regression models were consistent with the distribution and annual discharge of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the beiyun watershed this result agrees with boehm et al 2018 who found that fc pollution in surface water will greatly increase due to the discharge of sewage water it can be seen that the wwtps with high discharge are mainly located in p3 indicating that point source discharge is another important source of fc pollution in this region consequently this may be the main reason why fc cannot be explained by environmental factors in p3 furthermore four environmental factors were selected for the models of p1 p4 and p5 while eight factors were selected for p2 it seems that the urban pattern of p2 which was characterized by a typical urban rural mixed region was undergoing a complex fc source situation all of the models showed a positive correlation between fc and ss zimmer faust et al 2018 previous studies have also reported that ss was positively associated with fc concentration indicating that suspended solid might be as a more suitable place to survive than in water fang et al 2018 there is a negative correlation between rainfall and fc concentration in p1 where the forest land accounted for a considerable proportion badgley et al 2019 also found that natural forest negatively associated with fc interestingly solar radiation was identified as another significant predictor of fc having a negative association which may mask the high concentration of fc caused by stormwater runoff in the wet season this result may be especially true in april june which have the highest solar radiation fig s6 and initial rainfall events that will bring numerous pollutants due to long antecedent dry days the lower fc concentration during the months of september november was mainly inhabited by living conditions such as lower air temperature and water temperature a positive correlation between fc and them a previous study also showed that the optimal growth water temperatures of e coli ranged from 25 c to 37 c noor et al 2013 for spatial regression the annual averaging data from 21 catchments were analyzed table 2 shows the spatial regression model ms with the factor selection process in fig s19 the spatial difference was mainly driven by the land use distribution that was used to distinguish different urban patterns the spatial model in this study suggested that agricultural land impervious land and industry were the dominant sources of the fecal pollution this result is consistent with crim et al 2012 who focused on watersheds with different land uses in four countries unexpectedly forest was identified as a significant factor with a positive correlation in previous studies forest was negatively associated with fecal pollution in surface water and has been suggested as a sink landscape vitro et al 2017 badgley et al 2019 while only some studies such as smith et al 2001 indicated a positive correlation this may depend to a large extent on the characteristics of the watersheds and for the studied urban watershed the artificial forest is planted in the urban areas with a large amount of added fertilizer which may be the source landscape of fc besides population density and road density together represent the urbanization level but show opposite trends for the interpretation of fc roads are an important place for pollutant accumulation while areas with high population density often have complete sewage treatment systems that reduce the discharge of fc in domestic sewage same conclusion was made by vitro et al 2017 importantly the sustained urban nps caused by rapid urbanization may account for a considerable proportion of fc pollution bonkosky et al 2009 liao et al 2015 mattioli et al 2017 the correlations between environmental factors and fecal pollution are expected to be conserved across watersheds with similar land use patterns although specific relationships may need to be recalibrated to more accurately explain fecal pollution and identify the main source 4 2 influence of landscape on fc concentration variation in urban areas due to the influence of point sources in urban areas it failed to explain the temporal difference in fc by environmental factors however the river water quality was indeed affected by nps which has been confirmed by many researchers bonkosky et al 2009 chen et al 2017 fig s21 also shows that there is a positive correlation between the monthly rainfall amount and the streamflow thus a large amount of nps pollution caused by rainfall runoff entered the river consequently to explore the relationship between urban landscape pattern and nps pollution the fc concentration caused by nps was calculated based on eq 4 the regression model is shown in table 4 and cross validation is shown in fig s22 as shown in table 4 only one landscape variable patch density pd which reflects the degree of fragmentation of an area was selected to explain nps pollution of fc in urban areas the model showed that the fragmentation of impervious surfaces could effectively reduce nps fc because of the negative correlation between fc nps and pdurban thus in areas with high urbanization levels reducing the connectivity of impervious surfaces can significantly decrease the nps fc as a result low impact development lid could be used as an effective measure to alleviate this problem ishaq et al 2019 li et al 2019 however numerous authors have observed that streambeds may be the bacterial reservoir for fc which could be released during high flow events garzio hadzick et al 2010 kim et al 2010 at the same time kim et al 2010 noted that streambed release could not be considered during rainfall events as the stream would be dominated by surface runoff during that period even at high streamflow in this study nps fc pollution at both seasonal and event scales was discussed without considering streambed release thus an underestimation or overestimation of runoff impact may exist 4 3 key landscape metrics influencing event scale fc concentration variation the impact of landscape patterns on fc concentration distribution was explored at the rainfall event scale as meteorological and water quality factors did not affect microbial growth during a rainfall event regression analysis was conducted with ra values at 21 monitoring sites as the response variables fig 7 exhibits the results of variable selection all subsets regression for the best three models are reported in table 5 using these results this study for the first time explained the spatial characteristics of nps fc in a complex watershed based on landscape metrics at the event scale the variables of grassland forest and water which refer to the proportions of land use types showed negative effects on the nps fc while impervious surface and cultivated land showed positive correlations this result was also demonstrated in previous studies schoonover and lockaby 2006 shen et al 2014 holcomb et al 2018 nel et al 2018 in regions of p2 and p4 where urban rural areas with medium levels of urbanization existed the fragmentation of rural areas and forests as well as the complexity of impervious surfaces and rural areas characterized by pdrural pdfor lsiurban and lsirural explained the vulnerability of water bodies affected by nps fc pollution input moreover the fragmentation of impervious surfaces characterized by pdurban could be an effective way to indicate nps fc based on the negative relationship between them interestingly by considering the spatial heterogeneity of forestland the high density forests characterized by forest and lpifor located upstream showed a negative correlation with nps fc while the fragmented forests located in urban areas showed a positive correlation with nps fc in the beiyun river the detailed classifications of forest land in remote sensing data were merged into one class in this study however the nurseries orchards and wetlands were distributed in areas other than upstream and these land types require artificial maintenance and fertilization research conducted by liu et al 2018 in the beiyun watershed also showed the spatial instability in the response of forestland to pollutants indicating the importance of considering the detailed classification of land use our study expounded the terrestrial transmission process of fc from the perspective of landscape patterns which will be more targeted for fc management 4 4 management implications fc reproduction under suitable environmental conditions seems to be one of the primary causes for its pollution during which urbanization levels provided significant differences therefore water management strategies in complex watersheds should be reconsidered based on more detailed characteristics so that managers might identify the best policy decisions for regional watershed management variables that are driven by natural forces are difficult to change but the impact of ss and landscape may be altered by the thoughtful design of city planning and runoff management facilities for instance in this study controlling ss can effectively reduce fc because of the strong correlation between them in different urban patterns however more factors should be considered in urban areas kim et al 2010 indicated that turbidity might be the best indicator of fecal pollution at low streamflow thus the combination of source and process control realized by lid may effectively relieve fecal pollution in water bodies fletcher et al 2015 few studies have reported that macrophyte roots provide a larger surface area for microbe removal in water shingare et al 2019 specifically the control of pollutant build up and wash off processes on roads and the restoration of the ecological function of water bodies would be a long term strategy for fc management jeon et al 2019 a better understanding of the relationships between nps fc and landscape patterns will help integrate nps fc management into lid process and help with water quality improvements in the future the study of the correlation between nps fc and landscape patterns showed that fc can be improved by reducing the connectivity of impervious surfaces with grasslands for example ra will decrease by 5 10 times with a doubled level of fragmentation of impervious land according to the all subsets regression it is especially true in areas with high urbanization levels that the nps concentration of fc decreased exponentially with the increase in fragmentation of impervious surface in addition the forestland affected by human activities should be considered due to its spatial instability future site specific work is needed to track the sources of fc at different urban levels and explore the efficiency of lid facilities on fc the results from the current study provide key information that may be helpful for complex watershed management 5 conclusion the present study reports the dynamics and influencing factors of river fecal coliform collected from 21 sampling sites with 5 urban patterns over a period of two years the introduction of urban patterns coupled with landscape metrics allowed the targeted and accurate prediction of spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics despite high serious fc pollution occurred in all urban patterns relatively high monthly concentrations were found in p1 and p5 where high density villages are located rainfall events increased the polluted river sections by 47 62 and ra values of 10 100 and 100 1000 were mainly concentrated in the areas with high urbanization levels in addition the prediction models between fc concentration and environmental factors could be highly variable depending on urbanization levels regression analyses revealed that controlling ss can effectively reduce fc because of the strong correlation between them in different urban patterns while more factors should be considered in urban as such future prediction of fecal pollution may require an urbanization context rather than a universal situation both the event scale and seasonal scale regression analyses showed that key landscape metrics could successfully explain the nps fc in a complex watershed reducing the connectivity of impervious surfaces in urban areas can be an effective measure to control nps pollution of fc this will aid in management strategies of optimal landscape planning for restoration of water quality it is noteworthy that the nps fc concentration calculated in this study contains some possible uncertainties the nps fc concentration was calculated without considering streambed release thus an underestimation or overestimation of runoff impact may exist more efforts are needed to obtain more data to analyze the key influencing factors of river fc within a typical complex watershed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17904,thermal stratification and mixing are important to the physicochemical composition of reservoirs and lakes and impact their water quality and biogeochemical cycles however it remains unclear how thermal stratification and mixing process control the exchange of co2 between surface water and the earth s atmosphere to address this issue we examine the temporal characteristics of some physicochemical parameters partial pressure of co2 pco2 the δ13cdic and co2 emission from a typical karst groundwater fed reservoir dalongdong reservoir during the 23 month study 2016 2018 thermal stratification limited co2 emission in part from photosynthetic uptake of co2 from early april to late october while mixing processes stimulated co2 emission of co2 generated from organic matter remineralization in bottom water from october to april the dalongdong reservoir is an atmospheric source of co2 for most of the study period however during periods of stratification approximately 0 37 0 44 gg co2 1 gg 109g dissolved into the water from the atmosphere while approximately 6 24 3 73 gg co2 was lost to the atmosphere during periods lacking stratification limited emissions during stratified period may thus represent a negative feedback to co2 contributions to global warming which has increased lengths of stratified periods these study results are important to optimize sampling monitoring strategies to reduce errors of regional co2 emission estimation graphical abstract image 1 keywords co2 emission thermal stratification mixing period groundwater fed reservoir china 1 introduction exchange of co2 between the atmosphere and inland water bodies rivers lakes ponds and reservoirs represents an important flux of the terrestrial carbon c in the global carbon cycle cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 barros et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 although exchange is both into and out of inland water bodies the net flux of approximately 2 1 pg c yr represents an atmospheric source ciais et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 areal distribution of surface water has increased through damming of streams for hydroelectric power water surface area of man made dams and reservoirs currently cover more than 300 000 km2 on the earth lehner et al 2011 hertwich 2013 deemer et al 2016 the shift from flowing to static hydrologic systems has changed the carbon cycle through enhancing co2 evasion which first pointed out in the pioneering work by rudd et al 1993 and duchemin et al 1995 although numerous studies over past twenty five years have shown super saturation of co2 with respect to atmosphere in the surface water of reservoirs the total mass evading to the atmosphere is poorly constrained rudd et al 1993 st louis et al 2000 barros et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 deemer et al 2016 st louis et al 2000 first published an estimate of up to 272 7 tg c yr 1 of total co2 emission from reservoirs or 4 of the anthropogenic co2 source based on a limited data barros et al 2011 estimated of 48 tg c yr 1 evasion to the atmosphere corresponding to 17 6 of st louis et al s value while deemer et al 2016 reported even smaller emission amounts of 36 8 tg c yr 1 these divergent estimates of evasion reflect the complexity of making these estimates because of limited data and spatial and temporal heterogeneity of emission raymond et al 2013 paranaíba et al 2018 rather than integrating spot emission measurements around the globe however global estimates could also be evaluated through studies of processes regulating co2 emissions to inform global predictive models of present and future role of reservoirs in the global c cycle battin et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 hotchkiss et al 2015 deemer et al 2016 paranaíba et al 2018 we study one of those processes here the development and breakdown of thermal stratification co2 emission from reservoirs is a dynamic process that can be controlled by many factors including reservoir age wind speed temperature ecosystem metabolism solar radiation and nutrient and organic carbon delivery to the reservoir all of which affect the co2 concentration gradient between the water and atmospheres tranvik et al 2009 maberly et al 2012 adamczyk and shurin 2015 marcé et al 2015 deemer et al 2016 paranaíba et al 2018 sources of dissolved co2 include mineralization of organic carbon and dissolution of carbonate mineral phases dissolved co2 can be lost to the atmosphere by diffusive flux across the air water interface st louis et al 2000 tranvik et al 2009 barros et al 2011 hertwich 2013 deemer et al 2016 future changes to climate and rainfall temperature and wind patterns are likely to alter co2 exchange between the atmosphere and surface water particularly with enhanced floods or droughts hertwich 2013 deemer et al 2016 jin et al 2016 li et al 2016 liu et al 2016 tonetta et al 2017 although some of the dynamic factors controlling co2 emissions from reservoirs have been documented over the past few decades research about how thermal stratification breakdown of stratification and mixing affect co2 emissions especially through seasons in different climate zone is no enough the lack of understanding of seasonal variations caused by stratification and mixing is likely to lead to inaccuracies in global estimates of co2 emissions from reservoirs and lakes thermal stratification and mixing of reservoirs or lakes are likely important to co2 emissions because of their impacts on nutrient cycling phytoplankton dynamics and redox status conditions baehr and degrandpre 2004 komatsu et al 2006 schmid et al 2006 boehrer and schultze 2008 bellido et al 2009 lópez et al 2011 morales pineda et al 2014 adamczyk and shurin 2015 stratification and mixing result from water temperature and density variations in natural lakes which are influenced by seasonal meteorological conditions boehrer and schultze 2008 elçi 2008 ivey et al 2008 wang et al 2012 kerimoglu and rinke 2013 kelly et al 2001 found water pco2 declines in summer as stratification reduces the ratio of epilimnetic area to the epilimnetic volume in 11 boreal lakes åberg et al 2010 also showed thermal stratification maintained low surface water pco2 in summer when the epilimnion was deep and warm in merasjärvi lake in boreal sweden although timing and controls of thermal stratification are well known less is know how the changes in thermal structure affect co2 emissions or linked its biogeochemical processes in subtropical inland waters karst covers around 15 of the earth s continental surfaces ford and williams 2007 chen et al 2017 numerous reservoirs were built in karst areas for water supply and flood control due to water shortage and flood hazards milanović 2011 thousands of karst reservoirs were built in south china indo china peninsula balkan peninsula dinaric region anatolian peninsula apennine peninsula iberian peninsula east usa etc milanović 2011 therefore karst freshwater reservoir is one of the important reservoir types around the world carbonate contents are often higher in karst freshwater reservoirs than in non karst reservoirs due to the dissolution of carbonate rocks which may cause higher co2 fluxes however although there are some studies on co2 fluxes in karst reservoirs large uncertainty still exists in estimated co2 fluxes and it is still unclear whether they sequester or release co2 in this paper we evaluate how thermal stratification and mixing processes control changes of co2 emissions from a subtropical reservoir in southeastern china based on 23 months of monitored water temperature physicochemical parameters δ13cdic and co2 concentrations and directly measured fluxes in a karst groundwater fed reservoir results of this study emphasize the need to understand how thermal stratification affects seasonal variations in co2 fluxes to the atmosphere to minimize the uncertainty of global estimates of co2 fluxes from lakes or reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the dalongdong reservoir dld is typical of ten karst groundwater fed reservoirs in south china s karst region fig 1 a the dld reservoir was built in 1950s and has a surface area of about 8 79 106 m2 and total storage capacity of 1 51 108 m3 within a 310 km2 catchment it is recharged by two karst subterranean streams the xialong subterranean stream and the dalongdong subterranean stream fig 1c which source about 99 of the reservoir water based on a mass balance of inputs and outputs huang et al 2018 both outlets of two subterranean streams were located in the bottom at the reservoir tail the dam was built at the end of natural karst valley surrounded by typical karst peak cluster as a source of hydroelectric power fig 1b and c the dld reservoir release water through a buried headrace tunnel near the reservoir bottom for power generation the average water depth of the dld reservoir is about 11 m the climate in the dld reservoir area is subtropical humid monsoonal with mean annual air temperature of 21 7 c and mean annual precipitation of 1294 mm with most occurring from april to september around the reservoir the main human activities are agriculture and tourism with limited industry in general the dld reservoir is a better experiment site to study the variations of co2 fluxes from karst reservoir without disturbances of surface river or stream flow 2 2 water samples collection and analysis a representative sampling site 23 35 27 4 n 108 35 18 2 e was chosen in the downstream part of the dld reservoir fig 1c where average water depth over the study period was 15 5 m the sampling site was about 70 m from the bank of the reservoir which is formed of steep limestone mountain slopes the sampling site is located in the downstream open water area where have relatively small influence from surrounding mountain and have relative homogeneous and wide water surface water temperature was continuously monitored in situ from july 2016 to december 2018 using a temperature logger with a resolution of 0 1 c hobo pendant ua 002 64 onset company u s a at depths of 0 5 m 5 0 m 10 0 m and 15 0 m at 15 min interval below the water surface for obtaining high resolution information of water temperature variation in order to obtain the vertical water temperature characteristics and calculate the indicator of thermal stratification intensity additional higher spatial resolution of vertical water temperature measurements were made by collecting water samples at one or two months sampling intervals from the surface layer to bottom at 2 5m intervals using a depth setting sampler hydro bios ruttner from december 2016 to december 2018 and immediately measuring the temperature in situ with a ysi multi parameters meters ysi prodss yellow spring u s a the probes were calibrated according to the manufacturer s specifications prior to deployment for obtaining hydrochemical characteristics of the surface layer water in the dld reservoir water temperature ph do and specific conductivity spc were measured in situ 0 1 m below the surface using ysi multi parameters meters in the morning about 10 11 am at each sampling time resolutions for temperature ph do and spc were 0 1 c 0 01 ph unit 0 01 mg l 1 and 1 μs cm 1 respectively water chlorophyll a chl a was also measured in situ using ap lite probe coupled

cellulose acetate membranes filtered samples were immediately titrated for total alkalinity ta in the field after collection using hcl titration with a titrette digital titrator brand trading co ltd wertheim germany the titrant was 0 1 mmol l 1 hcl and the titration endpoint was ph 4 5 samples for cations were stored in acid washed hdpe bottles and were acidified with trace metal grade nitric acid 7m hno3 to a ph of 2 0 while no preservative was added to samples collected for major anions samples for δ13cdic were collected in 25 ml acid washed dry hdpe bottles and three drops of saturated hgcl2 were added to prevent microbial activity all samples were stored on ice until delivered to the laboratory where they were stored chilled in a refrigerator at 4 c until analysis major anions cl so4 2 were measured using an automated dionex ics 900 ion chromatography based on the apha s method rice et al 2012 major cations ca2 mg2 k and na were analyzed by icp oes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo fisher scientific usa using a procedure based on epa method 200 7 estimated analytical errors were within 5 δ13cdic values were analyzed using a mat 253 mass spectrometer coupled with a gas bench ii automated device with analytical precision of 0 15 the results are expressed as δ13cdic with respect to the vienna pee dee belemnite v pdb standard all lab analyses were carried out at the environmental and geochemical analysis laboratory of the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences inorganic carbon species including hco3 dissolved co2 and co3 2 was obtained using the co2sys program based on the measured alkalinity ph and water temperature lewis and wallace 2006 the water dic concentration was obtained using the formula dic h2co3 hco3 2 co3 2 the hydrochemical data including ph tested water temperature and cation and anion concentrations were processed with the program phreeqc 3 0 parkhurst and appelo 2013 to calculate partial pressure of co2 pco2 in surface waters and saturation index of calcite sic pco2 is assumed to be in equilibrium with the sampled waters by the equation pco2 hco3 h k1 kh where species in square brackets are activities of corresponding species in mol l 1 and k1 and kh are the temperature dependent first dissociation constants for h2co3 in water and henry s law respectively sic were calculated using equation sic log iap kcal where iap is the ion activity product and kcal is the temperature dependent equilibrium constant of calcite dissolution 2 3 hydrological and meteorological parameters of reservoir hydrological data for the dld reservoir including water level reservoir capacity water depth and water inflow and release amount were obtained from dalongdong reservoir authority rainfall air temperature wind speed and barometric pressure were measured using an on site vantage pro 2 weather station davis instruments corp u s a fig 1c from july 2016 through december 2018 resolutions of rainfall air temperature and wind speed are 0 2 mm 0 1 c and 5 respectively 2 4 calculation of co2 fluxes two methods based on unesco s guide unesco iha ghg 2010 one a floating chambers method fc and the other a thin boundary layer method tbl fig s1 were used to evaluate co2 flux across the water air interface at one or two months intervals over the study period the floating chamber method directly measures diffusive fluxes at the surface of aquatic ecosystems by connecting with tygon tubing a floating chamber of known volume and surface area to an automated non dispersive infrared detector ndir egm 5 pp systems usa duchemin et al 1999 matthews et al 2003 zhao et al 2015 the headspace atmosphere was passed through a desiccant to prevent water condensation in the tubing and then to the detector using its internal pump the initial increase in pco2 in the chamber was plotted against time and the slope of the increase found by linear regression analysis was used to estimate the flux of co2 across the air water interface by unesco iha ghg 2010 co2 flux s f1 f2 v a with f1 f3 f4 atmp r 273 13 t where co2 flux is co2 flux mg m 2 h 1 s is the slope in the time concentration plot

and t is the measured air temperature c as a comparison with the fc method fig s1 the standard tbl method was used to calculate diffusive co2 fluxes across the air water interface according to co2 flux kg cw cair where kg is the gas exchange coefficient for the given gas cm h 1 cw cair is the co2 concentration difference between the water and air unesco iha ghg 2010 the atmospheric co2 concentration was measured by egm 5 in situ the gas exchange coefficient kg was parameterized as a function of wind speed and normalized using a temperature dependent schmidt number sc based on the following equation kg k600 sc 600 n the k600 cm h is the gas transfer velocity adjusted to sc 600 for co2 at 20 c and is computed according to the following equation for lakes or reservoirs k600 0 226 u 10 2 2 0 168 where u10 is the wind speed at 10 m above waters crusius and wanninkhof 2003 u10 is calculated using in situ measured wind speed by the equation u10 uz 1 cd 1 2 k ln 10 z where cd is

is computed from the surface water temperature t c sc 1911 1 118 11t 3 4527t2 0 04132t3 the superscript n is a wind speed dependent parameter for wind speed at 10 m 3 7 m s n 2 3 and 3 7 m s n 1 2 crusius and wanninkhof 2003 the co2 fluxes derived from the fc and tbl methods have positive correlations r2 0 985 p 0 001 at all sampling times fig s1 reflecting good coherence between the two methods however the average co2 flux derived from the tbl method was greater than the fc method by a factor of 1 3 over the research period the differences between the fc and tbl method is possibly caused by wind speed parameter in the tbl semi empirical equations because the distance between weather station and sampling site therefore in this paper we use co2 emission fluxes estimated from fc method for further analysis because this method provide real time measurement co2 fluxes unesco iha ghg 2010 2 5 thermal structure of dld reservoir analysis the intensity of thermal stratification in the dld reservoir was assessed by using two well known indicators the schmidt stability sst and the relative thermal resistance to mixing rtrm idso 1973 wetze and likens 2000 fig s1 the sst represents the quantity of work per unit area necessary for the lake or reservoir to present a uniform density without adding or subtracting heat schmidt 1928 idso 1973 wetze and likens 2000 sst was calculated using an online r code package rlakeanalyzer for the study periods https rdrr io cran rlakeanalyzer input data included reservoir surface area water level reservoir depth and tested water temperature with water depth and the output is the schmidt stability variable j m2 the rtrm is expressed as the ratio of the density differences between water at the top and bottom of each water column birge 1916 wetze and likens 2000 according to some literatures the rtrm threshold value of 50 was characteristic of thermal stratification wetze and likens 2000 wetzel 2001 chimney et al 2006 the rtrm non dimensional indicator was calculated by rtrm ρd2 ρd1 ρ4 ρ5 where ρd1 and ρd2 are water densities at a depth of d1 upper layer and d2 lower layer respectively kg m3 ρ4 and ρ5 are water densities at 4 and 5 c respectively kg m3 larger sst and rtrm values signify a more stable water body and stronger thermal stratification the rtrm and sst showed a significant positive relationship r2 0 897 p 0 001 fig s1 reflecting consistency between two indicators 2 6 data analyses correlation analyses and regression analyses were conducted for relationships between co2 flux and other referenced parameters dic do ph δ13cdic pco2 etc and to identify the factors influencing co2 flux anova was used to evaluate differences between some parameters with significant set at p 0 05 the statistical processes were conducted using spss 17 0 spss inc chicago il and originpro 2017 origin lab corporation usa 3 results 3 1 environmental and reservoir parameters characteristics of environmental and reservoir parameters for the dld reservoir are presented in table 1 during the study period wind speed and air temperature varied between 0 06 and 3 75 m s coefficient of variation cv 91 19 and 5 9 36 0 c cv 30 61 respectively the total rainfall was 2145 mm in 2017 and 1456 mm in 2018 with most occurring during the rainy season from may to september when 1550 mm and 1049 mm rain fell in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 2 a the rainfall in 2017 was greater than normal because the west pacific subtropical high was to the south and long lasting in south china as compared with the normal national climate committee of china 2017 the dld water level varied from 172 02 to 183 76 m a s l with a mean of 177 11 m a s l and a cv of 1 84 accordingly the dld water depth ranged from 10 5 to 22 4 m with a mean of 15 5 m in the sampling site during the study period generally the water level rapidly increased after continuous rainfall besides the mean value of water inflow amount vs reservoir capacity and water release amount vs reservoir capacity was just 1 17 and 1 53 respectively during the study period 3 2 thermal structures in dld reservoir the water temperature profile and its variation through time reveals patterns of thermal stratification and mixing fig 3 and fig s2 seasonally the reservoir was stratified from early april to late october late spring summer and early autumn and mixed at other times autumn winter and most of spring fig 3 the maximum temperature difference when stratified was about 10 6 c between 0 1 and 20 m depth july 2017 variations in stratification through time are shown by the sst and rtrm indicators which varied from 0 to 198 54 j m2 mean 75 02 j m2 and from 0 to 303 51 mean 118 03 respectively fig 2g the higher sst and rtrm values almost always lasted from april to october and lower values reaching minima of 0 occurred during mixing periods for both indicators the minima occurred in december reflecting full mixing 3 3 physicochemical properties carbon isotopes and co2 fluxes variations of the measured water physicochemical properties vary systematically with stratification and mixing fig 2 specifically in the grab samples collected at a depth of 0 1 m water temperature do concentrations and δ13cdic values were elevated during periods when the dld reservoir was stratified and exhibited low values when mixed in contrast spc dic concentrations and co2 evasive fluxes were greatest during times of mixing and lowest during stratified periods importantly the co2 flux switched from negative to positive from stratified to mixed times in 2017 indicating flux to the atmosphere when the dld reservoir is mixed and from the atmosphere to the reservoir when stratified comparing with the negative co2 fluxes in the 2017 stratified period co2 fluxes showed interestingly minor positive value in the 2018 stratified period 3 4 phytoplankton biomass commonly the chl a content is a better indicator for the biomass of subaquatic phototrophs kalchev et al 1996 kasprzak et al 2008 adamczyk and shurin 2015 the seasonal patterns of the chl a were consistent with the water temperature do concentrations and δ13cdic values fig 2f the mean of chl a contents in the thermal stratification period is 14 98 μg l and 9 76 μg l in 2017 and 2018 respectively implying that the biomass of subaquatic phototroph mainly planktonic algae was larger during the stratified period in 2017 than in 2018 table 1 4 discussion many studies have shown that reservoir thermal stratification could cause a series of environmental effects especially for the internal carbon dynamics in water lópez et al 2011 morales pineda et al 2014 lu et al 2018 winton et al 2019 we found that co2 fluxes are impacted by thermal stratification and its breakdown and discuss below potential causes and implications of these impacts 4 1 water level variations does not influence on co2 emission because water in the dld reservoir is fed from two karst subterranean streams at the bottom in the reservoir tail it will start to increase the water capacity from the reservoir bottom and elevate the water level in the rainy season in the other hand the water was released for power generation by a buried headrace tunnel near the reservoir bottom the mean value of water inflow amount vs reservoir capacity and water release amount vs reservoir capacity were very low during the study period therefore the above reservoir characteristics possibly exerted less interference on water surface previous work has suggested that water level variations may alter co2 emission from lakes and reservoirs tonetta et al 2017 however the lack of correlations between water level and co2 emissions pco2 and δ13cdic in the dld reservoir fig s3m n and o indicate that variables other than water level are more important controls for co2 evasion 4 2 thermal stratification restrains on co2 emission commonly the magnitude and direction of co2 fluxes depend on the co2 concentration gradients between water and air barros et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 both air co2 and water pco2 showed seasonal variations in concentrations the variations were out of phase smaller variations in the air than water fig 2 the smaller amplitude of variations for co2 concentration in air than water is shown by their coefficient of variations for air cv 4 26 while for the water cv 121 52 with a range from 46 77 to 5754 4 ppmv fig 2 these differences indicate that the seasonal variations in co2 fluxes fig 2b f and g were dominated by water co2 concentration morales pineda et al 2014 li et al 2016 liu et al 2016 as reflected in a positive correlation between water pco2 and co2 flux r2 0 395 p 0 001 fig s3a a significant negative relationship occurs between reservoir stratification and co2 flux r2 0 454 for rtrm and r2 0 316 for sst p 0 001 dic r2 0 845 for rtrm and r2 0 734 for sst p 0 001 and pco2 r2 0 657 for rtrm and r2 0 541 for sst p 0 001 fig 4 a b and c these relationships indicate that seasonal variations in the thermal structure of the water column are critical to co2 emissions pco2 and dic concentrations the stratification depends on surface water temperature in the epilimnion of the dld reservoir which increases gradually following increased solar radiation during the summer although water temperature also varied in the thermocline and hypolimnion the variations were smaller than in the surface water reflecting difference in water density boehrer and schultze 2008 ivey et al 2008 figs 3 and s2 thermal stratification thus acts as a barrier to co2 emissions and similarly prevents the upward mixing of nutrients in the deep portion of the water column elçi 2008 however the increased summer solar radiation allows phytoplankton photosynthesis assimilate of inorganic carbon thereby decreasing water pco2 and dic content and increasing do concentration within the surface layer water fig 2 mcconnaughey 1998 pu et al 2017 these simultaneous biochemical processes result in a significant positive relationship of pco2 and dic r2 0 852 p 0 001 fig s3e and significant negative relationship of do and pco2 r2 0 787 p 0 001 fig s3h in addition the exchange direction of co2 fluxes showed different modes with negative values in the 2017 stratified periods and minor positive values in the 2018 stratified periods which is mainly caused by the biomass differences of subaquatic phototrophs in the dld reservoir surface layer water the higher biomass of subaquatic phototroph reduced dic contents and pco2 values through stronger phytoplankton photosynthesis in the 2017 thermal stratification period which resulted in negative co2 flux comparing with the 2017 stratified period the chl a contents are lower and pco2 values are higher in the 2018 stratified period which showed minor co2 emission and didn t appear atmospheric co2 sink fractionation of carbon isotopes during co2 emission can cause water δ13cdic values to increase bade et al 2004 myrbo and shapley 2006 doctor et al 2008 herath et al 2020 however a significant negative relationship between δ13cdic and co2 fluxes r2 0 761 p 0 001 fig s3b indicates emission derived fractionation does not control seasonal δ13cdic variations the significant positive correlation of water δ13cdic vs do r2 0 559 p 0 001 fig s3i and rtrm or sst vs δ13cdic r2 0 708 for rtrm and r2 0 632 for sst p 0 001 fig 4d suggests that c fractionation from primary productivity in the epilimnion increases δ13cdic values during stratified period this isotopic evidence supports our inference that primary productivity is an important control of c cycling including co2 emissions from the dld reservoir assimilation of co2 through primary production during stratified periods leads to decreasing water pco2 values in the surface layer water occasionally to values below atmospheric pco2 values the low pco2 values cause low and occasionally negative co2 fluxes from the water column which vary from 65 13 to 22 61 mg m 2 h 1 with a mean of 8 21 mg m 2 h 1 figs 2 and 3 these results indicate that stratification limits co2 emission to the atmosphere from the dld reservoir and that the limitation is primarily controlled by photosynthesis elçi 2008 park and chung 2018 jin et al 2019 su et al 2019 4 3 mixing processes stimulates co2 emission the breakdown of the thermocline during winter elevates co2 emissions figs 3 and s2 as bottom water with high dic contents and pco2 values move to the surface this process is reflected in the significant negative relationship of rtrm or sst with dic and pco2 and significant positive relationships of dic with co2 flux and co2 flux with pco2 baehr and degrandpre 2004 bellido et al 2009 park and chung 2018 pu et al 2018 fig 4b and c the delivery of high pco2 water to the surface results in the greatest observed co2 emission from the dld reservoir figs 2 and 3 bottom water commonly has low δ13cdic value due to organic matter degradation and anoxic environment similarly during periods of mixing in the dld reservoir δ13cdic values in the surface water were lower than during periods of stratification reflecting upward mixing of isotopically light dic from the deep reservoir bottom water these light values occur regardless of the loss of co2 from atmospheric evasion which increases to 247 76 mg m 2 h 1 in november 2017 292 01 mg m 2 h 1 in january 2018 1338 13 mg m 2 h 1 in november 2018 and 113 91 mg m 2 h 1 in december 2018 because isotopic fraction is only 1 during emission of dissolved co2 the limited fractionation during emission is shown by a significant positive relationship of rtrm or sst with δ13cdic when the reservoir is mixed further reflecting the stimulation of co2 emission during mixing 4 4 magnitude of co2 emission in the dld reservoir the effects from stratification to the magnitude of co2 evasion indicates that seasonal evasion must be considered when evaluating the total annual co2 fluxes we make those calculations here the surface area of the dld reservoir was estimated using the polygon applications in google earth pro and found to average 8 79 km2 across multiple years combining this areas with each of the seasonal measurements of average co2 fluxes fig 3 we estimate the co2 emissions were 0 37 0 44 gg co2 1 gg 109g when the reservoir was stratified and 6 24 3 73 gg co2 when the reservoir was mixed over the study period the total co2 emissions were estimated at 6 93 4 57 gg co2 over the study period although the dld reservoir was a net atmospheric source of co2 source accurate assessments of the magnitude of the source depends on evaluating seasonal variations including times when the reservoir represents a sink for atmospheric co2 generally the measured co2 fluxes in the dld reservoir were within the intermediate published range table 2 the estimated total mean of co2 fluxes 49 1 mmol m 2 d 1 from the dld reservoir was much higher than the values of global reservoirs 7 5 mmol m 2 d 1 deemer et al 2016 and china s reservoirs 12 10 mmol m 2 d 1 and lakes 10 17 mmol m 2 d 1 li et al 2018a as well as reservoirs in yunnan guizhou region 4 47 mmol m 2 d 1 where is the main karst regions in south china li et al 2018a our total mean of co2 flux was significantly higher than most of the values reported for some subtropical reservoirs e g hongfeng baihua hongyan and dongfeng tropic reservoirs e g nam ngum nam leuk and palasari temperate reservoirs e g danjiangkou semi arid reservoirs e g murray miramar poway and mediterranean reservoirs e g sau and guadalcacin yet compare to the xiuwen reservoir 47 mmol m 2 d 1 and the bornos reservoir 50 mmol m 2 d 1 table 2 however the co2 flux values in other reservoirs including the three gorges subtropical daecheong temperate eastmain 1 boreal la grande 2 boreal balbina tropical samuel tropical and petit saut tropical were significant higher 1 5 20 fold than that in the dld reservoir table 2 our negative co2 fluxes during the stratified period were lower than some tropical reservoirs e g the nam ngum reservoir and the nam leuk reservoir temperate reservoirs e g reservoirs in inner mongolia xinjiang plateau region and semi arid reservoir e g poway reservoir yet compare to the sau reservoir in the mediterranean region 5 0 mmol m 2 d 1 and exceeding the murray reservoir 1 755 mmol m 2 d 1 and miramar reservoir 0 875 mmol m 2 d 1 the ranges of co2 flux in some subtropical reservoirs also covered the negative domain i e the hongfeng the baihua the xiuwen and the hongyan reservoir table 2 which very likely occurred in the thermal stratification period according to reported co2 flux curve in their paper noteworthy most of the reservoirs covering the negative co2 flux range were karst freshwater reservoirs table 2 indicating that karst reservoirs could play a more important role in regulating carbon cycle in inland waters co2 fluxes from reservoirs have been gaining increased attention recently however large uncertainty still exists in regional and global co2 flux estimates due to incomplete temporal and spatial coverage of the flux data and unclear control mechanism of co2 production st louis et al 2000 barros et al 2011 deemer et al 2016 therefore our study is significant because it reveals obviously temporal dynamics and key control mechanisms of co2 fluxes and improves understanding of critical environmental problems of co2 fluxes from reservoirs 4 5 optimizing sampling strategy up to now even though many new modern techniques online monitoring equipment flux tower remote sensing etc have been used to study the co2 exchange across the water air interface of rivers lakes and reservoirs accurate estimates of co2 emissions is difficult due to high temporal heterogeneities this study provides a new point of view regarding the complexity of the temporal variations of co2 emission in lakes or reservoirs in fact variations of thermal structure of lakes or reservoirs are common natural phenomenon due to seasonal solar and air temperature changes in the world boehrer and schultze 2008 most reservoirs and lakes start to stratify in late spring with mixing occurring in late autumn due to solar radiation variations boehrer and schultze 2008 the obvious temporal heterogeneity of the co2 emission implies that sampling should be conducted over as many days as possible and should at least include the thermal stratification and mixing periods if sampling was conducted during the thermal stratified period a fairly low or even negative co2 emission flux would be obtained whereas if sampling was conducted only during the mixing period the co2 emissions would be overestimated based on our results sampling should include at a minimum the incipient stage medium stage and late stage of thermal stratification and mixing period in a lake or reservoir in addition spatial heterogeneities of co2 emission in a lake or reservoirs also occur roland et al 2010 raymond et al 2013 paranaíba et al 2018 therefore reasonable sampling dates coupled with higher spatial sampling densities will decrease uncertainty of co2 emission estimates reducing uncertainty is critical to estimates of this important atmospheric source of co2 and will improve assessments of carbon budgets of lakes and reservoirs 4 6 practical implications williamson et al 2009 pointed out that lakes and reservoirs as sentinels integrators and regulators of climate change commonly thermal and mixing variations in lakes or reservoirs are forced by energy exchanges with the atmosphere many studies have revealed that lake or reservoir water temperature is closely related to regional scale air temperature lee et al 2011 tundisi and tundisi 2011 magee and wu 2017 woolway and merchant 2019 especially epilimnetic water temperature exhibits a rapid and direct response to air temperature also the variations of physical chemical and biological traits of lakes or reservoirs are closely related to water temperature variations williamson et al 2009 tundisi and tundisi 2011 winton et al 2019 global warming has raised the global mean surface temperature by 0 85 c from the pre industrial level hartmann et al 2013 previous studies have pointed out that warming air temperatures over the past decades increased epilimnetic water temperatures coats et al 2006 dobiesz and lester 2009 o reilly et al 2015 ficker et al 2017 air temperature conditions drive the density gradient in the water column of lakes or reservoirs inducing changes in the intensity and duration of thermal stratification and stability mccormick mj 1999 livingstone 2003 coats et al 2006 lee et al 2011 therefore some studies explicitly pointed out that warming of air temperatures and surface waters has considerably increased the strength of thermal stratification and prolonged stratified period which leads to reduced mixing based on long term monitoring data or mathematic model williamson et al 2009 rempfer et al 2010 wang et al 2012 kerimoglu and rinke 2013 zhang et al 2014 2015 considering air temperature is the primary control on reservoir stratification the role of stratification in controlling co2 emissions suggests that global warming may provide a negative feedback for this source of atmospheric co2 alter lewis et al 2019 woolway and merchant 2019 as global temperatures rise periods of stratification will increase and mixing will decrease kerimoglu and rinke 2013 zhang et al 2014 winton et al 2019 woolway and merchant 2019 for example in lake superior the summer stratified season increased from roughly 145 days 170 days over the last century an increase of about 17 austin and colman 2008 in lake nam co the summer stratification duration increased at a rate of 6 00 3 54 days per decade from 1979 to 2012 huang et al 2017 in dillion reservoir in the southern rocky mountains the mean sst increased from 580 to 880 j m2 over the past 35 years 1981 2016 reflecting increased stratification lewis et al 2019 considering our findings at the dld reservoir the possibility of co2 emissions decrease could well be risen with intensification and lengthening of their stratification depending on light availability and dissolved nutrients the decrease in co2 emission could be reduced even further through co2 assimilation by aquatic phototrophs fixing or assimilating inorganic carbon in karst systems may be an important atmospheric co2 sink martin 2017 pu et al 2017 where carbonate mineral weathering coupled with the aquatic photosynthetic uptake of dic could provide a carbon sink in karst systems organisms and sediments liu et al 2018 karst groundwater is often rich in dic because of carbonate dissolution by carbonic acid generated during the hydration of co2 assimilation of the dic by aquatic phototrophs may thus represent an important carbon sequestration approach in constructed karst freshwater reservoirs lengthened thermal stratification will also temporarily block carbon enriched water upwelling and will contribute to dic assimilation by aquatic photosynthesis and occasionally absorb atmospheric co2 in the epilimnion therefore it could fix more inorganic carbon in the forms of organic matter in the thermal stratification lópez et al 2011 park and chung 2018 thus carbon from karst systems could be sequestered pu et al 2017 liu et al 2018 although mixing will release co2 into atmosphere the magnitude of the c cycle will depend on rates of organic carbon remineralization and mixing times both processes must be quantified for accurate assessments of carbon budgets in a reservoir and lake catchments and their links to atmospheric co2 the dynamics of co2 exchange with the atmosphere across the water air interface in reservoirs and lakes in the future requires high frequency real time monitoring data these data could improve estimates of carbon budgets and help constrained measures of carbon emission from reservoir and lakes this study focuses only on a medium sized subtropical reservoir fed by karst groundwater and a two years span additional similar studies in different climatic zones land use types nutrient loading and hydraulic regimes could improve the understanding of the extent and causes of carbon cycle in reservoirs or lakes and provide management relevant information that could help to balance regional carbon budget 5 conclusion this study demonstrates that co2 emissions from a reservoir in southeastern china is controlled by variations of thermal structure based on two years monitoring data due to stronger aquatic photosynthesis co2 emission are limited and at times the reservoir acts as an atmospheric co2 sink when it is thermally stratified in contrast co2 emission are greater during times when the reservoir mixes due to reservoir overturn the total co2 emissions were estimated at 6 93 4 57 gg co2 over the study period from the dld reservoir the high temporal heterogeneity in co2 emission flux indicates that significant uncertainty could exist in estimates of global lake or reservoir co2 emissions that disregard seasonal variations in thermal structure this study also provides a sampling and monitoring framework to minimize uncertainty in the estimates of co2 exchange between lakes or reservoirs and

17904,thermal stratification and mixing are important to the physicochemical composition of reservoirs and lakes and impact their water quality and biogeochemical cycles however it remains unclear how thermal stratification and mixing process control the exchange of co2 between surface water and the earth s atmosphere to address this issue we examine the temporal characteristics of some physicochemical parameters partial pressure of co2 pco2 the δ13cdic and co2 emission from a typical karst groundwater fed reservoir dalongdong reservoir during the 23 month study 2016 2018 thermal stratification limited co2 emission in part from photosynthetic uptake of co2 from early april to late october while mixing processes stimulated co2 emission of co2 generated from organic matter remineralization in bottom water from october to april the dalongdong reservoir is an atmospheric source of co2 for most of the study period however during periods of stratification approximately 0 37 0 44 gg co2 1 gg 109g dissolved into the water from the atmosphere while approximately 6 24 3 73 gg co2 was lost to the atmosphere during periods lacking stratification limited emissions during stratified period may thus represent a negative feedback to co2 contributions to global warming which has increased lengths of stratified periods these study results are important to optimize sampling monitoring strategies to reduce errors of regional co2 emission estimation graphical abstract image 1 keywords co2 emission thermal stratification mixing period groundwater fed reservoir china 1 introduction exchange of co2 between the atmosphere and inland water bodies rivers lakes ponds and reservoirs represents an important flux of the terrestrial carbon c in the global carbon cycle cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 barros et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 although exchange is both into and out of inland water bodies the net flux of approximately 2 1 pg c yr represents an atmospheric source ciais et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 areal distribution of surface water has increased through damming of streams for hydroelectric power water surface area of man made dams and reservoirs currently cover more than 300 000 km2 on the earth lehner et al 2011 hertwich 2013 deemer et al 2016 the shift from flowing to static hydrologic systems has changed the carbon cycle through enhancing co2 evasion which first pointed out in the pioneering work by rudd et al 1993 and duchemin et al 1995 although numerous studies over past twenty five years have shown super saturation of co2 with respect to atmosphere in the surface water of reservoirs the total mass evading to the atmosphere is poorly constrained rudd et al 1993 st louis et al 2000 barros et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 deemer et al 2016 st louis et al 2000 first published an estimate of up to 272 7 tg c yr 1 of total co2 emission from reservoirs or 4 of the anthropogenic co2 source based on a limited data barros et al 2011 estimated of 48 tg c yr 1 evasion to the atmosphere corresponding to 17 6 of st louis et al s value while deemer et al 2016 reported even smaller emission amounts of 36 8 tg c yr 1 these divergent estimates of evasion reflect the complexity of making these estimates because of limited data and spatial and temporal heterogeneity of emission raymond et al 2013 paranaíba et al 2018 rather than integrating spot emission measurements around the globe however global estimates could also be evaluated through studies of processes regulating co2 emissions to inform global predictive models of present and future role of reservoirs in the global c cycle battin et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 hotchkiss et al 2015 deemer et al 2016 paranaíba et al 2018 we study one of those processes here the development and breakdown of thermal stratification co2 emission from reservoirs is a dynamic process that can be controlled by many factors including reservoir age wind speed temperature ecosystem metabolism solar radiation and nutrient and organic carbon delivery to the reservoir all of which affect the co2 concentration gradient between the water and atmospheres tranvik et al 2009 maberly et al 2012 adamczyk and shurin 2015 marcé et al 2015 deemer et al 2016 paranaíba et al 2018 sources of dissolved co2 include mineralization of organic carbon and dissolution of carbonate mineral phases dissolved co2 can be lost to the atmosphere by diffusive flux across the air water interface st louis et al 2000 tranvik et al 2009 barros et al 2011 hertwich 2013 deemer et al 2016 future changes to climate and rainfall temperature and wind patterns are likely to alter co2 exchange between the atmosphere and surface water particularly with enhanced floods or droughts hertwich 2013 deemer et al 2016 jin et al 2016 li et al 2016 liu et al 2016 tonetta et al 2017 although some of the dynamic factors controlling co2 emissions from reservoirs have been documented over the past few decades research about how thermal stratification breakdown of stratification and mixing affect co2 emissions especially through seasons in different climate zone is no enough the lack of understanding of seasonal variations caused by stratification and mixing is likely to lead to inaccuracies in global estimates of co2 emissions from reservoirs and lakes thermal stratification and mixing of reservoirs or lakes are likely important to co2 emissions because of their impacts on nutrient cycling phytoplankton dynamics and redox status conditions baehr and degrandpre 2004 komatsu et al 2006 schmid et al 2006 boehrer and schultze 2008 bellido et al 2009 lópez et al 2011 morales pineda et al 2014 adamczyk and shurin 2015 stratification and mixing result from water temperature and density variations in natural lakes which are influenced by seasonal meteorological conditions boehrer and schultze 2008 elçi 2008 ivey et al 2008 wang et al 2012 kerimoglu and rinke 2013 kelly et al 2001 found water pco2 declines in summer as stratification reduces the ratio of epilimnetic area to the epilimnetic volume in 11 boreal lakes åberg et al 2010 also showed thermal stratification maintained low surface water pco2 in summer when the epilimnion was deep and warm in merasjärvi lake in boreal sweden although timing and controls of thermal stratification are well known less is know how the changes in thermal structure affect co2 emissions or linked its biogeochemical processes in subtropical inland waters karst covers around 15 of the earth s continental surfaces ford and williams 2007 chen et al 2017 numerous reservoirs were built in karst areas for water supply and flood control due to water shortage and flood hazards milanović 2011 thousands of karst reservoirs were built in south china indo china peninsula balkan peninsula dinaric region anatolian peninsula apennine peninsula iberian peninsula east usa etc milanović 2011 therefore karst freshwater reservoir is one of the important reservoir types around the world carbonate contents are often higher in karst freshwater reservoirs than in non karst reservoirs due to the dissolution of carbonate rocks which may cause higher co2 fluxes however although there are some studies on co2 fluxes in karst reservoirs large uncertainty still exists in estimated co2 fluxes and it is still unclear whether they sequester or release co2 in this paper we evaluate how thermal stratification and mixing processes control changes of co2 emissions from a subtropical reservoir in southeastern china based on 23 months of monitored water temperature physicochemical parameters δ13cdic and co2 concentrations and directly measured fluxes in a karst groundwater fed reservoir results of this study emphasize the need to understand how thermal stratification affects seasonal variations in co2 fluxes to the atmosphere to minimize the uncertainty of global estimates of co2 fluxes from lakes or reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the dalongdong reservoir dld is typical of ten karst groundwater fed reservoirs in south china s karst region fig 1 a the dld reservoir was built in 1950s and has a surface area of about 8 79 106 m2 and total storage capacity of 1 51 108 m3 within a 310 km2 catchment it is recharged by two karst subterranean streams the xialong subterranean stream and the dalongdong subterranean stream fig 1c which source about 99 of the reservoir water based on a mass balance of inputs and outputs huang et al 2018 both outlets of two subterranean streams were located in the bottom at the reservoir tail the dam was built at the end of natural karst valley surrounded by typical karst peak cluster as a source of hydroelectric power fig 1b and c the dld reservoir release water through a buried headrace tunnel near the reservoir bottom for power generation the average water depth of the dld reservoir is about 11 m the climate in the dld reservoir area is subtropical humid monsoonal with mean annual air temperature of 21 7 c and mean annual precipitation of 1294 mm with most occurring from april to september around the reservoir the main human activities are agriculture and tourism with limited industry in general the dld reservoir is a better experiment site to study the variations of co2 fluxes from karst reservoir without disturbances of surface river or stream flow 2 2 water samples collection and analysis a representative sampling site 23 35 27 4 n 108 35 18 2 e was chosen in the downstream part of the dld reservoir fig 1c where average water depth over the study period was 15 5 m the sampling site was about 70 m from the bank of the reservoir which is formed of steep limestone mountain slopes the sampling site is located in the downstream open water area where have relatively small influence from surrounding mountain and have relative homogeneous and wide water surface water temperature was continuously monitored in situ from july 2016 to december 2018 using a temperature logger with a resolution of 0 1 c hobo pendant ua 002 64 onset company u s a at depths of 0 5 m 5 0 m 10 0 m and 15 0 m at 15 min interval below the water surface for obtaining high resolution information of water temperature variation in order to obtain the vertical water temperature characteristics and calculate the indicator of thermal stratification intensity additional higher spatial resolution of vertical water temperature measurements were made by collecting water samples at one or two months sampling intervals from the surface layer to bottom at 2 5m intervals using a depth setting sampler hydro bios ruttner from december 2016 to december 2018 and immediately measuring the temperature in situ with a ysi multi parameters meters ysi prodss yellow spring u s a the probes were calibrated according to the manufacturer s specifications prior to deployment for obtaining hydrochemical characteristics of the surface layer water in the dld reservoir water temperature ph do and specific conductivity spc were measured in situ 0 1 m below the surface using ysi multi parameters meters in the morning about 10 11 am at each sampling time resolutions for temperature ph do and spc were 0 1 c 0 01 ph unit 0 01 mg l 1 and 1 μs cm 1 respectively water chlorophyll a chl a was also measured in situ using ap lite probe coupled

cellulose acetate membranes filtered samples were immediately titrated for total alkalinity ta in the field after collection using hcl titration with a titrette digital titrator brand trading co ltd wertheim germany the titrant was 0 1 mmol l 1 hcl and the titration endpoint was ph 4 5 samples for cations were stored in acid washed hdpe bottles and were acidified with trace metal grade nitric acid 7m hno3 to a ph of 2 0 while no preservative was added to samples collected for major anions samples for δ13cdic were collected in 25 ml acid washed dry hdpe bottles and three drops of saturated hgcl2 were added to prevent microbial activity all samples were stored on ice until delivered to the laboratory where they were stored chilled in a refrigerator at 4 c until analysis major anions cl so4 2 were measured using an automated dionex ics 900 ion chromatography based on the apha s method rice et al 2012 major cations ca2 mg2 k and na were analyzed by icp oes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo

automated device with analytical precision of 0 15 the results are expressed as δ13cdic with respect to the vienna pee dee belemnite v pdb standard all lab analyses were carried out at the environmental and geochemical analysis laboratory of the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences inorganic carbon species including hco3 dissolved co2 and co3 2 was obtained using the co2sys program based on the measured alkalinity ph and water temperature lewis and wallace 2006 the water dic concentration was obtained using the formula dic h2co3 hco3 2 co3 2 the hydrochemical data including ph tested water temperature and cation and anion concentrations were processed with the program phreeqc 3 0 parkhurst and appelo 2013 to calculate partial pressure of co2 pco2 in surface waters and saturation index of calcite sic pco2 is assumed to be in equilibrium with the sampled waters by the equation pco2 hco3 h k1 kh where species in square brackets are activities of corresponding species in mol l 1 and k1 and kh are the temperature dependent first dissociation constants for h2co3 in water and henry s law respectively sic were calculated using equation sic log iap kcal where iap is the ion activity product and kcal is the temperature dependent equilibrium constant of calcite dissolution 2 3 hydrological and meteorological parameters of reservoir hydrological data for the dld reservoir including water level reservoir capacity water depth and water inflow and release amount were obtained from dalongdong reservoir authority rainfall air temperature wind speed and barometric pressure were measured using an on site vantage pro 2 weather station davis instruments corp u s a fig 1c from july 2016 through december 2018 resolutions of rainfall air temperature and wind speed are 0 2 mm 0 1 c and 5 respectively 2 4 calculation of co2 fluxes two methods based on unesco s guide unesco iha ghg 2010 one a floating chambers method fc and the other a thin boundary layer method tbl fig s1 were used to evaluate co2 flux across the water air interface at one or two months intervals over the study period the floating chamber method directly measures diffusive fluxes at the surface of aquatic ecosystems by connecting with tygon tubing a floating chamber of known volume and surface area to an automated non dispersive infrared detector ndir egm 5 pp systems usa duchemin et al 1999 matthews et al 2003 zhao et al 2015 the headspace atmosphere was passed through a desiccant to prevent water condensation in the tubing and then to the detector using its internal pump the initial increase in pco2 in the chamber was plotted against time and the slope of the increase found by linear regression analysis was used to estimate the flux of co2 across the air water interface by unesco iha ghg 2010 co2 flux s f1 f2 v a with f1 f3 f4 atmp r 273 13 t where co2 flux is co2 flux mg m 2 h 1 s is the slope in the time concentration plot

and t is the measured air temperature c as a comparison with the fc method fig s1 the standard tbl method was used to calculate diffusive co2 fluxes across the air water interface according to co2 flux kg cw cair where kg is the gas exchange coefficient for the given gas cm h 1 cw cair is the co2 concentration difference between the water and air unesco iha ghg 2010 the atmospheric co2 concentration was measured by egm 5 in situ the gas exchange coefficient kg was parameterized as a function of wind speed and normalized using a temperature dependent schmidt number sc based on the following equation kg k600 sc 600 n the k600 cm h is the gas transfer velocity adjusted to sc 600 for co2 at 20 c and is computed according to the following equation for lakes or reservoirs k600 0 226 u 10 2 2 0 168 where u10 is the wind speed at 10 m above waters crusius and wanninkhof 2003 u10 is calculated using in situ measured wind speed by the equation u10 uz 1 cd 1 2 k ln 10 z where cd is the drag coefficient at 10 m height 0 0013 m s k is the von karman constant 0 41 and z is the measured wind speed height crusius and wanninkhof 2003 sc is the temperature dependent schmidt number and is computed from the surface water temperature t c sc 1911 1 118 11t 3 4527t2 0 04132t3 the superscript n is a wind speed dependent parameter for wind speed at 10 m 3 7 m s n 2 3 and 3 7 m s n 1 2 crusius and wanninkhof 2003 the co2 fluxes derived from the fc and tbl methods have positive correlations r2 0 985 p 0 001 at all sampling times fig s1 reflecting good coherence between the two methods however the average co2 flux derived from the tbl method was greater than the fc method by a factor of 1 3 over the research period the differences between the fc and tbl method is possibly caused by wind speed parameter in the tbl semi empirical equations because the distance between weather station and sampling site therefore in this paper we use co2 emission fluxes estimated from fc method for further analysis because this method provide real time measurement co2 fluxes unesco iha ghg 2010 2 5 thermal structure of dld reservoir analysis the intensity of thermal stratification in the dld reservoir was assessed by using two well known indicators the schmidt stability sst and the relative thermal resistance to mixing rtrm idso 1973 wetze and likens 2000 fig s1 the sst represents the quantity of work per unit area necessary for the lake or reservoir to present a uniform density without adding or subtracting heat schmidt 1928 idso 1973 wetze and likens 2000 sst was calculated using an online r code package rlakeanalyzer for the study periods https rdrr io cran rlakeanalyzer input data included reservoir surface area water level reservoir depth and tested water temperature with water depth and the output is the schmidt stability variable j m2 the rtrm is expressed as the ratio of the density differences between water at the top and bottom of each water column birge 1916 wetze and likens 2000 according to some literatures the rtrm threshold value of 50 was characteristic of thermal stratification wetze and likens 2000 wetzel 2001 chimney et al 2006 the rtrm non dimensional indicator was calculated by rtrm ρd2 ρd1 ρ4 ρ5 where ρd1 and ρd2 are water densities at a depth of d1 upper layer and d2 lower layer respectively kg m3 ρ4 and ρ5 are water densities at 4 and 5 c respectively kg m3 larger sst and rtrm values signify a more stable water body and stronger thermal stratification the rtrm and sst showed a significant positive relationship r2 0 897 p 0 001 fig s1 reflecting consistency between two indicators 2 6 data analyses correlation analyses and regression analyses were conducted for relationships between co2 flux and other referenced parameters dic do ph δ13cdic pco2 etc and to identify the factors influencing co2 flux anova was used to evaluate differences between some parameters with significant set at p 0 05 the statistical processes were conducted using spss 17 0 spss inc chicago il and originpro 2017 origin lab corporation usa 3 results 3 1 environmental and reservoir parameters characteristics of environmental and reservoir parameters for the dld reservoir are presented in table 1 during the study period wind speed and air temperature varied between 0 06 and 3 75 m s coefficient of variation cv 91 19 and 5 9 36 0 c cv 30 61 respectively the total rainfall was 2145 mm in 2017 and 1456 mm in 2018 with most occurring during the rainy season from may to september when 1550 mm and 1049 mm rain fell in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 2 a the rainfall in 2017 was greater than normal because the west pacific subtropical high was to the south and long lasting in south china as compared with the normal national climate committee of china 2017 the dld water level varied from 172 02 to 183 76 m a s l with a mean of 177 11 m a s l and a cv of 1 84 accordingly the dld water depth ranged from 10 5 to 22 4 m with a mean of 15 5 m in the sampling site during the study period generally the water level rapidly increased after continuous rainfall besides the mean value of water inflow amount vs reservoir capacity and water release amount vs reservoir capacity was just 1 17 and 1 53 respectively during the study period 3 2 thermal structures in dld reservoir the water temperature profile and its variation through time reveals patterns of thermal stratification and mixing fig 3 and fig s2 seasonally the reservoir was stratified from early april to late october late spring summer and early autumn and mixed at other times autumn winter and most of spring fig 3 the maximum temperature difference when stratified was about 10 6 c between 0 1 and 20 m depth july 2017 variations in stratification through time are shown by the sst and rtrm indicators which varied from 0 to 198 54 j m2 mean 75 02 j m2 and from 0 to 303 51 mean 118 03 respectively fig 2g the higher sst and rtrm values almost always lasted from april to october and lower values reaching minima of 0 occurred during mixing periods for both indicators the minima occurred in december reflecting full mixing 3 3 physicochemical properties carbon isotopes and co2 fluxes variations of the measured water physicochemical properties vary systematically with stratification and mixing fig 2 specifically in the grab samples collected at a depth of 0 1 m water temperature do concentrations and δ13cdic values were elevated during periods when the dld reservoir was stratified and exhibited low values when mixed in contrast spc dic concentrations and co2 evasive fluxes were greatest during times of mixing and lowest during stratified periods importantly the co2 flux switched from negative to positive from stratified to mixed times in 2017 indicating flux to the atmosphere when the dld reservoir is mixed and from the atmosphere to the reservoir when stratified comparing with the negative co2 fluxes in the 2017 stratified period co2 fluxes showed interestingly minor positive value in the 2018 stratified period 3 4 phytoplankton biomass commonly the chl a content is a better indicator for the biomass of subaquatic phototrophs kalchev et al 1996 kasprzak et al 2008 adamczyk and shurin 2015 the seasonal patterns of the chl a were consistent with the water temperature do concentrations and δ13cdic values fig 2f the mean of chl a contents in the thermal stratification period is 14 98 μg l and 9 76 μg l in 2017 and 2018 respectively implying that the biomass of subaquatic phototroph mainly planktonic algae was larger during the stratified period in 2017 than in 2018 table 1 4 discussion many studies have shown that reservoir thermal stratification could cause a series of environmental effects especially for the internal carbon dynamics in water lópez et al 2011 morales pineda et al 2014 lu et al 2018 winton et al 2019 we found that co2 fluxes are impacted by thermal stratification and its breakdown and discuss below potential causes and implications of these impacts 4 1 water level variations does not influence on co2 emission because water in the dld reservoir is fed from two karst subterranean streams at the bottom in the reservoir tail it will start to increase the water capacity from the reservoir bottom and elevate the water level in the rainy season in the other hand the water was released for power generation by a buried headrace tunnel near the reservoir bottom the mean value of water inflow amount vs reservoir capacity and water release amount vs reservoir capacity were very low during the study period therefore the above reservoir characteristics possibly exerted less interference on water surface previous work has suggested that water level variations may alter co2 emission from lakes and reservoirs tonetta et al 2017 however the lack of correlations between water level and co2 emissions pco2 and δ13cdic in the dld reservoir fig s3m n and o indicate that variables other than water level are more important controls for co2 evasion 4 2 thermal stratification restrains on co2 emission commonly the magnitude and direction of co2 fluxes depend on the co2 concentration gradients between water and air barros et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 both air co2 and water pco2 showed seasonal variations in concentrations the variations were out of phase smaller variations in the air than water fig 2 the smaller amplitude of variations for co2 concentration in air than water is shown by their coefficient of variations for air cv 4 26 while for the water cv 121 52 with a range from 46 77 to 5754 4 ppmv fig 2 these differences indicate that the seasonal variations in co2 fluxes fig 2b f and g were dominated by water co2 concentration morales pineda et al 2014 li et al 2016 liu et al 2016 as reflected in a positive correlation between water pco2 and co2 flux r2 0 395 p 0 001 fig s3a a significant negative relationship occurs between reservoir stratification and co2 flux r2 0 454 for rtrm and r2 0 316 for sst p 0 001 dic r2 0 845 for rtrm and r2 0 734 for sst p 0 001 and pco2 r2 0 657 for rtrm and r2 0 541 for sst p 0 001 fig 4 a b and c these relationships indicate that seasonal variations in the thermal structure of the water column are critical to co2 emissions pco2 and dic concentrations the stratification depends on surface water temperature in the epilimnion of the dld reservoir which increases gradually following increased solar radiation during the summer although water temperature also varied in the thermocline and hypolimnion the variations were smaller than in the surface water reflecting difference in water density boehrer and schultze 2008 ivey et al 2008 figs 3 and s2 thermal stratification thus acts as a barrier to co2 emissions and similarly prevents the upward mixing of nutrients in the deep portion of the water column elçi 2008 however the increased summer solar radiation allows phytoplankton photosynthesis assimilate of inorganic carbon thereby decreasing water pco2 and dic content and increasing do concentration within the surface layer water fig 2 mcconnaughey 1998 pu et al 2017 these simultaneous biochemical processes result in a significant positive relationship of pco2 and dic r2 0 852 p 0 001 fig s3e and significant negative relationship of do and pco2 r2 0 787 p 0 001 fig s3h in addition the exchange direction of co2 fluxes showed different modes with negative values in the 2017 stratified periods and minor positive values in the 2018 stratified periods which is mainly caused by the biomass differences of subaquatic phototrophs in the dld reservoir surface layer water the higher biomass of subaquatic phototroph reduced dic contents and pco2 values through stronger phytoplankton photosynthesis in the 2017 thermal stratification period which resulted in negative co2 flux comparing with the 2017 stratified period the chl a contents are lower and pco2 values are higher in the 2018 stratified period which showed minor co2 emission and didn t appear atmospheric co2 sink fractionation of carbon isotopes during co2 emission can cause water δ13cdic values to increase bade et al 2004 myrbo and shapley 2006 doctor et al 2008 herath et al 2020 however a significant negative relationship between δ13cdic and co2 fluxes r2 0 761 p 0 001 fig s3b indicates emission derived fractionation does not control seasonal δ13cdic variations the significant positive correlation of water δ13cdic vs do r2 0 559 p 0 001 fig s3i and rtrm or sst vs δ13cdic r2 0 708 for rtrm and r2 0 632 for sst p 0 001 fig 4d suggests that c fractionation from primary productivity in the epilimnion increases δ13cdic values during stratified period this isotopic evidence supports our inference that primary productivity is an important control of c cycling including co2 emissions from the dld reservoir assimilation of co2 through primary production during stratified periods leads to decreasing water pco2 values in the surface layer water occasionally to values below atmospheric pco2 values the low pco2 values cause low and occasionally negative co2 fluxes from the water column which vary from 65 13 to 22 61 mg m 2 h 1 with a mean of 8 21 mg m 2 h 1 figs 2 and 3 these results indicate that stratification limits co2 emission to the atmosphere from the dld reservoir and that the limitation is primarily controlled by photosynthesis elçi 2008 park and chung 2018 jin et al 2019 su et al 2019 4 3 mixing processes stimulates co2 emission the breakdown of the thermocline during winter elevates co2 emissions figs 3 and s2 as bottom water with high dic contents and pco2 values move to the surface this process is reflected in the significant negative relationship of rtrm or sst with dic and pco2 and significant positive relationships of dic with co2 flux and co2 flux with pco2 baehr and degrandpre 2004 bellido et al 2009 park and chung 2018 pu et al 2018 fig 4b and c the delivery of high pco2 water to the surface results in the greatest observed co2 emission from the dld reservoir figs 2 and 3 bottom water commonly has low δ13cdic value due to organic matter degradation and anoxic environment similarly during periods of mixing in the dld reservoir δ13cdic values in the surface water were lower than during periods of stratification reflecting upward mixing of isotopically light dic from the deep reservoir bottom water these light values occur regardless of the loss of co2 from atmospheric evasion which increases to 247 76 mg m 2 h 1 in november 2017 292 01 mg m 2 h 1 in january 2018 1338 13 mg m 2 h 1 in november 2018 and 113 91 mg m 2 h 1 in december 2018 because isotopic fraction is only 1 during emission of dissolved co2 the limited fractionation during emission is shown by a significant positive relationship of rtrm or sst with δ13cdic when the reservoir is mixed further reflecting the stimulation of co2 emission during mixing 4 4 magnitude of co2 emission in the dld reservoir the effects from stratification to the magnitude of co2 evasion indicates that seasonal evasion must be considered when evaluating the total annual co2 fluxes we make those calculations here the surface area of the dld reservoir was estimated using the polygon applications in google earth pro and found to average 8 79 km2 across multiple years combining this areas with each of the seasonal measurements of average co2 fluxes fig 3 we estimate the co2 emissions were 0 37 0 44 gg co2 1 gg 109g when the reservoir was stratified and 6 24 3 73 gg co2 when the reservoir was mixed over the study period the total co2 emissions were estimated at 6 93 4 57 gg co2 over the study period although the dld reservoir was a net atmospheric source of co2 source accurate assessments of the magnitude of the source depends on evaluating seasonal variations including times when the reservoir represents a sink for atmospheric co2 generally the measured co2 fluxes in the dld reservoir were within the intermediate published range table 2 the estimated total mean of co2 fluxes 49 1 mmol m 2 d 1 from the dld reservoir was much higher than the values of global reservoirs 7 5 mmol m 2 d 1 deemer et al 2016 and china s reservoirs 12 10 mmol m 2 d 1 and lakes 10 17 mmol m 2 d 1 li et al 2018a as well as reservoirs in yunnan guizhou region 4 47 mmol m 2 d 1 where is the main karst regions in south china li et al 2018a our total mean of co2 flux was significantly higher than most of the values reported for some subtropical reservoirs e g hongfeng baihua hongyan and dongfeng tropic reservoirs e g nam ngum nam leuk and palasari temperate reservoirs e g danjiangkou semi arid reservoirs e g murray miramar poway and mediterranean reservoirs e g sau and guadalcacin yet compare to the xiuwen reservoir 47 mmol m 2 d 1 and the bornos reservoir 50 mmol m 2 d 1 table 2 however the co2 flux values in other reservoirs including the three gorges subtropical daecheong temperate eastmain 1 boreal la grande 2 boreal balbina tropical samuel tropical and petit saut tropical were significant higher 1 5 20 fold than that in the dld reservoir table 2 our negative co2 fluxes during the stratified period were lower than some tropical reservoirs e g the nam ngum reservoir and the nam leuk reservoir temperate reservoirs e g reservoirs in inner mongolia xinjiang plateau region and semi arid reservoir e g poway reservoir yet compare to the sau reservoir in the mediterranean region 5 0 mmol m 2 d 1 and exceeding the murray reservoir 1 755 mmol m 2 d 1 and miramar reservoir 0 875 mmol m 2 d 1 the ranges of co2 flux in some subtropical reservoirs also covered the negative domain i e the hongfeng the baihua the xiuwen and the hongyan reservoir table 2 which very likely occurred in the thermal stratification period according to reported co2 flux curve in their paper noteworthy most of the reservoirs covering the negative co2 flux range were karst freshwater reservoirs table 2 indicating that karst reservoirs could play a more important role in regulating carbon cycle in inland waters co2 fluxes from reservoirs have been gaining increased attention recently however large uncertainty still exists in regional and global co2 flux estimates due to incomplete temporal and spatial coverage of the flux data and unclear control mechanism of co2 production st louis et al 2000 barros et al 2011 deemer et al 2016 therefore our study is significant because it reveals obviously temporal dynamics and key control mechanisms of co2 fluxes and improves understanding of critical environmental problems of co2 fluxes from reservoirs 4 5 optimizing sampling strategy up to now even though many new modern techniques online monitoring equipment flux tower remote sensing etc have been used to study the co2 exchange across the water air interface of rivers lakes and reservoirs accurate estimates of co2 emissions is difficult due to high temporal heterogeneities this study provides a new point of view regarding the complexity of the temporal variations of co2 emission in lakes or reservoirs in fact variations of thermal structure of lakes or reservoirs are common natural phenomenon due to seasonal solar and air temperature changes in the world boehrer and schultze 2008 most reservoirs and lakes start to stratify in late spring with mixing occurring in late autumn due to solar radiation variations boehrer and schultze 2008 the obvious temporal heterogeneity of the co2 emission implies that sampling should be conducted over as many days as possible and should at least include the thermal stratification and mixing periods if sampling was conducted during the thermal stratified period a fairly low or even negative co2 emission flux would be obtained whereas if sampling was conducted only during the mixing period the co2 emissions would be overestimated based on our results sampling should include at a minimum the incipient stage medium stage and late stage of thermal stratification and mixing period in a lake or reservoir in addition spatial heterogeneities of co2 emission in a lake or reservoirs also occur roland et al 2010 raymond et al 2013 paranaíba et al 2018 therefore reasonable sampling dates coupled with higher spatial sampling densities will decrease uncertainty of co2 emission estimates reducing uncertainty is critical to estimates of this important atmospheric source of co2 and will improve assessments of carbon budgets of lakes and reservoirs 4 6 practical implications williamson et al 2009 pointed out that lakes and reservoirs as sentinels integrators and regulators of climate change commonly thermal and mixing variations in lakes or reservoirs are forced by energy exchanges with the atmosphere many studies have revealed that lake or reservoir water temperature is closely related to regional scale air temperature lee et al 2011 tundisi and tundisi 2011 magee and wu 2017 woolway and merchant 2019 especially epilimnetic water temperature exhibits a rapid and direct response to air temperature also the variations of physical chemical and biological traits of lakes or reservoirs are closely related to water temperature variations williamson et al 2009 tundisi and tundisi 2011 winton et al 2019 global warming has raised the global mean surface temperature by 0 85 c from the pre industrial level hartmann et al 2013 previous studies have pointed out that warming air temperatures over the past decades increased epilimnetic water temperatures coats et al 2006 dobiesz and lester 2009 o reilly et al 2015 ficker et al 2017 air temperature conditions drive the density gradient in the water column of lakes or reservoirs inducing changes in the intensity and duration of thermal stratification and stability mccormick mj 1999 livingstone 2003 coats et al 2006 lee et al 2011 therefore some studies explicitly pointed out that warming of air temperatures and surface waters has considerably increased the strength of thermal stratification and prolonged stratified period which leads to reduced mixing based on long term monitoring data or mathematic model williamson et al 2009 rempfer et al 2010 wang et al 2012 kerimoglu and rinke 2013 zhang et al 2014 2015 considering air temperature is the primary control on reservoir stratification the role of stratification in controlling co2 emissions suggests that global warming may provide a negative feedback for this source of atmospheric co2 alter lewis et al 2019 woolway and merchant 2019 as global temperatures rise periods of stratification will increase and mixing will decrease kerimoglu and rinke 2013 zhang et al 2014 winton et al 2019 woolway and merchant 2019 for example in lake superior the summer stratified season increased from roughly 145 days 170 days over the last century an increase of about 17 austin and colman 2008 in lake nam co the summer stratification duration increased at a rate of 6 00 3 54 days per decade from 1979 to 2012 huang et al 2017 in dillion reservoir in the southern rocky mountains the mean sst increased from 580 to 880 j m2 over the past 35 years 1981 2016 reflecting increased stratification lewis et al 2019 considering our findings at the dld reservoir the possibility of co2 emissions decrease could well be risen with intensification and lengthening of their stratification depending on light availability and dissolved nutrients the decrease in co2 emission could be reduced even further through co2 assimilation by aquatic phototrophs fixing or assimilating inorganic carbon in karst systems may be an important atmospheric co2 sink martin 2017 pu et al 2017 where carbonate mineral weathering coupled with the aquatic photosynthetic uptake of dic could provide a carbon sink in karst systems organisms and sediments liu et al 2018 karst groundwater is often rich in dic because of carbonate dissolution by carbonic acid generated during the hydration of co2 assimilation of the dic by aquatic phototrophs may thus represent an important carbon sequestration approach in constructed karst freshwater reservoirs lengthened thermal stratification will also temporarily block carbon enriched water upwelling and will contribute to dic assimilation by aquatic photosynthesis and occasionally absorb atmospheric co2 in the epilimnion therefore it could fix more inorganic carbon in the forms of organic matter in the thermal stratification lópez et al 2011 park and chung 2018 thus carbon from karst systems could be sequestered pu et al 2017 liu et al 2018 although mixing will release co2 into atmosphere the magnitude of the c cycle will depend on rates of organic carbon remineralization and mixing times both processes must be quantified for accurate assessments of carbon budgets in a reservoir and lake catchments and their links to atmospheric co2 the dynamics of co2 exchange with the atmosphere across the water air interface in reservoirs and lakes in the future requires high frequency real time monitoring data these data could improve estimates of carbon budgets and help constrained measures of carbon emission from reservoir and lakes this study focuses only on a medium sized subtropical reservoir fed by karst groundwater and a two years span additional similar studies in different climatic zones land use types nutrient loading and hydraulic regimes could improve the understanding of the extent and causes of carbon cycle in reservoirs or lakes and provide management relevant information that could help to balance regional carbon budget 5 conclusion this study demonstrates that co2 emissions from a reservoir in southeastern china is controlled by variations of thermal structure based on two years monitoring data due to stronger aquatic photosynthesis co2 emission are limited and at times the reservoir acts as an atmospheric co2 sink when it is thermally stratified in contrast co2 emission are greater during times when the reservoir mixes due to reservoir overturn the total co2 emissions were estimated at 6 93 4 57 gg co2 over the study period from the dld reservoir the high temporal heterogeneity in co2 emission flux indicates that significant uncertainty could exist in estimates of global lake or reservoir co2 emissions that disregard seasonal variations in thermal structure this study also provides a sampling and monitoring framework to minimize uncertainty in the estimates of co2 exchange between lakes or reservoirs and
