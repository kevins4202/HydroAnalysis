9580,flash drought is an extreme phenomenon characterized by unusually rapid intensification of drought severity with strong impacts on plant growth especially for crops however it s unclear how hydrometeorological changes contribute to flash drought and how vegetation physiology greenness and productivity respond to flash drought in this study we developed an multivariate integrated framework for flash drought identification using a regression model based on principal components analysis pca the pca regression flash drought prfd model three criteria are specified to emphasize the rapid intensification of drought and its impacts on vegetation growth and water resources we applied our new model in two geographical units with different climates and hydrology one is dominated by agriculture and subject to natural drought the loess plateau and the other a natural region with infrequent drought the qinling mountains we found that high frequency of flash droughts is most likely to occur in the eastern and central loess plateau and part of the qinling mountains however in relatively humid areas flash drought shows strong intensity such as the qinling mountains and western and eastern edges of the loess plateau trend analysis indicates that prfd has increased frequency longer duration and stronger intensity since the 1990s in both regions from an ecological perspective prfd also showed a spatial pattern consistent with values of vegetation related proxies that were below the long term average demonstrating vegetation transpiration normalized difference vegetation index ndvi gross primary productivity have obvious feedback on flash drought events the loess plateau s ndvi responded immediately to flash drought versus a 1 month lag in the qinling mountains because our proposed framework integrates multiple aspects of drought information it can be applied in areas outside the study region according to regional hydrometeorological conditions this has significant implications for improving agricultural management and forecasting future severe impacts of flash drought on plant growth keywords flash drought integrated approach plant response water shortage 1 introduction drought is a natural hazard with complex causes large scale impacts and the potential to cause serious damage as a result it can cause significant ecological degradation and economic losses he et al 2019 jiao et al 2016 pendergrass et al 2020 as global climate warming intensifies the frequency and severity of droughts are expected to increase leading to longer lasting or more severe droughts that can potentially trigger permanent deterioration of vegetation function and productivity donohue et al 2013 jiao et al 2019 novick et al 2016 the development and spatial propagation of such droughts often take several months and spans long periods besides if the drought is accompanied by moisture deficits and heat extremes simultaneously with their strong interactions it can occur at the same time or transition from one type to another and impacts evolve with time otkin et al 2018 wang and yuan 2018 increasing attention has been focused on intense short duration days or weeks drought that develops rapidly and is called a flash drought mo and lettenmaier 2015 this drought category has occurred frequently in many regions including the north plains of the united states in 2017 he et al 2019 the central united states in june and july 2012 otkin et al 2016 the southeastern united states in 2016 otkin et al 2018 southern australia in early 2018 nguyen et al 2019 and south china in 2013 yuan et al 2015 several studies have tried to describe the characteristics of flash droughts based on their duration whereas others have focused on the unusually rapid intensification of drought for instance mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 defined a flash drought based on anomalies in the modeled soil moisture sm precipitation evapotranspiration et and temperature and classified into two categories one driven by high temperature heatwave drought and the other driven by rainfall limitation precipitation deficit previous studies did not account for changes in various drought related proxies over time nor did they set a threshold sufficiently dry to actually represent physiological drought in the affected plants thus otkin et al 2018 proposed that the term flash drought should be reserved for a time period during which rapid intensification occurred according to this definition christian et al 2019 presented an objective percentile based methodology to identify a flash drought using the standardized evaporative stress ratio sesr and changes in sesr in addition liu et al 2020 proposed a quantitative method to identify flash droughts based on the rate of drought intensification rifd these classifications acknowledge that drought is affected by a broad range of factors such as meteorology hydrology and energy balances however in isolation it is difficult to neatly classify a flash drought event using a single variable or indicator because no single indicator can sufficiently represent the complex processes and diverse impacts of drought indeed moisture deficits act in conjunction with high temperatures to determine the occurrence of flash drought and both factors may induce an accompanying reduction in plant function jiao et al 2021 zhang and yuan 2020 the current literature suggests that the changes in the relationship between precipitation and temperature may be more important than changes in each variable individually leonard et al 2014 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 trenberth et al 2014 despite this sesr or rifd typically focuses on a single climatic factor these univariate approaches may underestimate the effects of concurrent and compound extremes of one or both variables to solve this problem one of exigent issues is to construct a multivariate integrated framework to identify flash drought as this can avoid the effects of a time lag or deviation of univariate based models when they are used to evaluate the impact on vegetation dynamics in general flash drought appears to represent the onset and development phase of meteorological agricultural or hydrological drought which can then evolve into seasonal droughts however for flash drought to be used as an early and critical characteristic to identify subsequent seasonal drought the existing definition of flash drought must be adapted to explicitly consider the severity and duration of the drought ford and labosier 2017 wang et al 2016a if a dry anomaly is slight or has a short duration it may not significantly affect an ecosystem therefore quantifying the trends of severity and duration could facilitate the provision of an early warning of seasonal drought and associated risk assessment as in the case of conventional drought events flash droughts can also cause serious ecological deterioration and economic losses previous research suggested that flash drought usually occurs from may to july a period when plants most often encounter an imbalance between the heat and water required for plant growth he et al 2019 howitt et al 2014 mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 during this critical stage a short period of extreme high or low heat or moisture stress can rapidly damage crops and forest species because of the vulnerability of growing plants during the emergence pollination and grain filling stages barnabas et al 2008 earl and davis 2003 meyer et al 1993 wang and yuan 2018 xie et al 2016 although numerous studies have attempted to identify and describe the evolution of flash drought few focused on ecosystems other than agroecosystems for example the changes in crop yield were consistent with the changes during the 2012 summer flash drought severity in the central united states that were depicted by the evaporative stress index otkin et al 2016 he et al 2019 used the 30 m conus cropland et record with 8 day resolution along with coarser resolution monthly solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence to evaluate the impact of the 2017 northern plains flash drought moreover little detail is available on the impact of flash drought on vegetation growth under a range of environmental conditions the inadequacy of the available flash drought information has hampered seasonal drought forecasts and the choice of agroforestry ecosystem strategies to cope with drought consequently another major gap in our knowledge relates to the spatial and temporal characteristics of flash drought risk and its impact on managed and wild vegetation to address these issues we designed the present data to analyze drought in china s loess plateau and qinling mountains regions which cover the range of humid semi humid semi arid and arid conditions in north central china the loess plateau has one of the most serious cases of soil erosion in the world due to its combination of fine sediments and an ecologically fragile environment with frequent natural drought exacerbated by unsustainable land use the loess plateau has been continually negatively affected by anthropogenic activity for decades as the dominant land uses are farmland and artificial forests annual total precipitation and the annual mean temperature decrease from 948 9 mm in the southeast to 123 3 mm in the northwest and from 14 3 to 4 3 respectively the qinling mountains represent a critical geographical ecological transition zone and form the boundary between northern and southern china their geographical location means that they play a major role in chinese geographical patterns biota divisions and the distribution of natural resources ma et al 2019 the climate in the mountains ranges from sub humid to humid with annual total precipitation ranging from 520 mm in the north to 1200 mm in the south and annual mean temperature ranging from 5 14 in both regions a complex combination of atmospheric mechanisms determines the occurrence of droughts and severity of drought leading to equally complex variation in the frequency duration and magnitude of drought domínguez castro et al 2019 garcia herrera et al 2007 the primary goal of our study was to develop a new integrated framework for identifying flash droughts that can capture both heat wave and precipitation deficit flash drought events to accomplish this we used principal components analysis pca to combine multiple initial variables into a few uncorrelated comprehensive variables and extract variable weights from a single index relying on climate water conditions we used different weights in regression analysis to accommodate heterogeneity in the landscape of the two large study areas we named the resulting model the pca regression flash drought prfd model to evaluate how well the model could be generalized to work in regions with inconsistent climate water conditions we compared the model to previous models of heat wave and precipitation deficit flash drought we also surveyed the variation of sm during different types of flash drought finally we examined the performance of our framework for identifying flash drought including the spatiotemporal characteristic and the concurrent and compound effects on vegetation dynamics in diverse climate water regions 2 data 2 1 reanalysis datasets the meteorological and sm data were used to develop an integrated framework for identifying flash drought we used the era5 land hourly reanalysis products at a 0 1 resolution https cds climate copernicus eu muñoz sabater 2021 era5 is the fifth generation european center for medium range weather forecasts atmospheric reanalysis global climate dataset which superseded the era interim reanalysis dataset compared with era interim era5 has the following strengths much higher spatial and temporal resolution much improved troposphere a better global balance for precipitation and evaporation better sm data and more consistent sea surface temperature and sea ice aboobacker et al 2020 miranda et al 2020 oses et al 2020 renfrew et al 2020 the air temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the earth s surface taking account of the atmospheric conditions the daily precipitation is calculated by the sum of the hourly large scale precipitation and convective precipitation era5 hourly product on pressure levels provides estimates relative humidity moreover the average of era5 land sm at the depth of 0 100 cm as the volumetric unit was used in this study these datasets were verified against in situ sm observations and showed some confidence in drought analysis hillebrand et al 2020 sun et al 2020 additionally the global land evaporation amsterdam model v3 3a https www gleam eu provides transpiration et and root zone sm datasets at a daily scale as both variables are closely associated with vegetation growth 2 2 remote sensing data we obtained version 3 of the

obtained the land use type data for use in evaluating flash drought events from china s resource and environment science and data center http www resdc cn all the spatial datasets remote sensing and reanalysis datasets used in this study were resampled using a bilinear interpolation algorithm to a consistent spatial resolution of 0 1 using the arcpy package for version 3 7 of python 3 methodology 3 1 heat wave and precipitation deficit flash drought we used the two types of flash drought defined by mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 to identify flash drought in our study area heat wave and precipitation deficit flash droughts hwfd and pdfd although both types focus on sm as a water deficit indicator they virtually reflect different physical mechanisms that control sm high temperature can increase total evaporation tet whereas a lack of precipitation decreases tet because less water is available in the soil and increases temperature precipitation is not required for analyzing the two flash drought types because hwfd and pdfd are defined based on sm deficits mo and lettenmaier 2015 thus the definition we adopted here is based on temperature tet and sm quantile values as follows 1 hwfd tanomaly tstd tetanomaly 0 sm 40th percentile 2 pdfd tanomaly tstd tetanomaly 0 sm 40th percentile where tanomaly k and tetanomaly mm day represent the anomaly of the pentad mean air temperature and tet respectively tstd is the standard deviation of the tanomaly series for each pentad and grid point a flash drought event is identified when all of the above requirements are satisfied here and later in our paper an anomaly is calculated by subtracting the mean value of a variable from the measured or predicted value thus a positive value means the measured value is greater than the mean whereas a negative value is smaller 3 2 data preparation fig 1 illustrates the framework for identifying flash droughts first we calculated three drought conditions using daily temperature precipitation and sm reanalysis data the temperature condition index tci kogan 1995 the precipitation condition index pci and soil moisture condition index smci zhang and jia 2013 we then used pca to convert a set of potentially correlated variables into a set of linearly unrelated variables through an orthogonal transformation eastman and fulk 1993 in practice in comprehensive problem analysis multiple variables are often proposed and each reflects some information about the subject being studied but to different degrees thus tci pci and smci can monitor drought from different perspectives but the indicators are likely to be correlated to some extent du et al 2013 however these drought indices may not be linearly correlated in some seasons for example vegetation may have a different sensitivity to temperature precipitation and sm in different parts of the growing season or different seasons at different developmental stages thus in the second step of the framework we used pca to obtain a series of new data from tci pci and smci and to discard correlated signals and minor components with low explanatory value we call the result the pca based meteorological drought index pmdi in the third step we used regression analysis to determine the relationship between the new data series and the vapor pressure deficit vpd table 1 presents the equations used to calculate the four drought indices and the correlations pearson s r between pmdi and its components finally based on the factor score coefficients generated by pca we used regression model to upscale the data to the spatial scale based on the following equation 3 x k tci i tci σ tci α k pci i pci σ pci β k smci i smci σ smci γ k while xk represents the k th input variable in the regression equation for pmdi tcii pcii and smcii represent the tci pci and smci in a given year for pixel i σtci σpci and σsmci represent the standard deviations of tci pci and smci respectively tci pci smci represent the mean of tci pci and smci αk βk and γk represent the k th factor score coefficients derived from the pca method for tci pci and smci respectively to identify a flash drought we used standardized pmdi to more easily compare drought conditions between regions characterized by different climate regimes because fluctuation may sometimes appear among the daily values we computed the mean pentad values for pmdi before standardizing pmdi we calculated the change in pmdi values δpmdi between adjacent pentads to identify the rapid intensification that defines a flash drought in this analysis standardized pmdi and δpmdi are given as 4 pmdi ijp z pmdi ijp pmdi ijp σ pmdi ijp 5 δ pmdi ijp z δpmdi ijp δpmdi ijp σ δpmdi ijp where pmdiijp z and δpmdiijp z are the z scores of the pmdi values and the change in pmdi values for pentad p at grid point i j pmdi ijp and δpmdi ijp are the corresponding mean values for all years σ pmdi ijp and σ δpmdi ijp are the standard deviations of pmdi and δpmdi respectively 3 3 flash drought identification we used pentad pmdi and δpmdi percentiles to depict the drought process specifically the value of the chosen index must actually fall into drought during the rapid intensification period this means that any variable used to identify flash drought must fall below the 20th percentile for it to be considered drought christian et al 2020 otkin et al 2016 as in previous studies the threshold adopted here is twofold 1 the pmdi z greater than the 60th percentile and 2 the pmdi z value in the final pentad greater than the 80th percentile these two criteria could be found in liu et al 2020 and christian et al 2019 however a large difference in pmdi between the first and final pentads does not indicate a dramatic impact on the environment or ecosystem if this period persists for a longer time in terms of the rate of change during the rapid drought intensification unfavorable impacts are most likely to occur when there is continuous and rapid reinforcement of pmdi from one pentad to the next this suggests an additional criterion for flash drought 3 δpmdi z must be at or above the 60th percentile and no more than two consecutive δpmdi z values can fall below the 60th percentile value if one δpmdi z falls below the 60th percentile the following δpmdi z must be equal to or greater than the 60th percentile for flash drought to continue unless two or more consecutive δpmdi z values below the 60th percentile occur at the end of the flash drought this node could be suggested as the end of the period of rapid pmdi change to clarify the identification process for flash droughts based on the three abovementioned criteria we identified an example of a flash drought event from may to june 2006 fig 2 the onset time i e t in fig 2 of a flash drought event therefore defines the first pentad with δpmdi z in the 71th percentile greater than 60th percentile and pmdi in the 60th percentile the previous two δpmdi z values on 1 and 6 may 2006 fall below the 60th percentile with δpmdi z in the 45th and 19th percentiles respectively this process reflects a time series characteristic in which humid or normal weather conditions shift toward dry weather conditions and reveals this shift by focusing on the rapid rate of intensification which satisfies criterion 1 on 21 may and 5 june 2006 i e times t1 t2 and t4 t5 in fig 2 these two periods are identified as moderate conditions because their δpmdi z is less than the 60th percentile however the subsequent δpmdi z i e t2 t3 and t5 t6 in fig 2 had values above the 60th percentile at the 83th and 73th percentile respectively which satisfies criterion 3 so the flash drought is considered to continue furthermore the pmdi value at the end of the flash drought i e t6 t7 in fig 2 was greater than the 80th percentile and the following two consecutive δpmdi z values were in the 11th and 54th percentiles respectively which satisfies criteria 2 and 3 node t7 represents the stationary point at which vpd changes abruptly changes from a rapid increase to smooth fluctuation i e t8 t9 in fig 2 thus the end of the rapid drought intensification occurred on 15 june 2006 we calculated the frequency of occurrence foc as the proportion of pentads in which flash drought occurred in each grid cell and defined the intensity of a flash drought event as the difference in pmdi during its onset and subsequent development phases 6 foc n n total 100 where n is the total number of pentads in which a flash drought occurred during the entire record and ntotal is the total number of pentads ntotal 1627 frequency represents the total number of times whereas foc is a proportion of the total 7 intensity pmdi t pmdi t n t n t where t represents denotes the onset time of the flash drought and pmdit represents the pmdi value at the onset time tn and pmdi t n represents the terminal time and pmdi value of terminal time 3 4 trend analysis and change point detection to quantify the temporal trend of the time series for the frequency duration and intensity of flash drought events we used the nonparametric mann kendall test mann 1945 in contrast with traditional linear regression this trend test does not require data to follow a specific distribution and the results are not greatly distorted by outlier data de jong et al 2011 we used the changepoint np package https cran r project org web packages changepoint np index html for the r software www r project org to detect the change points of flash drought frequency duration and intensity across the two study regions this package is an extension of the changepoint package with a faster dynamic programming algorithm and a pruned exact linear time haynes et al 2016 4 results 4 1 comparison of conventional flash drought events the ensemble foc for two types of flash drought hwfd and pdfd showed high spatial variability from 1981 to 2018 fig 3a and b the foc of hwfd ranged from 0 to 12 with high foc most likely to occur in humid regions such as the qinling mountains and the southwestern part of the loess plateau fig 3a the foc across most northwestern parts of the study area i e arid areas was less than 2 indicating that hwfd was relatively infrequent in these regions in contrast pdfd events were common on the loess plateau fig 3b especially in the northwestern part where the moisture supply is insufficient and tet is high in humid and semi humid regions the combination of a sufficient moisture supply and dense vegetation can facilitate root water uptake even when drought occurs resulting in short duration pdfd with foc 2 from the perspective of drought characteristics the hwfd and pdfd methods only focus on the threshold of maximum temperature and precipitation anomalies respectively as we noted in the methods section another important characteristic of flash droughts lies in the unusually rapid intensification rate of the sm deficit fig 3c presents the sm anomaly in adjacent pentads of the onset for major flash drought events based on data from all pixels on the loess plateau and in the qinling mountains from 1981to 2018 for prfd sm shows a decreasing trend within three pentads in contrast hwfd and pdfd show sharp declines in sm at the onset of the flash drought t but then sm increased during the following three lagged pentads from t 1 to t 3 the three types of flash drought therefore differ among the pentads of sm 4 2 frequency and intensity of flash drought fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the frequency foc and intensity of flash drought identified based on pmdi frequency and foc exhibited similar spatial distributions with the maximum occurrence of prfd concentrated in the lvliang mountains qingyang city weihe plain and scattered regions on the southern side of the qinling mountains with frequency ranging from 30 to 56 times and foc on average ranges from 8 to 16 in addition high values of frequency and foc also existed in the easternmost part of the loess plateau and the northeastern part of the qinling mountains with foc greater than 12 this means that these regions experienced a higher frequency of flash drought specifically there was a lower frequency of prfd in most areas of the western loess plateau and the southernmost part of the qinling mountains with foc less than 5 we calculated the flash drought intensity index eq 7 to characterize the magnitude of prfd and distinguish events with relatively slow development from events with the most rapid development the spatial distribution of the intensity of prfd was highly inconsistent with foc fig 4c obviously the most rapidly developing flash droughts occurred in most regions of the qinling mountains and in the westernmost and eastern parts of the loess plateau the average intensity was between 0 3 and 0 7 thus we can conclude that flash drought in the loess plateau combined high frequency with low intensity versus low frequency and high intensity in the qinling mountains 4 3 trend analysis for flash droughts to explore the interannual variability of flash drought we plotted the annual average anomaly series for frequency the pentads and the intensity of flash drought in the two study regions fig 5 in general these variables showed similar trends that is prfd has been observed with enhanced frequency longer pentads and higher intensity after the 1990 s than that before for example the average prfd intensity anomaly was 0 25 and 0 29 during the 1990 s in the loess plateau and qinling mountains respectively the highest prfd intensity occurred in 1999 on the loess plateau and in 2002 in the qinling mountains with average intensity anomaly values of 0 11 and 0 16 respectively fig 6 shows the results of the mann kendall trend analysis to detect the years when the prfd frequency pentads and intensity changed from 1981 to 2018 there were upward trends both on the loess plateau and in the qinling mountains for frequency pentads and intensity all flash drought variables statistically significant increasing trends the prfd pentads and intensity increased greatly with the change point in the 1990 s across both regions for example the series of average prfd intensity showed that a change year occurred in 1990 on the loess plateau with the average intensity differing by 0 048 between the pre and post change periods fig 6e similarly the trend changed in 1999 in the qinling mountains with an average intensity difference of 0 046 fig 6f for the frequency trend the change occurred in 2010 in the qinling mountains versus 1996 on the loess plateau 4 4 impact assessment of flash droughts we chose the 1982 flash drought event to explore whether and how flash drought behavior affected vegetation physiology the change processes of several vegetation related indices are investigated from one pentad prior to onset t 1 to two pentad post onset t 2 of prfd based on the onset of prfd in 1982 we selected the corresponding 10 day data and 8 day data for ndvi and gpp respectively fig 7a shows that the most rapidly developing flash droughts are presented across the eastern part of the loess plateau and the western qinling mountains overall these flash drought areas were captured well by et and root zone sm anomalies fig 7b however there were differences in spatial extent and magnitude especially in the loess plateau negative et anomalies covered most areas where prfd tended to occur but only appeared at the onset of flash drought in the qinling mountains fig 7b the major differences in the evolution over time were located in the southwestern part of the loess plateau and the western qinling mountains with the et anomaly decreasing below 0 5 mm day thus these decreasing trends responded to a short period of record dryness for any climate based type of flash drought high temperature increases et and rapidly decreases sm and a precipitation deficit also increases sm deficits zhang et al 2017 we investigated the evolution of root zone sm which plays a dominant and direct role in determining vegetation growth the results show that spatial pattern of negative root zone sm anomalies was consistent with most of the areas where prfd occurs in addition these anomalies tended to increase on average after the onset of flash drought onset across most of the loess plateau which was mainly preceded by decreasing et according to prfd results early june 1982 denotes the onset period for most flash drought events 50 the negative ndvi anomalies were generally consistent with the spatial pattern of prfd which indicates that flash drought significantly decreases ndvi for example with the worst drought conditions in the eastern part of the loess plateau and the western qinling mountains drought in these areas was captured well by rapidly decreasing ndvi anomalies in early june and early july ndvi anomalies generally 0 15 from fig 7 b the negative of gpp anomalies follow the same spatial pattern as that of the prfd occurrence along with the flash drought evolved in turn induce an accompanying reduction in spatial correlation between them 0 3 0 22 0 22 and 0 07 in most regions with high prfd intensity the changes of corresponding gpp anomalies were lower than 2 and the greatest response in gpp was mainly found in the west of the boundary of the loess plateau and qinling mountains 5 discussion 5 1 methods to identify flash droughts flash drought is a kind of drought that occurs during the growing season it is characterized by extreme weather conditions and severe sm deficits jiao et al 2021 mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 based on the different physical mechanisms used in previous studies high temperatures and water deficits are the main climatic conditions that drive flash droughts these conditions define two types of flash drought hwfd and pdfd with typical spatial patterns they are more likely to occur in southern and northern china wang and yuan 2018 where the moisture supply is relatively sufficient or in a deficit condition respectively this agrees with our results in which hwfd occurred most often in the relatively humid qinling mountains but pdfd occurred mostly in the arid loess plateau fig 3a and b in contrast with previous research that identified flash drought based on its duration other research has instead drawn attention to the unusually dramatic rate of development of an sm deficit and increase of the et ratio nguyen et al 2021 although these methods specify the threshold for the corresponding variables that are used to identify the onset of flash drought this approach only indicates dryer conditions that may not represent a true drought event these methodologies also only proposed a flash drought framework based on a single variable and ignored the concurrent effect of two or more variables recently researchers have begun to focus on the interactions among multiple driving factors hu et al 2021 to account for this new multi variable approach and the connections among the variables we explored the spatial characteristics and temporal trends of flash drought across different climate water regions furthermore the certain pertinence relations between these driving factors may have existed in statistical analysis namely these variables reflect overlapping drought information we used pca to reduce the overlapped parts as many as possible a new variable set with uncorrelated principal components avena et al 1999 eastman and fulk 1993 as an effective tool for reducing the dimensions of analysis pca is used to extract the principal components from temperature precipitation and sm the resulting new variables eliminated much of the redundancy and retained more original information that reflected drought information in our analysis the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 accounted for more than 83 of the variance in the drought information which means that the temperature anomalies precipitation anomalies and sm anomalies that drive the rapid onset of flash drought were well accounted given that global precipitation is projected to remain steady the changing vpd is known to be a critical constraint on plant functioning in terrestrial biomes grossiord et al 2020 yuan et al 2019a increasing vpd decreases photosynthesis and growth leads to higher risks of hydraulic failure and carbon starvation and can lead to drought induced mortality babst et al 2019 novick et al 2016 williams et al 2013 in this study we applied vpd with simultaneous use of pc1 and pc2 in the regression model for flash drought identification however no objective criteria are currently available given the uncertainties in defining the concept of flash drought and the scarcity of data based on such a definition otkin et al 2018 our approach was based on three specific thresholds that reflect the development phases that define a flash drought these criteria emphasize drought events that can generate anomalously high or low stress conditions under a business as usual scenario because methodological approaches must be focused on the velocity of drought onset as the main differentiating these from other drought events characterized by slower processes noguera et al 2020 fig 3c shows that hwfd and pdfd which focus only on temperature and precipitation respectively show high spatial heterogeneity in flash drought incidence in contrast our new method accounts for the rapid onset and consistency across pentads rather than relying on a single pentad at the beginning of the flash drought compared with the pmdi based flash drought prfd previous methods could improperly detect events with a duration shorter than four weeks because hwfd or pdfd may have occurred during the recovery phase when sm begins to increase again liu et al 2020 wang and yuan 2018 prfd integrates multiple related variables temperature precipitation and sm and is therefore more suitable for improving our ability to identify flash droughts across a range of geographic and climatic conditions thus our approach represents an improvement on previous effects to identify flash droughts 5 2 spatial and temporal characteristics of flash drought and risk evaluation as we mentioned earlier flash drought is characterized by excessive atmospheric water demand accompanied by a rapid change in water availability hobbins et al 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 the spatial patterns of foc revealed that our prfd results differed slightly from a previous approach based on a modified rate of intensification of sm deficits in the yellow river basin liu et al 2020 which included most areas of the loess plateau both studies revealed higher foc in the southeastern and central parts of the loess plateau but with low intensity 0 3 fig 4 semi humid regions such as the weihe plain baoji xi an etc show greater susceptibility to flash drought due to the large areas of rainfed crops with risk exacerbated by climate anomalies that are occurring due to global change this spatial pattern has resulted mainly from rapidly drying soils caused by increasing et which is driven in turn by higher temperatures in humid and semi humid regions conversely whether rising temperatures cause et to increase or decrease is uncertain because drought conditions usually inhibit et in arid and semi arid regions yuan et al 2019b furthermore our results show clear trends of increasing flash droughts which is consistent with the trend of global warming aghakouchak et al 2014 along with rising temperatures on a global scale heat waves are often but not always accompanied by drought so the susceptibility of plants to damage from flash drought is exacerbated grossiord et al 2020 in this context the future variability of hydrometeorological variables such as precipitation temperature and sm at short time scales are being investigated in detail yuan et al 2019b developed a land surface model to project future exposure to flash drought and projected that the severity and frequency of flash drought risk would increase significantly during the middle and end of the 21st century especially in southern china where the problem is exacerbated by population growth wang et al 2016a investigated the long term trends and variability of flash droughts and found similar results as mentioned above that is the trend of accelerated drying decreasing sm in southern china is mainly due to a combination of decreasing precipitation caused by decadal scale climate variability and anthropogenic aerosols wang et al 2016b another reason might be the increasing atmospheric water demand and et under heat wave conditions zhang et al 2021 found that ipcc data indicated that global warming will continue in the 21st century our study also suggests significant increases in the frequency and intensity of flash drought based on concurrent development of water and heat anomalies in the qinling mountains at the border between northern and southern china this scenario of rapid and increasing anomalies could be strengthened leading to a growing need for drought early warning in the coming decades 5 3 effects of flash drought on vegetation dynamics we also examined the evolution of several vegetation related indicators in response to flash drought including two satellite based indicators ndvi and gpp and one reanalysis dataset et fig 8a shows that flash drought events could be divided into five prfd intensity categories for the 1982 drought event with the threshold percentile interval from 0 to 20 in the present study we selected a prfd intensity greater than the 60th percentile to analyze the variation of vegetation anomalies which were mainly scattered in the eastern part of the loess plateau and western and the central parts of the qinling mountains these regions were mostly associated with grassland forest and shrubwood with relatively little drought in sandy land fig 8b based on the temporal evolution of prfd et anomalies showed considerable differences in adjacent pentads between the two regions fig 9 the et anomalies fig 9a show a pattern of rising et on the loess plateau starting at time t followed by a subsequent reduction as flash drought developed in contrast in the qinling mountains the minimum anomaly occurs at t and then increases similar patterns are observed when the prfd intensity increases to 80 100 fig 9b stomatal regulation is directly responsible for controlling leaf level et but no consensus exists on the mechanisms and processes of stomatal responses to hydrometeorological stresses grossiord et al 2020 earlier work showed that et rates tend to increase with high vpd up to a point after which et either remains high or starts decreasing franks et al 1997 this is why et had a higher anomaly at time t on the loess plateau with et gradually decreasing thereafter the different patterns of et response to flash drought between the two study areas are likely caused by differences in the plant species fig 8b and physiological mechanisms by which stomatal behavior responds to flash drought deserve further attention in future research ndvi was dominated by negative anomalies across the loess plateau and reached its minimum value in early june during which most of the flash droughts in this period occurred fig 9c and d in the qinling mountains the minimum ndvi anomalies occurred in late july when ndvi was significantly lower than in the other months these response patterns of ndvi to flash drought can be chiefly associated with the vegetation types and drought resistance on the loess plateau grassland is the major vegetation type fig 8b and shallow roots of the grass limit their ability to draw water from deeper soil layers when a precipitation deficit occurs liu et al 2019 however the vegetation of the qinling mountains is mainly composed of forest i e deep rooted trees and grassland i e sparse forest with large grassy areas which have higher resistance to hydrometeorological stresses due to the accumulation of dead branches and fallen leaves porous woodland soil and deep roots system wang et al 2021 as a result ndvi on the loess plateau seems to respond immediately to flash drought events whereas there is an approximately 1 month lag in the qinling mountains on the other hand chen et al 2021 demonstrated that the occurrence of flash drought was not significantly affected by vegetation physiological activity however their vegetation sensitivity experiments suggest that vegetation greening can dramatically increase the frequency of flash drought through increased et therefore the implementation of extensive grain for green project has exacerbated the flash drought risk in the loess plateau and qinling mountains since this project involved widespread afforestation that would have led to increased et as the trees grew apart from the response of vegetation structure it should be noted that vegetation physiology also reacts to flash drought figs 9e and 9f show that gpp depressions that are unrelated to flash drought occurred in the pre drought period which occurred mainly in the qinling mountains because our definition holds that flash drought is a subset of ordinary drought the climate and water conditions have already changed before flash drought occurred along with its direct impact on susceptible plants gpp will respond immediately to this environmental change this finding confirmed the conclusion of schwarz et al 2020 that is the differences in climate conditions prevailing in the pre and post drought period should take into account as even moderate dryness might leave vegetation vulnerable 6 conclusions in this study we developed a new integrated method for identifying flash drought based on multiple variables temperature precipitation and sm that permits identification of the onset time duration and intensity of flash drought events across a range of sites with different climate water conditions our method emphasizes the rapid rate of pmdi intensification during pentad to pentad changes then considers the atmospheric water demand by developing a regression model in which the final variables are selected by pca and finally evaluates the impact of flash drought on vegetation dynamics this new approach lets us identify the types of flash drought i e hwfd vs pdfd by assigning different weights to the variables included in the model different physical mechanisms govern the evolution of sm anomalies during adjacent pentads of the onset and development of flash drought by comparing our new model with previous models hwfd and pdfd we found that the older models were affected by unreasonable thresholds that limited their ability to capture continuous variation over time as a result our proposed new framework can better guarantee that all of the identified events truly represent flash droughts by focusing on the rapid intensification of the drought and subsequent consistent changes our foc and intensity analysis revealed a high frequency and low intensity of flash drought in the loess plateau but low frequency and high intensity in the qinling mountains our method identified prfd with greater frequency longer pentads and stronger intensity after the 1990 s from an ecological perspective the observed negative anomalies for et root zone sm and ndvi were generally consistent with the spatial pattern of prfd which confirmed that flash drought had an obvious influence on plant growth the vegetation response to flash drought displayed regional differences during flash drought ndvi on the loess plateau responded immediately to flash drought versus an approximately 1 month lag time in the qinling mountains prfd comprehensively considered multiple sources of drought information that are of interest to agricultural managers thereby providing an approach with high spatial and temporal resolutions based on an enhanced definition of flash drought because of the flexible weight assignment method the method also has strong potential to improve the predictability of early warning for seasonal drought findings

9580,flash drought is an extreme phenomenon characterized by unusually rapid intensification of drought severity with strong impacts on plant growth especially for crops however it s unclear how hydrometeorological changes contribute to flash drought and how vegetation physiology greenness and productivity respond to flash drought in this study we developed an multivariate integrated framework for flash drought identification using a regression model based on principal components analysis pca the pca regression flash drought prfd model three criteria are specified to emphasize the rapid intensification of drought and its impacts on vegetation growth and water resources we applied our new model in two geographical units with different climates and hydrology one is dominated by agriculture and subject to natural drought the loess plateau and the other a natural region with infrequent drought the qinling mountains we found that high frequency of flash droughts is most likely to occur in the eastern and central loess plateau and part of the qinling mountains however in relatively humid areas flash drought shows strong intensity such as the qinling mountains and western and eastern edges of the loess plateau trend analysis indicates that prfd has increased frequency longer duration and stronger intensity since the 1990s in both regions from an ecological perspective prfd also showed a spatial pattern consistent with values of vegetation related proxies that were below the long term average demonstrating vegetation transpiration normalized difference vegetation index ndvi gross primary productivity have obvious feedback on flash drought events the loess plateau s ndvi responded immediately to flash drought versus a 1 month lag in the qinling mountains because our proposed framework integrates multiple aspects of drought information it can be applied in areas outside the study region according to regional hydrometeorological conditions this has significant implications for improving agricultural management and forecasting future severe impacts of flash drought on plant growth keywords flash drought integrated approach plant response water shortage 1 introduction drought is a natural hazard with complex causes large scale impacts and the potential to cause serious damage as a result it can cause significant ecological degradation and economic losses he et al 2019 jiao et al 2016 pendergrass et al 2020 as global climate warming intensifies the frequency and severity of droughts are expected to increase leading to longer lasting or more severe droughts that can potentially trigger permanent deterioration of vegetation function and productivity donohue et al 2013 jiao et al 2019 novick et al 2016 the development and spatial propagation of such droughts often take several months and spans long periods besides if the drought is accompanied by moisture deficits and heat extremes simultaneously with their strong interactions it can occur at the same time or transition from one type to another and impacts evolve with time otkin et al 2018 wang and yuan 2018 increasing attention has been focused on intense short duration days or weeks drought that develops rapidly and is called a flash drought mo and lettenmaier 2015 this drought category has occurred frequently in many regions including the north plains of the united states in 2017 he et al 2019 the central united states in june and july 2012 otkin et al 2016 the southeastern united states in 2016 otkin et al 2018 southern australia in early 2018 nguyen et al 2019 and south china in 2013 yuan et al 2015 several studies have tried to describe the characteristics of flash droughts based on their duration whereas others have focused on the unusually rapid intensification of drought for instance mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 defined a flash drought based on anomalies in the modeled soil moisture sm precipitation evapotranspiration et and temperature and classified into two categories one driven by high temperature heatwave drought and the other driven by rainfall limitation precipitation deficit previous studies did not account for changes in various drought related proxies over time nor did they set a threshold sufficiently dry to actually represent physiological drought in the affected plants thus otkin et al 2018 proposed that the term flash drought should be reserved for a time period during which rapid intensification occurred according to this definition christian et al 2019 presented an objective percentile based methodology to identify a flash drought using the standardized evaporative stress ratio sesr and changes in sesr in addition liu et al 2020 proposed a quantitative method to identify flash droughts based on the rate of drought intensification rifd these classifications acknowledge that drought is affected by a broad range of factors such as meteorology hydrology and energy balances however in isolation it is difficult to neatly classify a flash drought event using a single variable or indicator because no single indicator can sufficiently represent the complex processes and diverse impacts of drought indeed moisture deficits act in conjunction with high temperatures to determine the occurrence of flash drought and both factors may induce an accompanying reduction in plant function jiao et al 2021 zhang and yuan 2020 the current literature suggests that the changes in the relationship between precipitation and temperature may be more important than changes in each variable individually leonard et al 2014 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 trenberth et al 2014 despite this sesr or rifd typically focuses on a single climatic factor these univariate approaches may underestimate the effects of concurrent and compound extremes of one or both variables to solve this problem one of exigent issues is to construct a multivariate integrated framework to identify flash drought as this can avoid the effects of a time lag or deviation of univariate based models when they are used to evaluate the impact on vegetation dynamics in general flash drought appears to represent the onset and development phase of meteorological agricultural or hydrological drought which can then evolve into seasonal droughts however for flash drought to be used as an early and critical characteristic to identify subsequent seasonal drought the existing definition of flash drought must be adapted to explicitly consider the severity and duration of the drought ford and labosier 2017 wang et al 2016a if a dry anomaly is slight or has a short duration it may not significantly affect an ecosystem therefore quantifying the trends of severity and duration could facilitate the provision of an early warning of seasonal drought and associated risk assessment as in the case of conventional drought events flash droughts can also cause serious ecological deterioration and economic losses previous research suggested that flash drought usually occurs from may to july a period when plants most often encounter an imbalance between the heat and water required for plant growth he et al 2019 howitt et al 2014 mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 during this critical stage a short period of extreme high or low heat or moisture stress can rapidly damage crops and forest species because of the vulnerability of growing plants during the emergence pollination and grain filling stages barnabas et al 2008 earl and davis 2003 meyer et al 1993 wang and yuan 2018 xie et al 2016 although numerous studies have attempted to identify and describe the evolution of flash drought few focused on ecosystems other than agroecosystems for example the changes in crop yield were consistent with the changes during the 2012 summer flash drought severity in the central united states that were depicted by the evaporative stress index otkin et al 2016 he et al 2019 used the 30 m conus cropland et record with 8 day resolution along with coarser resolution monthly solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence to evaluate the impact of the 2017 northern plains flash drought moreover little detail is available on the impact of flash drought on vegetation growth under a range of environmental conditions the inadequacy of the available flash drought information has hampered seasonal drought forecasts and the choice of agroforestry ecosystem strategies to cope with drought consequently another major gap in our knowledge relates to the spatial and temporal characteristics of flash drought risk and its impact on managed and wild vegetation to address these issues we designed the present data to analyze drought in china s loess plateau and qinling mountains regions which cover the range of humid semi humid semi arid and arid conditions in north central china the loess plateau has one of the most serious cases of soil erosion in the world due to its combination of fine sediments and an ecologically fragile environment with frequent natural drought exacerbated by unsustainable land use the loess plateau has been continually negatively affected by anthropogenic activity for decades as the dominant land uses are farmland and artificial forests annual total precipitation and the annual mean temperature decrease from 948 9 mm in the southeast to 123 3 mm in the northwest and from 14 3 to 4 3 respectively the qinling mountains represent a critical geographical ecological transition zone and form the boundary between northern and southern china their geographical location means that they play a major role in chinese geographical patterns biota divisions and the distribution of natural resources ma et al 2019 the climate in the mountains ranges from sub humid to humid with annual total precipitation ranging from 520 mm in the north to 1200 mm in the south and annual mean temperature ranging from 5 14 in both regions a complex combination of atmospheric mechanisms determines the occurrence of droughts and severity of drought leading to equally complex variation in the frequency duration and magnitude of drought domínguez castro et al 2019 garcia herrera et al 2007 the primary goal of our study was to develop a new integrated framework for identifying flash droughts that can capture both heat wave and precipitation deficit flash drought events to accomplish this we used principal components analysis pca to combine multiple initial variables into a few uncorrelated comprehensive variables and extract variable weights from a single index relying on climate water conditions we used different weights in regression analysis to accommodate heterogeneity in the landscape of the two large study areas we named the resulting model the pca regression flash drought prfd model to evaluate how well the model could be generalized to work in regions with inconsistent climate water conditions we compared the model to previous models of heat wave and precipitation deficit flash drought we also surveyed the variation of sm during different types of flash drought finally we examined the performance of our framework for identifying flash drought including the spatiotemporal characteristic and the concurrent and compound effects on vegetation dynamics in diverse climate water regions 2 data 2 1 reanalysis datasets the meteorological and sm data were used to develop an integrated framework for identifying flash drought we used the era5 land hourly reanalysis products at a 0 1 resolution https cds climate copernicus eu muñoz sabater 2021 era5 is the fifth generation european center for medium range weather forecasts atmospheric reanalysis global climate dataset which superseded the era interim reanalysis dataset compared with era interim era5 has the following strengths much higher spatial and temporal resolution much improved troposphere a better global balance for precipitation and evaporation better sm data and more consistent sea surface temperature and sea ice aboobacker et al 2020 miranda et al 2020 oses et al 2020 renfrew et al 2020 the air temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the earth s surface taking account of the atmospheric conditions the daily precipitation is calculated by the sum of the hourly large scale precipitation and convective precipitation era5 hourly product on pressure levels provides estimates relative humidity moreover the average of era5 land sm at the depth of 0 100 cm as the volumetric unit was used in this study these datasets were verified against in situ sm observations and showed some confidence in drought analysis hillebrand et al 2020 sun et al 2020 additionally the global land evaporation amsterdam model v3 3a https www gleam eu provides transpiration et and root zone sm datasets at a daily scale as both variables are closely associated with vegetation growth 2 2 remote sensing data we obtained version 3 of the

reanalysis datasets used in this study were resampled using a bilinear interpolation algorithm to a consistent spatial resolution of 0 1 using the arcpy package for version 3 7 of python 3 methodology 3 1 heat wave and precipitation deficit flash drought we used the two types of flash drought defined by mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 to identify flash drought in our study area heat wave and precipitation deficit flash droughts hwfd and pdfd although both types focus on sm as a water deficit indicator they virtually reflect different physical mechanisms that control sm high temperature can increase total evaporation tet whereas a lack of precipitation decreases tet because less water is available in the soil and increases temperature precipitation is not required for analyzing the two flash drought types because hwfd and pdfd are defined based on sm deficits mo and lettenmaier 2015 thus the definition we adopted here is based on temperature tet and sm quantile values as follows 1 hwfd tanomaly tstd tetanomaly 0 sm 40th percentile 2 pdfd tanomaly tstd tetanomaly 0 sm 40th percentile where tanomaly k and tetanomaly mm day represent the anomaly of the pentad mean air temperature and tet respectively tstd is the standard deviation of the tanomaly series for each pentad and grid point a flash drought event is identified when all of the above requirements are satisfied here and later in our paper an anomaly is calculated by subtracting the mean value of a variable from the measured or predicted value thus a positive value means the measured value is greater than the mean whereas a negative value is smaller 3 2 data preparation fig 1 illustrates the framework for identifying flash droughts first we calculated three drought conditions using daily temperature precipitation and sm reanalysis data the temperature condition index tci kogan 1995 the precipitation condition index pci and soil moisture condition index smci zhang and jia 2013 we then used pca to convert a set of potentially correlated variables into a set of linearly unrelated variables through an orthogonal transformation eastman and fulk 1993 in practice in comprehensive problem analysis multiple variables are often proposed and each reflects some information about the subject being studied but to different degrees thus tci pci and smci can monitor drought from different perspectives but the indicators are likely to be correlated to some extent du et al 2013 however these drought indices may not be linearly correlated in some seasons for example vegetation may have a different sensitivity to temperature precipitation and sm in different parts of the growing season or different seasons at different developmental stages thus in the second step of the framework we used pca to obtain a series of new data from tci pci and smci and to discard correlated signals and minor components with low explanatory value we call the result the pca based meteorological drought index pmdi in the third step we used regression analysis to determine the relationship between the new data series and the vapor pressure deficit vpd table 1 presents the equations used to calculate the four drought indices and the correlations pearson s r between pmdi and its components finally based on the factor score coefficients generated by pca we used regression model to upscale the data to the spatial scale based on the following equation 3 x k tci i tci σ tci α k pci i pci σ pci β k smci i smci σ smci γ k while xk represents the k th input variable in the regression equation for pmdi tcii pcii and smcii represent the tci pci and smci in a given year for pixel i σtci σpci and σsmci represent the standard deviations of tci pci and smci respectively tci pci smci represent the mean of tci pci and smci αk βk and γk represent the k th factor score coefficients derived from the pca method for tci pci and smci respectively to identify a flash drought we used standardized pmdi to more easily compare drought conditions between regions characterized by different climate regimes because fluctuation may sometimes appear among the daily values we computed the mean pentad values for pmdi before standardizing pmdi we calculated the change in pmdi values δpmdi between adjacent pentads to identify the rapid intensification that defines a flash drought in this analysis standardized pmdi and δpmdi are given as 4 pmdi ijp z pmdi ijp pmdi ijp σ pmdi ijp 5 δ pmdi ijp z δpmdi ijp δpmdi ijp σ δpmdi ijp where pmdiijp z and δpmdiijp z are the z scores of the pmdi values and the change in pmdi values for pentad p at grid point i j pmdi ijp and δpmdi ijp are the corresponding mean values for all years σ pmdi ijp and σ δpmdi ijp are the standard deviations of pmdi and δpmdi respectively 3 3 flash drought identification we used pentad pmdi and δpmdi percentiles to depict the drought process specifically the value of the chosen index must actually fall into drought during the rapid intensification period this means that any variable used to identify flash drought must fall below the 20th percentile for it to be considered drought christian et al 2020 otkin et al 2016 as in previous studies the threshold adopted here is twofold 1 the pmdi z greater than the 60th percentile and 2 the pmdi z value in the final pentad greater than the 80th percentile these two criteria could be found in liu et al 2020 and christian et al 2019 however a large difference in pmdi between the first and final pentads does not indicate a dramatic impact on the environment or ecosystem if this period persists for a longer time in terms of the rate of change during the rapid drought intensification unfavorable impacts are most likely to occur when there is continuous and rapid reinforcement of pmdi from one pentad to the next this suggests an additional criterion for flash drought 3 δpmdi z must be at or above the 60th percentile and no more than two consecutive δpmdi z values can fall below the 60th percentile value if one δpmdi z falls below the 60th percentile the following δpmdi z must be equal to or greater than the 60th percentile for flash drought to continue unless two or more consecutive δpmdi z values below the 60th percentile occur at the end of the flash drought this node could be suggested as the end of the period of rapid pmdi change to clarify the identification process for flash droughts based on the three abovementioned criteria we identified an example of a flash drought event from may to june 2006 fig 2 the onset time i e t in fig 2 of a flash drought event therefore defines the first pentad with δpmdi z in the 71th percentile greater than 60th percentile and pmdi in the 60th percentile the previous two δpmdi z values on 1 and 6 may 2006 fall below the 60th percentile with δpmdi z in the 45th and 19th percentiles respectively this process reflects a time series characteristic in which humid or normal weather conditions shift toward dry weather conditions and reveals this shift by focusing on the rapid rate of intensification which satisfies criterion 1 on 21 may and 5 june 2006 i e times t1 t2 and t4 t5 in fig 2 these two periods are identified as moderate conditions because their δpmdi z is less than the 60th percentile however the subsequent δpmdi z i e t2 t3 and t5 t6 in fig 2 had values above the 60th percentile at the 83th and 73th percentile respectively which satisfies criterion 3 so the flash drought is considered to continue furthermore the pmdi value at the end of the flash drought i e t6 t7 in fig 2 was greater than the 80th percentile and the following two consecutive δpmdi z values were in the 11th and 54th percentiles respectively which satisfies criteria 2 and 3 node t7 represents the stationary point at which vpd changes abruptly changes from a rapid increase to smooth fluctuation i e t8 t9 in fig 2 thus the end of the rapid drought intensification occurred on 15 june 2006 we calculated the frequency of occurrence foc as the proportion of pentads in which flash drought occurred in each grid cell and defined the intensity of a flash drought event as the difference in pmdi during its onset and subsequent development phases 6 foc n n total 100 where n is the total number of pentads in which a flash drought occurred during the entire record and ntotal is the total number of pentads ntotal 1627 frequency represents the total number of times whereas foc is a proportion of the total 7 intensity pmdi t pmdi t n t n t where t represents denotes the onset time of the flash drought and pmdit represents the pmdi value at the onset time tn and pmdi t n represents the terminal time and pmdi value of terminal time 3 4 trend analysis and change point detection to quantify the temporal trend of the time series for the frequency duration and intensity of flash drought events we used the nonparametric mann kendall test mann 1945 in contrast with traditional linear regression this trend test does not require data to follow a specific distribution and the results are not greatly distorted by outlier data de jong et al 2011 we used the changepoint np package https cran r project org web packages changepoint np index html for the r software www r project org to detect the change points of flash drought frequency duration and intensity across the two study regions this package is an extension of the changepoint package with a faster dynamic programming algorithm and a pruned exact linear time haynes et al 2016 4 results 4 1 comparison of conventional flash drought events the ensemble foc for two types of flash drought hwfd and pdfd showed high spatial variability from 1981 to 2018 fig 3a and b the foc of hwfd ranged from 0 to 12 with high foc most likely to occur in humid regions such as the qinling mountains and the southwestern part of the loess plateau fig 3a the foc across most northwestern parts of the study area i e arid areas was less than 2 indicating that hwfd was relatively infrequent in these regions in contrast pdfd events were common on the loess plateau fig 3b especially in the northwestern part where the moisture supply is insufficient and tet is high in humid and semi humid regions the combination of a sufficient moisture supply and dense vegetation can facilitate root water uptake even when drought occurs resulting in short duration pdfd with foc 2 from the perspective of drought characteristics the hwfd and pdfd methods only focus on the threshold of maximum temperature and precipitation anomalies respectively as we noted in the methods section another important characteristic of flash droughts lies in the unusually rapid intensification rate of the sm deficit fig 3c presents the sm anomaly in adjacent pentads of the onset for major flash drought events based on data from all pixels on the loess plateau and in the qinling mountains from 1981to 2018 for prfd sm shows a decreasing trend within three pentads in contrast hwfd and pdfd show sharp declines in sm at the onset of the flash drought t but then sm increased during the following three lagged pentads from t 1 to t 3 the three types of flash drought therefore differ among the pentads of sm 4 2 frequency and intensity of flash drought fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the frequency foc and intensity of flash drought identified based on pmdi frequency and foc exhibited similar spatial distributions with the maximum occurrence of prfd concentrated in the lvliang mountains qingyang city weihe plain and scattered regions on the southern side of the qinling mountains with frequency ranging from 30 to 56 times and foc on average ranges from 8 to 16 in addition high values of frequency and foc also existed in the easternmost part of the loess plateau and the northeastern part of the qinling mountains with foc greater than 12 this means that these regions experienced a higher frequency of flash drought specifically there was a lower frequency of prfd in most areas of the western loess plateau and the southernmost part of the qinling mountains with foc less than 5 we calculated the flash drought intensity index eq 7 to characterize the magnitude of prfd and distinguish events with relatively slow development from events with the most rapid development the spatial distribution of the intensity of prfd was highly inconsistent with foc fig 4c obviously the most rapidly developing flash droughts occurred in most regions of the qinling mountains and in the westernmost and eastern parts of the loess plateau the average intensity was between 0 3 and 0 7 thus we can conclude that flash drought in the loess plateau combined high frequency with low intensity versus low frequency and high intensity in the qinling mountains 4 3 trend analysis for flash droughts to explore the interannual variability of flash drought we plotted the annual average anomaly series for frequency the pentads and the intensity of flash drought in the two study regions fig 5 in general these variables showed similar trends that is prfd has been observed with enhanced frequency longer pentads and higher intensity after the 1990 s than that before for example the average prfd intensity anomaly was 0 25 and 0 29 during the 1990 s in the loess plateau and qinling mountains respectively the highest prfd intensity occurred in 1999 on the loess plateau and in 2002 in the qinling mountains with average intensity anomaly values of 0 11 and 0 16 respectively fig 6 shows the results of the mann kendall trend analysis to detect the years when the prfd frequency pentads and intensity changed from 1981 to 2018 there were upward trends both on the loess plateau and in the qinling mountains for frequency pentads and intensity all flash drought variables statistically significant increasing trends the prfd pentads and intensity increased greatly with the change point in the 1990 s across both regions for example the series of average prfd intensity showed that a change year occurred in 1990 on the loess plateau with the average intensity differing by 0 048 between the pre and post change periods fig 6e similarly the trend changed in 1999 in the qinling mountains with an average intensity difference of 0 046 fig 6f for the frequency trend the change occurred in 2010 in the qinling mountains versus 1996 on the loess plateau 4 4 impact assessment of flash droughts we chose the 1982 flash drought event to explore whether and how flash drought behavior affected vegetation physiology the change processes of several vegetation related indices are investigated from one pentad prior to onset t 1 to two pentad post onset t 2 of prfd based on the onset of prfd in 1982 we selected the corresponding 10 day data and 8 day data for ndvi and gpp respectively fig 7a shows that the most rapidly developing flash droughts are presented across the eastern part of the loess plateau and the western qinling mountains overall these flash drought areas were captured well by et and root zone sm anomalies fig 7b however there were differences in spatial extent and magnitude especially in the loess plateau negative et anomalies covered most areas where prfd tended to occur but only appeared at the onset of flash drought in the qinling mountains fig 7b the major differences in the evolution over time were located in the southwestern part of the loess plateau and the western qinling mountains with the et anomaly decreasing below 0 5 mm day thus these decreasing trends responded to a short period of record dryness for any climate based type of flash drought high temperature increases et and rapidly decreases sm and a precipitation deficit also increases sm deficits zhang et al 2017 we investigated the evolution of root zone sm which plays a dominant and direct role in determining vegetation growth the results show that spatial pattern of negative root zone sm anomalies was consistent with most of the areas where prfd occurs in addition these anomalies tended to increase on average after the onset of flash drought onset across most of the loess plateau which was mainly preceded by decreasing et according to prfd results early june 1982 denotes the onset period for most flash drought events 50 the negative ndvi anomalies were generally consistent with the spatial pattern of prfd which indicates that flash drought significantly decreases ndvi for example with the worst drought conditions in the eastern part of the loess plateau and the western qinling mountains drought in these areas was captured well by rapidly decreasing ndvi anomalies in early june and early july ndvi anomalies generally 0 15 from fig 7 b the negative of gpp anomalies follow the same spatial pattern as that of the prfd occurrence along with the flash drought evolved in turn induce an accompanying reduction in spatial correlation between them 0 3 0 22 0 22 and 0 07 in most regions with high prfd intensity the changes of corresponding gpp anomalies were lower than 2 and the greatest response in gpp was mainly found in the west of the boundary of the loess plateau and qinling mountains 5 discussion 5 1 methods to identify flash droughts flash drought is a kind of drought that occurs during the growing season it is characterized by extreme weather conditions and severe sm deficits jiao et al 2021 mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 based on the different physical mechanisms used in previous studies high temperatures and water deficits are the main climatic conditions that drive flash droughts these conditions define two types of flash drought hwfd and pdfd with typical spatial patterns they are more likely to occur in southern and northern china wang and yuan 2018 where the moisture supply is relatively sufficient or in a deficit condition respectively this agrees with our results in which hwfd occurred most often in the relatively humid qinling mountains but pdfd occurred mostly in the arid loess plateau fig 3a and b in contrast with previous research that identified flash drought based on its duration other research has instead drawn attention to the unusually dramatic rate of development of an sm deficit and increase of the et ratio nguyen et al 2021 although these methods specify the threshold for the corresponding variables that are used to identify the onset of flash drought this approach only indicates dryer conditions that may not represent a true drought event these methodologies also only proposed a flash drought framework based on a single variable and ignored the concurrent effect of two or more variables recently researchers have begun to focus on the interactions among multiple driving factors hu et al 2021 to account for this new multi variable approach and the connections among the variables we explored the spatial characteristics and temporal trends of flash drought across different climate water regions furthermore the certain pertinence relations between these driving factors may have existed in statistical analysis namely these variables reflect overlapping drought information we used pca to reduce the overlapped parts as many as possible a new variable set with uncorrelated principal components avena et al 1999 eastman and fulk 1993 as an effective tool for reducing the dimensions of analysis pca is used to extract the principal components from temperature precipitation and sm the resulting new variables eliminated much of the redundancy and retained more original information that reflected drought information in our analysis the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 accounted for more than 83 of the variance in the drought information which means that the temperature anomalies precipitation anomalies and sm anomalies that drive the rapid onset of flash drought were well accounted given that global precipitation is projected to remain steady the changing vpd is known to be a critical constraint on plant functioning in terrestrial biomes grossiord et al 2020 yuan et al 2019a increasing vpd decreases photosynthesis and growth leads to higher risks of hydraulic failure and carbon starvation and can lead to drought induced mortality babst et al 2019 novick et al 2016 williams et al 2013 in this study we applied vpd with simultaneous use of pc1 and pc2 in the regression model for flash drought identification however no objective criteria are currently available given the uncertainties in defining the concept of flash drought and the scarcity of data based on such a definition otkin et al 2018 our approach was based on three specific thresholds that reflect the development phases that define a flash drought these criteria emphasize drought events that can generate anomalously high or low stress conditions under a business as usual scenario because methodological approaches must be focused on the velocity of drought onset as the main differentiating these from other drought events characterized by slower processes noguera et al 2020 fig 3c shows that hwfd and pdfd which focus only on temperature and precipitation respectively show high spatial heterogeneity in flash drought incidence in contrast our new method accounts for the rapid onset and consistency across pentads rather than relying on a single pentad at the beginning of the flash drought compared with the pmdi based flash drought prfd previous methods could improperly detect events with a duration shorter than four weeks because hwfd or pdfd may have occurred during the recovery phase when sm begins to increase again liu et al 2020 wang and yuan 2018 prfd integrates multiple related variables temperature precipitation and sm and is therefore more suitable for improving our ability to identify flash droughts across a range of geographic and climatic conditions thus our approach represents an improvement on previous effects to identify flash droughts 5 2 spatial and temporal characteristics of flash drought and risk evaluation as we mentioned earlier flash drought is characterized by excessive atmospheric water demand accompanied by a rapid change in water availability hobbins et al 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 the spatial patterns of foc revealed that our prfd results differed slightly from a previous approach based on a modified rate of intensification of sm deficits in the yellow river basin liu et al 2020 which included most areas of the loess plateau both studies revealed higher foc in the southeastern and central parts of the loess plateau but with low intensity 0 3 fig 4 semi humid regions such as the weihe plain baoji xi an etc show greater susceptibility to flash drought due to the large areas of rainfed crops with risk exacerbated by climate anomalies that are occurring due to global change this spatial pattern has resulted mainly from rapidly drying soils caused by increasing et which is driven in turn by higher temperatures in humid and semi humid regions conversely whether rising temperatures cause et to increase or decrease is uncertain because drought conditions usually inhibit et in arid and semi arid regions yuan et al 2019b furthermore our results show clear trends of increasing flash droughts which is consistent with the trend of global warming aghakouchak et al 2014 along with rising temperatures on a global scale heat waves are often but not always accompanied by drought so the susceptibility of plants to damage from flash drought is exacerbated grossiord et al 2020 in this context the future variability of hydrometeorological variables such as precipitation temperature and sm at short time scales are being investigated in detail yuan et al 2019b developed a land surface model to project future exposure to flash drought and projected that the severity and frequency of flash drought risk would increase significantly during the middle and end of the 21st century especially in southern china where the problem is exacerbated by population growth wang et al 2016a investigated the long term trends and variability of flash droughts and found similar results as mentioned above that is the trend of accelerated drying decreasing sm in southern china is mainly due to a combination of decreasing precipitation caused by decadal scale climate variability and anthropogenic aerosols wang et al 2016b another reason might be the increasing atmospheric water demand and et under heat wave conditions zhang et al 2021 found that ipcc data indicated that global warming will continue in the 21st century our study also suggests significant increases in the frequency and intensity of flash drought based on concurrent development of water and heat anomalies in the qinling mountains at the border between northern and southern china this scenario of rapid and increasing anomalies could be strengthened leading to a growing need for drought early warning in the coming decades 5 3 effects of flash drought on vegetation dynamics we also examined the evolution of several vegetation related indicators in response to flash drought including two satellite based indicators ndvi and gpp and one reanalysis dataset et fig 8a shows that flash drought events could be divided into five prfd intensity categories for the 1982 drought event with the threshold percentile interval from 0 to 20 in the present study we selected a prfd intensity greater than the 60th percentile to analyze the variation of vegetation anomalies which were mainly scattered in the eastern part of the loess plateau and western and the central parts of the qinling mountains these regions were mostly associated with grassland forest and shrubwood with relatively little drought in sandy land fig 8b based on the temporal evolution of prfd et anomalies showed considerable differences in adjacent pentads between the two regions fig 9 the et anomalies fig 9a show a pattern of rising et on the loess plateau starting at time t followed by a subsequent reduction as flash drought developed in contrast in the qinling mountains the minimum anomaly occurs at t and then increases similar patterns are observed when the prfd intensity increases to 80 100 fig 9b stomatal regulation is directly responsible for controlling leaf level et but no consensus exists on the mechanisms and processes of stomatal responses to hydrometeorological stresses grossiord et al 2020 earlier work showed that et rates tend to increase with high vpd up to a point after which et either remains high or starts decreasing franks et al 1997 this is why et had a higher anomaly at time t on the loess plateau with et gradually decreasing thereafter the different patterns of et response to flash drought between the two study areas are likely caused by differences in the plant species fig 8b and physiological mechanisms by which stomatal behavior responds to flash drought deserve further attention in future research ndvi was dominated by negative anomalies across the loess plateau and reached its minimum value in early june during which most of the flash droughts in this period occurred fig 9c and d in the qinling mountains the minimum ndvi anomalies occurred in late july when ndvi was significantly lower than in the other months these response patterns of ndvi to flash drought can be chiefly associated with the vegetation types and drought resistance on the loess plateau grassland is the major vegetation type fig 8b and shallow roots of the grass limit their ability to draw water from deeper soil layers when a precipitation deficit occurs liu et al 2019 however the vegetation of the qinling mountains is mainly composed of forest i e deep rooted trees and grassland i e sparse forest with large grassy areas which have higher resistance to hydrometeorological stresses due to the accumulation of dead branches and fallen leaves porous woodland soil and deep roots system wang et al 2021 as a result ndvi on the loess plateau seems to respond immediately to flash drought events whereas there is an approximately 1 month lag in the qinling mountains on the other hand chen et al 2021 demonstrated that the occurrence of flash drought was not significantly affected by vegetation physiological activity however their vegetation sensitivity experiments suggest that vegetation greening can dramatically increase the frequency of flash drought through increased et therefore the implementation of extensive grain for green project has exacerbated the flash drought risk in the loess plateau and qinling mountains since this project involved widespread afforestation that would have led to increased et as the trees grew apart from the response of vegetation structure it should be noted that vegetation physiology also reacts to flash drought figs 9e and 9f show that gpp depressions that are unrelated to flash drought occurred in the pre drought period which occurred mainly in the qinling mountains because our definition holds that flash drought is a subset of ordinary drought the climate and water conditions have already changed before flash drought occurred along with its direct impact on susceptible plants gpp will respond immediately to this environmental change this finding confirmed the conclusion of schwarz et al 2020 that is the differences in climate conditions prevailing in the pre and post drought period should take into account as even moderate dryness might leave vegetation vulnerable 6 conclusions in this study we developed a new integrated method for identifying flash drought based on multiple variables temperature precipitation and sm that permits identification of the onset time duration and intensity of flash drought events across a range of sites with different climate water conditions our method emphasizes the rapid rate of pmdi intensification during pentad to pentad changes then considers the atmospheric water demand by developing a regression model in which the final variables are selected by pca and finally evaluates the impact of flash drought on vegetation dynamics this new approach lets us identify the types of flash drought i e hwfd vs pdfd by assigning different weights to the variables included in the model different physical mechanisms govern the evolution of sm anomalies during adjacent pentads of the onset and development of flash drought by comparing our new model with previous models hwfd and pdfd we found that the older models were affected by unreasonable thresholds that limited their ability to capture continuous variation over time as a result our proposed new framework can better guarantee that all of the identified events truly represent flash droughts by focusing on the rapid intensification of the drought and subsequent consistent changes our foc and intensity analysis revealed a high frequency and low intensity of flash drought in the loess plateau but low frequency and high intensity in the qinling mountains our method identified prfd with greater frequency longer pentads and stronger intensity after the 1990 s from an ecological perspective the observed negative anomalies for et root zone sm and ndvi were generally consistent with the spatial pattern of prfd which confirmed that flash drought had an obvious influence on plant growth the vegetation response to flash drought displayed regional differences during flash drought ndvi on the loess plateau responded immediately to flash drought versus an approximately 1 month lag time in the qinling mountains prfd comprehensively considered multiple sources of drought information that are of interest to agricultural managers thereby providing an approach with high spatial and temporal resolutions based on an enhanced definition of flash drought because of the flexible weight assignment method the method also has strong potential to improve the predictability of early warning for seasonal drought findings

9581,in arid regions water resources are under immense pressure and multiple stresses excessive use of water resources without proper management occurs in the present situation and it will be intensified under future climate change conditions finding a good strategy for water resources management is essential to preserve sustainability in such watersheds in this study the first purpose is to optimize water use for the agricultural crops in the eshtehard watershed in iran where the aquifer is a strategic resource for irrigated agriculture and is facing intensive drawdown because of over extraction a hydro agronomic simulation optimization approach is used for agronomy and groundwater management in which the agricultural production and water level variation are simulated by linking swat and modflow and the optimal crops pattern is searched for by the pso algorithm the crops area and their irrigation water consumption are the decision variables with the objective of maximizing the net benefit gained from the crops yield while the groundwater drawdown is limited to a pre defined stability level for the following purpose the climate change impact on the optimal crop pattern across the watershed under two representative concentration pathways scenarios rcps 2 6 and 8 5 downscaled by the data of the hadgem2 es general circulation model for the near future is evaluated results show that irreparable damage to groundwater depletion is reduced in the optimum state and lower stress is imposed on the aquifer under the climate change impacts by executing the optimum crop pattern to see this a part of the winter wheat and cotton crops area must be replaced by winter barley also the crop s irrigation amount must be decreased for winter wheat winter barley and cotton by 45 7 and 10 respectively which reduces groundwater extraction in the optimum situation keywords watershed management crop pattern planning groundwater stability climate change impact hydro agronomic modeling 1 introduction a complete understanding of a watershed surface and groundwater resources tradeoff is required for robust water resources management the interaction of surface and groundwater resources is also deemed one of the challenges in modeling tasks it has a particular importance especially in semi arid regions where the management or use often will influence the availability and the quantity or quality of the other bailey et al 2016 during the low seasons and dry years groundwater over derivation decreases water table height due to the long time groundwater rehabilitation cycle the missing groundwater will not be able to be replaced for reuse soon and the phenomenon of land subsidence may occur in which the un usability of the agricultural lands is one of its consequences therefore understanding the groundwater system behavior is essential especially in water limited and under pressures of global climate change efficiency environments singh 2014a due to the ever increasing world population and the uncertainties of climate variability water demands and socio economic and environmental effects using limited water and developing optimal usage is necessary for water management in order to avoid the high computational cost the hydrological simulation with no detailed description of surface groundwater interactions is used in most of the researches in a complex water resources network wherein both surface and groundwater resources are managed conjunctively the hydrological models with the physically based distribution can quantify water availability under current and future conditions and decision makers can determine appropriate integrated water management policies in the last decade the development of the distributed watershed hydrological models improved the coupled surface groundwater models simulation accuracy some models have been linked to developing a comprehensive and coherent understanding of conjunctive management of surface and groundwater cycle as well such as modsim modflow fredericks et al 1998 hspf modflow ross et al 2005 parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 cathy weill et al 2011 gsflow wu et al 2015 and weap modflow čerkasova et al 2018 like a recent one the swatmod model combines the swat and modflow aliyari et al 2019 guzman et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 optimizing the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater with simulation optimization approaches have chosen to evaluate a couple of hydrologic or hydro agronomic modeling in water resources and agricultural water management in many researches singh 2014b such as determining optimal locations and pumping rates in coastal aquifers to avoid saltwater intrusion mantoglou and papantoniou 2008 control the non point agricultural pollution tan et al 2011 applying different irrigation water management issues to improve crop productivity singh and panda 2013 changing the schedule of the irrigation plan and then reducing evapotranspiration under the optimal conditions to improve groundwater management which can save water resources wu et al 2015 increasing the possibility of sustainability in the aquifer by applying optimization on groundwater abstraction kamali and niksokhan 2017 sustaining a balance between surface water and groundwater withdrawal in wet and dry areas by optimizing the water demand coverage zeinali et al 2020 coordinating optimal irrigation water allocation for different hydrological years under consideration of crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation gong et al 2020 applying sustainable water management strategies for environmental and agricultural water demand conjunctively dehghanipour et al 2020 and finding optimal pumping schedules for pumping wells with and without restrictions on stream flow depletion kerebih and keshari 2021 the meta heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization and shuffled complex evolution require no derivative calculation and are more promising for finding global optima in the non linear space of problems aliyari et al 2019 some researches focused on the effects of climate change on surface water and groundwater like on the recharge variation vaccaro 1992 water availability water stresses and water demand abbaspour et al 2009 crop yield changes xiao et al 2010 both confined and unconfined groundwater behavior by coupled aquifer land surface atmosphere model riasat et al 2012 groundwater resiliency shrestha et al 2020 and on the cyclic and non cyclic conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water resources adaptation to evaluate water supply plans for future groundwater sustainability and water availability in the agriculture sector afshar et al 2021 according to previous studies simulating the water quantity and quality along with simulating climate change scenarios and management practices need comprehensive and multifaceted approaches in hydrological modeling in previous researches the effect of climate change on the interaction of the surface and groundwater resources has been rarely studied with the help of an optimization process also the impact of optimum management scenarios in the near future of a watershed is not studied specifically which could be named as the novelty of the present research in this regard the first purpose of the present study is to analyze the spatio temporal variability of agronomy and groundwater interaction then the aquifer s behavior has been assessed based on groundwater abstraction and crop pattern management for water saving for this purpose a holistic model is needed to simulate surface flow agricultural management groundwater abstraction and water table height variation with meteorological variables with appropriate accuracy based on reviewed studies the swat and modflow models are chosen respectively for surface and groundwater simulation because of their ability to calculate the significant variables required for conjunctive water resources management the swat modflow linked model proposed by bailey et al 2016 is not used in this research because the model focuses on auto irrigation forms in the swat model so the separate models have been used to simulate irrigation and crops yield and groundwater variation and they are linked through coding in matlab environment the pso algorithm is used for the optimization process it is coupled with the swat modflow model to obtain the optimum crops pattern in the eshtehard watershed in the center of iran the second purpose of the study is to assess the impact of climate change on the watershed s water resources and agricultural production to achieve this goal the linked model is used to investigate the global climate change effect on the crops yield and groundwater resources with the most optimistic and pessimistic scenarios the scenarios are generated by the general circulation models gcms the impact of climate change on the optimum crop pattern agricultural production and aquifer storage is assessed and the results are discussed 2 case study the eshtehard watershed with an area of 245 square kilometers is located in the namak lake basin in iran in this area only the shoor river flows from west to east containing salty water and makes it unsuitable for drinking and farming purposes the location of the eshtehard watershed is shown in fig 1 the watershed inflow is about 34 5 million cubic meters per year mcm year asefodoleh hydrometric station is located at the outflow point of the watershed which is considered the basin s outflow the average long term discharge at this station is 0 732 m3 s equivalent to 25 mcm yr the mean annual temperature in the watershed is 14 c and the annual precipitation is 214 8 mm the data are extracted from the eshtehard basin s water budget studies report ministry of energy of iran 2014 the most dominant land use categories in the watershed are grassland and pasture 58 agriculture 24 barren or sparsely vegetated 16 and urban 2 the major irrigated crops are winter wheat winter barley and cotton almost the total water consumption in the eshtehard watershed is supplied by the groundwater resource used 1 for drinking 2 for industry and 97 for agriculture purposes because of the groundwater withdrawal s impact on the crop s irrigation and the irrigation s return flow on the groundwater recharge a qualified package is required for simulating surface and groundwater hydrology and their interaction in the watershed for this purpose swat and modflow are used due to spatial surface and groundwater resources variation it is needed to geo locate the swat model sub basins and hydrologic response units hru to the modflow grid cells and construct a linkage between these packages 3 methods and materials 3 1 crops yield simulation model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a process based watershed scale model that uses semi distributed parameters in the continuous time hydrologic model during the watershed simulation the model predicts land management operation s sensation on water sediment and nutrient yields the swat system is linked to a geographical information system gis to merge multiple spatial environmental data the swat model of the eshtehard watershed is constructed from the digital elevation map dem with 30 m cell size the topographic data slope and drainage network land use soil type meteorological data minimum and maximum temperature precipitation relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed groundwater data and crop cultivation management data plants growing season irrigation fertilizers and pesticide application harvest and kill growing season and tillage these data for three major irrigated crops of winter wheat wwht winter barley wbar and cotton cotp are extracted from the approved reports by the national authorities and are entered into the model in fig 1 the layer of land uses in the watershed used in the swat model are presented the watershed is divided into 21 sub basins subdivided into 167 hydrologic units in the model called hydrological response units hru each hru consists of uniform land use soil type and slope class hrus can be spatially disconnected and do not have a designated geographic location wei et al 2018 and the calculations are scaled up to the sub basin outlet by the percent area of the hrus within the sub basin swat response variables for groundwater and surface water interaction such as a groundwater discharge to streams or river seepage to the aquifer are available only at the sub basin level furthermore groundwater storage indexes such as water table elevation are not geographically located bailey et al 2016 in this study the surface runoff discharge and deep aquifer recharge estimation are two primary goals for swat s calibration to ensure the accuracy of modflow inputs because of agricultural lands and irrigated crops existing in the eshtehard watershed an acceptable estimation of crop yield is the next goal in swat s calibration procedure swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 is used for model calibration and validation which is capable of providing multiple model evaluation statistical criteria as an objective function melaku and wang 2019 initially the ranges of sensitive parameters are defined for calibration the swat model is calibrated for 16 years with a three year warm up period for preparing proper initial conditions and is validated for three years the monthly records are used for discharge calibration and the yearly records are used for crops yield 3 2 groundwater simulation model the u s geological survey usgs has developed modflow as a public domain numerical groundwater modeling code mcdonald and harbaugh 2003 modflow is supported in gms groundwater modeling system which is a comprehensive graphical user environment for performing groundwater simulations in this study the model is solved in both steady and unsteady states with the geometric multi grid solver implemented using recharge well river and general head boundary packages the topography data bedrock elevation starting gw head 210 pumping wells 10 for drinking 43 for industrial and 157 for agricultural water use and 13 observation wells that are showed in fig 4a are extracted from the eshtehard basin s water budget studies report ministry of energy of iran 2014 in the gms modflow model the aquifer is divided into 600 grid cells with 20 rows 30 columns and aquifer properties assumed to be uniform within each cell the study area is divided into several polygons according to swat sub basins for the hydraulic conductivity and recharge zones for each part the average recharge value computed in the sub basins is assigned to the modflow grid cells fig 2 with the help of the recharge package this value contains precipitation return flow of agricultural irrigation and river infiltration the trial and error method is used to adjust the model parameters like k hydraulic conductivity and recharge amounts until the simulated groundwater level corresponds reasonably with the observed ones the fixed parameters is chosen to achieve the best results and more successful linkage with minimized error in the calibration process 3 3 particle swarm optimization algorithm particle swarm optimization pso is a population based algorithm introduced by kennedy and eberhart 1995 in pso each particle tries to improve its location using the data of the best personal position pbest i and the best global position gbest t found by the whole swarm the step size and position of each particle is updated by 1 v i t 1 w v i t c 1 r 1 t pbest i x i t c 2 r 2 t gbest t x i t 2 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where i is the population number w is the inertia weight that controls the convergence of pso r 1 and r 2 are uniform random numbers in the range of 0 1 that control the diversity of the search the acceleration coefficients of c 1 and c 2 take a fixed value that stabilizes the effect of pbest i and gbest t x i t is the current position of particle i in the t th iteration and v i t is the velocity step size for particle i in this study 20 particles are considered and the values of 2 5 1 5 and 0 98 are defined for c 1 c 2 and ω respectively also the function stretching technique is performed for the avoidance of premature convergence according to previous studies sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 3 4 climate change impacts assessment climate change affects groundwater resources by changing the recharge rate and time and decreasing increasing groundwater levels shrestha et al 2016 the precipitation and temperature data in the swat model are varied based on the projected values then computed recharge is entered into the gms modflow model to assess the climate change impact on the eshtehard aquifer this process is applied for the present situation and the optimum situation to assess the effect of optimized crop pattern in the future of watershed situation instead of continuing the present condition the future condition of climatic variables can be predicted by the global database of five general circulation models gcms of gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem noresm1 m from isi mip inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project these data are included in ar5 ipcc fifth assessment reports under representative concentration pathways rcps scenarios that vary based on radiative forcing these scenarios mainly focus on providing the concentration of greenhouse gases and radiative forcing according to time passage overall there are four rcps scenarios of rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 that the primary goal is to identify future uncertainties without predicting them shrestha et al 2020 the outputs from rcp scenarios are still not sure due to uncertainty in the future greenhouse gas emissions there are some uncertainty and a wide range in the projection of future climate trends however gcms provide reasonable approximations of present and past climates which are still helpful in estimating future climatic conditions shrestha et al 2016 in this study two optimistic and pessimistic scenarios of rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 generated by hadgem2 es hadley global environment model 2 earth system are used to derive the climatic variables for the eshtehard watershed in the near future of 2021 2040 3 4 1 climate change toolkit cct the cct program ashraf vaghefi et al 2017 is a climate change toolkit to analyze and recognize patterns for extreme weather conditions it is used to extract downscale bias correct and interpolate the data obtained from global gcms the climate models often provide biased representations of observed times series systematic model errors are caused by imperfect conceptualization discretization and spatial averaging within grid cells the historical data are used for gcm data bias correction one at a time for precipitation tmax and tmin the additive method is used for temperature eq 3 and the ratio method is used for precipitation eq 4 3 t corrected ij t gcm ij t observed jk t gcm jk 4 p corrected ij p gcm ij p observed jk p gcm jk where t and p are the temperature c and precipitation mm day t and p are the long term average temperature and precipitation and i j k are day month and year counters respectively 3 5 swat modflow and pso linkage process at first the swat modflow linked package must be calibrated to ensure proper performance for integrated surface water and groundwater simulation for this purpose values for the groundwater parameters in swat that provided a discharge s nash sutcliff index upper than 0 6 are defined to generate groundwater recharge values used as the modflow inputs then the pest tool in modflow is then used to determine the best value for hydraulic conductivity and minimize the error between observed and simulated groundwater levels in the steady state finally the calibrated swat modflow model is verified for a set of data not used in the calibration stage then the swat modflow model is calibrated and run for the unsteady state the calibration process is shown in yellow boxes in fig 3 after preparing the swat and modflow models the optimization process starts with the pso algorithm at first the irrigated crops area and irrigation amounts are changed in swat input files considering that the total area of irrigated cultivation should not exceed the maximum available area and the crops areas can only convert to each other inside the swat model a feature called lup land use update is used for changing the land use this feature uses two files named lup dat and lupinput dat the lup dat file specifies the time that land s changes start in the lupinput dat file some coefficient values fractions are specified for each hru and the hru s area can be categorized by changing these coefficients the hrus are hydrological response units with the same characteristics soil type slope land use hru area is determined by multiplying the fraction by each sub basin area in which the hru is located changing the fraction of each hru with a specific land cover can change the crop s area a noteworthy point in applying changes to these coefficients fractions is that the sum of the fractions in each sub basin should remain equal to one to keep the total area constant in the optimization process the decision variables are the fraction values in irrigated hrus to change the cultivation pattern so that the sum of the fractions in each sub basin is equal to one in this way each hru has specific land use and by changing the fraction values its area in each sub basin changes then swat exe is executed to create output files to calculate the crops yield and the groundwater recharge discharge total irrigation volume is computed by summation of irrigation amounts used for crops production total irrigation and recharge volumes are replaced in the modflow input files as pumping extraction recharge rate respectively then modflow exe is executed to build output files for computing the groundwater level across the aquifer then the benefit gained by crops yield sale and the electricity cost of water extraction from wells is calculated to compute the objective function for the optimization procedure the pso algorithm also defines a constraint of stabilizing the groundwater level above a pre defined stability head according to this explanation the mathematical formulation of the problem is as follows 5 max f c 1 c a c y c p c 1 w ge h w γ w q w ep subject to 6 1 c a c a max 7 h w h w stab f is the objective function which is the net benefit gained from crops yield c is the number of crops a c is the crop s area ha in each year in the planning period y c is the crop s average yield in the unit of area ton ha in each year p c is the price of unit crop s yield ton w is the number of wells used for irrigation in the plain ge is the ground elevation m h w is the simulated groundwater level in each well m γ w is the water specific weight kn m3 q w is the pumping discharge from each well m3 ep is the unit electricity price kwh a max is the total available cultivable area in the plain ha and h w stab is the groundwater level defined for the stability of the aquifer in each well m the stability level for each well is considered equal to the average of the historical observed groundwater level in the surrounding piezometric wells in the region therefore this stability level is not so high that it tights the water extraction for crops irrigation and is not so low that it threatens the aquifer s sustainability the optimization process used in the pso swat modflow model is shown in the red boxes in fig 3 climate change scenarios are executed for both the present situation and optimum state models at first by using cct the gcm data are extracted for the watershed and are downscaled after data bias correction the future precipitation and temperature are entered into swat for both present state and optimum states then the impact of climate change on the crops yield and the groundwater resources are assessed for the coming years the climate change assessment process is shown in green boxes in fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 models calibration the swat model parameters sensitive to streamflow deep recharge and crop yield are found using swat cup similar to other studies in modeling irrigation wei et al 2018 these parameters are shown in table 1 the simulated vs observed discharge at the asefodoleh hydrometric station as the basin s outflow for the calibration period january 2000 to december 2015 and validation period january 2016 to december 2018 is shown in fig 4b the nash sutcliffe ns coefficient is obtained at 0 81 for calibration and 0 77 for validation also the r2 coefficient is 0 85 for calibration and 0 82 for validation the pest package is used for the calibration of modflow the calibration goal is to obtain the best values for hydraulic conductivity and specific yield parameters to adjust the simulated water level with the observed one in the piezometric wells pest adjusts model parameters to minimize the difference between observed and simulated groundwater head the head errors are obtained 0 014 0 632 and 0 755 for mean mean absolute and root mean square errors in the calibration phase and 0 156 0 767 and 0 901 respectively in the validation phase for the steady state for the unsteady state calibration the error values are obtained 0 370 1 015 and 1 309 respectively the diagrams of unsteady state head calibration for the observing wells are shown in fig 4 after calibration the hydraulic conductivity varied between 1 and 60 m d for the steady state and the specific yield varied between 0 15 and 0 85 for the unsteady state in the eshtehard aquifer 4 2 pso swat modflow results by running the optimization process optimal values for crops irrigation amount and crops area are obtained for wheat barley and cotton plants the goal is to maximize the net benefit of crops yield sales while preventing further groundwater drops from the stability head there are 59 decision variables in this study 20 19 and 17 decision variables are for winter wheat winter barley and cotton irrigation and three decision variables are for the areas of these three crops it took about 48 h to run the optimizer model for a system with intel r core tm i5 4210u cpu 1 70 ghz 2401 mhz 2 cores and 4 gb ram specifications according to fig 5 a the average annual irrigation amount for winter wheat has decreased by 45 in the optimum situation due to the 47 irrigation amount decrease in the spring and the high water requirement of the plant the water stress reduces the crop yield by 14 the average annual irrigation amount for winter barley has decreased by 7 in the optimum situation and the crop yield remained constant which can be said that the amount of irrigation in the present situation is 7 more than the plant s need fig 5 b the average annual irrigation amount for cotton has decreased by 10 in the optimum situation and the crop yield has increased by 7 5 which can be said that the amount of cotton irrigation in the present situation is 10 higher than the plant s need fig 5 c excess irrigation water has limited root growth and reduced the crop s yield and by optimizing the plant s water irrigation the crop s yield has increased in the optimum state fig 5 e shows that a part of winter wheat and cotton areas are replaced by winter barley after optimization the crop area decreased for winter wheat and cotton is 24 and 19 and the increase for barley is 49 winter wheat and cotton production benefit have decreased 35 and 13 respectively and for barley it has increased 49 resulting in an increase of 4 for the total agricultural production benefit this variation is shown in fig 6 according to fig 7 the aquifer level at the end of the operation period is 4 2 m lower than the first year in the present state while this drawdown has reached 2 5 m in the optimum state by reducing the groundwater extraction the groundwater level is 2 4 m higher than the present state at the end of the operation period in the optimum state according to the comparison of the average seasonal variations of the irrigation volume fig 8 a and aquifer recharge fig 8 b the irrigation amount is decreased in the optimum state especially in spring and summer as a result of optimized crop pattern planning this reduction in irrigation has resulted in the decrease of agricultural infiltration and therefore the groundwater recharge is decreased in the optimum state comparing the present situation in the watershed 4 3 effect of climate change scenarios by running climate change scenarios the temperature and precipitation values are predicted for the near future period of 2021 2040 and variations of these variables are shown in fig 9 a and 9 b comparison of the average annual precipitation in the climate change scenarios with the present situation shows a broader range of future precipitation variation as shown in fig 9 a also it is seen that in the first scenario s1 which is rcp 2 6 the predicted precipitations are higher than in the second scenario s2 which is rcp 8 5 this comparison for the temperature demonstrates warmer weather in rcp 8 5 as presented in fig 9 b the predicted precipitation and temperature are entered into the swat modflow model for both the present and optimum conditions so the impacts of climate change on the existing and optimum crop patterns are assessed in the following in the first stage the crop yield in all proposed scenarios is presented in fig 10 according to fig 10 by executing the climate change scenarios on the present pattern the average annual yield for winter wheat decreases in both s1 and s2 scenarios compared to the present situation for barley the average annual yield is almost the same as the present situation in s1 while decreasing in s2 also the crop s yield variation range is increased in both scenarios compared to the present situation indicating the yield s high sensitivity to water stress caused by future climate change for cotton the average annual yield and variation range in both s1 and s2 scenarios are decreased compared to the present situation it indicates that the crop s yield is sensitive to climate change impacts in the optimum crop pattern situation no noticeable change is occurred for wheat and barley crops yield in both s1 and s2 scenarios compared to the current situation projection in climate change conditions for cotton the average annual yield is almost the same in s1 and s2 scenarios but the crop s yield variation range is increased indicating the sensitivity of the cotton s yield to water stress caused by climate change which is because of the execution of the optimum irrigation in fig 11 variation of the groundwater table by the occurrence of the climate change scenarios in the present and optimum states is shown in the west of the eshtehard watershed due to climate change impact on the present crop situation the groundwater table has increased 4 9 and 4 1 m in scenarios s1 and s2 respectively relative to the present situation because of increased precipitation in this section of the plain by moving to the center of the plain the groundwater head has decreased to 13 8 and 14 1 m in scenarios s1 and s2 respectively because of decreased precipitation and continuation of the excessive agricultural water extraction from the aquifer in this region in the eastern region less water extraction occurs but the groundwater table has decreased due to the severe reduction in the amount of recharge caused by decreased precipitation as an impact of climate change on the other hand by execution of the optimum crop pattern in the watershed the groundwater would have different behavior in climate change scenarios and lower stress is imposed on basin water resources the aquifer head has increased to 4 3 and 4 1 m for scenarios s1 and s2 respectively in the west to the central regions of the plain in comparison to the present situation this raise is because of the reduction in agricultural water extraction due to the optimum crop pattern and irrigation this is a crucial point that must be noticed as the role of optimum crop pattern and irrigation in the sustainability of the water resources in the eastern region of the plain the water table has decreased 1 8 1 9 m relative to the present situation because of reduced precipitation in the climate change scenarios for further investigation on the results obtained by the pso swat modflow model variation of the recharge to the eshtehard aquifer in the present and optimum states and affected by climate change is shown in fig 12 because of the irrigation volume reduction in the optimum crop pattern state the return flow amount is decreased in this situation so the amount of groundwater recharge is decreased compared to the present situation however this case does not cause a further drop in groundwater level because groundwater abstraction has also decreased in this area fig 12 a by executing the climate change scenarios the same reason is given for the difference in the amount of groundwater recharge for the present situation and the optimal situation in scenario1 fig 12 b and scenario 2 fig 12 c also by comparing the present situation ps in fig 12 a with the effects of climate change on it for scenario s1 ps in fig 12 b the groundwater recharge is reduced in low precipitation regions located in the north and northeast of the aquifer it is increased in high precipitation zones located in the southwest of the aquifer because of variation in precipitation the same changes are evident in the comparison of the present situation ps in fig 12 a with the effects of climate change on it for scenario s2 ps in fig 12 c in scenario s1 fig 12 b the amounts of recharge to the aquifer are a bit higher than scenario s2 fig 12 c because of higher predicted precipitation for this condition 5 summary and conclusion this study assesses the effect of optimum crop patterns on groundwater resources also the impact of climate change on crop patterns and water consumption is evaluated this is achieved through a simulation optimization approach in which swat and modflow models are linked to simulate the agronomic and groundwater resources of the watershed then the swat modflow model is linked with the pso algorithm to find the optimum crop pattern and irrigation water allocation in the optimal crop pattern state the groundwater degradation is decreased by changing the irrigated crops area and reducing groundwater extraction for irrigation the results obtained by the pso swat modflow model give the best solution for maximizing the net benefit gained from crop yield while the groundwater table is not lowered below a pre defined stability head in the second part of the research the impact of climate change on the present and optimum crop pattern is assessed the results showed that the groundwater degradation is significantly reduced by executing the optimum crop pattern in the plain this is done by replacing a part of the winter wheat and cotton area with the winter barley which resulted in reducing the irrigation water consumption while the net benefit gained from the crops yield is maximized the obtained solutions show the proposed simulation optimization approach s ability to improve the conditions in irrigation based watersheds these results show that the present crop patterns and irrigation are inconsistent with the sustainable groundwater use goal gaining more net benefit besides more sustainability is possible by changing to the optimal pattern also in the optimized condition the effect of climate change on the future water resources is lower than the continuance of the present crop pattern declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9581,in arid regions water resources are under immense pressure and multiple stresses excessive use of water resources without proper management occurs in the present situation and it will be intensified under future climate change conditions finding a good strategy for water resources management is essential to preserve sustainability in such watersheds in this study the first purpose is to optimize water use for the agricultural crops in the eshtehard watershed in iran where the aquifer is a strategic resource for irrigated agriculture and is facing intensive drawdown because of over extraction a hydro agronomic simulation optimization approach is used for agronomy and groundwater management in which the agricultural production and water level variation are simulated by linking swat and modflow and the optimal crops pattern is searched for by the pso algorithm the crops area and their irrigation water consumption are the decision variables with the objective of maximizing the net benefit gained from the crops yield while the groundwater drawdown is limited to a pre defined stability level for the following purpose the climate change impact on the optimal crop pattern across the watershed under two representative concentration pathways scenarios rcps 2 6 and 8 5 downscaled by the data of the hadgem2 es general circulation model for the near future is evaluated results show that irreparable damage to groundwater depletion is reduced in the optimum state and lower stress is imposed on the aquifer under the climate change impacts by executing the optimum crop pattern to see this a part of the winter wheat and cotton crops area must be replaced by winter barley also the crop s irrigation amount must be decreased for winter wheat winter barley and cotton by 45 7 and 10 respectively which reduces groundwater extraction in the optimum situation keywords watershed management crop pattern planning groundwater stability climate change impact hydro agronomic modeling 1 introduction a complete understanding of a watershed surface and groundwater resources tradeoff is required for robust water resources management the interaction of surface and groundwater resources is also deemed one of the challenges in modeling tasks it has a particular importance especially in semi arid regions where the management or use often will influence the availability and the quantity or quality of the other bailey et al 2016 during the low seasons and dry years groundwater over derivation decreases water table height due to the long time groundwater rehabilitation cycle the missing groundwater will not be able to be replaced for reuse soon and the phenomenon of land subsidence may occur in which the un usability of the agricultural lands is one of its consequences therefore understanding the groundwater system behavior is essential especially in water limited and under pressures of global climate change efficiency environments singh 2014a due to the ever increasing world population and the uncertainties of climate variability water demands and socio economic and environmental effects using limited water and developing optimal usage is necessary for water management in order to avoid the high computational cost the hydrological simulation with no detailed description of surface groundwater interactions is used in most of the researches in a complex water resources network wherein both surface and groundwater resources are managed conjunctively the hydrological models with the physically based distribution can quantify water availability under current and future conditions and decision makers can determine appropriate integrated water management policies in the last decade the development of the distributed watershed hydrological models improved the coupled surface groundwater models simulation accuracy some models have been linked to developing a comprehensive and coherent understanding of conjunctive management of surface and groundwater cycle as well such as modsim modflow fredericks et al 1998 hspf modflow ross et al 2005 parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 cathy weill et al 2011 gsflow wu et al 2015 and weap modflow čerkasova et al 2018 like a recent one the swatmod model combines the swat and modflow aliyari et al 2019 guzman et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 optimizing the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater with simulation optimization approaches have chosen to evaluate a couple of hydrologic or hydro agronomic modeling in water resources and agricultural water management in many researches singh 2014b such as determining optimal locations and pumping rates in coastal aquifers to avoid saltwater intrusion mantoglou and papantoniou 2008 control the non point agricultural

restrictions on stream flow depletion kerebih and keshari 2021 the meta heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization and shuffled complex evolution require no derivative calculation and are more promising for finding global optima in the non linear space of problems aliyari et al 2019 some researches focused on the effects of climate change on surface water and groundwater like on the recharge variation vaccaro 1992 water availability water stresses and water demand abbaspour et al 2009 crop yield changes xiao et al 2010 both confined and unconfined groundwater behavior by coupled aquifer land surface atmosphere model riasat et al 2012 groundwater resiliency shrestha et al 2020 and on the cyclic and non cyclic conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water resources adaptation to evaluate water supply plans for future groundwater sustainability and water availability in the agriculture sector afshar et al 2021 according to previous studies simulating the water quantity and quality along with simulating climate change scenarios and management practices need comprehensive and multifaceted approaches in hydrological modeling in previous researches the effect of climate change on the interaction of the surface and groundwater resources has been rarely studied with the help of an optimization process also the impact of optimum management scenarios in the near future of a watershed is not studied specifically which could be named as the novelty of the present research in this regard the first purpose of the present study is to analyze the spatio temporal variability of agronomy and groundwater interaction then the aquifer s behavior has been assessed based on groundwater abstraction and crop pattern management for water saving for this purpose a holistic model is needed to simulate surface flow agricultural management groundwater abstraction and water table height variation with meteorological variables with appropriate accuracy based on reviewed studies the swat and modflow models are chosen respectively for surface and groundwater simulation because of their ability to calculate the significant variables required for conjunctive water resources management the swat modflow linked model proposed by bailey et al 2016 is not used in this research because the model focuses on auto irrigation forms in the swat model so the separate models have been used to simulate irrigation and crops yield and groundwater variation and they are linked through coding in matlab environment the pso algorithm is used for the optimization process it is coupled with the swat modflow model to obtain the optimum crops pattern in the eshtehard watershed in the center of iran the second purpose of the study is to assess the impact of climate change on the watershed s water resources and agricultural production to achieve this goal the linked model is used to investigate the global climate change effect on the crops yield and groundwater resources with the most optimistic and pessimistic scenarios the scenarios are generated by the general circulation models gcms the impact of climate change on the optimum crop pattern agricultural production and aquifer storage is assessed and the results are discussed 2 case study the eshtehard watershed with an area of 245 square kilometers is located in the namak lake basin in iran in this area only the shoor river flows from west to east containing salty water and makes it unsuitable for drinking and farming purposes the location of the eshtehard watershed is shown in fig 1 the watershed inflow is about 34 5 million cubic meters per year mcm year asefodoleh hydrometric station is located at the outflow point of the watershed which is considered the basin s outflow the average long term discharge at this station is 0 732 m3 s equivalent to 25 mcm yr the mean annual temperature in the watershed is 14 c and the annual precipitation is 214 8 mm the data are extracted from the eshtehard basin s water budget studies report ministry of energy of iran 2014 the most dominant land use categories in the watershed are grassland and pasture 58 agriculture 24 barren or sparsely vegetated 16 and urban 2 the major irrigated crops are winter wheat winter barley and cotton almost the total water consumption in the eshtehard watershed is supplied by the groundwater resource used 1 for drinking 2 for industry and 97 for agriculture purposes because of the groundwater withdrawal s impact on the crop s irrigation and the irrigation s return flow on the groundwater recharge a qualified package is required for simulating surface and groundwater hydrology and their interaction in the watershed for this purpose swat and modflow are used due to spatial surface and groundwater resources variation it is needed to geo locate the swat model sub basins and hydrologic response units hru to the modflow grid cells and construct a linkage between these packages 3 methods and materials 3 1 crops yield simulation model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a process based watershed scale model that uses semi distributed parameters in the continuous time hydrologic model during the watershed simulation the model predicts land management operation s sensation on water sediment and nutrient yields the swat system is linked to a geographical information system gis to merge multiple spatial environmental data the swat model of the eshtehard watershed is constructed from the digital elevation map dem with 30 m cell size the topographic data slope and drainage network land use soil type meteorological data minimum and maximum temperature precipitation relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed groundwater data and crop cultivation management data plants growing season irrigation fertilizers and pesticide application harvest and kill growing season and tillage these data for three major irrigated crops of winter wheat wwht winter barley wbar and cotton cotp are extracted from the approved reports by the national authorities and are entered into the model in fig 1 the layer of land uses in the watershed used in the swat model are presented the watershed is divided into 21 sub basins subdivided into 167 hydrologic units in the model called hydrological response units hru each hru consists of uniform land use soil type and slope class hrus can be spatially disconnected and do not have a designated geographic location wei et al 2018 and the calculations are scaled up to the sub basin outlet by the percent area of the hrus within the sub basin swat response variables for groundwater and surface water interaction such as a groundwater discharge to streams or river seepage to the aquifer are available only at the sub basin level furthermore groundwater storage indexes such as water table elevation are not geographically located bailey et al 2016 in this study the surface runoff discharge and deep aquifer recharge estimation are two primary goals for swat s calibration to ensure the accuracy of modflow inputs because of agricultural lands and irrigated crops existing in the eshtehard watershed an acceptable estimation of crop yield is the next goal in swat s calibration procedure swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 is used for model calibration and validation which is capable of providing multiple model evaluation statistical criteria as an objective function melaku and wang 2019 initially the ranges of sensitive parameters are defined for calibration the swat model is calibrated for 16 years with a three year warm up period for preparing proper initial conditions and is validated for three years the monthly records are used for discharge calibration and the yearly records are used for crops yield 3 2 groundwater simulation model the u s geological survey usgs has developed modflow as a public domain numerical groundwater modeling code mcdonald and harbaugh 2003 modflow is supported in gms groundwater modeling system which is a comprehensive graphical user environment for performing groundwater simulations in this study the model is solved in both steady and unsteady states with the geometric multi grid solver implemented using recharge well river and general head boundary packages the topography data bedrock elevation starting gw head 210 pumping wells 10 for drinking 43 for industrial and 157 for agricultural water use and 13 observation wells that are showed in fig 4a are extracted from the eshtehard basin s water budget studies report ministry of energy of iran 2014 in the gms modflow model the aquifer is divided into 600 grid cells with 20 rows 30 columns and aquifer properties assumed to be uniform within each cell the study area is divided into several polygons according to swat sub basins for the hydraulic conductivity and recharge zones for each part the average recharge value computed in the sub basins is assigned to the modflow grid cells fig 2 with the help of the recharge package this value contains precipitation return flow of agricultural irrigation and river infiltration the trial and error method is used to adjust the model parameters like k hydraulic conductivity and recharge amounts until the simulated groundwater level corresponds reasonably with the observed ones the fixed parameters is chosen to achieve the best results and more successful linkage with minimized error in the calibration process 3 3 particle swarm optimization algorithm particle swarm optimization pso is a population based algorithm introduced by kennedy and eberhart 1995 in pso each particle tries to improve its location using the data of the best personal position pbest i and the best global position gbest t found by the whole swarm the step size and position of each particle is updated by 1 v i t 1 w v i t c 1 r 1 t pbest i x i t c 2 r 2 t gbest t x i t 2 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where i is the population number w is the inertia weight that controls the convergence of pso r 1 and r 2 are uniform random numbers in the range of 0 1 that control the diversity of the search the acceleration coefficients of c 1 and c 2 take a fixed value that stabilizes the effect of pbest i and gbest t x i t is the current position of particle i in the t th iteration and v i t is the velocity step size for particle i in this study 20 particles are considered and the values of 2 5 1 5 and 0 98 are defined for c 1 c 2 and ω respectively also the function stretching technique is performed for the avoidance of premature convergence according to previous studies sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 3 4 climate change impacts assessment climate change affects groundwater resources by changing the recharge rate and time and decreasing increasing groundwater levels shrestha et al 2016 the precipitation and temperature data in the swat model are varied based on the projected values then computed recharge is entered into the gms modflow model to assess the climate change impact on the eshtehard aquifer this process is applied for the present situation and the optimum situation to assess the effect of optimized crop pattern in the future of watershed situation instead of continuing the present condition the future condition of climatic variables can be predicted by the global database of five general circulation models gcms of gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem noresm1 m from isi mip inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project these data are included in ar5 ipcc fifth assessment reports under representative concentration pathways rcps scenarios that vary based on radiative forcing these scenarios mainly focus on providing the concentration of greenhouse gases and radiative forcing according to time passage overall there are four rcps scenarios of rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 that the primary goal is to identify future uncertainties without predicting them shrestha et al 2020 the outputs from rcp scenarios are still not sure due to uncertainty in the future greenhouse gas emissions there are some uncertainty and a wide range in the projection of future climate trends however gcms provide reasonable approximations of present and past climates which are still helpful in estimating future climatic conditions shrestha et al 2016 in this study two optimistic and pessimistic scenarios of rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 generated by hadgem2 es hadley global environment model 2 earth system are used to derive the climatic variables for the eshtehard watershed in the near future of 2021 2040 3 4 1 climate change toolkit cct the cct program ashraf vaghefi et al 2017 is a climate change toolkit to analyze and recognize patterns for extreme weather conditions it is used to extract downscale bias correct and interpolate the data obtained from global gcms the climate models often provide biased representations of observed times series systematic model errors are caused by imperfect conceptualization discretization and spatial averaging within grid cells the historical data are used for gcm data bias correction one at a time for precipitation tmax and tmin the additive method is used for temperature eq 3 and the ratio method is used for precipitation eq 4 3 t corrected ij t gcm ij t observed jk t gcm jk 4 p corrected ij p gcm ij p observed jk p gcm jk where t and p are the temperature c and precipitation mm day t and p are the long term average temperature and precipitation and i j k are day month and year counters respectively 3 5 swat modflow and pso linkage process at first the swat modflow linked package must be calibrated to ensure proper performance for integrated surface water and groundwater simulation for this purpose values for the groundwater parameters in swat that provided a discharge s nash sutcliff index upper than 0 6 are defined to generate groundwater recharge values used as the modflow inputs then the pest tool in modflow is then used to determine the best value for hydraulic conductivity and minimize the error between observed and simulated groundwater levels in the steady state finally the calibrated swat modflow model is verified for a set of data not used in the calibration stage then the swat modflow model is calibrated and run for the unsteady state the calibration process is shown in yellow boxes in fig 3 after preparing the swat and modflow models the optimization process starts with the pso algorithm at first the irrigated crops area and irrigation amounts are changed in swat input files considering that the total area of irrigated cultivation should not exceed the maximum available area and the crops areas can only convert to each other inside the swat model a feature called lup land use update is used for changing the land use this feature uses two files named lup dat and lupinput dat the lup dat file specifies the time that land s changes start in the lupinput dat file some coefficient values fractions are specified for each hru and the hru s area can be categorized by changing these coefficients the hrus are hydrological response units with the same characteristics soil type slope land use hru area is determined by multiplying the fraction by each sub basin area in which the hru is located changing the fraction of each hru with a specific land cover can change the crop s area a noteworthy point in applying changes to these coefficients fractions is that the sum of the fractions in each sub basin should remain equal to one to keep the total area constant in the optimization process the decision variables are the fraction values in irrigated hrus to change the cultivation pattern so that the sum of the fractions in each sub basin is equal to one in this way each hru has specific land use and by changing the fraction values its area in each sub basin changes then swat exe is executed to create output files to calculate the crops yield and the groundwater recharge discharge total irrigation volume is computed by summation of irrigation amounts used for crops production total irrigation and recharge volumes are replaced in the modflow input files as pumping extraction recharge rate respectively then modflow exe is executed to build output files for computing the groundwater level across the aquifer then the benefit gained by crops yield sale and the electricity cost of water extraction from wells is calculated to compute the objective function for the optimization procedure the pso algorithm also defines a constraint of stabilizing the groundwater level above a pre defined stability head according to this explanation the mathematical formulation of the problem is as follows 5 max f c 1 c a c y c p c 1 w ge h w γ w q w ep subject to 6 1 c a c a max 7 h w h w stab f is the objective function which is the net benefit gained from crops yield c is the number of crops a c is the crop s area ha in each year in the planning period y c is the crop s average yield in the unit of area ton ha in each year p c is the price of unit crop s yield ton w is the number of wells used for irrigation in the plain ge is the ground elevation m h w is the simulated groundwater level in each well m γ w is the water specific weight kn m3 q w is the pumping discharge from each well m3 ep is the unit electricity price kwh a max is the total available cultivable area in the plain ha and h w stab is the groundwater level defined for the stability of the aquifer in each well m the stability level for each well is considered equal to the average of the historical observed groundwater level in the surrounding piezometric wells in the region therefore this stability level is not so high that it tights the water extraction for crops irrigation and is not so low that it threatens the aquifer s sustainability the optimization process used in the pso swat modflow model is shown in the red boxes in fig 3 climate change scenarios are executed for both the present situation and optimum state models at first by using cct the gcm data are extracted for the watershed and are downscaled after data bias correction the future precipitation and temperature are entered into swat for both present state and optimum states then the impact of climate change on the crops yield and the groundwater resources are assessed for the coming years the climate change assessment process is shown in green boxes in fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 models calibration the swat model parameters sensitive to streamflow deep recharge and crop yield are found using swat cup similar to other studies in modeling irrigation wei et al 2018 these parameters are shown in table 1 the simulated vs observed discharge at the asefodoleh hydrometric station as the basin s outflow for the calibration period january 2000 to december 2015 and validation period january 2016 to december 2018 is shown in fig 4b the nash sutcliffe ns coefficient is obtained at 0 81 for calibration and 0 77 for validation also the r2 coefficient is 0 85 for calibration and 0 82 for validation the pest package is used for the calibration of modflow the calibration goal is to obtain the best values for hydraulic conductivity and specific yield parameters to adjust the simulated water level with the observed one in the piezometric wells pest adjusts model parameters to minimize the difference between observed and simulated groundwater head the head errors are obtained 0 014 0 632 and 0 755 for mean mean absolute and root mean square errors in the calibration phase and 0 156 0 767 and 0 901 respectively in the validation phase for the steady state for the unsteady state calibration the error values are obtained 0 370 1 015 and 1 309 respectively the diagrams of unsteady state head calibration for the observing wells are shown in fig 4 after calibration the hydraulic conductivity varied between 1 and 60 m d for the steady state and the specific yield varied between 0 15 and 0 85 for the unsteady state in the eshtehard aquifer 4 2 pso swat modflow results by running the optimization process optimal values for crops irrigation amount and crops area are obtained for wheat barley and cotton plants the goal is to maximize the net benefit of crops yield sales while preventing further groundwater drops from the stability head there are 59 decision variables in this study 20 19 and 17 decision variables are for winter wheat winter barley and cotton irrigation and three decision variables are for the areas of these three crops it took about 48 h to run the optimizer model for a system with intel r core tm i5 4210u cpu 1 70 ghz 2401 mhz 2 cores and 4 gb ram specifications according to fig 5 a the average annual irrigation amount for winter wheat has decreased by 45 in the optimum situation due to the 47 irrigation amount decrease in the spring and the high water requirement of the plant the water stress reduces the crop yield by 14 the average annual irrigation amount for winter barley has decreased by 7 in the optimum situation and the crop yield remained constant which can be said that the amount of irrigation in the present situation is 7 more than the plant s need fig 5 b the average annual irrigation amount for cotton has decreased by 10 in the optimum situation and the crop yield has increased by 7 5 which can be said that the amount of cotton irrigation in the present situation is 10 higher than the plant s need fig 5 c excess irrigation water has limited root growth and reduced the crop s yield and by optimizing the plant s water irrigation the crop s yield has increased in the optimum state fig 5 e shows that a part of winter wheat and cotton areas are replaced by winter barley after optimization the crop area decreased for winter wheat and cotton is 24 and 19 and the increase for barley is 49 winter wheat and cotton production benefit have decreased 35 and 13 respectively and for barley it has increased 49 resulting in an increase of 4 for the total agricultural production benefit this variation is shown in fig 6 according to fig 7 the aquifer level at the end of the operation period is 4 2 m lower than the first year in the present state while this drawdown has reached 2 5 m in the optimum state by reducing the groundwater extraction the groundwater level is 2 4 m higher than the present state at the end of the operation period in the optimum state according to the comparison of the average seasonal variations of the irrigation volume fig 8 a and aquifer recharge fig 8 b the irrigation amount is decreased in the optimum state especially in spring and summer as a result of optimized crop pattern planning this reduction in irrigation has resulted in the decrease of agricultural infiltration and therefore the groundwater recharge is decreased in the optimum state comparing the present situation in the watershed 4 3 effect of climate change scenarios by running climate change scenarios the temperature and precipitation values are predicted for the near future period of 2021 2040 and variations of these variables are shown in fig 9 a and 9 b comparison of the average annual precipitation in the climate change scenarios with the present situation shows a broader range of future precipitation variation as shown in fig 9 a also it is seen that in the first scenario s1 which is rcp 2 6 the predicted precipitations are higher than in the second scenario s2 which is rcp 8 5 this comparison for the temperature demonstrates warmer weather in rcp 8 5 as presented in fig 9 b the predicted precipitation and temperature are entered into the swat modflow model for both the present and optimum conditions so the impacts of climate change on the existing and optimum crop patterns are assessed in the following in the first stage the crop yield in all proposed scenarios is presented in fig 10 according to fig 10 by executing the climate change scenarios on the present pattern the average annual yield for winter wheat decreases in both s1 and s2 scenarios compared to the present situation for barley the average annual yield is almost the same as the present situation in s1 while decreasing in s2 also the crop s yield variation range is increased in both scenarios compared to the present situation indicating the yield s high sensitivity to water stress caused by future climate change for cotton the average annual yield and variation range in both s1 and s2 scenarios are decreased compared to the present situation it indicates that the crop s yield is sensitive to climate change impacts in the optimum crop pattern situation no noticeable change is occurred for wheat and barley crops yield in both s1 and s2 scenarios compared to the current situation projection in climate change conditions for cotton the average annual yield is almost the same in s1 and s2 scenarios but the crop s yield variation range is increased indicating the sensitivity of the cotton s yield to water stress caused by climate change which is because of the execution of the optimum irrigation in fig 11 variation of the groundwater table by the occurrence of the climate change scenarios in the present and optimum states is shown in the west of the eshtehard watershed due to climate change impact on the present crop situation the groundwater table has increased 4 9 and 4 1 m in scenarios s1 and s2 respectively relative to the present situation because of increased precipitation in this section of the plain by moving to the center of the plain the groundwater head has decreased to 13 8 and 14 1 m in scenarios s1 and s2 respectively because of decreased precipitation and continuation of the excessive agricultural water extraction from the aquifer in this region in the eastern region less water extraction occurs but the groundwater table has decreased due to the severe reduction in the amount of recharge caused by decreased precipitation as an impact of climate change on the other hand by execution of the optimum crop pattern in the watershed the groundwater would have different behavior in climate change scenarios and lower stress is imposed on basin water resources the aquifer head has increased to 4 3 and 4 1 m for scenarios s1 and s2 respectively in the west to the central regions of the plain in comparison to the present situation this raise is because of the reduction in agricultural water extraction due to the optimum crop pattern and irrigation this is a crucial point that must be noticed as the role of optimum crop pattern and irrigation in the sustainability of the water resources in the eastern region of the plain the water table has decreased 1 8 1 9 m relative to the present situation because of reduced precipitation in the climate change scenarios for further investigation on the results obtained by the pso swat modflow model variation of the recharge to the eshtehard aquifer in the present and optimum states and affected by climate change is shown in fig 12 because of the irrigation volume reduction in the optimum crop pattern state the return flow amount is decreased in this situation so the amount of groundwater recharge is decreased compared to the present situation however this case does not cause a further drop in groundwater level because groundwater abstraction has also decreased in this area fig 12 a by executing the climate change scenarios the same reason is given for the difference in the amount of groundwater recharge for the present situation and the optimal situation in scenario1 fig 12 b and scenario 2 fig 12 c also by comparing the present situation ps in fig 12 a with the effects of climate change on it for scenario s1 ps in fig 12 b the groundwater recharge is reduced in low precipitation regions located in the north and northeast of the aquifer it is increased in high precipitation zones located in the southwest of the aquifer because of variation in precipitation the same changes are evident in the comparison of the present situation ps in fig 12 a with the effects of climate change on it for scenario s2 ps in fig 12 c in scenario s1 fig 12 b the amounts of recharge to the aquifer are a bit higher than scenario s2 fig 12 c because of higher predicted precipitation for this condition 5 summary and conclusion this study assesses the effect of optimum crop patterns on groundwater resources also the impact of climate change on crop patterns and water consumption is evaluated this is achieved through a simulation optimization approach in which swat and modflow models are linked to simulate the agronomic and groundwater resources of the watershed then the swat modflow model is linked with the pso algorithm to find the optimum crop pattern and irrigation water allocation in the optimal crop pattern state the groundwater degradation is decreased by changing the irrigated crops area and reducing groundwater extraction for irrigation the results obtained by the pso swat modflow model give the best solution for maximizing the net benefit gained from crop yield while the groundwater table is not lowered below a pre defined stability head in the second part of the research the impact of climate change on the present and optimum crop pattern is assessed the results showed that the groundwater degradation is significantly reduced by executing the optimum crop pattern in the plain this is done by replacing a part of the winter wheat and cotton area with the winter barley which resulted in reducing the irrigation water consumption while the net benefit gained from the crops yield is maximized the obtained solutions show the proposed simulation optimization approach s ability to improve the conditions in irrigation based watersheds these results show that the present crop patterns and irrigation are inconsistent with the sustainable groundwater use goal gaining more net benefit besides more sustainability is possible by changing to the optimal pattern also in the optimized condition the effect of climate change on the future water resources is lower than the continuance of the present crop pattern declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

9582,plastic film mulching and irrigation amount greatly affect soil hydrothermal status and spring maize zea mays l productivity in arid areas yet the coupled effects of film mulching with different optical properties and deficit irrigation on water and temperature variation within the soil crop system and on plant growth in arid areas have not been well investigated a two year field experiment was conducted with five treatments 1 full irrigation without mulching fn 2 full irrigation with transparent plastic film mulching ft 3 full irrigation with black plastic film mulching fb 4 deficit irrigation with transparent plastic film mulching dt and 5 deficit irrigation without mulching dn the results showed that plastic film mulching significantly increased soil water in the 80 120 cm soil layer and canopy air humidity the alternating wet dry behavior of soil water caused by plastic film mulching was an effective water utilization strategy that increased crop water productivity dt stimulated the alternating wet dry behavior of soil water in the 0 80 cm layer more than the fn this alternating behavior was characterized by relatively wet soil at the 12 leaf growth stage v12 relatively dry soil from v12 to the grain filling growth stage r3 and relatively wet soil again after r3 alternating wet dry behavior changed from wet to dry at v12 in 2019 and was earlier than v12 in 2020 plastic film mulching significantly increased soil temperature at the six leaf growth stage v6 and decreased canopy air temperature during the whole maize growing seasons the higher net photosynthesis rate was observed at the canopy air relative humidity of 78 6 net photosynthesis rate decreased with increasing canopy air temperature ft fb dt and fn significantly increased grain

output input ratio by 28 1 and 10 9 in 2019 respectively compared with ft however these values were 12 3 and 4 0 in the relatively wet growing season in 2020 deficit irrigation combined with transparent plastic film mulching can ensure an acceptable maize grain yield and net income in arid areas with limited water resources especially in growing seasons with greater rainfall keywords spring maize plastic film mulching soil crop system water and temperature variation alternating wet dry soil water 1 introduction irrigated agriculture accounts for 40 of global crop production and is essential to ensure the global grain supply and alleviate the pressure of population growth especially in arid areas ozdogan 2011 in arid areas such as the hetao irrigation district extreme air temperatures and water resource shortages limit agricultural productivity low air temperature in the spring low rainfall and high evaporative potential have adverse effects on seedling establishment crop development and water use chen et al 2011 ren et al 2016 the hetao irrigation district is one of the three largest irrigation districts and the major maize production regions the maize planting area accounted for 35 6 of the total arable land li et al 2020 effective water and temperature management practices that improve yield and resource use efficiency are critical for improving crop production and sustainable development of agriculture in arid areas plastic film mulching has been widely used in the production of food and cash crops in arid irrigation districts especially for crops such as tomatoes solanum lycopersicum l zhang et al 2017a sunflower helianthus anuus l agele et al 2010 and maize zea mays l lamptey et al 2020 liu et al 2017 this mulching strategy enhances crop productivity and improves soil hydrothermal conditions by reducing soil evaporation and heat loss daryanto et al 2017 liu et al 2014 transparent plastic film mulching facilitates seed germination enhances plant growth and development and increases crop productivity bu et al 2013 black plastic film mulching can effectively improve soil high temperature stress during hot growing seasons qin et al 2018 transparent plastic filming may cause premature senescence and reduce grain yield in the loess plateau bu et al 2013 hu et al 2020 mo et al 2017 qin et al 2018 compared with transparent plastic film mulching black film mulching can absorb more solar radiation and reduce soil temperature under the mulch moreno and moreno 2008 yaghi et al 2013 remarkably some studies have shown no significant differences in results between the two plastic film mulching types mo et al 2017 and contrasting results mbah et al 2010 have also been observed this may be related to the optical properties of the film climate characteristics soil texture and so on previous studies have mainly investigated the effects of mulching on soil water and temperature or light utilization and crop growth braunack et al 2015 jia et al 2018 li et al 2021 as a continuous system the water and temperature transport of the soil crop system are highly correlated and affect crop growth and yield however at present there have been only a few studies reporting on the application of mulching film with different optical properties on the water and temperature transport of the soil crop system and its effects on plant growth and grain yield especially in arid irrigation districts with changing climate and greater demand for water resources water scarcity has become a global concern affecting agricultural production in arid irrigation districts grayson 2013 water shortage is not only a major factor affecting crop growth but is also an important factor restricting agricultural development grayson 2013 with water resource scarcities intensifying improving water use efficiency is urgently needed in arid areas throughout the world tejero et al 2011 some crops can adapt to water deficits reducing irrigation water by a certain amount deficit irrigation may not significantly reduce maize yield and may even increase water use efficiency al ghobari and dewidar 2018 comas et al 2019 in semi arid and arid areas deficit irrigation is widely used to alleviate water scarcity and improve yields studies have shown that moderate deficit irrigation improved maize productivity zou et al 2021 crop growth parameters were not significantly affected and the highest water use efficiency was obtained when reducing irrigation amount by 20 liu et al 2017 effects of deficit irrigation and mulching on crops have been previously investigated and most of these studies were designed to investigate effects on soil water and temperature transfer during the crop growing season braunack et al 2015 water use during the growing season ali sarıdaş et al 2021 yield and economic return zhang et al 2017b however the effects of deficit irrigation combined with plastic film mulches having different optical properties on the water and temperature status of the soil crop system and crop growth have not been well studied therefore it is important to investigate the water and temperature status of the soil crop system under full and deficit irrigation with plastic film mulching to determine how crop growth is affected leaf chlorophyll concentration is a vital pigment for absorbing transferring and transforming photosynthetic capability lamptey et al 2020 photosynthesis and chlorophyll concentration are the physiological factors that are most sensitive to water and temperature stress luo et al 2011 roohi et al 2015 soil water and temperature and canopy air temperature and humidity can reflect the response of crop growth to environmental stresses stuerz et al 2014 environmental stresses water temperature stress can reduce leaf photosynthesis affect plant growth and crop productivity and ultimately lead to reduced crop yields monneveux et al 2006 sexton et al 2021 superior hydrothermal status can enhance water productivity and increase grain yield roohi et al 2015 thapa et al 2018 and biomass gautam et al 2015 guo et al 2016 sexton et al 2021 different combinations of mulching and irrigation affect water and temperature transfer in the soil crop system hydrothermal status of the soil crop system can have a great influence on the plant gas exchange process thus affecting plant growth and crop productivity stuerz et al 2014 therefore quantitative analysis of net photosynthetic rate chlorophyll concentration and plant growth response to water and temperature status of the soil crop system is urgently needed we hypothesized that deficit irrigation with transparent plastic film mulching can improve hydrothermal conditions of the soil crop system thus enhancing plant growth and grain yield even though the effect of plastic film mulching on soil moisture and temperature and plant growth is currently recognized the key mechanism by which plastic film mulching and irrigation regulate spatiotemporal hydrothermal variation of the soil crop system and affect crop productivity is still not well studied hence the objectives of this research were to 1 investigate the effects of plastic film mulches having different optical properties and deficit irrigation on water and temperature transfer in the soil crop system 2 explore the effects of mulching and irrigation on alternating wet dry behavior of soil water and diurnal temperature amplitude 3 evaluate the effects of hydrothermal status of the soil crop system on plant physiological characteristics 4 analyze maize growth grain yield and economic benefits under different combinations of mulching and irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were conducted in 2019 and 2020 at the shuguang experimental station 40 46 n 107 24 e elevation 1039 m in linhe county of inner mongolia autonomous region china average annual

was a slightly wet growing season the groundwater depth is relatively shallow about 3 3 m at the experimental site 2 2 experimental design the field experiment consisted of five treatments 1 full irrigation without mulch fn 2 full irrigation with transparent plastic film mulch ft 3 full irrigation with black plastic film mulch fb 4 deficit irrigation with transparent plastic film mulch dt and 5 deficit irrigation without mulch dn the experiment used completely randomized block design and each treatment was replicated three times the plastic film 70 cm wide 0 008 mm thick for the ft fb and dt treatments was mulched across a flat surface in both years the nitrogen application rate was 300 kg ha 1 and the phosphorus application rate was 200 kg ha 1 for all treatments phosphate was spread as a base fertilizer in the form of diammonium phosphate before mulching nitrogen was also broadcast before mulching at levels of 150 kg ha 1 in the form of ammonium phosphate and urea as base fertilizer the remaining 150 kg ha 1 nitrogen was evenly applied in the form of urea at the grain filling stage r3 milk in both years previous studies have shown that border irrigation with 315 mm of water and furrow irrigation with 300 mm of water is recommended deficit irrigation amounts for cultivating mulched maize in the hetao irrigation district dong et al 2018 li et al 2020 thus the deficit irrigation amount applied in this study was 300 mm per growing season the full irrigation treatment amount was 500 mm per growing season the irrigation method was border irrigation owing to autumn irrigation after the harvest every year the soil moisture condition was better before planting irrigations were applied at the six leaf v6 12 leaf v12 silking r1 and grain filling r3 growth stages with 125 mm per application for full irrigation and 75 mm per application for deficit irrigation see ritchie et al 1986 for an explanation of the growth staging system each leaf stage is defined according to the uppermost leaf with visible leaf collar r1 begins when any silks are visible outside the husks r3 begins when kernel displays yellow color on the outside and inner fluid is milky white and r6 begins when husks and most of leaves turns yellow color and all kernels obtained the maximum dry weight irrigation was carried out after all treatments reached a certain growth stage irrigation water was obtained from groundwater well exact irrigation amounts were delivered by a pump equipped with a flow meter seeds were planted by hand at a depth of 5 cm using a manual hole planting machine each experimental plot was 12 m in length and 4 m in width two rows of maize cultivar jinping 628 were planted on each sheet of plastic film with 40 cm width narrow row and plants spaced 30 cm apart and a wide space of 80 cm between the two films the width of each sheet of plastic film is 70 cm maize was planted in wide 80 cm and narrow 40 cm rows under the treatments without

canopy air temperature canopy air relative humidity is the amount of moisture currently held by the air as a percentage of the total possible moisture that the air could hold at a given temperature when we mention canopy air temperature we are referring to the air temperature as measured at the thermistor height of the instrumentation system and not to the temperature of the leaf tissues

the soil crop system 3 1 1 soil and canopy air relative humidity both soil relative humidity and canopy air relative humidity in the soil crop system were greatly affected by mulching and irrigation and both varied spatially fig 2 canopy air relative humidity increased with canopy height and soil relative humidity initially increased and then decreased with soil depth in the two study years soil relative humidity for ft fb and dt were significantly greater than observed for fn and dn in the 80 120 cm layer soil relative humidity generally followed the order of fb ft fn dt dn in the 0 60 cm layer but treatment differences were not significant plastic film mulching significantly increased canopy air relative humidity over that observed for the fn and dn but canopy air relative humidity differences between ft fb and dt were not significantly different in the two study years soil and canopy air relative humidity varied with growth stage soil relative humidity among treatments was mostly higher at v6 then decreased and reached the lowest value at r1 especially in the surface layer 0 20 cm and in the deepest layer 100 120 cm soil relative humidity gradually recovered especially in the deeper soil canopy air relative humidity among treatments showed an opposite trend canopy air relative humidity initially increased and reached its highest value at r3 and then decreased generally ft fb dt and fn mainly increased soil relative humidity as compared with dn by 41 3 40 0 28 7 and 9 6 respectively in the 0 120 cm soil layer in 2019 and by 40 8 41 4 26 3 and 17 9 in 2020 ft fb dt and fn mainly increased canopy air humidity compared with dn by 6 5 5 6 5 9 and 2 7 respectively in the 0 150 cm height profile in 2019 and by 4 8 4 7 4 3 and 2 8 in 2020 the effects of irrigation on soil and canopy air relative humidity were shown in fig s1 soil and canopy air humidity enhanced after irrigation soil relative humidity increased by 20 7 17 3 26 7 15 7 and 15 5 for ft

irrigation 3 1 2 alternating wet dry behavior of soil water the wet and dry status of soil under mulching was characterized by the increase and decrease of water respectively relative to the soil water content in the fn treatment in this study dn resulted in the drier soil water conditions in the 0 120 cm layer than seen for fn in both years mulching stimulated alternating wet dry behavior of soil water especially under deficit irrigation fig 3 alternating wet dry behavior of soil water mainly occurred in the 0 80 cm soil layer whereas the 80 120 cm soil layer was mainly characterized by intense fluctuation in the wet range alternating wet dry behavior of soil water in the 0 80 cm soil layer changed from wet to dry at v12 and was earlier than v12 in 2020 and then changed from dry to wet at r3 especially under the dt treatment fig 3a d soil in 0 80 cm layer was mostly slightly wetter than the fn treatment under ft and fb in 2020 with more rainfall dt slightly stimulated the alternating wet dry behavior of soil water in the 0 80 cm layer compared with fn in which drier conditions mainly occurred from v12 to r3 averaging 9 9 and 4 0 drier than fn in the 0 20 cm and 20 80 cm layers respectively in 2019 and 7 9 and 16 6 drier than fn in 2020 owing to more rainfall soil water in 0 20 cm for dt presented relative wet compared with fn at r1 in 2020 in contrast much wetter soil water conditions occurred for dt than for fn in the 80 120 cm layer across growth stages with a range of 2 5 36 9 in 2019 and 5 8 66 3 in 2020 ft and fb resulted in much wetter soil water

affected by mulch treatment and irrigation and varied spatially fig 4 canopy air temperatures slightly increased with canopy height and soil temperature decreased with soil depth in the two study years canopy air temperatures for the mulched treatments ft fb and dt were not significantly different from each other but were significantly lower than the canopy air temperatures in no mulched treatments fn and dn in the two study years plastic film mulching remarkably increased soil temperatures soil temperatures followed the order of ft dt fb dn fn in 2019 and followed the order of dt ft

season in both study years soil temperature and canopy air temperature varied with the growth stage soil temperature and canopy air temperature gradually decreased with advancing growth stages and reached the lowest value at r6 generally canopy air temperatures for ft fb and dt were significantly lower than canopy air temperatures for fn by 3 7 3 6 and 3 8 respectively at all measurement

deficit irrigation treatment under mulching chlorophyll concentrations under transparent and black plastic film mulching were not significantly different from each other during any of the growth stages in 2019 and 2020 net photosynthesis rate a increased from v9 to r1 and slightly declined from r1 to r3 in the two study years fig 7 the a values for mulched treatments were significantly greater than that for fn and dn at different growth stages in both study years the a values for ft were significantly higher than that for fb at v9 and for dt at any maize growth stages in both study years generally the average a values were 36 7 35 5 33 9 29 4 and 26 0 μmol m 2 s 1 for ft fb dt fn and dn respectively in 2019 and 38 8 37 6 36 0 31 6 and 28 5 μmol m 2 s 1 in 2020 ft fb dt and fn significantly increased net photosynthesis rate as compared with dn by 41 2 36 5 30 1 and 13 3 respectively in 2019 and by 36 1 31 9 26 2 and 10 7 in 2020 3 4 leaf area index and dry matter

than for fn and dn at v6 and v12 in 2019 fig 8a and for all growth stages in 2020 fig 8b lai values for ft fb and dt were not significantly different from one another in 2019 and 2020 at r1 i e 89 days after planting lai was 44 3 and 13 8 greater for ft than for fn in 2019 and 2020 respectively 22 2 and 12 2 greater for fb than for fn and 8 7 and 9 6 greater for dt than for fn generally lai for ft fb dt and fn were 40 3 33 7 22 6 and 9 1 greater than that for dn in 2019 respectively and 24 0 23 5 18 8 and 6 6 greater in 2020 dry matter accumulation initially increased gradually for all treatments during the two growing seasons and then increased more rapidly as the season progressed reaching maximum values at r6 dry matter accumulations for ft fb and dt were significantly higher

days after planting dry matter accumulation was significantly greater for ft by 20 4 and 19 5 than for fn in 2019 and 2020 respectively and similarly greater for fb by 16 2 and 19 4 and greater for dt by 8 8 and 6 4 than for fn generally dry matter accumulation for ft fb dt and fn were 40 0 36 9 27 6 and 12 8 greater than that for dn in 2019 respectively and 48 0 42 3 31 7 and 15 4 greater in 2020 3 5 yield and economic benefit yield crop water productivity and economic benefit of spring maize under the five treatments were evaluated in the two study years table 2 yield and wpc under ft fb and dt were significantly greater than under fn ft fb dt and fn significantly increased grain yields compared with dn by 39 7 25 5 18 2 and 9 0 respectively in 2019 and by 45 8 41 8 33 4 and 17 0 in 2020 yields for dt and fb were not significantly different and they were significantly lower than yields for ft in 2019 in 2020 the yield for ft and fb were not significantly different from each other and they were significantly higher than observed for dt crop water productivity for dt was significantly higher than that for the other treatments in 2019 and 2020 ft fb dt and dn significantly increased wpc compared with fn by 39 0 26 6 45 2 and 16 6 respectively in 2019 and by 29 4 31 2 48 3 and 8 2 in 2020 moreover dt saved 40 of the water resources in an arid water shortage area generally total input values were lower under dn and fn compared with other mulching treatments due to no film mulch costs and followed the order of dn fn dt ft fb nevertheless the output value for mulching treatments was remarkably higher than for fn and dn the net income for ft fb dt and fn was 894 436 343 and 166 usd ha 1 higher than for dn in 2019 respectively and 1127 979 844 and 429 usd ha 1 higher in 2020 the net income and output input for fb and dt showed little difference between the two study years and dt saved 200 mm of irrigation water net income and output input were 28 1 and 10 9 respectively lower for dt than for ft in 2019 however these values were only 12 3 and 4 0 lower for dt than for ft in the relatively wetter growing season of 2020 net income ranged from 1068 to 1962 usd ha 1 in 2019 and from 1166 to 2293 usd ha 1 in 2020 with the highest values recorded for ft and the lowest values recorded for dn in 2019 and 2020 3 6 correlation between plant growth and water and temperature of the soil crop system 3 6 1 correlation between yield net income canopy air temperature and humidity leaf physiological characteristics and plant growth correlations between yield net income canopy air temperature and humidity leaf physiological characteristics and plant growth for the two study years are shown in fig 9 generally leaf chlorophyll concentration cc net photosynthesis rate lai and dry matter accumulation dma were positively correlated with maize yield y and net income ni with the positive correlation coefficients almost reaching 0 99 in 2020 net income had strong positive correlations with y in both study years canopy air relative humidity ch had weak positive correlations with yield lai dry matter accumulation and net income in the two study years remarkably diurnal temperature amplitude dta and canopy air temperature ct were negatively correlated with yield and net income in the two study years in both years diurnal temperature amplitude and canopy air temperature were negatively correlated with leaf chlorophyll concentration net photosynthesis rate lai and dry matter accumulation canopy air temperature had strong negative correlations with leaf chlorophyll concentration net photosynthesis rate lai and dry matter accumulation especially in 2020 fig 9b 3 6 2 the relationship between leaf net photosynthesis rate and canopy air humidity and temperature the relationship between leaf net photosynthesis rate and canopy air relative humidity was quadratic r 2 0 4888 p 0 01 with the maximum net photosynthesis rate of 38 3 μmol m 2 s 1 observed at the canopy air relative humidity of 78 6 fig 10a in contrast the relationship between net photosynthesis rate and canopy air temperature was linear r 2 0 3158 p 0 01 and net photosynthesis rate decreased with the increasing canopy air temperature in this study fig 10b 4 discussion 4 1 hydrothermal status of the soil crop system 4 1 1 the wet dry alternative pattern plastic film mulching can significantly improve soil water content but soil water content was not significantly different between transparent or black plastic film mulch li et al 2021 owing to the enhanced transpiration under mulching and the intense demand for water by maize and coupled with the lower irrigation amount soil relative humidity under dt was lower than that under fn in the 0 60 cm soil layer especially at v12 r1 and r3 fig 2b d and g i these results are consistent with previous studies li et al 2017 qin et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a notably soil relative humidity for dt was remarkably higher than that for dn the pattern we observed of soil wetting drying wetting may be a water use strategy under plastic film mulching that effectively improves water use and optimizes soil water status in an arid water shortage area previous research confirmed this pattern in semiarid rainfed regions we referred to this pattern as the alternating wet dry behavior of soil water zhang et al 2019a 2019b our study also confirmed that this pattern of alternating wet dry behavior of soil water mainly occurred in the 0 80 cm soil layer especially under dt fig 3 soil water evaporation is the main component of crop water consumption at the early growth stages when plants are small and plastic film mulching has the greatest potential to reduce soil water loss by evaporation bu et al 2013 therefore mulched treatments showed soil wetting relative to no mulched treatments at v6 mulched maize experiences faster canopy growth than non mulched maize resulting in greater transpiration that may eventually offset the early season soil moisture improvement provided by mulching li et al 2017 especially under deficit irrigation thus soil drying relative to fn mainly occurred from v12 to r3 owing to the shallow groundwater table and irrigation soil moisture under mulched treatments was much higher than observed under non mulched treatments in the 80 120 cm soil layer and thus intense wetting relative to fn occurred in the 80 120 cm layer during the growing season fig 3e f at r6 maize transpiration tends to decrease and soil moisture under mulched treatments returns to a relatively favorable state mo et al 2016 notably dt presented the more soil wetting relative to dn during the whole growth stage the alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd is always applied in rice production yao et al 2012 ye et al 2013 rice is adaptable to intermittent irrigation thus there is no necessary for continuous irrigation awd can enhance root biomass dong et al 2012 obtaine similar yield and profits but reduce irrigation duration and amount rejesus et al 2011 as for maize production compared with increasing 200 mm irrigation amount plastic film mulching promoted maize efficient water use that is soil wetting and drying pattern in 0 80 cm soil layer and obtained significantly high yield and economic benefits this alternating soil wetting and drying pattern relative to fn can be used as an efficient water use strategy in areas with limited water resources li et al 2017 ye et al 2013 during the critical period of water demand v12 r3 dt may enhance water absorption and utilization of deep soil water thus relieving water stress jia et al 2018 studies presented that plants can rapidly recover growth and quickly eliminate some detrimental water stress effects after rehydration luo et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a in this study owing to the supplemental irrigation and the effect of plastic film mulching the mean relative soil water for dt and fn in the 0 120 cm layer was at a similar level during the high water demand growth stages v12 r3 and dt showed soil wetting relative to fn at r6 fig 3 4 1 2 the canopy micro environments canopy air temperature and humidity are important indicators of crop microclimate higher canopy air humidity may cause an increased incidence of plant diseases and insect pests thus limiting crop yields lower canopy air humidity results in partial closure of stomata thereby inhibiting photosynthesis and transpiration we found that canopy air relative humidity was positively correlated with leaf net photosynthesis rate and maize growth fig 9 moreover plastic film mulching significantly increased canopy air relative humidity at v6 v12 r1 and r6 especially for ft and dt and values were lower than the optimal value 78 6 fig 10a although plastic film mulching increased canopy air relative humidity at r3 to a value 78 6 that was higher than the optimal value relative humidity differences among treatments were not significantly different compared with fn transparent plastic film mulching coupled with deficit irrigation resulted in a better water environment for the soil crop system than the fn treatment and this in combination with alternating wet dry behavior of soil water positively stimulated crop evapotranspiration to use water efficiently while saving water resources canopy air temperature can vary with cultivars and treatments plants under water stress typically have higher canopy air temperatures dejonge et al 2015 and cooler canopy air temperatures have been shown to consistently increase leaf water use efficiency and contribute to greater canopy water use efficiency sexton et al 2021 furthermore cooler canopies can reduce water loss and increase grain yield roohi et al 2015 thapa et al 2018 and biomass gautam et al 2015 guo et al 2016 sexton et al 2021 our research showed similar results i e canopy air temperature had strong negative correlations with leaf physiological characteristics plant growth and final yield fig 9 plastic film mulching significantly decreased canopy air temperature fig 4 and this was more probably to increase canopy water use efficiency and enhance grain yield lower canopy air temperature and higher soil temperature under mulches would reduce respiratory expenditures and facilitate root activity such that crop photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation may be accelerated jia et al 2018 sunoj et al 2016 previous research showed that leaf chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate had strong negative correlations with canopy air temperature roohi et al 2015 mulched treatments with significantly lower canopy air temperatures higher canopy air humidity and better soil moisture and temperature conditions produced significantly higher net photosynthetic rates and chlorophyll concentrations compared with fn transparent plastic film mulching coupled with deficit irrigation presented a better temperature environment for the soil crop system and positively promoted crop growth and assimilation 4 1 3 soil temperature plastic film mulching can prevent heat loss and increase soil temperature in the early growing season daryanto et al 2017 liu et al 2014 werf 2010 because of radiative reflection absorption and transmission soil temperature for the black film mulch was lower than soil temperature for the transparent film mulch mbah et al 2010 the higher soil temperature coupled with good soil moisture conditions under plastic film mulching at v6 can promote seedling emergence of spring maize especially in cold springs liu et al 2009 owing to the covering effect of leaves cover the soil warming effect of mulches diminished when the plants became larger subrahmaniyan et al 2018 there was little difference in soil temperature among the plastic film mulch treatments and non mulched treatments at r1 and r3 especially in the 10 25 cm soil layer furthermore irrigation and fertilization at r3 in this study effectively avoided nutrient deficits and premature leaf senescence at this critical growth stage especially for the transparent plastic film mulching treatment fig 8 li et al 2021 plastic film mulching treatments resulted in lower diurnal temperature amplitude than fn in both years fig 4 especially under deficit irrigation this result was mainly due to the increased nighttime soil temperature for the mulched treatments zhang et al 2019b higher soil temperature at night would facilitate rapid recovery of root activity in the morning jia et al 2018 moreover a moderate increase in nighttime soil temperatures may promote subsequent day photosynthetic rates during the vegetative stage yang et al 2016 this was conducive to seed germination and crop development higher soil temperatures at early stages coupled with lower diurnal temperature amplitude high nighttime soil temperature under mulches provided a more favorable soil temperature environment for seed germination and crop growth especially under transparent plastic film mulching 4 2 photosynthesis characteristics photosynthesis which plays an important role in crop production is a crucial physiological process affected by plastic film mulching and irrigation amount ali et al 2018 li et al 2019 photosynthesis and chlorophyll concentration are most sensitive to water and temperature stress luo et al 2011 roohi et al 2015 photosynthetic performance had the strong positive correlation with grain yield fang et al 2018 and decreasing net photosynthesis rate may reduce the supply of photosynthates available for grain filling thereby leading to lower grain yield tao et al 2016 li et al 2021 showed that leaf net photosynthesis rate presented the strong positive correlations with soil water and temperature low canopy air humidity can inhibit photosynthesis owing to the partial closure of stomata and low canopy air temperature can reduce water loss and increase canopy water use efficiency and grain yield roohi et al 2015 sexton et al 2021 thapa et al 2018 according to the relationships for canopy air relative humidity or temperature vs leaf net photosynthesis rate fig 10 dt and ft were more probably to obtain optimal canopy air relative humidity and canopy air temperatures during the maize growing seasons low canopy air temperature and high soil temperature under mulches facilitate crop photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation jia et al 2018 sunoj et al 2016 our study showed the similar results as other s research mentioned above the superior hydrothermal conditions of the soil crop system for ft facilitated higher photosynthesis performance and grain yield and dt with improved hydrothermal conditions of the soil crop system could obtain high photosynthesis performance and acceptable yield and net income especially during spring maize growing season with more rainfall 4 3 crop growth and economic benefits the better hydrothermal environment of the soil crop system under ft and fb significantly increased lai values and dry matter accumulation during the maize growing season fig 8 alternating wet dry behavior of soil water and lower diurnal temperature amplitude coupled with the better hydrothermal environment under dt significantly promoted maize physiological characteristics leaf chlorophyll concentration and net photosynthesis rate and growth lai and dry matter accumulation compared with fn this result indicated that mulching can replace part of the irrigation requirement and the combination of film mulching and some degree of deficit irrigation could improve the hydrothermal environment promote plant growth and maintain crop yield at a desirable level table 2 notably wpc for dt was significantly higher than it was for other treatments dt saved 40 of the water resources in an arid water shortage area although an additional input was paid for labor and plastic film cost the mulched treatments resulted in appreciable increases in crop grain yield thus producing greater net income input values were higher with black film than with transparent film in this study since the price of the black film was higher than that of the transparent film moreover grain yield for the black film treatment was lower than for the transparent film treatment therefore the net income and output input values for ft were higher than for fb table 2 dt decreased irrigation input compared with ft and fb but produced acceptable grain yield especially in 2020 when more rain fell consequently the net income and output input values for dt were at a desirable level 5 conclusions in an arid irrigation district an improved hydrothermal environment for the soil crop system was achieved by plastic film mulching alternating wet dry behavior of soil water induced by plastic film mulching was an effective water utilization strategy that increased crop water productivity the lower diurnal temperature amplitude canopy air temperature and higher canopy air relative humidity with the use of plastic film mulching induced more rapid and vigorous plant growth as a result plastic film mulching significantly increased leaf chlorophyll concentration and net photosynthesis rate during the maize growing season higher net photosynthesis rate was obtained at the canopy air relative humidity of 78 6 and net photosynthesis rate decreased with increasing canopy air temperature compared with full irrigation with transparent plastic film mulching deficit irrigation with transparent plastic film mulching significantly increased crop water productivity decreased net income by 28 1 in 2019 however these values was only 12 3 in the relatively wetter growing season of 2020 taken together deficit irrigation combined with transparent plastic film mulching enhance crop water productivity ensure acceptable maize grain yield and net income in arid areas with limited water resources especially during growing seasons with more rainfall

9582,plastic film mulching and irrigation amount greatly affect soil hydrothermal status and spring maize zea mays l productivity in arid areas yet the coupled effects of film mulching with different optical properties and deficit irrigation on water and temperature variation within the soil crop system and on plant growth in arid areas have not been well investigated a two year field experiment was conducted with five treatments 1 full irrigation without mulching fn 2 full irrigation with transparent plastic film mulching ft 3 full irrigation with black plastic film mulching fb 4 deficit irrigation with transparent plastic film mulching dt and 5 deficit irrigation without mulching dn the results showed that plastic film mulching significantly increased soil water in the 80 120 cm soil layer and canopy air humidity the alternating wet dry behavior of soil water caused by plastic film mulching was an effective water utilization strategy that increased crop water productivity dt stimulated the alternating wet dry behavior of soil water in the 0 80 cm layer more than the fn this alternating behavior was characterized by relatively wet soil at the 12 leaf growth stage v12 relatively dry soil from v12 to the grain filling growth stage r3 and relatively wet soil again after r3 alternating wet dry behavior changed from wet to dry at v12 in 2019 and was earlier than v12 in 2020 plastic film mulching significantly increased soil temperature at the six leaf growth stage v6 and decreased canopy air temperature during the whole maize growing seasons the higher net photosynthesis rate was observed at the canopy air relative humidity of 78 6 net photosynthesis rate decreased with increasing canopy air temperature ft fb dt and fn significantly increased grain yields over dn by 39 7 45 8 25 5 41 8 18 2 33 4 and 9 0 17 0 respectively and increased net income over dn by 894 1127 436 979 343 844 and 166 429 usd ha 1 respectively dt decreased net income and output input ratio by 28 1 and 10 9 in 2019 respectively compared with ft however these values were 12 3 and 4 0 in the relatively wet growing season in 2020 deficit irrigation combined with transparent plastic film mulching can ensure an acceptable maize grain yield and net income in arid areas with limited water resources especially in growing seasons with greater rainfall keywords spring maize plastic film mulching soil crop system water and temperature variation alternating wet dry soil water 1 introduction irrigated agriculture accounts for 40 of global crop production and is essential to ensure the global grain supply and alleviate the pressure of population growth especially in arid areas ozdogan 2011 in arid areas such as the hetao irrigation district extreme air temperatures and water resource shortages limit agricultural productivity low air temperature in the spring low rainfall and high evaporative potential have adverse effects on seedling establishment crop development and water use chen et al 2011 ren et al 2016 the hetao irrigation district is one of the three largest irrigation districts and the major maize production regions the maize planting area accounted for 35 6 of the total arable land li et al 2020 effective water and temperature management practices that improve yield and resource use efficiency are critical for improving crop production and sustainable development of agriculture in arid areas plastic film mulching has been widely used in the production of food and cash crops in arid irrigation districts especially for crops such as tomatoes solanum lycopersicum l zhang et al 2017a sunflower helianthus anuus l agele et al 2010 and maize zea mays l lamptey et al 2020 liu et al 2017 this mulching strategy enhances crop productivity and improves soil hydrothermal conditions by reducing soil evaporation and heat loss daryanto et al 2017 liu et al 2014 transparent plastic film mulching facilitates seed germination enhances plant growth and development and increases crop productivity bu et al 2013 black plastic film mulching can effectively improve soil high temperature stress during hot growing seasons qin et al 2018 transparent plastic filming may cause premature senescence and reduce grain yield in the loess plateau bu et al 2013 hu et al 2020 mo et al 2017 qin et al 2018 compared with transparent plastic film mulching black film mulching can absorb more solar radiation and reduce soil temperature under the mulch moreno and moreno 2008 yaghi et al 2013 remarkably some studies have shown no significant differences in results between the two plastic film mulching types mo et al 2017 and contrasting results mbah et al 2010 have also been observed this may be related to the optical properties of the film climate characteristics soil texture and so on previous studies have mainly investigated the effects of mulching on soil water and temperature or light utilization and crop growth braunack et al 2015 jia et al 2018 li et al 2021 as a continuous system the water and temperature transport of the soil crop system are highly correlated and affect crop growth and yield however at present there have been only a few studies reporting on the application of mulching film with different optical properties on the water and temperature transport of the soil crop system and its effects on plant growth and grain yield especially in arid irrigation districts with changing climate and greater demand for water resources water scarcity has become a global concern affecting agricultural production in arid irrigation districts grayson 2013 water shortage is not only a major factor affecting crop growth but is also an important factor restricting agricultural development grayson 2013 with water resource scarcities intensifying improving water use efficiency is urgently needed in arid areas throughout the world tejero et al 2011 some crops can adapt to water deficits reducing irrigation water by a certain amount deficit irrigation may not significantly reduce maize yield and may even increase water use efficiency al ghobari and dewidar 2018 comas et al 2019 in semi arid and arid areas deficit irrigation is widely used to alleviate water scarcity and improve yields studies have shown that moderate deficit irrigation improved maize productivity zou et al 2021 crop growth parameters were not significantly affected and the highest water use efficiency was obtained when reducing irrigation amount by 20 liu et al 2017 effects of deficit irrigation and mulching on crops have been previously investigated and most of these studies were designed to investigate effects on soil water and temperature transfer during the crop growing season braunack et al 2015 water use during the growing season ali sarıdaş et al 2021 yield and economic return zhang et al 2017b however the effects of deficit irrigation combined with plastic film mulches having different optical properties on the water and temperature status of the soil crop system and crop growth have not been well studied therefore it is important to investigate the water and temperature status of the soil crop system under full and deficit irrigation with plastic film mulching to determine how crop growth is affected leaf chlorophyll concentration is a vital pigment for absorbing transferring and transforming photosynthetic capability lamptey et al 2020 photosynthesis and chlorophyll concentration are the physiological factors that are most sensitive to water and temperature stress luo et al 2011 roohi et al 2015 soil water and temperature and canopy air temperature and humidity can reflect the response of crop growth to environmental stresses stuerz et al 2014 environmental stresses water temperature stress can reduce leaf photosynthesis affect plant growth and crop productivity and ultimately lead to reduced crop yields monneveux et al 2006 sexton et al 2021 superior hydrothermal status can enhance water productivity and increase grain yield roohi et al 2015 thapa et al 2018 and biomass gautam et al 2015 guo et al 2016 sexton et al 2021 different combinations of mulching and irrigation affect water and temperature transfer in the soil crop system hydrothermal status of the soil crop system can have a great influence on the plant gas exchange process thus affecting plant growth and crop productivity stuerz et al 2014 therefore quantitative analysis of net photosynthetic rate chlorophyll concentration and plant growth response to water and temperature status of the soil crop system is urgently needed we hypothesized that deficit irrigation with transparent plastic film mulching can improve hydrothermal conditions of the soil crop system thus enhancing plant growth and grain yield even though the effect of plastic film mulching on soil moisture and temperature and plant growth is currently recognized the key mechanism by which plastic film mulching and irrigation regulate spatiotemporal hydrothermal variation of the soil crop system and affect crop productivity is still not well studied hence the objectives of this research were to 1 investigate the effects of plastic film mulches having different optical properties and deficit irrigation on water and temperature transfer in the soil crop system 2 explore the effects of mulching and irrigation on alternating wet dry behavior of soil water and diurnal temperature amplitude 3 evaluate the effects of hydrothermal status of the soil crop system on plant physiological characteristics 4 analyze maize growth grain yield and economic benefits under different combinations of mulching and irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were conducted in 2019 and 2020 at the shuguang experimental station 40 46 n 107 24 e elevation 1039 m in linhe county of inner mongolia autonomous region china average annual precipitation is 160 mm and about 107 mm during the plant growing seasons ren et al 2016 mean annual pan evaporation of 20 cm diameter is 2350 mm zhou et al 2018 average annual air temperature is 9 1 c and annual total sunshine hours are 3200 h during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons the rainfall was 55 mm and 129 mm respectively fig 1 this indicated that 2019 was a dry growing season and 2020 was a slightly wet growing season the groundwater depth is relatively shallow about 3 3 m at the experimental site 2 2 experimental design the field experiment consisted of five treatments 1 full irrigation without mulch fn 2 full irrigation with transparent plastic film mulch ft 3 full irrigation with black plastic film mulch fb 4 deficit irrigation with transparent plastic film mulch dt and 5 deficit irrigation without mulch dn the experiment used completely randomized block design and each treatment was replicated three times the plastic film 70 cm wide 0 008 mm thick for the ft fb and dt treatments was mulched across a flat surface in both years the nitrogen application rate was 300 kg ha 1 and the phosphorus application rate was 200 kg ha 1 for all treatments phosphate was spread as a base fertilizer in the form of diammonium phosphate before mulching nitrogen was also broadcast before mulching at levels of 150 kg ha 1 in the form of ammonium phosphate and urea as base fertilizer the remaining 150 kg ha 1 nitrogen was evenly applied in the form of urea at the grain filling stage r3 milk in both years previous studies have shown that border irrigation with 315 mm of water and furrow irrigation with 300 mm of water is recommended deficit irrigation amounts for cultivating mulched maize in the hetao irrigation district dong et al 2018 li et al 2020 thus the deficit irrigation amount applied in this study was 300 mm per growing season the full irrigation treatment amount was 500 mm per growing season the irrigation method was border irrigation owing to autumn irrigation after the harvest every year the soil moisture condition was better before planting irrigations were applied at the six leaf v6 12 leaf v12 silking r1 and grain filling r3 growth stages with 125 mm per application for full irrigation and 75 mm per application for deficit irrigation see ritchie et al 1986 for an explanation of the growth staging system each leaf stage is defined according to the uppermost leaf with visible leaf collar r1 begins when any silks are visible outside the husks r3 begins when kernel displays yellow color on the outside and inner fluid is milky white and r6 begins when husks and most of leaves turns yellow color and all kernels obtained the maximum dry weight irrigation was carried out after all treatments reached a certain growth stage irrigation water was obtained from groundwater well exact irrigation amounts were delivered by a pump equipped with a flow meter seeds were planted by hand at a depth of 5 cm using a manual hole planting machine each experimental plot was 12 m in length and 4 m in width two rows of maize cultivar jinping 628 were planted on each sheet of plastic film with 40 cm width narrow row and plants spaced 30 cm apart and a wide space of 80 cm between the two films the width of each sheet of plastic film is 70 cm maize was planted in wide 80 cm and narrow 40 cm rows under the treatments without mulching and the planting position was corresponding to the mulching treatments the sowing dates were 26 april of 2019 and 30 april of 2020 and the corresponding harvesting dates were 12 september of 2019 and 12 september of 2020 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil relative humidity and temperature soil water content was measured by gravimetric analysis at the v6 v12 r1 r3 and physiological maturity r6 growth stages soil water was expressed as a percentage of field capacity and is subsequently referred to as relative humidity soil relative humidity srh was calculated as the quotient of gravimetric soil water content swc g g 1 and field capacity fc g g 1 1 s r h s w c f c the soil properties in the 0 120 cm profile are provided in table 1 soil temperatures were continuously recorded by hobo data loggers during the growing season onset inc usa hobo data loggers were installed at the center of narrow rows of maize soil temperatures were measured hourly at soil depths of 5 10 15 20

surface at the v6 v12 r1 r3 and r6 growth stages weather environment meter is hand hold the measurement position is in the center of narrow rows of maize we called it canopy air relative humidity and canopy air temperature canopy air relative humidity is the amount of moisture currently held by the air as a percentage of the total possible moisture that the air could hold at a given temperature when we mention canopy air temperature we are referring to the air temperature as measured at the thermistor height of the instrumentation system and not to the temperature of the leaf tissues comprising the maize canopy canopy air relative humidity and temperature were measured hourly from 8 00 20 00 at the v6 v12 r1 r3 and r6 growth stages values are the average of the daytime measurements 2 3 3 chlorophyll concentration and net photosynthesis rate chlorophyll concentration µmol m 2 was measured using a chlorophyll concentration meter model mc 100 apogee instruments inc usa during maize stages v12 r1 r3 and r6 the chlorophyll concentration meter measures relative chlorophyll content and outputs an estimate of actual chlorophyll concentration in units of µmol per m2 of leaf surface actual chlorophyll concentration is closely correlated with relative chlorophyll concentration chlorophyll concentration measurements were made in the middle portion of the most recently

width coefficient leaf length ll m and the widest lw m part of a leaf were measured with a ruler the coefficient for maize was 0 75 all five plants were harvested for dry matter determination all plant samples were dried at 105 c for 30 min and then dried at 75 c in an oven until constant weight was achieved and then samples were weighed 2 l a i p d l l l w 0 75 ten maize plants were selected

the soil crop system 3 1 1 soil and canopy air relative humidity both soil relative humidity and canopy air relative humidity in the soil crop system were greatly affected by mulching and irrigation and both varied spatially fig 2 canopy air relative humidity increased with canopy height and soil relative humidity initially increased and then decreased with soil depth in the two study years soil relative humidity for ft fb and dt were significantly greater than observed for fn and dn in the 80 120 cm layer soil relative humidity generally followed the order of fb ft fn dt dn in the 0 60 cm layer but treatment differences were not significant plastic film mulching significantly increased canopy air relative humidity over that observed for the fn and dn but canopy air relative humidity differences between ft fb and dt were not significantly different in the two study years soil and canopy air relative humidity varied with growth stage soil relative humidity among treatments was mostly higher at v6 then decreased and reached the lowest value at r1 especially in the surface layer 0 20 cm and in the deepest layer 100 120 cm soil relative humidity gradually recovered especially in the deeper soil canopy air relative humidity among treatments showed an opposite trend canopy air relative humidity initially increased and reached its highest value at r3 and then decreased generally ft fb dt and fn mainly increased soil relative humidity as compared with dn by 41 3 40 0 28 7 and 9 6 respectively in the 0 120 cm soil layer in 2019 and by 40 8 41 4 26 3 and 17 9 in 2020 ft fb dt and fn mainly increased canopy air humidity compared with dn by 6 5 5 6 5 9 and 2 7 respectively in the 0 150 cm height profile in 2019 and by 4 8 4 7 4 3 and 2 8 in 2020 the effects of irrigation on soil and canopy air relative humidity were shown in fig s1 soil and canopy air humidity enhanced after irrigation soil relative humidity increased by 20 7 17 3 26 7 15 7 and 15 5 for ft fb dt fn and dn respectively as for canopy air humidity the values are 4 4 4 4 4 0 2 9 and 2 6 respectively soil and canopy air relative humidity generally followed the order of ft fb dt fn dn after irrigation 3 1 2 alternating wet dry behavior of soil water the wet and dry status of soil under mulching was characterized by the increase and decrease of water respectively relative to the soil water content in the fn treatment in this study dn resulted in the drier soil water conditions in the 0 120 cm layer than seen for fn in both years mulching stimulated alternating wet dry behavior of soil water especially under deficit irrigation fig 3 alternating wet dry behavior of soil water mainly occurred in the 0 80 cm soil layer whereas the 80 120 cm soil layer was mainly characterized by intense fluctuation in the wet range alternating wet dry behavior of soil water in the 0 80 cm soil layer changed from wet to dry at v12 and was earlier than v12 in 2020 and then changed from dry to wet at r3 especially under the dt treatment fig 3a d soil in 0 80 cm layer was mostly slightly wetter than the fn treatment under ft and fb in 2020 with more rainfall dt slightly stimulated the alternating wet dry behavior of soil water in the 0 80 cm layer compared with fn in which drier conditions mainly occurred from v12 to r3 averaging 9 9 and 4 0 drier than fn in the 0 20 cm and 20 80 cm layers respectively in 2019 and 7 9 and 16 6 drier than fn in 2020 owing to more rainfall soil water in 0 20 cm for dt presented relative wet compared with fn at r1 in 2020 in contrast much wetter soil water conditions occurred for dt than for fn in the 80 120 cm layer across growth stages with a range of 2 5 36 9 in 2019 and 5 8 66 3 in 2020 ft and fb resulted in much wetter soil water conditions in the 80 120 cm layer than seen for fn in the two study years compared with dn the wetter soil water conditions occurred for dt than for fn in the 0 120 cm layer across growth stages with 19 1 in 2019 and 8 4 in 2020 3 2 temperature variation of the soil crop system 3 2 1 soil temperature and canopy air temperature soil and canopy air temperatures of the soil crop system were greatly affected by mulch treatment and irrigation and varied spatially fig 4 canopy air temperatures slightly increased with canopy height and soil temperature decreased with soil depth in the two study years canopy air temperatures for the mulched treatments ft fb and dt were not significantly different from each other but were significantly lower than the canopy air temperatures in no mulched treatments fn and dn in the two study years plastic film mulching remarkably increased soil temperatures soil temperatures followed the order of ft dt fb dn fn in 2019 and followed the order of dt ft fb dn fn in 2020 plastic film mulching significantly increased soil temperature at v6 and soil temperature under dt in the 0 15 cm layer was significantly higher than under fn during the growing season in both study years soil temperature and canopy air temperature varied with the growth stage soil temperature and canopy air temperature gradually decreased with advancing growth stages and reached the lowest value at r6 generally canopy air temperatures for ft fb and dt were significantly lower than canopy air temperatures for fn by 3 7 3 6 and 3 8 respectively at all measurement heights from 0 to 150 cm above the soil surface in 2019 and by 3 4 3 5 and 2 5 in 2020 plastic film mulching remarkably increased soil temperature in the two study years ft fb and dt increased soil temperatures in the 0 25 cm layer by 0 85 0 39 and 0 78 c respectively in 2019 and by 0 73 0 80 and 1 24 c in 2020 relative to the soil temperatures measured under fn 3 2 2 diurnal temperature amplitude diurnal temperature amplitude was reduced under ft fb dt and dn fig 5 compared with fn diurnal temperature amplitudes for ft fb dt and dn were 1 4 1 1 1 8 and 0 7 c respectively lower than for fn at the emergence stage in 2019 and 0 4 0 2 0 7 and 0 1 c lower in 2020 ft fb dt and dn decreased diurnal temperature amplitude by 1 3 1 0 1 6 and 0 4 c respectively at the vegetative growth stage in 2019 and by 2 1 0 7 2 2 and 0 5 c in 2020 the respective reductions in diurnal temperature amplitude were 0 9 0 7 1 1 and 0 3 c respectively at the reproductive growth stage in 2019 and 1 1 0 7 0 8 and 0 5 c in 2020 during the entire growing season the diurnal temperature amplitudes under ft fb and dt were 1 1 0 8 1 3 and 0 4 c respectively lower than fn in 2019 and 1 2 0 6 1 1 and 0 4 c lower in 2020 3 3 chlorophyll concentration and net photosynthesis rate leaf chlorophyll concentration first increased and then decreased across the v12 r1 r3 and r6 maize growth stages for all treatments during the two study years fig 6 maximum values occurred at r1 after which chlorophyll concentration gradually decreased as plants senesced leaf chlorophyll concentrations for mulched treatments were significantly higher than for the no mulched treatments p 0 05 no significant difference was observed in chlorophyll concentration between the full irrigation treatments and the deficit irrigation treatment under mulching chlorophyll concentrations under transparent and black plastic film mulching were not significantly different from each other during any of the growth stages in 2019 and 2020 net photosynthesis rate a increased from v9 to r1 and slightly declined from r1 to r3 in the two study years fig 7 the a values for mulched treatments were significantly greater than that for fn and dn at different growth stages in both study years the a values for ft were significantly higher than that for fb at v9 and for dt at any maize growth stages in both study years generally the average a values were 36 7 35 5 33 9 29 4 and 26 0 μmol m 2 s 1 for ft fb dt fn and dn respectively in 2019 and 38 8 37 6 36 0 31 6 and 28 5 μmol m 2 s 1 in 2020 ft fb dt and fn significantly increased net photosynthesis rate as compared with dn by 41 2 36 5 30 1 and 13 3 respectively in 2019 and by 36 1 31 9 26 2 and 10 7 in 2020 3 4 leaf area index and dry matter accumulation the dynamic processes of leaf area index lai development and dry matter accumulation for spring maize during the two growing seasons are presented in fig 8 lai first increased and then decreased and reached maximum values at r1 in the two study years lai values for ft and fb were significantly higher than for no mulched treatments fn and dn and lai for dt was significantly higher than for fn and dn at v6 and v12 in 2019 fig 8a and for all growth stages in 2020 fig 8b lai values for ft fb and dt were not significantly different from one another in 2019 and 2020 at r1 i e 89 days after planting lai was 44 3 and 13 8 greater for ft than for fn in 2019 and 2020 respectively 22 2 and 12 2 greater for fb than for fn and 8 7 and 9 6 greater for dt than for fn generally lai for ft fb dt and fn were 40 3 33 7 22 6 and 9 1 greater than that for dn in 2019 respectively and 24 0 23 5 18 8 and 6 6 greater in 2020 dry matter accumulation initially increased gradually for all treatments during the two growing seasons and then increased more rapidly as the season progressed reaching maximum values at r6 dry matter accumulations for ft fb and dt were significantly higher than for fn and dn in 2019 and 2020 dry matter accumulation for dt was significantly higher than for fn and dn at v6 v12 and r3 in 2019 and 2020 dry matter accumulations for dt ft and fb were not significantly different from another in 2019 fig 8c and dry matter accumulation for dt was significantly lower than for fb at v6 and lower than for ft at v6 v12 r1 and r3 in 2020 fig 8d at r6 i e 130 days after planting dry matter accumulation was significantly greater for ft by 20 4 and 19 5 than for fn in 2019 and 2020 respectively and similarly greater for fb by 16 2 and 19 4 and greater for dt by 8 8 and 6 4 than for fn generally dry matter accumulation for ft fb dt and fn were 40 0 36 9 27 6 and 12 8 greater than that for dn in 2019 respectively and 48 0 42 3 31 7 and 15 4 greater in 2020 3 5 yield and economic benefit yield crop water productivity and economic benefit of spring maize under the five treatments were evaluated in the two study years table 2 yield and wpc under ft fb and dt were significantly greater than under fn ft fb dt and fn significantly increased grain yields compared with dn by 39 7 25 5 18 2 and 9 0 respectively in 2019 and by 45 8 41 8 33 4 and 17 0 in 2020 yields for dt and fb were not significantly different and they were significantly lower than yields for ft in 2019 in 2020 the yield for ft and fb were not significantly different from each other and they were significantly higher than observed for dt crop water productivity for dt was significantly higher than that for the other treatments in 2019 and 2020 ft fb dt and dn significantly increased wpc compared with fn by 39 0 26 6 45 2 and 16 6 respectively in 2019 and by 29 4 31 2 48 3 and 8 2 in 2020 moreover dt saved 40 of the water resources in an arid water shortage area generally total input values were lower under dn and fn compared with other mulching treatments due to no film mulch costs and followed the order of dn fn dt ft fb nevertheless the output value for mulching treatments was remarkably higher than for fn and dn the net income for ft fb dt and fn was 894 436 343 and 166 usd ha 1 higher than for dn in 2019 respectively and 1127 979 844 and 429 usd ha 1 higher in 2020 the net income and output input for fb and dt showed little difference between the two study years and dt saved 200 mm of irrigation water net income and output input were 28 1 and 10 9 respectively lower for dt than for ft in 2019 however these values were only 12 3 and 4 0 lower for dt than for ft in the relatively wetter growing season of 2020 net income ranged from 1068 to 1962 usd ha 1 in 2019 and from 1166 to 2293 usd ha 1 in 2020 with the highest values recorded for ft and the lowest values recorded for dn in 2019 and 2020 3 6 correlation between plant growth and water and temperature of the soil crop system 3 6 1 correlation between yield net income canopy air temperature and humidity leaf physiological characteristics and plant growth correlations between yield net income canopy air temperature and humidity leaf physiological characteristics and plant growth for the two study years are shown in fig 9 generally leaf chlorophyll concentration cc net photosynthesis rate lai and dry matter accumulation dma were positively correlated with maize yield y and net income ni with the positive correlation coefficients almost reaching 0 99 in 2020 net income had strong positive correlations with y in both study years canopy air relative humidity ch had weak positive correlations with yield lai dry matter accumulation and net income in the two study years remarkably diurnal temperature amplitude dta and canopy air temperature ct were negatively correlated with yield and net income in the two study years in both years diurnal temperature amplitude and canopy air temperature were negatively correlated with leaf chlorophyll concentration net photosynthesis rate lai and dry matter accumulation canopy air temperature had strong negative correlations with leaf chlorophyll concentration net photosynthesis rate lai and dry matter accumulation especially in 2020 fig 9b 3 6 2 the relationship between leaf net photosynthesis rate and canopy air humidity and temperature the relationship between leaf net photosynthesis rate and canopy air relative humidity was quadratic r 2 0 4888 p 0 01 with the maximum net photosynthesis rate of 38 3 μmol m 2 s 1 observed at the canopy air relative humidity of 78 6 fig 10a in contrast the relationship between net photosynthesis rate and canopy air temperature was linear r 2 0 3158 p 0 01 and net photosynthesis rate decreased with the increasing canopy air temperature in this study fig 10b 4 discussion 4 1 hydrothermal status of the soil crop system 4 1 1 the wet dry alternative pattern plastic film mulching can significantly improve soil water content but soil water content was not significantly different between transparent or black plastic film mulch li et al 2021 owing to the enhanced transpiration under mulching and the intense demand for water by maize and coupled with the lower irrigation amount soil relative humidity under dt was lower than that under fn in the 0 60 cm soil layer especially at v12 r1 and r3 fig 2b d and g i these results are consistent with previous studies li et al 2017 qin et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a notably soil relative humidity for dt was remarkably higher than that for dn the pattern we observed of soil wetting drying wetting may be a water use strategy under plastic film mulching that effectively improves water use and optimizes soil water status in an arid water shortage area previous research confirmed this pattern in semiarid rainfed regions we referred to this pattern as the alternating wet dry behavior of soil water zhang et al 2019a 2019b our study also confirmed that this pattern of alternating wet dry behavior of soil water mainly occurred in the 0 80 cm soil layer especially under dt fig 3 soil water evaporation is the main component of crop water consumption at the early growth stages when plants are small and plastic film mulching has the greatest potential to reduce soil water loss by evaporation bu et al 2013 therefore mulched treatments showed soil wetting relative to no mulched treatments at v6 mulched maize experiences faster canopy growth than non mulched maize resulting in greater transpiration that may eventually offset the early season soil moisture improvement provided by mulching li et al 2017 especially under deficit irrigation thus soil drying relative to fn mainly occurred from v12 to r3 owing to the shallow groundwater table and irrigation soil moisture under mulched treatments was much higher than observed under non mulched treatments in the 80 120 cm soil layer and thus intense wetting relative to fn occurred in the 80 120 cm layer during the growing season fig 3e f at r6 maize transpiration tends to decrease and soil moisture under mulched treatments returns to a relatively favorable state mo et al 2016 notably dt presented the more soil wetting relative to dn during the whole growth stage the alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd is always applied in rice production yao et al 2012 ye et al 2013 rice is adaptable to intermittent irrigation thus there is no necessary for continuous irrigation awd can enhance root biomass dong et al 2012 obtaine similar yield and profits but reduce irrigation duration and amount rejesus et al 2011 as for maize production compared with increasing 200 mm irrigation amount plastic film mulching promoted maize efficient water use that is soil wetting and drying pattern in 0 80 cm soil layer and obtained significantly high yield and economic benefits this alternating soil wetting and drying pattern relative to fn can be used as an efficient water use strategy in areas with limited water resources li et al 2017 ye et al 2013 during the critical period of water demand v12 r3 dt may enhance water absorption and utilization of deep soil water thus relieving water stress jia et al 2018 studies presented that plants can rapidly recover growth and quickly eliminate some detrimental water stress effects after rehydration luo et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a in this study owing to the supplemental irrigation and the effect of plastic film mulching the mean relative soil water for dt and fn in the 0 120 cm layer was at a similar level during the high water demand growth stages v12 r3 and dt showed soil wetting relative to fn at r6 fig 3 4 1 2 the canopy micro environments canopy air temperature and humidity are important indicators of crop microclimate higher canopy air humidity may cause an increased incidence of plant diseases and insect pests thus limiting crop yields lower canopy air humidity results in partial closure of stomata thereby inhibiting photosynthesis and transpiration we found that canopy air relative humidity was positively correlated with leaf net photosynthesis rate and maize growth fig 9 moreover plastic film mulching significantly increased canopy air relative humidity at v6 v12 r1 and r6 especially for ft and dt and values were lower than the optimal value 78 6 fig 10a although plastic film mulching increased canopy air relative humidity at r3 to a value 78 6 that was higher than the optimal value relative humidity differences among treatments were not significantly different compared with fn transparent plastic film mulching coupled with deficit irrigation resulted in a better water environment for the soil crop system than the fn treatment and this in combination with alternating wet dry behavior of soil water positively stimulated crop evapotranspiration to use water efficiently while saving water resources canopy air temperature can vary with cultivars and treatments plants under water stress typically have higher canopy air temperatures dejonge et al 2015 and cooler canopy air temperatures have been shown to consistently increase leaf water use efficiency and contribute to greater canopy water use efficiency sexton et al 2021 furthermore cooler canopies can reduce water loss and increase grain yield roohi et al 2015 thapa et al 2018 and biomass gautam et al 2015 guo et al 2016 sexton et al 2021 our research showed similar results i e canopy air temperature had strong negative correlations with leaf physiological characteristics plant growth and final yield fig 9 plastic film mulching significantly decreased canopy air temperature fig 4 and this was more probably to increase canopy water use efficiency and enhance grain yield lower canopy air temperature and higher soil temperature under mulches would reduce respiratory expenditures and facilitate root activity such that crop photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation may be accelerated jia et al 2018 sunoj et al 2016 previous research showed that leaf chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate had strong negative correlations with canopy air temperature roohi et al 2015 mulched treatments with significantly lower canopy air temperatures higher canopy air humidity and better soil moisture and temperature conditions produced significantly higher net photosynthetic rates and chlorophyll concentrations compared with fn transparent plastic film mulching coupled with deficit irrigation presented a better temperature environment for the soil crop system and positively promoted crop growth and assimilation 4 1 3 soil temperature plastic film mulching can prevent heat loss and increase soil temperature in the early growing season daryanto et al 2017 liu et al 2014 werf 2010 because of radiative reflection absorption and transmission soil temperature for the black film mulch was lower than soil temperature for the transparent film mulch mbah et al 2010 the higher soil temperature coupled with good soil moisture conditions under plastic film mulching at v6 can promote seedling emergence of spring maize especially in cold springs liu et al 2009 owing to the covering effect of leaves cover the soil warming effect of mulches diminished when the plants became larger subrahmaniyan et al 2018 there was little difference in soil temperature among the plastic film mulch treatments and non mulched treatments at r1 and r3 especially in the 10 25 cm soil layer furthermore irrigation and fertilization at r3 in this study effectively avoided nutrient deficits and premature leaf senescence at this critical growth stage especially for the transparent plastic film mulching treatment fig 8 li et al 2021 plastic film mulching treatments resulted in lower diurnal temperature amplitude than fn in both years fig 4 especially under deficit irrigation this result was mainly due to the increased nighttime soil temperature for the mulched treatments zhang et al 2019b higher soil temperature at night would facilitate rapid recovery of root activity in the morning jia et al 2018 moreover a moderate increase in nighttime soil temperatures may promote subsequent day photosynthetic rates during the vegetative stage yang et al 2016 this was conducive to seed germination and crop development higher soil temperatures at early stages coupled with lower diurnal temperature amplitude high nighttime soil temperature under mulches provided a more favorable soil temperature environment for seed germination and crop growth especially under transparent plastic film mulching 4 2 photosynthesis characteristics photosynthesis which plays an important role in crop production is a crucial physiological process affected by plastic film mulching and irrigation amount ali et al 2018 li et al 2019 photosynthesis and chlorophyll concentration are most sensitive to water and temperature stress luo et al 2011 roohi et al 2015 photosynthetic performance had the strong positive correlation with grain yield fang et al 2018 and decreasing net photosynthesis rate may reduce the supply of photosynthates available for grain filling thereby leading to lower grain yield tao et al 2016 li et al 2021 showed that leaf net photosynthesis rate presented the strong positive correlations with soil water and temperature low canopy air humidity can inhibit photosynthesis owing to the partial closure of stomata and low canopy air temperature can reduce water loss and increase canopy water use efficiency and grain yield roohi et al 2015 sexton et al 2021 thapa et al 2018 according to the relationships for canopy air relative humidity or temperature vs leaf net photosynthesis rate fig 10 dt and ft were more probably to obtain optimal canopy air relative humidity and canopy air temperatures during the maize growing seasons low canopy air temperature and high soil temperature under mulches facilitate crop photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation jia et al 2018 sunoj et al 2016 our study showed the similar results as other s research mentioned above the superior hydrothermal conditions of the soil crop system for ft facilitated higher photosynthesis performance and grain yield and dt with improved hydrothermal conditions of the soil crop system could obtain high photosynthesis performance and acceptable yield and net income especially during spring maize growing season with more rainfall 4 3 crop growth and economic benefits the better hydrothermal environment of the soil crop system under ft and fb significantly increased lai values and dry matter accumulation during the maize growing season fig 8 alternating wet dry behavior of soil water and lower diurnal temperature amplitude coupled with the better hydrothermal environment under dt significantly promoted maize physiological characteristics leaf chlorophyll concentration and net photosynthesis rate and growth lai and dry matter accumulation compared with fn this result indicated that mulching can replace part of the irrigation requirement and the combination of film mulching and some degree of deficit irrigation could improve the hydrothermal environment promote plant growth and maintain crop yield at a desirable level table 2 notably wpc for dt was significantly higher than it was for other treatments dt saved 40 of the water resources in an arid water shortage area although an additional input was paid for labor and plastic film cost the mulched treatments resulted in appreciable increases in crop grain yield thus producing greater net income input values were higher with black film than with transparent film in this study since the price of the black film was higher than that of the transparent film moreover grain yield for the black film treatment was lower than for the transparent film treatment therefore the net income and output input values for ft were higher than for fb table 2 dt decreased irrigation input compared with ft and fb but produced acceptable grain yield especially in 2020 when more rain fell consequently the net income and output input values for dt were at a desirable level 5 conclusions in an arid irrigation district an improved hydrothermal environment for the soil crop system was achieved by plastic film mulching alternating wet dry behavior of soil water induced by plastic film mulching was an effective water utilization strategy that increased crop water productivity the lower diurnal temperature amplitude canopy air temperature and higher canopy air relative humidity with the use of plastic film mulching induced more rapid and vigorous plant growth as a result plastic film mulching significantly increased leaf chlorophyll concentration and net photosynthesis rate during the maize growing season higher net photosynthesis rate was obtained at the canopy air relative humidity of 78 6 and net photosynthesis rate decreased with increasing canopy air temperature compared with full irrigation with transparent plastic film mulching deficit irrigation with transparent plastic film mulching significantly increased crop water productivity decreased net income by 28 1 in 2019 however these values was only 12 3 in the relatively wetter growing season of 2020 taken together deficit irrigation combined with transparent plastic film mulching enhance crop water productivity ensure acceptable maize grain yield and net income in arid areas with limited water resources especially during growing seasons with more rainfall

9583,water availability is the most critical restriction for sustainable crop plantation in the arid region consequently it is essential to quantify the soil water balance and optimize the irrigation schedules in the farmland however the effects of cultivation history on crop field water balance and optimized irrigation design were rarely studied in this study three typical maize zea mays l fields with different cultivation histories i e old oasis maize field of new maize field developed from a wetland nfw new maize field developed from the desert nfd in arid regions of northwest china were selected which had major differences in soil textures and gwls based on one growth season i e from april 30th to september 30th in situ field monitoring e g soil water content maize growth index meteorological data and numerical model hydrus 1d simulation the water balance and root water uptake deficit in these fields were quantified and optimized irrigation schedules were proposed during the maize growth period under the current irrigation schedule the highest percolation was observed in of 364 mm followed by nfd 231 mm and nfw 52 mm the soil water in nfw was obviously recharged by the capillary rise from groundwater while the of and nfd were not also the most severe water deficit was identified in nfd followed by nfw and of compared with the current irrigation schedule the irrigation was reduced by 65 45 and 13 under the optimized irrigation amount in nfw of and nfd respectively furthermore it was reduced by 84 61 and 23 under both irrigation time and amount optimized in nfw of and nfd respectively under either optimized irrigation the water deficit was relieved deep percolation was reduced during the maize growth period and less soil water was stored after maize was harvested especially under irrigation time and amount optimizing the least irrigation times 4 and amount 90 mm were applied in nfw among three fields ascribing to a large amount of water recharge from shallow groundwater by capillary rise due to the soil texture differences fewer irrigation times 6 with considerable single irrigation amount 30 70 mm was recommended for of with loamy soil whereas more irrigation times 12 with less single irrigation 25 50 mm were appropriated for nfd with sandy soil it concluded that the effects of soil texture and gwl should be well considered for optimizing irrigation schedules keywords deep percolation relative transpiration rate capillary rise water saving hydrus 1d 1 introduction water scarcity is a global problem especially in the arid regions where water shortages have become one of the main limitations for ecological restoration agricultural production and industry development kahil et al 2015 liu et al 2010 xu et al 2019 the water shortage problem is also severe in northwest china especially with large populations and plenty of farmland zhang et al 2019a zhao and zhao 2014 the resident and farmland in northwest china are concentrated around the rivers such as the yellow river tarim river and heihe river in this area for years with limited precipitation river water was the primary water resource and most of them were used for irrigation liu et al 2010 xu et al 2019 also the irrigation water demand was increasing as large farmland areas were newly developed in the last forty years liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b however the rapidly increased water use requirement for industry development and residents living asked to reduce irrigation water consumption zhang et al 2019a hence adapting the water saving irrigation schedule was necessary to relieve the water shortage problem and thus realize sustainable agricultural production and social development in the arid region hochmuth et al 2015 ji et al 2007 zhao and zhao 2014 the heihe river basin is the second largest inland river basin 140 000 km2 in arid regions of northwest china and is one of the main areas for maize zea mays l production tan and zheng 2017 zhang et al 2019a due to the limited precipitation in the maize growth season 70 mm in this area the heihe river water and groundwater were the primary water resources for maize growth hochmuth et al 2015 li 2020 zhao et al 2010 in this area the maize was widely planted in the farmland with various cultivation histories which were mainly characterized by different soil types and groundwater levels gwls fig 1 the oldest farmland was located along the heihe river with fine textured soil and was cultivated for hundreds to thousands of years which was so called old oasis farmland of with thick loamy textural soil layer and deep gwl zhao and zhao 2014 to improve the agricultural production and economic income the local farmers developed a considerable amount of farmland from the wetland close by the heihe river or in the desert nearby the edge of the oasis in the last forty years li 2020 su et al 2014 these fields were so called new farmland developed from wetland nfw with thick sandy textural soil layer covered with thin loamy textural soil layer and shallow gwl or new farmland from the desert nfd with thick sandy textural soil layer and deep gwl as a sequence the rapid increment of farmland area intensified the irrigation water consumption and aggravated the water shortage problem at present flood irrigation is dominated in the farmland as the drip irrigation system was too expensive for the local government and farmers to afford the irrigation schedule in a maize field was carried out mainly based on the farming experience and accessibility to water resources which often resulted in a low water use efficiency and a large proportion of deep percolation li 2020 zhang et al 2019b zhou and zhao 2019 therefore quantifying water balance and improving the irrigation schedule in the maize field were urgent and necessary to mitigate the water shortage problem many studies have been conducted to quantify the water balance and calculate water requirements under various cropland in this area ji et al 2007 li and wang 2021 li et al 2012 liu et al 2010 su et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 zhou and zhao 2019 meanwhile the potential evapotranspiration et p was often used for optimized irrigation and water allocation design liu et al 2010 tan and zheng 2017 zhao et al 2010 which was mainly affected by the meteorological data and crop growth indexes however the crop root water uptake and soil water movement were also strongly influenced by soil texture forkutsa et al 2009 and gwl babajimopoulos et al 2007 ren et al 2016 satchithanantham et al 2014 which affected the soil water balance characteristic and optimized irrigation design it is known that the soil hydraulic properties e g hydraulic conductivity soil water retention curve were strongly dependent on the soil texture which affected the soil water movement and root water uptake further bahmani and bayram 2018 katerji and mastrorilli 2009 yi et al 2020 forkutsa et al 2009 found that the optimized irrigation strategies were strongly dependent on the soil types and addressed that a method of frequent irrigation with a small single irrigation amount was suitable for the sandy field rather than the loamy field also su et al 2014 suggested that more irrigation was needed for the maize field characterized by the sandy soil than the loamy soil meanwhile the gwl should also be considered for the water saving optimized irrigation scheduling it was reported that the shallow groundwater recharged the soil water through the capillary rise which significantly minimized the irrigation amount forkutsa et al 2009 ren et al 2016 tan et al 2014 although plenty of studies about water balance in the maize field were reported in the heihe river basin li 2020 zhao and zhao 2014 zhou and zhao 2019 the comparison among these maize fields with different soil textures or gwls were rarely reported a few studies reported optimizing irrigation schedules in the maize field in recent years in the study area li et al 2012 and li and wang 2021 suggested that the optimized total irrigation amounts in the maize fields with clay loamy soil and sandy soil were 500 600 mm and 632 836 mm according to the scenario modeling results with coupled model i e hydrus 1d and wofost and aquacrop model respectively also the detailed optimized irrigation schedule was only proposed in the nfd sandy soil by zhou and zhao 2019 who suggested irrigated for 14 times with 50 mm per event from the scenario modeling results with cropwater model as a consequence more studies were needed for quantifying the water balance and scheduling the optimized irrigation in the maize fields in the heihe river basin especially considering the differences in soil texture and gwl the water balance in the field could be quantified by the water balance method based on the mass conservation mateos et al 2002 yazaki et al 2006 zhao and zhao 2014 or a hydrodynamic model based on the richards equation forkutsa et al 2009 ji et al 2007 mokari et al 2019 comparatively the hydrodynamic model had a better performance for modeling soil water movement as the soil water movement equation and related soil parameters were physically based with the help of a hydrodynamic model such as hydrus 1d we could obtain the detailed water fluxes information with high spatial and temporal resolutions after the model was calibrated with limited measured data jyotiprava dash et al 2014 mo allim et al 2018 tan et al 2014 also it is adequate for optimized irrigation design with scenario simulations forkutsa et al 2009 li et al 2015 the study s objectives were 1 to quantify the water balances under current irrigation schedules in the maize fields with different soil textures and gwls and 2 to improve the irrigation schedules by scenario simulation with the hydrus 1d model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment sites were located in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin northwest china characteristic of the representative piedmont valley plain oasis the climate is continental arid temperate having an annual average precipitation of 112 mm 1965 2015 with about 60 of the precipitation characterized with low rainfall intensity during july to september the annual pan evaporation is approximately 2400 mm the average annual temperature is 7 6 c with the maximum and minimum temperatures of 39 1 and 27 8 c respectively zhao and zhao 2014 zhou and zhao 2019 three typical maize fields with different cultivation histories were distributed from the heihe river beach to the desert fig 1 including old oasis farmland of new farmland developed from wetland nfw and new farmland developed from the desert nfd there were apparent differences in soil texture table 1 and gwl in three maize fields the of was cultivated for hundred years and it was characterized by the thick loamy soil profile 3 0 m with deep gwl 4 0 m zhao and zhao 2014 the nfw was developed from the riverine wetland in the 1980 s which was characterized by thick riverbed coarse sand covered with 20 60 cm depth loamy soil layer and shallow gwl 0 4 1 5 m the nfd was developed from the desert in the 1980 s which was characterized by the thick sandy soil layer 3 0 m and deep gwl 3 0 m li and wang 2021 in addition to higher silt and clay contents observed in surface soil 0 20 cm which were mainly attributed to the fine particles deposition by irrigation water from the heihe river su et al 2014 the planting system was ruled by the seed company and local government with the so called seed maize i e spring maize for seed production planted in the of and field maize i e spring maize for fodder production grown in the nfw and nfd the seed maize production in of mainly ascribed to its higher soil quality and better irrigation conditions which affected the maize seed quality further compared to field maize the seed maize was characterized by less biomass shorter height and lower lai due to species differences in addition the male parent maize in the of was cut down in late july which occupied 20 of the plants in the field the local farmers managed three fields based on their long term farming experiences the soil surface in the of and nfd were covered with plastic film to reduce soil evaporation with an area of about 55 whereas the nfw was not as it was always wet due to the shallow gwl three fields were flat and were flood irrigated by the heihe river water or the groundwater the current irrigation schedules in the study area mainly depended on the long term farming experience available water conditions and labor availability rather than considering water saving as the low financial cost of irrigation water li and wang 2021 zhao et al 2010 based on the experience of local farmers less irrigation amount and times were carried out in nfw 544 mm six times with the shallow gwl compared with of 800 mm eight times and nfd 597 mm ten times fig 2 affected by the limited water availability due to the shortage of irrigation well and irrigation systems at the oasis boundary nfd location less irrigation was applied in nfd than of also the of was paid more attention by the local farmers as its gross economic income 40 000 cny hm2 was much higher than that of nfd 25 000 cny hm2 hence the irrigation was conducted in advance in the of when the water resources or labor availability was restricted 2 2 field and laboratory measurements two time domain reflectometry tdr access tubes were installed in each field to measure the soil water content swc with trime tdr pico iph t3 imko germany tdr tubes were located under the plastic film and bare soil respectively the weighted average measured value of these two sites was taken in each field the swc measurements were taken every 10 cm from the soil surface to 150 cm depth with 1 3 days interval the calibration of tdr was performed in the field as described by yi et al 2014 the gwl was monitored in nfw but not in op and nfd on considering whether the gwl could affect the swc in the root zone or not every day the gwls at nfw and the heihe river beach were automatically recorded with a water level logger u20l 04 hobo usa at the beginning of the experiment profiled soil samples in three maize fields were collected to determine soil texture pipette method bulk density oven drying method saturated water content oven drying method and saturated hydraulic conductivity k s constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 these soil physical properties in the three fields are shown in table 1 the maize growth indexes in each field were collected from april 30th to september 30th in 2013 the crop height was measured every 10 15 days with a meter rule with thirty replications and the leaf area index lai was measured with lai 2200 canopy analysis instrument li cor usa every 10 15 days at more than twenty sites in each field the maximum root depth was monthly investigated with a large bore soil auger at three sites i e in the middle zone of plastic film under maize plant and in the middle zone of bare soil with different horizon distances to the maize plant in each field the root distribution along the soil profile was investigated once in late july in which the maximum root biomass was assumed to be achieved as the crop height and lai reached the top values after excavating a 150 cm depth soil profile in each field the cuboid soil samples 25 cm 10 cm 10 cm in volume were taken at three sites with different horizon distances to the maize plant from the soil surface to the profile bottom and then the maize roots were separated and dried at 60 c until a constant mass was achieved daily meteorological data including the precipitation maximum and minimum temperature humidity solar radiation and wind velocity were measured in a weather station at the linze inland river basin comprehensive research station of the chinese ecosystem research network 2 3 model simulation the hydrus 1d model had a good performance in simulating water heat and solute transport in variably saturated porous media šimůnek et al 2016 this model numerically solves richards equation for water flow in variably saturated porous media and has been widely used for various hydrological applications askri et al 2014 jiménez martínez et al 2009 mokari et al 2019 2 3 1 soil

this study the simulated soil domain for three maize fields was 0 150 cm depth soil which was longer than the deepest root depth and value specified initial and boundary conditions at each site were used initial conditions were set in the model for measured swc at the beginning of the simulation period april 30th at the soil surface the atmospheric boundary condition was imposed using daily data of precipitation p potential evaporation e p and t p the daily reference evapotranspiration rate et 0 was calculated using penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 maize potential evapotranspiration rate et p was then calculated by multiplying et 0 by maize growth coefficient which was derived from allen et al 1998 after that the e p and t p were separated from et p based on beer s law 6 e p t e t p t exp k l a i t 7 t p t e t p t e p t where k is an extinction coefficient set to be 0 463 additionally we assumed that the plastic film with 55 area distributed in the of and nfd could reduce e p by 50 as the plastic film was considered impermeable to evaporation allen et al 1998 zhao et al 2018 and few parts of the film were destroyed during maize seeding and fertilizing at the bottom of the domain variable pressure head condition was chosen as the lower boundary condition for the nfw simulation as the gwl was shallow enough 0 5 1 5 m to affect the swc and maize root water uptake the free drainage boundary was used for the of and nfd simulations as the gwl 3 5 m was far from the lower boundary position 2 3 4 model calibration and validation the hydrus 1d model was calibrated and validated by the measured swc θ data in 2013 from april 30th to july 15th and from july 16th to september 30th respectively selected soil hydraulic parameters i e θ r α and n were optimized with the inverse solution embedded into the hydrus 1d model while measured values were used for θ s and k s the initial hydraulic parameters of θ r α and n were obtained by the neural network prediction function in the hydrus 1d model with the soil texture and bulk density during the hydrus 1d model calibration and validation model predictions of average daily swcs at different soil depths were

performed in each field based on the rules of least irrigation amount and less root water uptake deficit for the maize growth for the scenario simulations all settings were the same as these in the simulation of the year 2013 except for the changes in irrigation time and amount the oi schedules were manually confirmed with the trial and error method and the minimum change of irrigation amount in an irrigation event was 1 mm the irrigation amount was rescheduled for the first oi schedule oi 1 but the irrigation date was not also each day s deep percolation was not higher than that under the current irrigation schedule while the relative transpiration rate t a t p was not less than that under the current irrigation schedule for the second oi schedule oi 2 both irrigation amount and irrigation date were rescheduled based on three principles firstly the t a t p did not fall below 0 8 during the whole maize growth period and an irrigation event will be trigged when t a t p falls close to 0 8 the condition that the maize growth was assumed not to be significantly affected than that under sufficient irrigation conditions attia et al 2021 secondly scheduling set as few irrigation times as possible thirdly the threshold value of irrigation amount was chosen when the t a t p was no longer increasing with the increment of the single irrigation amount 3 results 3 1 maize growth indexes soil water content dynamics and modeling performance the three maize fields identified noticeable differences in crop height lai and root distribution fig 3 similar maize height and lai were observed among three fields before june 30th while apparent lower height and lai were observed in the of than nfw and nfd after that the maximum lai for the nfd of and nfw were 3 6 6 1 and 5 9 m2 m 2 respectively and it appeared two weeks earlier in the of i e late june to late july than that in other fields i e middle july to middle august the root distributions investigated in three fields in late july were similar to some degree fig 3c characterized by the decreased root biomass as the soil depth increased however differences also existed the lower depth for 95 cumulative root distribution was about 40 90 and 60 cm for the nfw of and nfd respectively swc fluctuations were observed at all soil layers in three maize fields during the maize growth period fig 4 more notable increments of swc were found at the topsoil layers than deep soil layers after the irrigation rainfall event in three fields the swc below 60 cm soil depth fluctuated lightly in both nfd and of while it changed obviously in nfw also a higher swc was often observed in nfw and of than in nfd with the final sets of selected soil hydraulic parameters i e θ r α and n the swc at different soil layers in three maize fields was well predicted fig 4 which was indicated by the relatively low rmse and mae values in both calibration and validation periods the rmse mae between observed and simulated swc ranged from 0 010 0 008 to 0 054 0 048 cm3 cm 3 with slightly higher rmse mae at topsoil layer than deep soil layers also some differences between the observed and simulated swc were identified for all soil depths for example the swcs at 30 cm and 60 cm in of and 10 cm and 30 cm in nfw were overestimated after irrigation 3 2 water balance and root water uptake deficit water balances in three maize fields during the growth period in the year 2013 are shown in table 2 and fig 5 under the current irrigation schedule of obtained the highest irrigation amount followed by the nfd and nfw the nfw s highest t p and et p were observed followed by nfd and of at the same time a much higher e p was found in nfw than of and nfd differences in e a and t a among three maize fields were identified in general nfw had a higher cumulative e a 179 mm and t a 514 mm than of e a 119 mm t a 435 mm and nfd e a 61 mm t a 451 mm table 2 at the same time the differences in e a and t a rates among the three fields varied with the maize growth period fig 5a b the higher e a rate was likely observed in may and june than in other months a much higher e a rate was identified in nfw than op and nfd during the first two weeks in may with a reverse trend in the next two weeks a much higher e a rate was also found in nfw than op and nfd during the middle of june while nfw and op had a higher e a rate than nfd after that the t a rate gradually increased from late april to late june then maintained at a high level for two months and then decreased a higher daily t a was observed in of and nfd than nfw during may and early june while a similar t a rate was identified in three maize fields in middle june after that the higher t a rate was more likely observed in nfw than of and nfd similarly apparent differences in the lower boundary fluxes lbfs were found in total the most significant cumulative drainage across the lower boundary was observed in of 364 mm followed by nfd 231 mm and nfw 52 mm also the δs decreased most in nfd followed by of and nfw table 2 meanwhile the three fields lower boundary fluxes lbfs dramatically varied with the maize growth fig 5c the most significant fluctuations of lbfs the positive and negative values indicated the capillary rise and deep percolation respectively were observed in nfw 40 to 60 mm d 1 followed by of 18 to 0 mm d 1 and nfd 7 to 0 mm d 1 during the study period soil water percolated lbfs 0 continuously from the lower boundary in both of and nfd while the soil water in nfw was frequently recharged lbfs 0 by the groundwater obvious drainage was likely to be observed following each irrigation event rather than those rainfall events the lbfs in of and nfd were similar before the first irrigation event or during the dry period while apparent differences were observed when irrigation happened root water uptake deficit was identified in three maize fields fig 5d indicated by the low t a t p 0 8 at some time the highest average t a t p was observed in of 0 94 followed by nfw 0 91 and nfd 0 88 the water uptake deficit in three fields was mainly occurred on the days around the irrigation event or before the first irrigation event most days for water deficit were observed in nfd 21 d followed by nfw 15 d and of 8 d 3 3 optimized irrigation schedules details of water balances under two optimized irrigation schedules are shown in table 2 the irrigation amounts under oi 1 were reduced by 354 450 and 30 mm for nfw of and nfd respectively while the total t a increased 4 17 mm in three maize fields according to the less irrigation amount under oi 1 the e a d and δs were also decreased the e a was slightly reduced 0 5 mm in three fields while the cumulative d at the lower boundary was reduced by 335 316 and 78 mm for nfw of and nfd respectively also a more significant decrement of δs was observed in of 63 mm than nfd 8 mm and nfw 2 mm similarly the irrigation amounts under oi 2 were reduced by 454 490 and 157 mm for the nfw of and nfd respectively meanwhile the irrigation times were changed from 6 8 and 9 to 2 6 and 12 for nfw of and nfd respectively compared to the water balance under the current irrigation schedule the e a in oi 2 decreased in both nfw 4 mm and of 22 mm but slightly increased in nfd 12 mm notably the apparent decrement in cumulative d was identified in three maize fields under oi 2 which was reduced by 428 329 and 162 mm for nfw of and nfd respectively also a much more significant reduction of δs was observed in of 109 mm than in nfd 19 mm and nfw 4 mm 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content differences and model simulation the differences in swcs dynamics among the three maize fields were mainly affected by the different irrigation schedules soil textures and gwls with the larger irrigation amount and finer soil texture in of than nfw table 1 a much higher average swc was observed in of 0 24 cm3 cm 3 than nfd 0 09 cm3 cm 3 this result was consistent with the swc observations from zhao and zhao 2014 and li 2020 who monitored the swc in of and nfd respectively with the higher clay and silt contents in of than nfd the much lower k s n and much higher θ r were identified presenting higher water conservation capacity bahmani and bayram 2018 hu et al 2018 although the nfw obtained the slightest irrigation amount and gave the sandy soil texture below 40 cm soil depth the average swc 0 25 cm3 cm 3 was higher than of and nfd the high swc in nfw was mainly attributed to the shallow gwl fig 6 which recharged the soil profile by the capillary rise forkutsa et al 2009 li et al 2015 xie et al 2011 also the rapid gwl fluctuations were well observed to result in the sharp changes of swc at deep soil layers e g 60 90 cm in nfw indicating the monitoring of gwl with a high temporal resolution was essential for vadose zone water movement study with the shallow gwl meanwhile a much higher swc will be observed in nfd if the seed maize was planted and the soil surface was covered with the plastic film as the t p and e p are expected to be obviously reduced the relatively low rmse and mae in all soil layers for calibration and validation periods indicated that the model fitness was acceptable for soil water movement simulation compared with other research in the study region ji et al 2007 zhang et al 2019b the final set of soil hydraulic parameters in this study was close to their results further indicating that the simulated results were reliable also the et a in three maize fields 513 693 mm were close to the results for other studies 531 680 mm in the same region li 2020 zhao and zhao 2014 zhou and zhao 2019 indicating the modeling results were reasonable some differences between the observed and simulated swc in these simulations were mainly attributed to the uncertainty in the swc measurement and spatial variations of soil physical properties mokari et al 2019 zhou and zhao 2019 additionally the soil water movement process with plastic mulch was simplified from two dimensional to vertical direction only in the modeling resulting in further extra errors he et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 however these errors were relatively small and acceptable thus the modeling results could be used further to analyze the water balance details in three maize fields 4 2 evapotranspiration and root water uptake deficit affected by the different lai maize height and plastic film mulching conditions among three maize fields fig 3 apparent differences in e p and t p were identified the much lower e p in of and nfd than nfw was mainly attributed to plastic film mulching in both fields he et al 2018 but the soil surface was bared in nfw in addition the much higher t p identified in nfw and nfd than of was associated with the larger lai and taller height which resulted in the larger et p and higher partitioning of t p from et p duo to the highest e p in nfw much higher e a was also observed in nfw than other two fields implying the plastic film was effective and necessary for water saving in the arid region he et al 2018 li and wang 2021 hence the plastic film mulching was expected to be used in nfw for reducing nonproductive water loss although the water was easily accessible at this site in addition the e a was also affected by the soil texture and irrigation schedules compared with of having a loamy soil texture the sandy soil in nfd was characterized by the low field capacity 0 08 cm3 cm 3 calculated by the soil water retention cure at that the soil suction was 33 kpa and high k s 130 cm d 1 which reduced the evaporation as the surface soil dried out quickly after irrigation precipitation the highest t a in nfw among three maize fields was mainly attributed to the largest t p and sufficient water supply as the soil water was replenished by both irrigation precipitation and shallow groundwater it was consistent with shouse et al 2011 and li et al 2015 who pronounced that the root water uptake was very sensitive to the groundwater table fluctuations although the t p in nfd was larger than of a smaller t a was observed the lowest t a in nfd was mainly attributed to the sandy soil texture and insufficient irrigation amount which resulted in the lowest soil water content potential and actual root water uptake ji et al 2007 this finding was also pronounced by forkutsa et al 2009 who found that the cotton field with loam soil had a much higher t a 479 mm than those fields with sandy loam soil 291 398 mm and sandy soil 182 mm root water uptake deficit t a t p 0 8 was observed in three maize fields implying the current irrigation schedule should be improved ascribing to the theory of the feddes model feddes 1978 for describing root water uptake in the hydrus model the t a was reduced in both dry h 600 cm water limited and wet h 30 cm aeration limited soil conditions during the dry period the water potential gradient between soil and maize root was reduced thus decreasing the root water uptake rate hussain et al 2019 similarly deficient aeration of the root zone in the wet condition restricted root physiological activity and decreased root water uptake rate wang et al 2012 the temporary decrement of transpiration after irrigation was also reported by li and wang 2021 who explained that the quick waterlogging after irrigation restricts canopy development and stomatal conductance due to the smaller amount of irrigation and sandier soil texture in nfd compared to other fields most water limited root water uptake deficits were observed although the shallow groundwater replenished the soil water in nfw the water limited root water uptake deficit event was also observed before the first irrigation event as the root was mainly distributed in the shallow soil layer 0 10 cm and the relative deep gwl 110 cm at that time also the aeration limited root water uptake event was most likely to happen in of 8 times than other fields ascribing to the largest irrigation amount and finer soil texture 4 3 deep percolation and capillary rise the differences in lbfs among the three maize fields were mainly attributed to the different irrigation schedules soil textures and gwls obvious deep percolation fig 4c was identified in three maize fields with a high rate following each irrigation event implying the irrigation schedule should be improved for example the highest percolation rate was identified in of on may 24th with the largest irrigation amount 185 mm other studies also identified the phenomenon of notable deep percolation in the maize field in both of zhao and zhao 2014 and nfd li 2020 zhang et al 2019b zhou and zhao 2019 with the percolation water ratio cumulative percolation total water input ranged from 20 to 68 except for the nfw with shallow gwl both cumulative percolation r 0 895 p 0 01 and percolation water ratio r 0 608 p 0 1 had positive correlations with total water input fig 7 implying the water saving practice was a practical approach for reducing deep percolation although the percolated water could finally recharge the groundwater and be reused in irrigation the soil nutrient e g n p was leached with water percolation which reduced nutrient use efficiency and increased groundwater pollution risk reading et al 2019 zhou and zhao 2019 also more electric energy and labor were used accompanied by more irrigation and wasted by the unwanted percolation meanwhile the overmuch irrigation amount further intensified the nonproductive water loss enhancing e a by increasing the swc at the surface layer ren et al 2016 the soil water recharge from groundwater by capillary rise was only observed in the nfw with shallow gwl which happened before an irrigation event when the upper soil layers were dry the effects of groundwater recharge on soil were also proposed by tan et al 2014 and ren et al 2016 who found that the capillary rise from groundwater was 106 162 mm in the paddy field and 129 230 mm in different crop fields i e maize sunflower and watermelon respectively the capillary rise in nfw in our study area was much higher 536 mm than above studies which was mainly attributed to the higher k s 186 287 cm d 1 for the lower soil layers and more frequent increment of gwl fig 6 considering the large amount of the soil water replenished by groundwater the current irrigation times and amount were expected to reduce in the nfw meanwhile the nonproductive e a would also decrease as the soil surface was drier when the irrigation times and amount were reduced luo and sophocleous 2010 satchithanantham et al 2014 4 4 optimized irrigation schedule and limitations the deep percolation and root water uptake deficit observed in three fields called for the requirement for the irrigation readjustment more irrigation amount reduction was identified in nfw and of than nfd under oi 1 table 2 ascribing to the considerable capillary rise from groundwater in nfw and larger irrigation amount finer soil texture in of although the irrigation amount was significantly reduced under oi 1 fig 8 the average t a t p in nfw of and nfd was increased from 0 91 0 94 and 0 88 to 0 93 0 97 and 0 89 respectively implying the great potential for water saving under current irrigation schedule apparent differences in irrigation schedule were also identified among three maize fields under oi 2 fig 9 mainly attributed to the gwl and soil texture discrepancies due to capillary rise in the nfw with shallow gwl 50 120 cm forkutsa et al 2009 ren et al 2016 the least irrigation amount and times were proposed in the nfw among three maize fields under oi 2 thus it is better to utilize the groundwater by capillary rise compared with the current irrigation schedule it can reduce nonproductive e a electric energy consumption and labor input however the secondary soil salinization should be taken attention as the groundwater is slightly saline 1 2 ds m 1 which was also pronounced by other researchers li et al 2015 shouse et al 2011 the discrepancies in the irrigation schedule under oi 2 between of and nfd were mainly ascribed to their soil texture differences the nfd with sandy soil was characterized by the low field capacity and large k s which was easy for water percolation therefore the strategy of frequent irrigation times 12 times with a relatively small irrigation amount 25 50 mm was suitable for nfd under oi 2 fig 9 compared with nfd the soil in of was characterized by a higher field capacity 0 25 cm3 cm 3 and lower k s 30 cm d 1 which was adapted to the relatively larger irrigation amount 30 70 mm and fewer irrigation times 6 times under oi 2 fig 9 although the differences in irrigation amount between of and nfd were partly attributed to the discrepancies in maize species the irrigation strategy was reliable and consistent with the suggestions from forkutsa et al 2009 and su et al 2014 also the higher et p in nfd than of resulted from the larger lai and taller height led to the higher total irrigation amount in the nfd the et p was usually referenced to irrigation amount in the farmland without groundwater contribution zhao and zhao 2014 zhao et al 2010 however the total water input during the maize growth period in of and nfd under oi 2 was less than or close to the et a ascribing to the relatively high initial swc resulting from winter irrigation in the last year zhang et al 2019b also the optimized irrigation amounts in both oi 1 and oi 2 were expected to be further reduced when the seed maize was planted in nfw and nfd or the soil surface in nfw was covered with the plastic film the improved irrigation schedule was also proposed by other studies in our study area zhou and zhao 2019 and li and wang 2021 recommended that the improved irrigation mount in nfd was 700 mm 14 times with 50 mm per event and 712 mm 11 14 times respectively also li et al 2012 addressed that 500 600 mm total irrigation amount was suitable for the maize field with clay loam soil the higher irrigation amount in the above studies than in this research i e 460 mm in nfd and 310 mm in of is partly ascribed to the different irrigation design principles compared with the improved irrigation schedules with fixed amounts and time li and wang 2021 li et al 2012 zhou and zhao 2019 the irrigation design in this study was more effective as the irrigation precipitation distribution fig 9 matched well with the et 0 and maize growth indexes in both of and nfd figs 2 and 3 a relatively small irrigation amount was proper in the early crop growth period as the et p was relatively low and the root was mainly distributed in the shallow soil layers with the extension of the crop growth period the irrigation amount increased with the et p and root depth increment while in the late crop growth period the irrigation amount was reduced as et p decreased with the crop maturation also the irrigation amount and times were expected to be affected by the rainfall distribution under oi 2 but this influence was limited in the arid area as the precipitation amount was small as the finer soil texture can reduce irrigation times and total amount it is better to irrigate the nfd with heihe river water rather than groundwater as the river water is abundant with fine soil particles for improving the soil properties su et al 2014 corresponding to the reduced irrigation amount under both optimized irrigation schedules the nonproductive water losses e g e a d during the maize growth period were significantly reduced table 2 the water use efficiency was greatly enhanced at the same time as the ratio of t a p i increased from 0 79 0 48 and 0 64 to 1 75 2 56 0 83 1 05 and 0 74 0 86 under oi 1 oi 2 for nfw of and nfd respectively additionally the nonproductive water losses were expected to reduce after the maize was harvested as the soil water storage decreased besides the irrigation time and amount adjustment methods switching the flooding irrigation to drip irrigation can also reduce irrigation he et al 2018 however it currently seems financially infeasible for the maize field in the study area some limitations also existed for the optimized irrigation design the feedback of root water uptake on crop growth was not considered in this study ascribing to the limits of the hydrus model as a result the same maize growth indexes were used for all scenario simulations in each maize field hence it is better to couple the hydrus model with the crop growth model e g wofost dssat to improve the results of optimized irrigation schedules li et al 2012 zhou et al 2012 also the feedback of rescheduled irrigation events on gwl fluctuations in the nfw was not considered under both optimized irrigation schedules which probably overestimated the groundwater contribution and water saving potential nevertheless the significant positive relationships of the gwls between nfw and heihe river beach were identified fig 6b indicating that the gwl in nfw was mainly controlled by the heihe river rather than the irrigation events 5 conclusions the water balances for three typical maize fields in the heihe river basin were quantified based on the field monitoring and simulation and the hydrus 1d model proposed the optimized irrigation schedule in each area the current irrigation schedules were unreasonable in three maize fields characterized by the large deep percolation and apparent root water uptake deficit deep percolation was the largest in the of followed by nfd and nfw as the shallow groundwater recharge diminished the water percolation the water deficit was most severe in the nfd followed by nfw and of proper irrigation could consider the soil texture gwl crop water requirement and root distribution the optimized irrigation design based on the model simulation used less irrigation water for three fields which would result in less nonproductive water loss but even higher t a the groundwater should be used sufficiently in the nfw for water saving as the gwl was relatively shallow considering the different soil textures frequent and relatively small irrigation could be applied in the nfd with sandy soil texture in contrast fewer irrigation times and more significant single irrigation amounts could be applied in the of with loamy soil distribution further research should couple the hydrus

9583,water availability is the most critical restriction for sustainable crop plantation in the arid region consequently it is essential to quantify the soil water balance and optimize the irrigation schedules in the farmland however the effects of cultivation history on crop field water balance and optimized irrigation design were rarely studied in this study three typical maize zea mays l fields with different cultivation histories i e old oasis maize field of new maize field developed from a wetland nfw new maize field developed from the desert nfd in arid regions of northwest china were selected which had major differences in soil textures and gwls based on one growth season i e from april 30th to september 30th in situ field monitoring e g soil water content maize growth index meteorological data and numerical model hydrus 1d simulation the water balance and root water uptake deficit in these fields were quantified and optimized irrigation schedules were proposed during the maize growth period under the current irrigation schedule the highest percolation was observed in of 364 mm followed by nfd 231 mm and nfw 52 mm the soil water in nfw was obviously recharged by the capillary rise from groundwater while the of and nfd were not also the most severe water deficit was identified in nfd followed by nfw and of compared with the current irrigation schedule the irrigation was reduced by 65 45 and 13 under the optimized irrigation amount in nfw of and nfd respectively furthermore it was reduced by 84 61 and 23 under both irrigation time and amount optimized in nfw of and nfd respectively under either optimized irrigation the water deficit was relieved deep percolation was reduced during the maize growth period and less soil water was stored after maize was harvested especially under irrigation time and amount optimizing the least irrigation times 4 and amount 90 mm were applied in nfw among three fields ascribing to a large amount of water recharge from shallow groundwater by capillary rise due to the soil texture differences fewer irrigation times 6 with considerable single irrigation amount 30 70 mm was recommended for of with loamy soil whereas more irrigation times 12 with less single irrigation 25 50 mm were appropriated for nfd with sandy soil it concluded that the effects of soil texture and gwl should be well considered for optimizing irrigation schedules keywords deep percolation relative transpiration rate capillary rise water saving hydrus 1d 1 introduction water scarcity is a global problem especially in the arid regions where water shortages have become one of the main limitations for ecological restoration agricultural production and industry development kahil et al 2015 liu et al 2010 xu et al 2019 the water shortage problem is also severe in northwest china especially with large populations and plenty of farmland zhang et al 2019a zhao and zhao 2014 the resident and farmland in northwest china are concentrated around the rivers such as the yellow river tarim river and heihe river in this area for years with limited precipitation river water was the primary water resource and most of them were used for irrigation liu et al 2010 xu et al 2019 also the irrigation water demand was increasing as large farmland areas were newly developed in the last forty years liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b however the rapidly increased water use requirement for industry development and residents living asked to reduce irrigation water consumption zhang et al 2019a hence adapting the water saving irrigation schedule was necessary to relieve the water shortage problem and thus realize sustainable agricultural production and social development in the arid region hochmuth et al 2015 ji et al 2007 zhao and zhao 2014 the heihe river basin is the second largest inland river basin 140 000 km2 in arid regions of northwest china and is one of the main areas for maize zea mays l production tan and zheng 2017 zhang et al 2019a due to the limited precipitation in the maize growth season 70 mm in this area the heihe river water and groundwater were the primary water resources for maize growth hochmuth et al 2015 li 2020 zhao et al 2010 in this area the maize was widely planted in the farmland with various cultivation histories which were mainly characterized by different soil types and groundwater levels gwls fig 1 the oldest farmland was located along the heihe river with fine textured soil and was cultivated for hundreds to thousands of years which was so called old oasis farmland of with thick loamy textural soil layer and deep gwl zhao and zhao 2014 to improve the agricultural production and economic income the local farmers developed a considerable amount of farmland from the wetland close by the heihe river or in the desert nearby the edge of the oasis in the last forty years li 2020 su et al 2014 these fields were so called new farmland developed from wetland nfw with thick sandy textural soil layer covered with thin loamy textural soil layer and shallow gwl or new farmland from the desert nfd with thick sandy textural soil layer and deep gwl as a sequence the rapid increment of farmland area intensified the irrigation water consumption and aggravated the water shortage problem at present flood irrigation is dominated in the farmland as the drip irrigation system was too expensive for the local government and farmers to afford the irrigation schedule in a maize field was carried out mainly based on the farming experience and accessibility to water resources which often resulted in a low water use efficiency and a large proportion of deep percolation li 2020 zhang et al 2019b zhou and zhao 2019 therefore quantifying water balance and improving the irrigation schedule in the maize field were urgent and necessary to mitigate the water shortage problem many studies have been conducted to quantify the water balance and calculate water requirements under various cropland in this area ji et al 2007 li and wang 2021 li et al 2012 liu et al 2010 su et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 zhou and zhao 2019 meanwhile the potential evapotranspiration et p was often used for optimized irrigation and water allocation design liu et al 2010 tan and zheng 2017 zhao et al 2010 which was mainly affected by the meteorological data and crop growth indexes however the crop root water uptake and soil water movement were also strongly influenced by soil texture forkutsa et al 2009 and gwl babajimopoulos et al 2007 ren et al 2016 satchithanantham et al 2014 which affected the soil water balance characteristic and optimized irrigation design it is known that the soil hydraulic properties e g hydraulic conductivity soil water retention curve were strongly dependent on the soil texture which affected the soil water movement and root water uptake further bahmani and bayram 2018 katerji and mastrorilli 2009 yi et al 2020 forkutsa et al 2009 found that the optimized irrigation strategies were strongly dependent on the soil types and addressed that a method of frequent irrigation with a small single irrigation amount was suitable for the sandy field rather than the loamy field also su et al 2014 suggested that more irrigation was needed for the maize field characterized by the sandy soil than the loamy soil meanwhile the gwl should also be considered for the water saving optimized irrigation scheduling it was reported that the shallow groundwater recharged the soil water through the capillary rise which significantly minimized the irrigation amount forkutsa et al 2009 ren et al 2016 tan et al 2014 although plenty of studies about water balance in the maize field were reported in the heihe river basin li 2020 zhao and zhao 2014 zhou and zhao 2019 the comparison among these maize fields with different soil textures or gwls were rarely reported a few studies reported optimizing irrigation schedules in the maize field in recent years in the study area li et al 2012 and li and wang 2021 suggested that the optimized total irrigation amounts in the maize fields with clay loamy soil and sandy soil were 500 600 mm and 632 836 mm according to the scenario modeling results with coupled model i e hydrus 1d and wofost and aquacrop model respectively also the detailed optimized irrigation schedule was only proposed in the nfd sandy soil by zhou and zhao 2019 who suggested irrigated for 14 times with 50 mm per event from the scenario modeling results with cropwater model as a consequence more studies were needed for quantifying the water balance and scheduling the optimized irrigation in the maize fields in the heihe river basin especially considering the differences in soil texture and gwl the water balance in the field could be quantified by the water balance method based on the mass conservation mateos et al 2002 yazaki et al 2006 zhao and zhao 2014 or a hydrodynamic model based on the richards equation forkutsa et al 2009 ji et al 2007 mokari et al 2019 comparatively the hydrodynamic model had a better performance for modeling soil water movement as the soil water movement equation and related soil parameters were physically based with the help of a hydrodynamic model such as hydrus 1d we could obtain the detailed water fluxes information with high spatial and temporal resolutions after the model was calibrated with limited measured data jyotiprava dash et al 2014 mo allim et al 2018 tan et al 2014 also it is adequate for optimized irrigation design with scenario simulations forkutsa et al 2009 li et al 2015 the study s objectives were 1 to quantify the water balances under current irrigation schedules in the maize fields with different soil textures and gwls and 2 to improve the irrigation schedules by scenario simulation with the hydrus 1d model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment sites were located in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin northwest china characteristic of the representative piedmont valley plain oasis the climate is continental arid temperate having an annual average precipitation of 112 mm 1965 2015 with about 60 of the precipitation characterized with low rainfall intensity during july to september the annual pan evaporation is approximately 2400 mm the average annual temperature is 7 6 c with the maximum and minimum temperatures of 39 1 and 27 8 c respectively zhao and zhao 2014 zhou and zhao 2019 three typical maize fields with different cultivation histories were distributed from the heihe river beach to the desert fig 1 including old oasis farmland of new farmland developed from wetland nfw and new farmland developed from the desert nfd there were apparent differences in soil texture table 1 and gwl in three maize fields the of was cultivated for hundred years and it was characterized by the thick loamy soil profile 3 0 m with deep gwl 4 0 m zhao and zhao 2014 the nfw was developed from the riverine wetland in the 1980 s which was characterized by thick riverbed coarse sand covered with 20 60 cm depth loamy soil layer and shallow gwl 0 4 1 5 m the nfd was developed from the desert in the 1980 s which was characterized by the thick sandy soil layer 3 0 m and deep gwl 3 0 m li and wang 2021 in addition to higher silt and clay contents observed in surface soil 0 20 cm which were mainly attributed to the fine particles deposition by irrigation water from the heihe river su et al 2014 the planting system was ruled by the seed company and local government with the so called seed maize i e spring maize for seed production planted in the of and field maize i e spring maize for fodder production grown in the nfw and nfd the seed maize production in of mainly ascribed to its higher soil quality and better irrigation conditions which affected the maize seed quality further compared to field maize the seed maize was characterized by less biomass shorter height and lower lai due to species differences in addition the male parent maize in the of was cut down in late july which occupied 20 of the plants in the field the local farmers managed three fields based on their long term farming experiences the soil surface in the of and nfd were covered with plastic film to reduce soil evaporation with an area of about 55 whereas the nfw was not as it was always wet due to the shallow gwl three fields were flat and were flood irrigated by the heihe river water or the groundwater the current irrigation schedules in the study area mainly depended on the long term farming experience available water conditions and labor availability rather than considering water saving as the low financial cost of irrigation water li and wang 2021 zhao et al 2010 based on the experience of local farmers less irrigation amount and times were carried out in nfw 544 mm six times with the shallow gwl compared with of 800 mm eight times and nfd 597 mm ten times fig 2 affected by the limited water availability due to the shortage of irrigation well and irrigation systems at the oasis boundary nfd location less irrigation was applied in nfd than of also the of was paid more attention by the local farmers as its gross economic income 40 000 cny hm2 was much higher than that of nfd 25 000 cny hm2 hence the irrigation was conducted in advance in the of when the water resources or labor availability was restricted 2 2 field and laboratory measurements two time domain reflectometry tdr access tubes were installed in each field to measure the soil water content swc with trime tdr pico iph t3 imko germany tdr tubes were located under the plastic film and bare soil respectively the weighted average measured value of these two sites was taken in each field the swc measurements were taken every 10 cm from the soil surface to 150 cm depth with 1 3 days interval the calibration of tdr was performed in the field as described by yi et al 2014 the gwl was monitored in nfw but not in op and nfd on considering whether the gwl could affect the swc in the root zone or not every day the gwls at nfw and the heihe river beach were automatically recorded with a water level logger u20l 04 hobo usa at the beginning of the experiment profiled soil samples in three maize fields were collected to determine soil texture pipette method bulk density oven drying method saturated water content oven drying method and saturated hydraulic conductivity k s constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 these soil physical properties in the three fields are shown in table 1 the maize growth indexes in each field were collected from april 30th to september 30th in 2013 the crop height was measured every 10 15 days with a meter rule with thirty replications and the leaf area index lai was measured with lai 2200 canopy analysis instrument li cor usa every 10 15 days at more than twenty sites in each field the maximum root depth was monthly investigated with a large bore soil auger at three sites i e in the middle zone of plastic film under maize plant and in the middle zone of bare soil with different horizon distances to the maize plant in each field the root distribution along the soil profile was investigated once in late july in which the maximum root biomass was assumed to be achieved as the crop height and lai reached the top values after excavating a 150 cm depth soil profile in each field the cuboid soil samples 25 cm 10 cm 10 cm in volume were taken at three sites with different horizon distances to the maize plant from the soil surface to the profile bottom and then the maize roots were separated and dried at 60 c until a constant mass was achieved daily meteorological data including the precipitation maximum and minimum temperature humidity solar radiation and wind velocity were measured in a weather station at the linze inland river basin comprehensive research station of the chinese ecosystem research network 2 3 model simulation the hydrus 1d model had a good performance in simulating water heat and solute transport in variably saturated porous media šimůnek et al 2016 this model numerically solves richards

this study the simulated soil domain for three maize fields was 0 150 cm depth soil which was longer than the deepest root depth and value specified initial and boundary conditions at each site were used initial conditions were set in the model for measured swc at the beginning of the simulation period april 30th at the soil surface the atmospheric boundary condition was imposed using daily data of precipitation p potential evaporation e p and t p the daily reference evapotranspiration rate et 0 was calculated using penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 maize potential evapotranspiration rate et p was then calculated by multiplying et 0 by maize growth coefficient which was derived from allen et al 1998 after that the e p and t p were separated from et p based on beer s law 6 e p t e t p t exp k l a i t 7 t p t e t p t e p t where k is an extinction coefficient set to be 0 463 additionally we assumed that the plastic film with 55 area distributed in the of and nfd could reduce e p by 50 as the plastic film was considered impermeable to evaporation allen et al 1998 zhao et al 2018 and few parts of the film were destroyed during maize seeding and fertilizing at the bottom of the domain variable pressure head condition was chosen as the lower boundary condition for the nfw simulation as the gwl was shallow enough 0 5 1 5 m to affect the swc and maize root water uptake the free drainage boundary was used for the of and nfd simulations as the gwl 3 5 m was far from the lower boundary position 2 3 4 model calibration and validation the hydrus 1d model was calibrated and validated by the measured swc θ data in 2013 from april 30th to july 15th and from july 16th to september 30th respectively selected soil hydraulic parameters i e θ r α and n were optimized with the inverse solution embedded into the hydrus 1d model while measured values were used for θ s and k s the initial hydraulic parameters of θ r α and n were obtained by the neural network prediction function in the hydrus 1d model with the soil texture and bulk density during the hydrus 1d model calibration and validation model predictions of average daily swcs at different soil depths were

performed in each field based on the rules of least irrigation amount and less root water uptake deficit for the maize growth for the scenario simulations all settings were the same as these in the simulation of the year 2013 except for the changes in irrigation time and amount the oi schedules were manually confirmed with the trial and error method and the minimum change of irrigation amount in an irrigation event was 1 mm the irrigation amount was rescheduled for the first oi schedule oi 1 but the irrigation date was not also each day s deep percolation was not higher than that under the current irrigation schedule while the relative transpiration rate t a t p was not less than that under the current irrigation schedule for the second oi schedule oi 2 both irrigation amount and irrigation date were rescheduled based on three principles firstly the t a t p did not fall below 0 8 during the whole maize growth period and an irrigation event will be trigged when t a t p falls close to 0 8 the condition that the maize growth was assumed not to be significantly affected than that under sufficient irrigation conditions attia et al 2021 secondly scheduling set as few irrigation times as possible thirdly the threshold value of irrigation amount was chosen when the t a t p was no longer increasing with the increment of the single irrigation amount 3 results 3 1 maize growth indexes soil water content dynamics and modeling performance the three maize fields identified noticeable differences in crop height lai and root distribution fig 3 similar maize height and lai were observed among three fields before june 30th while apparent lower height and lai were observed in the of than nfw and nfd after that the maximum lai for the nfd of and nfw were 3 6 6 1 and 5 9 m2 m 2 respectively and it appeared two weeks earlier in the of i e late june to late july than that in other fields i e middle july to middle august the root distributions investigated in three fields in late july were similar to some degree fig 3c characterized by the decreased root biomass as the soil depth increased however differences also existed the lower depth for 95 cumulative root distribution was about 40 90 and 60 cm for the nfw of and nfd respectively swc fluctuations were observed at all soil layers in three maize fields during the maize growth period fig 4 more notable increments of swc were found at the topsoil layers than deep soil layers after the irrigation rainfall event in three fields the swc below 60 cm soil depth fluctuated lightly in both nfd and of while it changed obviously in nfw also a higher swc was often observed in nfw and of than in nfd with the final sets of selected soil hydraulic parameters i e θ r α and n the swc at different soil layers in three maize fields was well predicted fig 4 which was indicated by the relatively low rmse and mae values in both calibration and validation periods the rmse mae between observed and simulated swc ranged from 0 010 0 008 to 0 054 0 048 cm3 cm 3 with slightly higher rmse mae at topsoil layer than deep soil layers also some differences between the observed and simulated swc were identified for all soil depths for example the swcs at 30 cm and 60 cm in of and 10 cm and 30 cm in nfw were overestimated after irrigation 3 2 water balance and root water uptake deficit water balances in three maize fields during the growth period in the year 2013 are shown in table 2 and fig 5 under the current irrigation schedule of obtained the highest irrigation amount followed by the nfd and nfw the nfw s highest t p and et p were observed followed by nfd and of at the same time a much higher e p was found in nfw than of and nfd differences in e a and t a among three maize fields were identified in general nfw had a higher cumulative e a 179 mm and t a 514 mm than of e a 119 mm t a 435 mm and nfd e a 61 mm t a 451 mm table 2 at the same time the differences in e a and t a rates among the three fields varied with the maize growth period fig 5a b the higher e a rate was likely observed in may and june than in other months a much higher e a rate was identified in nfw than op and nfd during the first two weeks in may with a reverse trend in the next two weeks a much higher e a rate was also found in nfw than op and nfd during the middle of june while nfw and op had a higher e a rate than nfd after that the t a rate gradually increased from late april to late june then maintained at a high level for two months and then decreased a higher daily t a was observed in of and nfd than nfw during may and early june while a similar t a rate was identified in three maize fields in middle june after that the higher t a rate was more likely observed in nfw than of and nfd similarly apparent differences in the lower boundary fluxes lbfs were found in total the most significant cumulative drainage across the lower boundary was observed in of 364 mm followed by nfd 231 mm and nfw 52 mm also the δs decreased most in nfd followed by of and nfw table 2 meanwhile the three fields lower boundary fluxes lbfs dramatically varied with the maize growth fig 5c the most significant fluctuations of lbfs the positive and negative values indicated the capillary rise and deep percolation respectively were observed in nfw 40 to 60 mm d 1 followed by of 18 to 0 mm d 1 and nfd 7 to 0 mm d 1 during the study period soil water percolated lbfs 0 continuously from the lower boundary in both of and nfd while the soil water in nfw was frequently recharged lbfs 0 by the groundwater obvious drainage was likely to be observed following each irrigation event rather than those rainfall events the lbfs in of and nfd were similar before the first irrigation event or during the dry period while apparent differences were observed when irrigation happened root water uptake deficit was identified in three maize fields fig 5d indicated by the low t a t p 0 8 at some time the highest average t a t p was observed in of 0 94 followed by nfw 0 91 and nfd 0 88 the water uptake deficit in three fields was mainly occurred on the days around the irrigation event or before the first irrigation event most days for water deficit were observed in nfd 21 d followed by nfw 15 d and of 8 d 3 3 optimized irrigation schedules details of water balances under two optimized irrigation schedules are shown in table 2 the irrigation amounts under oi 1 were reduced by 354 450 and 30 mm for nfw of and nfd respectively while the total t a increased 4 17 mm in three maize fields according to the less irrigation amount under oi 1 the e a d and δs were also decreased the e a was slightly reduced 0 5 mm in three fields while the cumulative d at the lower boundary was reduced by 335 316 and 78 mm for nfw of and nfd respectively also a more significant decrement of δs was observed in of 63 mm than nfd 8 mm and nfw 2 mm similarly the irrigation amounts under oi 2 were reduced by 454 490 and 157 mm for the nfw of and nfd respectively meanwhile the irrigation times were changed from 6 8 and 9 to 2 6 and 12 for nfw of and nfd respectively compared to the water balance under the current irrigation schedule the e a in oi 2 decreased in both nfw 4 mm and of 22 mm but slightly increased in nfd 12 mm notably the apparent decrement in cumulative d was identified in three maize fields under oi 2 which was reduced by 428 329 and 162 mm for nfw of and nfd respectively also a much more significant reduction of δs was observed in of 109 mm than in nfd 19 mm and nfw 4 mm 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content differences and model simulation the differences in swcs dynamics among the three maize fields were mainly affected by the different irrigation schedules soil textures and gwls with the larger irrigation amount and finer soil texture in of than nfw table 1 a much higher average swc was observed in of 0 24 cm3 cm 3 than nfd 0 09 cm3 cm 3 this result was consistent with the swc observations from zhao and zhao 2014 and li 2020 who monitored the swc in of and nfd respectively with the higher clay and silt contents in of than nfd the much lower k s n and much higher θ r were identified presenting higher water conservation capacity bahmani and bayram 2018 hu et al 2018 although the nfw obtained the slightest irrigation amount and gave the sandy soil texture below 40 cm soil depth the average swc 0 25 cm3 cm 3 was higher than of and nfd the high swc in nfw was mainly attributed to the shallow gwl fig 6 which recharged the soil profile by the capillary rise forkutsa et al 2009 li et al 2015 xie et al 2011 also the rapid gwl fluctuations were well observed to result in the sharp changes of swc at deep soil layers e g 60 90 cm in nfw indicating the monitoring of gwl with a high temporal resolution was essential for vadose zone water movement study with the shallow gwl meanwhile a much higher swc will be observed in nfd if the seed maize was planted and the soil surface was covered with the plastic film as the t p and e p are expected to be obviously reduced the relatively low rmse and mae in all soil layers for calibration and validation periods indicated that the model fitness was acceptable for soil water movement simulation compared with other research in the study region ji et al 2007 zhang et al 2019b the final set of soil hydraulic parameters in this study was close to their results further indicating that the simulated results were reliable also the et a in three maize fields 513 693 mm were close to the results for other studies 531 680 mm in the same region li 2020 zhao and zhao 2014 zhou and zhao 2019 indicating the modeling results were reasonable some differences between the observed and simulated swc in these simulations were mainly attributed to the uncertainty in the swc measurement and spatial variations of soil physical properties mokari et al 2019 zhou and zhao 2019 additionally the soil water movement process with plastic mulch was simplified from two dimensional to vertical direction only in the modeling resulting in further extra errors he et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 however these errors were relatively small and acceptable thus the modeling results could be used further to analyze the water balance details in three maize fields 4 2 evapotranspiration and root water uptake deficit affected by the different lai maize height and plastic film mulching conditions among three maize fields fig 3 apparent differences in e p and t p were identified the much lower e p in of and nfd than nfw was mainly attributed to plastic film mulching in both fields he et al 2018 but the soil surface was bared in nfw in addition the much higher t p identified in nfw and nfd than of was associated with the larger lai and taller height which resulted in the larger et p and higher partitioning of t p from et p duo to the highest e p in nfw much higher e a was also observed in nfw than other two fields implying the plastic film was effective and necessary for water saving in the arid region he et al 2018 li and wang 2021 hence the plastic film mulching was expected to be used in nfw for reducing nonproductive water loss although the water was easily accessible at this site in addition the e a was also affected by the soil texture and irrigation schedules compared with of having a loamy soil texture the sandy soil in nfd was characterized by the low field capacity 0 08 cm3 cm 3 calculated by the soil water retention cure at that the soil suction was 33 kpa and high k s 130 cm d 1 which reduced the evaporation as the surface soil dried out quickly after irrigation precipitation the highest t a in nfw among three maize fields was mainly attributed to the largest t p and sufficient water supply as the soil water was replenished by both irrigation precipitation and shallow groundwater it was consistent with shouse et al 2011 and li et al 2015 who pronounced that the root water uptake was very sensitive to the groundwater table fluctuations although the t p in nfd was larger than of a smaller t a was observed the lowest t a in nfd was mainly attributed to the sandy soil texture and insufficient irrigation amount which resulted in the lowest soil water content potential and actual root water uptake ji et al 2007 this finding was also pronounced by forkutsa et al 2009 who found that the cotton field with loam soil had a much higher t a 479 mm than those fields with sandy loam soil 291 398 mm and sandy soil 182 mm root water uptake deficit t a t p 0 8 was observed in three maize fields implying the current irrigation schedule should be improved ascribing to the theory of the feddes model feddes 1978 for describing root water uptake in the hydrus model the t a was reduced in both dry h 600 cm water limited and wet h 30 cm aeration limited soil conditions during the dry period the water potential gradient between soil and maize root was reduced thus decreasing the root water uptake rate hussain et al 2019 similarly deficient aeration of the root zone in the wet condition restricted root physiological activity and decreased root water uptake rate wang et al 2012 the temporary decrement of transpiration after irrigation was also reported by li and wang 2021 who explained that the quick waterlogging after irrigation restricts canopy development and stomatal conductance due to the smaller amount of irrigation and sandier soil texture in nfd compared to other fields most water limited root water uptake deficits were observed although the shallow groundwater replenished the soil water in nfw the water limited root water uptake deficit event was also observed before the first irrigation event as the root was mainly distributed in the shallow soil layer 0 10 cm and the relative deep gwl 110 cm at that time also the aeration limited root water uptake event was most likely to happen in of 8 times than other fields ascribing to the largest irrigation amount and finer soil texture 4 3 deep percolation and capillary rise the differences in lbfs among the three maize fields were mainly attributed to the different irrigation schedules soil textures and gwls obvious deep percolation fig 4c was identified in three maize fields with a high rate following each irrigation event implying the irrigation schedule should be improved for example the highest percolation rate was identified in of on may 24th with the largest irrigation amount 185 mm other studies also identified the phenomenon of notable deep percolation in the maize field in both of zhao and zhao 2014 and nfd li 2020 zhang et al 2019b zhou and zhao 2019 with the percolation water ratio cumulative percolation total water input ranged from 20 to 68 except for the nfw with shallow gwl both cumulative percolation r 0 895 p 0 01 and percolation water ratio r 0 608 p 0 1 had positive correlations with total water input fig 7 implying the water saving practice was a practical approach for reducing deep percolation although the percolated water could finally recharge the groundwater and be reused in irrigation the soil nutrient e g n p was leached with water percolation which reduced nutrient use efficiency and increased groundwater pollution risk reading et al 2019 zhou and zhao 2019 also more electric energy and labor were used accompanied by more irrigation and wasted by the unwanted percolation meanwhile the overmuch irrigation amount further intensified the nonproductive water loss enhancing e a by increasing the swc at the surface layer ren et al 2016 the soil water recharge from groundwater by capillary rise was only observed in the nfw with shallow gwl which happened before an irrigation event when the upper soil layers were dry the effects of groundwater recharge on soil were also proposed by tan et al 2014 and ren et al 2016 who found that the capillary rise from groundwater was 106 162 mm in the paddy field and 129 230 mm in different crop fields i e maize sunflower and watermelon respectively the capillary rise in nfw in our study area was much higher 536 mm than above studies which was mainly attributed to the higher k s 186 287 cm d 1 for the lower soil layers and more frequent increment of gwl fig 6 considering the large amount of the soil water replenished by groundwater the current irrigation times and amount were expected to reduce in the nfw meanwhile the nonproductive e a would also decrease as the soil surface was drier when the irrigation times and amount were reduced luo and sophocleous 2010 satchithanantham et al 2014 4 4 optimized irrigation schedule and limitations the deep percolation and root water uptake deficit observed in three fields called for the requirement for the irrigation readjustment more irrigation amount reduction was identified in nfw and of than nfd under oi 1 table 2 ascribing to the considerable capillary rise from groundwater in nfw and larger irrigation amount finer soil texture in of although the irrigation amount was significantly reduced under oi 1 fig 8 the average t a t p in nfw of and nfd was increased from 0 91 0 94 and 0 88 to 0 93 0 97 and 0 89 respectively implying the great potential for water saving under current irrigation schedule apparent differences in irrigation schedule were also identified among three maize fields under oi 2 fig 9 mainly attributed to the gwl and soil texture discrepancies due to capillary rise in the nfw with shallow gwl 50 120 cm forkutsa et al 2009 ren et al 2016 the least irrigation amount and times were proposed in the nfw among three maize fields under oi 2 thus it is better to utilize the groundwater by capillary rise compared with the current irrigation schedule it can reduce nonproductive e a electric energy consumption and labor input however the secondary soil salinization should be taken attention as the groundwater is slightly saline 1 2 ds m 1 which was also pronounced by other researchers li et al 2015 shouse et al 2011 the discrepancies in the irrigation schedule under oi 2 between of and nfd were mainly ascribed to their soil texture differences the nfd with sandy soil was characterized by the low field capacity and large k s which was easy for water percolation therefore the strategy of frequent irrigation times 12 times with a relatively small irrigation amount 25 50 mm was suitable for nfd under oi 2 fig 9 compared with nfd the soil in of was characterized by a higher field capacity 0 25 cm3 cm 3 and lower k s 30 cm d 1 which was adapted to the relatively larger irrigation amount 30 70 mm and fewer irrigation times 6 times under oi 2 fig 9 although the differences in irrigation amount between of and nfd were partly attributed to the discrepancies in maize species the irrigation strategy was reliable and consistent with the suggestions from forkutsa et al 2009 and su et al 2014 also the higher et p in nfd than of resulted from the larger lai and taller height led to the higher total irrigation amount in the nfd the et p was usually referenced to irrigation amount in the farmland without groundwater contribution zhao and zhao 2014 zhao et al 2010 however the total water input during the maize growth period in of and nfd under oi 2 was less than or close to the et a ascribing to the relatively high initial swc resulting from winter irrigation in the last year zhang et al 2019b also the optimized irrigation amounts in both oi 1 and oi 2 were expected to be further reduced when the seed maize was planted in nfw and nfd or the soil surface in nfw was covered with the plastic film the improved irrigation schedule was also proposed by other studies in our study area zhou and zhao 2019 and li and wang 2021 recommended that the improved irrigation mount in nfd was 700 mm 14 times with 50 mm per event and 712 mm 11 14 times respectively also li et al 2012 addressed that 500 600 mm total irrigation amount was suitable for the maize field with clay loam soil the higher irrigation amount in the above studies than in this research i e 460 mm in nfd and 310 mm in of is partly ascribed to the different irrigation design principles compared with the improved irrigation schedules with fixed amounts and time li and wang 2021 li et al 2012 zhou and zhao 2019 the irrigation design in this study was more effective as the irrigation precipitation distribution fig 9 matched well with the et 0 and maize growth indexes in both of and nfd figs 2 and 3 a relatively small irrigation amount was proper in the early crop growth period as the et p was relatively low and the root was mainly distributed in the shallow soil layers with the extension of the crop growth period the irrigation amount increased with the et p and root depth increment while in the late crop growth period the irrigation amount was reduced as et p decreased with the crop maturation also the irrigation amount and times were expected to be affected by the rainfall distribution under oi 2 but this influence was limited in the arid area as the precipitation amount was small as the finer soil texture can reduce irrigation times and total amount it is better to irrigate the nfd with heihe river water rather than groundwater as the river water is abundant with fine soil particles for improving the soil properties su et al 2014 corresponding to the reduced irrigation amount under both optimized irrigation schedules the nonproductive water losses e g e a d during the maize growth period were significantly reduced table 2 the water use efficiency was greatly enhanced at the same time as the ratio of t a p i increased from 0 79 0 48 and 0 64 to 1 75 2 56 0 83 1 05 and 0 74 0 86 under oi 1 oi 2 for nfw of and nfd respectively additionally the nonproductive water losses were expected to reduce after the maize was harvested as the soil water storage decreased besides the irrigation time and amount adjustment methods switching the flooding irrigation to drip irrigation can also reduce irrigation he et al 2018 however it currently seems financially infeasible for the maize field in the study area some limitations also existed for the optimized irrigation design the feedback of root water uptake on crop growth was not considered in this study ascribing to the limits of the hydrus model as a result the same maize growth indexes were used for all scenario simulations in each maize field hence it is better to couple the hydrus model with the crop growth model e g wofost dssat to improve the results of optimized irrigation schedules li et al 2012 zhou et al 2012 also the feedback of rescheduled irrigation events on gwl fluctuations in the nfw was not considered under both optimized irrigation schedules which probably overestimated the groundwater contribution and water saving potential nevertheless the significant positive relationships of the gwls between nfw and heihe river beach were identified fig 6b indicating that the gwl in nfw was mainly controlled by the heihe river rather than the irrigation events 5 conclusions the water balances for three typical maize fields in the heihe river basin were quantified based on the field monitoring and simulation and the hydrus 1d model proposed the optimized irrigation schedule in each area the current irrigation schedules were unreasonable in three maize fields characterized by the large deep percolation and apparent root water uptake deficit deep percolation was the largest in the of followed by nfd and nfw as the shallow groundwater recharge diminished the water percolation the water deficit was most severe in the nfd followed by nfw and of proper irrigation could consider the soil texture gwl crop water requirement and root distribution the optimized irrigation design based on the model simulation used less irrigation water for three fields which would result in less nonproductive water loss but even higher t a the groundwater should be used sufficiently in the nfw for water saving as the gwl was relatively shallow considering the different soil textures frequent and relatively small irrigation could be applied in the nfd with sandy soil texture in contrast fewer irrigation times and more significant single irrigation amounts could be applied in the of with loamy soil distribution further research should couple the hydrus

9584,plastic film mulching pm has become a widely used cropping method in arid and semiarid areas however it is unknown how different pms affect crop water and n utilization and their interaction under different n supplies a two year field experiment was conducted in the hetao irrigation district hid in northwest china following local irrigation practices 500 mm border irrigation was used to grow spring maize over two growing seasons 2019 and 2020 with two n levels high n 225 kg n ha 1 and low n 150 kg n ha 1 combined with three mulching methods the experiment had five treatments i no mulching with high n control ck ii black plastic film with high n hb iii transparent plastic film with high n ht iv black plastic film with low n lb and v transparent plastic film with low n lt the 4 pm treatments had higher average soil water storage 0 120 cm than ck the pm treatments had the highest water consumption coefficients kwcn at 6 leaf to 12 leaf stage kwc2 and milking to maturity kwc5 stage the hp treatments hb and ht had higher soil nitrogen storage than ck during the growth period averaged across two seasons hb and ht had 23 9 29 2 respectively higher grain yields than ck averaged across two seasons the transparent pm treatments had 7 49 5 31 and 1 72 higher water use efficiency wue partial factor productivity of nitrogen pfpn and harvest index respectively than the black pm treatments the pm treatments showed the relationship between water use efficiency of biomass wue b and nitrogen use efficiency of biomass nue b with wue b increased nue b also increased given these results we recommend the high n level and transparent pm for maize cropping to increase yield and resource utilization efficiency in the hid keywords border irrigation plastic film mulching water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency maize yield 1 introduction dryland agriculture feeds more than one third of the world s population in dryland areas evaporation usually exceeds precipitation causing water scarcity with crop production often requiring irrigation demissie et al 2021 and in most arid areas soil fertility can be achieved through the application of large amounts of chemical fertilizer dai et al 2021 in northwest china the original drought condition together with reducing water policy application and increased water demand highlights the local water shortage problem local farmers often use border irrigation large amount of fertilizer to increase yields liu et al 2015 lu et al 2019 however excessive water and nitrogen n fertilizer inputs causes nitrate nitrogen accumulation in soil and the residual n leached into deep soil xu et al 2019 zhou and feng 2019 optimizing water and fertilizer management is necessary to increase sustainable agricultural production and resource use efficiency monaghan et al 2013 plastic film mulching pm has been used widely in china to conserve soil water and increase crop production daryanto et al 2017 many studies have shown that pm reduces evaporation accelerates crop growth and increases water use efficiency wue ding et al 2019 he et al 2018 yu et al 2018 moreover pm is recognized as an effective way to regulate soil temperature improve soil nutrient availability and depress weed growth dong et al 2018a wang et al 2019 xie et al 2020 in summary pm can make full use of natural resources for agricultural production even in arid and saline conditions guo et al 2019 minhas et al 2020 however different colored film has different effects on soil hydrothermal conditions crop nutrient utilization and even yield formation gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 black film can strongly absorb light and increase mean root zone temperatures changing the root growth environment which affects nutrient absorption and crop growth unlike the transparent film hu et al 2020 in dryland areas of northwest china with average annual temperatures less than 15 c transparent film produced higher yields and lower values of water use efficiency wue than black film gao et al 2019 with adequate n supply black film produced higher yields than transparent film sun et al 2018 pm can play different roles under different water and n inputs qin et al 2015 however few pm studies have focused on the coupling effect of water and fertilizer and optimal resource water nitrogen utilization for high yields therefore we conducted a quantitative assessment of different pms on water utilization soil nitrogen storage and their interaction on crop growth and yield water shortage is a major limiting factor for crop growth in arid agricultural areas zhang et al 2021a bai et al 2017 indeed different irrigation methods such as furrow irrigation combined with ridge mulching plastic film and drip irrigation have been used to reduce water expenditure dong et al 2018b zhou et al 2018 while these measures were feasible in experiments their application in large scale irrigation areas needs further research wei et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b border irrigation with large amounts of fertilization under pm remains the most widely used management method in arid areas studies have shown that field fertilizer amounts range from 172 5 to 345 kg ha 1 under irrigated cropping in arid areas of china qi et al 2019 xu et al 2018 farmers often use the excessive chemical fertilizer to obtain the highest yields resulting in water pollution greenhouse gas emissions and low n fertilizer use efficiency nue sainju et al 2003 wang et al 2018b 2016 some studies have shown that high fertilizer application under pm can maintain high yields increase wue and reduce soil n accumulation bezborodov et al 2010 chen et al 2015 li et al 2019 however the extensive management has resulted in many problems such as nitrogen leaching rising groundwater levels and groundwater pollution qi et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 thus the incongruity between rational resource use and crop yield needs to be resolved for the sustainable development of arid agricultural production systems spring maize is the main crop in the hetao irrigation district hid a typical arid irrigation area of northwest china occupying more than 30 of local arable land liu et al 2017a we hypothesized that pm would conserve more water and nitrogen for maize utilization increase resource water and nitrogen use efficiency and maize yield compared with the bare soil this study 1 investigated the effect of mulching on soil water utilization and allocation and nitrate nitrogen storage change 2 analyzed the relationship between water and nutrient use and their interaction on crop production aboveground biomass and yield 3 identified the internal mechanism of film mulching for increasing production and provided a reference for arid area agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at the shuguang irrigation research station of hid in the western inner mongolia autonomous region china 40 43 n 107 13 e elevation 1039 m fig 1 the climate in this region is characterized as a typically arid continental climate with average annual rainfall of 105 mm concentrated from may to september the accumulated pan evaporation exceeds 700 mm and the average temperature is 17 3 c during the maize growing period fig 2 the weather data was recorded at the meteorological station located about 200 m from the experimental field the groundwater level ranged from 2 to 3 m across two growing seasons the studied soil had a distinct layered structure comprising a silt loam soil from 0 to 60 cm depth and sandy soil from 60 to 100 cm depth according to usda soil textural triangle table 1 the topsoil 0 60 cm had an average no3 content of 6 47 mg kg 1 nh4 content of 10 57 mg kg 1 available phosphorus of 62 35 mg kg 1 and available potassium of 118 35 mg kg 1 table 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted across two maize growing seasons from april 2019 to september 2020 there were five treatments i border irrigation with transparent pm and high fertilizer amount 225 kg ha 1 n ht ii border irrigation with black pm and high fertilizer amount hb iii border irrigation without mulching and high fertilizer amount ck iv border irrigation with transparent pm and low fertilizer amount 150 kg ha 1 n lt and v border irrigation with black pm and low fertilizer amount lb a completely randomized block split plot design was used for the two fertilizer rates main plot and two mulching treatments subplot in the experiment the research field was divided into 15 plots each 4 12 m with eight rows of maize each plot received basal fertilizer broadcast as urea 46 n and p2o5 and topdressed as urea 46 n mixed with irrigation water detailed fertilizer information is in table 2 the irrigation groundwater had an average saline level of 2 0 ds m 1 and ph 7 8 during the two maize growing seasons 2 3 field management the pm treatment plots were mulched with transparent or black film 70 cm width wide row laid on the soil surface to provide 70 cover with a narrow space 30 cm between plastic films fig 3 after applying basal fertilizer the plastic film was put in place and maize seeds hybrid jinping 628 immediately sown using a hole sowing machine at the wide row with 40 cm row spacing 30 cm plant spacing and 5 cm planting depth for ck in addition to the film mulching the other cropping measures were consistent with the pm treatments the plant density was 66 667 plant ha 1 the sowing dates were 28 april 2019 and 30 april 2020 and the corresponding harvest dates were 6 september 2019 and 8 september 2020 the total irrigation amount was 500 mm local level see table 3 for details the irrigation events depended on the weather and crop condition in the second year the final irrigation amount was reduced to 100 mm due to the effective rainfall was great than 25 mm on 18 august 2020 following local farming practices field management measures also included regular weeding and pesticide application to control insects 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 soil water content and nitrate nitrogen soil water content was measured at five growth stages in both seasons 6 leaf stage v6 12 leaf stage v12 tasseling stage vt milking stage r3 and maturity stage r6 soil was sampled from under the mulch for the mulching treatments and the central row for ck three soil cores were sampled at 10 cm intervals from 0 to 20 cm and 20 cm intervals from 20 to 120 cm in each plot using a soil auger after carefully removing organic material and fine roots the gravimetric soil water content was determined dried at 105 c to constant weight for a subsample of each sample the remaining soil subsamples were air dried and sieved through a 1 mm mesh for chemical analysis to

significantly affected by fertilizer and mulching management p 0 05 table 4 the hp treatments produced significantly higher yields than ck p 0 05 with an average increase of 26 5 averaged across both seasons hb and ht produced 23 9 and 29 2 higher yields respectively than ck grain yields increased with increasing fertilizer level under the same mulching treatment among all treatments ht produced the highest grain yield average 12 653 kg ha 1 and lb produced the lowest average 8715 kg ha 1 all treatments had higher grain yields in 2019 than 2020 lb had the lowest 100 grain index transparent mulch had a higher 100 grain index than black mulch under the same fertilizer amount dry matter accumulation across the whole growing period was ranked ht hb ck lt lb fig 9 over time differences in dry matter accumulation between treatments increased the maximum dry matter accumulation rate occurred from vt r3 being 84 07 90 58 98 64 59 93 and 69 44 g m 2 d 1 for ck hb ht lb and lt respectively at maturity the greatest difference in dry matter accumulation occurred between ht and lb 736 g m 2 the fertilizer and mulching management had a significant impact on hi p 0 05 table 4 transparent mulch produced higher hi than black mulch under the same nitrogen supply hi decreased with increasing fertilizer level under the same mulching treatment among all treatments ht produced the highest hi 0 60 and ck produced the lowest 0 50 4 discussion 4 1 effect of mulch and nitrogen fertilization on groundwater supply and soil water consumption different fertilizer and mulching methods had various effects on soil water utilization in this study soil water moved upward from deep soil layers to root layers with the magnitude of ht hb ck lt lb across both seasons mulching optimized the soil environment in the maize root zone promoted water and fertilizer absorption by the root system and accelerated the soil water supply from deeper soil resulting in the vigorous growth fig 9 zhang et al 2007 zribi et al 2015 mulching may have also isolated the water vapor exchange of the topsoil and conserved more water in the soil than bare soil miao et al 2016 in our experiment the groundwater supply accounted for more than 5 of et a during crop growth which could be realized as a part of agricultural reducing water potential this contradicts the present study in arid regions zhang et al 2021a reported that the groundwater water lost in the form of deep percolation than supply our results indicated that mulching could accelerate soil moisture movement and broaden the water source liu et al 2017a the lp treatments had significantly higher average sws than the hp treatments and ck during maize growth in both seasons table 5 p 0 05 the could be attributed to a change in the evaporation to transpiration ratio with more soil water stored under mulching for crop utilization peng et al 2020 xie et al 2020 for soil water utilization and distribution it is well known that maize mainly absorbs water from the topsoil which is consistent with our study that showed greater sws variation in the topsoil dong et al 2018b wang et al 2013 yang et al 2010 surface soil moisture is affected by the weather thus affecting crop growth and development dai et al 2021 our results showed that mulching measures maintained high soil moisture during crop growth reducing the risk of crops becoming stressed additionally subsoil sws increased under mulching compared with ck the plastic mulch improved sws throughout the soil profile which increased yield and aboveground biomass fig 9 lamptey et al 2020 li et al 2020 during the maize growing period in our study the hp treatments decreased the average et a by 3 09 while the lp treatments decreased the average et a by 5 95 compared with ck while mulching could reduce invalid swc evaporation plants would increase respiration allowing more water to escape to the atmosphere through the stomata increasing water consumption xue et al 2017 generally pm decreased soil evaporation increased crop transpiration and improved crop growth and dry matter accumulation dong et al 2018b lee and park 2020 improved soil hydrothermal environment under pm and sufficient nitrogen application promoted root development improved crop utilization of root zone water and increased the ratio of transpiration evapotranspiration fang et al 2021 wang et al 2020a 2020b in our study ht and hb didn t obviously reduce et a during the growth period than ck but allocated more water for plant transpiration in our study ck had lower et an than the hp treatments before r3 except from v0 v6 the small crop canopy during early growth v0 v6 means that solar can directly affect soil temperature and evaporate surface soil water especially for bare soil zhou et al 2009 as the canopy cover increases soil evaporation gradually diminishes with the bare soil forming a dry surface layer slowing the loss rate of swc tan et al 2017 studies on kwcn at different growth stages have shown that water can be allocated to key crop growth stages zhang et al 2021a in our study the highest kwcn occurred from v6 v12 or r3 r6 in the pm treatments due to crop consumption and long period duration fig 6 during this time the hp treatments had higher kwcn values than the lp treatments and ck consistent with previous studies that showed that pm affects crop growth and water use zhang et al 2021a minhas et al 2020 the main reason for the variation of kwcn may be that the effect of management measures pm and fertilizer on soil water use mechanism differed at different growth stages pm reduced soil moisture evaporation before v6 resulting in a lower kwcn than ck during v6 to v12 pm and nitrogen fertilizer promoted crop growth and increased plant transpiration wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 produced higher kwcn than ck in the later growth stages pm prolonged the length of the filling period and delayed senescence hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a thus it produced higher kwcn than ck in our study the transparent film played a more significant role than black film in allocating water to accelerate crop growth above all these results indicate that pm accelerates soil water movement affects water allocation during key periods and creates a high soil water environment increasing yield and aboveground biomass 4 2 effect of mulch and nitrogen fertilization on soil nitrate n use and plant n uptake it is well known that soil n accumulation and leaching are closely related to mulching measures root uptake and irrigation method liang et al 2019 mohanty et al 2020 qi et al 2018 mulching and fertilization increased soil no3 n with the average increase in hb ht and lb lt fig 7 mulching protects the topsoil maintains soil water and promotes soil no3 n accumulation compared with ck curtis and wang 1998 nishimura et al 2012 generally transparent mulching accelerates crop growth and root development resulting in more n absorbed by crops than black film van grinsven et al 2013 wang et al 2019 in our study the soil no3 n storage accumulation order was hp ck lp during crop growth it is likely that film mulching reduces the depth of n with water infiltration and air exchange is isolated inhibiting the n conversion process and greenhouse gas emissions resulting in no3 n remaining in topsoil dong et al 2019 wang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 reported that pm increased nitrogen accumulation in maize by 44 6 and nue by 55 2 our study showed variation in topsoil no3 n between treatments with hb ht ck lb lt across both seasons fig 7a b topsoil no3 n storage under mulching was at least 29 higher than ck during crop growth for the same n supply mulching could regulate the relationship between soil n supply and crop demand ensuring crop nutrient absorption zhang et al 2017 soil no3 n gradually decreased with crop growth as the plants accumulated n fig 8 the lp treatments used soil n better than the hp treatments and ck for dry matter accumulation and increasing grain n content table 4 fig 9 topsoil no3 n storage directly affects dry matter accumulation and yield formation dai et al 2021 our results showed positive correlations between yield and no3 n storage at 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil depth at v12 fig 10a vt fig 10b and r3 fig 10c the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 57 to 0 75 for yield and no3 n storage at 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm from v12 r3 across both years the linear function described the relationship between soil nutrients and yield fig 11 and indicated the possibility of predicting yield based on soil dynamics during crop growth kaya et al 2005 tang et al 2013 before v6 the soil nutrients were gradually decomposed and consumed rather than absorbed and used by the plants when the topsoil n storage was around 180 200 kg ha 1 after v6 the increase in biomass was proportional to the decrease in soil n storage the relationship between aboveground biomass and n supply under different film mulching from v6 vt before topdressing fig 12a had a coefficient of determination of 0 73 for the quadratic function the relationship between aboveground biomass and topsoil no3 n storage fig 12b was build which had a coefficient of determination greater than 0 72 for the quadratic function our results showed that different fertilizer amounts had a greater effect on dry matter accumulation during later growth than different film mulching during late growth stages ck showed more dry matter accumulation rate than the mulching treatments fig 12b indicating that mulching can promote the transition of crops from vegetative to reproductive growth and prevent low growth in summary pm maintained soil no3 n created a high soil nutrient environment and promoted dry matter accumulation and yield 4 3 effect of mulch and nitrogen fertilization on soil water and nitrate n utilization wue and pfpn followed the same trend with ht hb ck mulching conserved more water and nitrogen for crop use than ck increasing aboveground biomass and yield fig 9 table 4 as reported elsewhere chen et al 2015 as the fertilizer amount increased wue and pfpn decreased indicating that improvements in resource utilization water and nitrogen with mulching would decrease with increasing n application rate causing an imbalance between outputs and inputs wang et al 2018b pm affects soil water and nitrogen utilization forming a new relationship between resource water and nitrogen use and biomass and yield relative to ck the relationship between wue b and nue b was quantified using field data fig 13 under ck nue b increased with the increase in wue b during early growth peaked and then decreased during later growth fig 13a indicating that wue b could be increased through water saving measures but nue b would limit crop growth overall the mulching treatments increased wue b and nue b fig 13b c however during later growth excessive irrigation water could leach soil nutrients and limit nutrient absorption by crops decreasing nue b combining the et and soil no3 n storage results et consumption did not significantly differ between treatments during later growth and large amounts of irrigation water would mainly leach soil nitrogen figs 5 and 7 this could explain why mulching can limit crop growth and yield wang et al 2020a 2020b the impact of pm on maize yield and biomass in dryland areas differs with its effectiveness related to factors including n supply water supply soil temperature and mulching duration ibrahim et al 2020 qin et al 2018 the hp treatments significantly increased maize yield and biomass p 0 05 compared with ck the transparent film increased yield and biomass more than the black film under the same n supply it is likely that film mulching retains more soil water and decreases the total resistance in the soil plant system to enhance photosynthesis leach 1980 gao et al 2019 reported that transparent film mulch increased yield more than black film mulching 24 99 vs 22 74 with 500 mm precipitation however film mulching can alter the water and temperature conditions outside the optimum range of crops decreasing yield zhu et al 2012 in summary under no stress film mulching can improve the relationship between water and nitrogen and promote crop growth however under stress film mulched soil may not actively respond to changes in external conditions restricting crop growth li et al 2013 the transparent film produced hi than black film under the same n supply hi decreased as the fertilizer amount increased some studies have shown that mulching affected the dry matter distribution to increase yield li et al 2020 bai et al 2017 considering the economic yield resource utilization water and nitrogen and environmental nitrogen accumulation benefits transparent film mulch plus fertilization is recommended as the most suitable management method in arid irrigation areas such as hid the study error mainly caused by the soil heterogeneity and annual weather and diseases pests and extreme weather effects on crops were not considered more field experiment data was collected to optimize water and fertilizer management and realized the sustainable development of regional agriculture additionally how to use crop models to explore the application of different management measures e g change in cultivars tillage method organic fertilizer application to deal with future climate change will be our future research goal 5 conclusions a two year field experiment showed that soil water soil nitrate nitrogen and their interaction were affected by film mulching under different nitrogen supply high and low plastic mulching increased groundwater replenishment and soil water storage during crop growth by 34 6 and 6 1 on average and allocated more water to critical growth periods v6 v12 or r3 r6 than bare soil soil nitrogen was retained for crop use under mulching and closely related to aboveground biomass and yield wue and pfpn followed the same trend with ht hb ck as the fertilizer amount increased pffn decreased the relationship between wue b and nue b showed that as wue b increased nue b also increased with mulching we recommend that farmers apply irrigation and fertilizer during early crop growth reducing irrigation during later growth played the role of film mulching to conserve moisture increase water and nitrogen use and increase yield generally transparent film produced higher wue hi and pfpn than black film and ck with high nitrogen supply as the fertilizer amount increased yield and grain nitrogen content increased slightly and the water and nitrogen resource utilization indexes significantly decreased given these results it is suggested that farmers use a high fertilizer amount i e 225 kg n ha 1 for hid and transparent plastic film mulching to increase yield and resource utilization these findings provide a technical reference for the extension of film practice technologies and a theoretical basis for agricultural fertilizer decision making and mulching in arid irrigation areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9584,plastic film mulching pm has become a widely used cropping method in arid and semiarid areas however it is unknown how different pms affect crop water and n utilization and their interaction under different n supplies a two year field experiment was conducted in the hetao irrigation district hid in northwest china following local irrigation practices 500 mm border irrigation was used to grow spring maize over two growing seasons 2019 and 2020 with two n levels high n 225 kg n ha 1 and low n 150 kg n ha 1 combined with three mulching methods the experiment had five treatments i no mulching with high n control ck ii black plastic film with high n hb iii transparent plastic film with high n ht iv black plastic film with low n lb and v transparent plastic film with low n lt the 4 pm treatments had higher average soil water storage 0 120 cm than ck the pm treatments had the highest water consumption coefficients kwcn at 6 leaf to 12 leaf stage kwc2 and milking to maturity kwc5 stage the hp treatments hb and ht had higher soil nitrogen storage than ck during the growth period averaged across two seasons hb and ht had 23 9 29 2 respectively higher grain yields than ck averaged across two seasons the transparent pm treatments had 7 49 5 31 and 1 72 higher water use efficiency wue partial factor productivity of nitrogen pfpn and harvest index respectively than the black pm treatments the pm treatments showed the relationship between water use efficiency of biomass wue b and nitrogen use efficiency of biomass nue b with wue b increased nue b also increased given these results we recommend the high n level and transparent pm for maize cropping to increase yield and resource utilization efficiency in the hid keywords border irrigation plastic film mulching water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency maize yield 1 introduction dryland agriculture feeds more than one third of the world s population in dryland areas evaporation usually exceeds precipitation causing water scarcity with crop production often requiring irrigation demissie et al 2021 and in most arid areas soil fertility can be achieved through the application of large amounts of chemical fertilizer dai et al 2021 in northwest china the original drought condition together with reducing water policy application and increased water demand highlights the local water shortage problem local farmers often use border irrigation large amount of fertilizer to increase yields liu et al 2015 lu et al 2019 however excessive water and nitrogen n fertilizer inputs causes nitrate nitrogen accumulation in soil and the residual n leached into deep soil xu et al 2019 zhou and feng 2019 optimizing water and fertilizer management is necessary to increase sustainable agricultural production and resource use efficiency monaghan et al 2013 plastic film mulching pm has been used widely in china to conserve soil water and increase crop production daryanto et al 2017 many studies have shown that pm reduces evaporation accelerates crop growth and increases water use efficiency wue ding et al 2019 he et al 2018 yu et al 2018 moreover pm is recognized as an effective way to regulate soil temperature improve soil nutrient availability and depress weed growth dong et al 2018a wang et al 2019 xie et al 2020 in summary pm can make full use of natural resources for agricultural production even in arid and saline conditions guo et al 2019 minhas et al 2020 however different colored film has different effects on soil hydrothermal conditions crop nutrient utilization and even yield formation gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 black film can strongly absorb light and increase mean root zone temperatures changing the root growth environment which affects nutrient absorption and crop growth unlike the transparent film hu et al 2020 in dryland areas of northwest china with average annual temperatures less than 15 c transparent film produced higher yields and lower values of water use efficiency wue than black film gao et al 2019 with adequate n supply black film produced higher yields than transparent film sun et al 2018 pm can play different roles under different water and n inputs qin et al 2015 however few pm studies have focused on the coupling effect of water and fertilizer and optimal resource water nitrogen utilization for high yields therefore we conducted a quantitative assessment of different pms on water utilization soil nitrogen storage and their interaction on crop growth and yield water shortage is a major limiting factor for crop growth in arid agricultural areas zhang et al 2021a bai et al 2017 indeed different irrigation methods such as furrow irrigation combined with ridge mulching plastic film and drip irrigation have been used to reduce water expenditure dong et al 2018b zhou et al 2018 while these measures were feasible in experiments their application in large scale irrigation areas needs further research wei et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b border irrigation with large amounts of fertilization under pm remains the most widely used management method in arid areas studies have shown that field fertilizer amounts range from 172 5 to 345 kg ha 1 under irrigated cropping in arid areas of china qi et al 2019 xu et al 2018 farmers often use the excessive chemical fertilizer to obtain the highest yields resulting in water pollution greenhouse gas emissions and low n fertilizer use efficiency nue sainju et al 2003 wang et al 2018b 2016 some studies have shown that high fertilizer application under pm can maintain high yields increase wue and reduce soil n accumulation bezborodov et al 2010 chen et al 2015 li et al 2019 however the extensive management has resulted in many problems such as nitrogen leaching rising groundwater levels and groundwater pollution qi et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 thus the incongruity between rational resource use and crop yield needs to be resolved for the sustainable development of arid agricultural production systems spring maize is the main crop in the hetao irrigation district hid a typical arid irrigation area of northwest china occupying more than 30 of local arable land liu et al 2017a we hypothesized that pm would conserve more water and nitrogen for maize utilization increase resource water and nitrogen use efficiency and maize yield compared with the bare soil this study 1 investigated the effect of mulching on soil water utilization and allocation and nitrate nitrogen storage change 2 analyzed the relationship between water and nutrient use and their interaction on crop production aboveground biomass and yield 3 identified the internal mechanism of film mulching for increasing production and provided a reference for arid area agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at the shuguang irrigation research station of hid in the western inner mongolia autonomous region

phosphorus of 62 35 mg kg 1 and available potassium of 118 35 mg kg 1 table 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted across two maize growing seasons from april 2019 to september 2020 there were five treatments i border irrigation with transparent pm and high fertilizer amount 225 kg ha 1 n ht ii border irrigation with black pm and high fertilizer amount hb iii border irrigation without mulching and high fertilizer amount ck iv border irrigation with transparent pm and low fertilizer amount 150 kg ha 1 n lt and v border irrigation with black pm and low fertilizer amount lb a completely randomized block split plot design was used for the two fertilizer rates main plot and two mulching treatments subplot in the experiment the research field was divided into 15 plots each 4 12 m with eight rows of maize each plot received basal fertilizer broadcast as urea 46 n and p2o5 and topdressed as urea 46 n mixed with irrigation water detailed fertilizer information is in table 2 the irrigation groundwater had an average saline level of 2 0 ds m 1 and ph 7 8 during the two maize growing seasons 2 3 field management the pm treatment plots were mulched with transparent or black film 70 cm width wide row laid on the soil surface to provide 70 cover with a narrow space 30 cm between plastic films fig 3 after applying basal fertilizer the plastic film was put in place and maize seeds hybrid jinping 628 immediately sown using a hole sowing machine at the wide row with 40 cm row spacing 30 cm plant spacing and 5 cm planting depth for ck in addition to the film mulching the other cropping measures were consistent with the pm treatments the plant density was 66 667 plant ha 1 the sowing dates were 28 april 2019 and 30 april 2020 and the corresponding harvest dates were 6 september 2019 and 8 september 2020 the total irrigation amount was 500 mm local level see table 3 for details the irrigation events depended on the weather and crop condition in the second year the final irrigation amount was reduced to 100 mm due to the effective rainfall was great than 25 mm on 18 august 2020 following local farming practices field management measures also included regular weeding and pesticide application to control insects 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 soil water content and nitrate nitrogen soil water content was measured at five growth stages in both seasons 6 leaf stage v6 12 leaf stage v12 tasseling stage vt milking stage r3 and maturity stage r6 soil was sampled from under the mulch for the mulching treatments and the central row for ck three soil cores were sampled at 10 cm intervals from 0 to 20 cm and 20 cm intervals from 20 to 120 cm in each plot using a soil auger after carefully removing organic material and fine roots the gravimetric soil water content was determined dried at 105 c to constant weight for a subsample of each sample the remaining soil subsamples were air dried and sieved through a 1 mm mesh for chemical analysis to measure soil nitrate content the air dried soil samples were extracted with 1 m kcl 2 5 g air dried soil 25 ml of 1 mol l 1 kcl and analyzed using an aa3 continuous flow analytical system before sowing v0 in 2019 soil samples were collected to determine soil water content and nitrogen content and the electrical conductivity of a saturated paste extract table 1 2 4 2 plant measurements three

more plant nitrogen storage than ck respectively averaged across both seasons the maximum nitrogen accumulation rate by plants occurred from vt r3 with ck hb ht lb and lt accumulating 3 2 4 6 4 6 1 9

significantly affected by fertilizer and mulching management p 0 05 table 4 the hp treatments produced significantly higher yields than ck p 0 05 with an average increase of 26 5 averaged across both seasons hb and ht produced 23 9 and 29 2 higher yields respectively than ck grain yields increased with increasing fertilizer level under the same mulching treatment among all treatments ht produced the highest grain yield average 12 653 kg ha 1 and lb produced the lowest average 8715 kg ha 1 all treatments had higher grain yields in 2019 than 2020 lb had the lowest 100 grain index transparent mulch had a higher 100 grain index than black mulch under the same fertilizer amount dry matter accumulation across the whole growing period was ranked ht hb ck lt lb fig 9 over time differences in

at maturity the greatest difference in dry matter accumulation occurred between ht and lb 736 g m 2 the fertilizer and mulching management had a significant impact on hi p 0 05 table 4 transparent mulch produced higher hi than black mulch under the same nitrogen supply hi decreased with increasing fertilizer level under the same mulching treatment among all treatments ht produced the highest hi 0 60 and ck produced the lowest 0 50 4 discussion 4 1 effect of mulch and nitrogen fertilization on groundwater supply and soil water consumption different fertilizer and mulching methods had various effects on soil water utilization in this study soil water moved upward from deep soil layers to root layers with the magnitude of ht hb ck lt lb across both seasons mulching optimized the soil environment in the maize root zone promoted water and fertilizer absorption by the root system and accelerated the soil water supply from deeper soil resulting in the vigorous growth fig 9 zhang et al 2007 zribi et al 2015 mulching may have also isolated the water vapor exchange of the topsoil and conserved more water in the soil than bare soil miao et al 2016 in our experiment the groundwater supply accounted for more than 5 of et a during crop growth which could be realized as a part of agricultural reducing water potential this contradicts the present study in arid regions zhang et al 2021a reported that the groundwater water lost in the form of deep percolation than supply our results indicated that mulching could accelerate soil moisture movement and broaden the water source liu et al 2017a the lp treatments had significantly higher average sws than the hp treatments and ck during maize growth in both seasons table 5 p 0 05 the could be attributed to a change in the evaporation to transpiration ratio with more soil water stored under mulching for crop utilization peng et al 2020 xie et al 2020 for soil water utilization and distribution it is well known that maize mainly absorbs water from the topsoil which is consistent with our study that showed greater sws variation in the topsoil dong et al 2018b wang et al 2013 yang et al 2010 surface soil moisture is affected by the weather thus affecting crop growth and development dai et al 2021 our results showed that mulching measures maintained high soil moisture during crop growth reducing the risk of crops becoming stressed additionally subsoil sws increased under mulching compared with ck the plastic mulch improved sws throughout the soil profile which increased yield and aboveground biomass fig 9 lamptey et al 2020 li et al 2020 during the maize growing period in our study the hp treatments decreased the average et a by 3 09 while the lp treatments decreased the average et a by 5 95 compared with ck while mulching could reduce invalid swc evaporation plants would increase respiration allowing more water to escape to the atmosphere through the stomata increasing water consumption xue et al 2017 generally pm decreased soil evaporation increased crop transpiration and improved crop growth and dry matter accumulation dong et al 2018b lee and park 2020 improved soil hydrothermal environment under pm and sufficient nitrogen application promoted root development improved crop utilization of root zone water and increased the ratio of transpiration evapotranspiration fang et al 2021 wang et al 2020a 2020b in our study ht and hb didn t obviously reduce et a during the growth period than ck but allocated more water for plant transpiration in our study ck had lower et an than the hp treatments before r3 except from v0 v6 the small crop canopy during early growth v0 v6 means that solar can directly affect soil temperature and evaporate surface soil water especially for bare soil zhou et al 2009 as the canopy cover increases soil evaporation gradually diminishes with the bare soil forming a dry surface layer slowing the loss rate of swc tan et al 2017 studies on kwcn at different growth stages have shown that water can be allocated to key crop growth stages zhang et al 2021a in our study the highest kwcn occurred from v6 v12 or r3 r6 in the pm treatments due to crop consumption and long period duration fig 6 during this time the hp treatments had higher kwcn values than the lp treatments and ck consistent with previous studies that showed that pm affects crop growth and water use zhang et al 2021a minhas et al 2020 the main reason for the variation of kwcn may be that the effect of management measures pm and fertilizer on soil water use mechanism differed at different growth stages pm reduced soil moisture evaporation before v6 resulting in a lower kwcn than ck during v6 to v12 pm and nitrogen fertilizer promoted crop growth and increased plant transpiration wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 produced higher kwcn than ck in the later growth stages pm prolonged the length of the filling period and delayed senescence hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a thus it produced higher kwcn than ck in our study the transparent film played a more significant role than black film in allocating water to accelerate crop growth above all these results indicate that pm accelerates soil water movement affects water allocation during key periods and creates a high soil water environment increasing yield and aboveground biomass 4 2 effect of mulch and nitrogen fertilization on soil nitrate n use and plant n uptake it is well known that soil n accumulation and leaching are closely related to mulching measures root uptake and irrigation method liang et al 2019 mohanty et al 2020 qi et al 2018 mulching and fertilization increased soil no3 n with the average increase in hb ht and lb lt fig 7 mulching protects the topsoil maintains soil water and promotes soil no3 n accumulation compared with ck curtis and wang 1998 nishimura et al 2012 generally transparent mulching accelerates crop growth and root development resulting in more n absorbed by crops than black film van grinsven et al 2013 wang et al 2019 in our study the soil no3 n storage accumulation order was hp ck lp during crop growth it is likely that film mulching reduces the depth of n with water infiltration and air exchange is isolated inhibiting the n conversion process and greenhouse gas emissions resulting in no3 n remaining in topsoil dong et al 2019 wang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 reported that pm increased nitrogen accumulation in maize by 44 6 and nue by 55 2 our study showed variation in topsoil no3 n between treatments with hb ht ck lb lt across both seasons fig 7a b topsoil no3 n storage under mulching was at least 29 higher than ck during crop growth for the same n supply mulching could regulate the relationship between soil n supply and crop demand ensuring crop nutrient absorption zhang et al 2017 soil no3 n gradually decreased with crop growth as the plants accumulated n fig 8 the lp treatments used soil n better than the hp treatments and ck for dry matter accumulation and increasing grain n content table 4 fig 9 topsoil no3 n storage directly affects dry matter accumulation and yield formation dai et al 2021 our results showed positive correlations between yield and no3 n storage at 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil depth at v12 fig 10a vt fig 10b and r3 fig 10c the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 57 to 0 75 for yield and no3 n storage at 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm from v12 r3 across both years the linear function described the relationship between soil nutrients and yield fig 11 and indicated the possibility of predicting yield based on soil dynamics during crop growth kaya et al 2005 tang et al 2013 before v6 the soil nutrients were gradually decomposed and consumed rather than absorbed and used by the plants when the topsoil n storage was around 180 200 kg ha 1 after v6 the increase in biomass was proportional to the decrease in soil n storage the relationship between aboveground biomass and n supply under different film mulching from v6 vt before topdressing fig 12a had a coefficient of determination of 0 73 for the quadratic function the relationship between aboveground biomass and topsoil no3 n storage fig 12b was build which had a coefficient of determination greater than 0 72 for the quadratic function our results showed that different fertilizer amounts had a greater effect on dry matter accumulation during later growth than different film mulching during late growth stages ck showed more dry matter accumulation rate than the mulching treatments fig 12b indicating that mulching can promote the transition of crops from vegetative to reproductive growth and prevent low growth in summary pm maintained soil no3 n created a high soil nutrient environment and promoted dry matter accumulation and yield 4 3 effect of mulch and nitrogen fertilization on soil water and nitrate n utilization wue and pfpn followed the same trend with ht hb ck mulching conserved more water and nitrogen for crop use than ck increasing aboveground biomass and yield fig 9 table 4 as reported elsewhere chen et al 2015 as the fertilizer amount increased wue and pfpn decreased indicating that improvements in resource utilization water and nitrogen with mulching would decrease with increasing n application rate causing an imbalance between outputs and inputs wang et al 2018b pm affects soil water and nitrogen utilization forming a new relationship between resource water and nitrogen use and biomass and yield relative to ck the relationship between wue b and nue b was quantified using field data fig 13 under ck nue b increased with the increase in wue b during early growth peaked and then decreased during later growth fig 13a indicating that wue b could be increased through water saving measures but nue b would limit crop growth overall the mulching treatments increased wue b and nue b fig 13b c however during later growth excessive irrigation water could leach soil nutrients and limit nutrient absorption by crops decreasing nue b combining the et and soil no3 n storage results et consumption did not significantly differ between treatments during later growth and large amounts of irrigation water would mainly leach soil nitrogen figs 5 and 7 this could explain why mulching can limit crop growth and yield wang et al 2020a 2020b the impact of pm on maize yield and biomass in dryland areas differs with its effectiveness related to factors including n supply water supply soil temperature and mulching duration ibrahim et al 2020 qin et al 2018 the hp treatments significantly increased maize yield and biomass p 0 05 compared with ck the transparent film increased yield and biomass more than the black film under the same n supply it is likely that film mulching retains more soil water and decreases the total resistance in the soil plant system to enhance photosynthesis leach 1980 gao et al 2019 reported that transparent film mulch increased yield more than black film mulching 24 99 vs 22 74 with 500 mm precipitation however film mulching can alter the water and temperature conditions outside the optimum range of crops decreasing yield zhu et al 2012 in summary under no stress film mulching can improve the relationship between water and nitrogen and promote crop growth however under stress film mulched soil may not actively respond to changes in external conditions restricting crop growth li et al 2013 the transparent film produced hi than black film under the same n supply hi decreased as the fertilizer amount increased some studies have shown that mulching affected the dry matter distribution to increase yield li et al 2020 bai et al 2017 considering the economic yield resource utilization water and nitrogen and environmental nitrogen accumulation benefits transparent film mulch plus fertilization is recommended as the most suitable management method in arid irrigation areas such as hid the study error mainly caused by the soil heterogeneity and annual weather and diseases pests and extreme weather effects on crops were not considered more field experiment data was collected to optimize water and fertilizer management and realized the sustainable development of regional agriculture additionally how to use crop models to explore the application of different management measures e g change in cultivars tillage method organic fertilizer application to deal with future climate change will be our future research goal 5 conclusions a two year field experiment showed that soil water soil nitrate nitrogen and their interaction were affected by film mulching under different nitrogen supply high and low plastic mulching increased groundwater replenishment and soil water storage during crop growth by 34 6 and 6 1 on average and allocated more water to critical growth periods v6 v12 or r3 r6 than bare soil soil nitrogen was retained for crop use under mulching and closely related to aboveground biomass and yield wue and pfpn followed the same trend with ht hb ck as the fertilizer amount increased pffn decreased the relationship between wue b and nue b showed that as wue b increased nue b also increased with mulching we recommend that farmers apply irrigation and fertilizer during early crop growth reducing irrigation during later growth played the role of film mulching to conserve moisture increase water and nitrogen use and increase yield generally transparent film produced higher wue hi and pfpn than black film and ck with high nitrogen supply as the fertilizer amount increased yield and grain nitrogen content increased slightly and the water and nitrogen resource utilization indexes significantly decreased given these results it is suggested that farmers use a high fertilizer amount i e 225 kg n ha 1 for hid and transparent plastic film mulching to increase yield and resource utilization these findings provide a technical reference for the extension of film practice technologies and a theoretical basis for agricultural fertilizer decision making and mulching in arid irrigation areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
