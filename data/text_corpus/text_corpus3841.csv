19205,disinfected drinking water contains hundreds of disinfection by products dbps that are formed by the reaction of disinfectants with natural and anthropogenic organic matter bromide and iodide understanding what these dbps are is important because millions of people worldwide consume drinking water every day and human epidemiologic studies have reported cancer miscarriage and birth defects from consuming such waters while more than 600 dbps are reported in the literature very few studies quantify complete classes of chlorinated brominated and iodinated dbps also very few studies conduct comprehensive non target analyses of unknown dbps to characterize the complete dbp exposure the exposome we developed a new gas chromatography gc mass spectrometry ms method that simultaneously quantifies 39 priority unregulated dbps from six different chemical classes haloacetaldehydes haloketones haloacetamides haloacetonitriles halonitromethanes and iodinated trihalomethanes and analyzes unknown dbps with mass accuracy 600 ppm under full scan conditions using a new type of time of flight tof mass spectrometer which combines selected ion monitoring sim level sensitivity with mass accuracy of 0 05 da method detection limits of 3 61 ng l were achieved these levels were found to be quite comparable to those of a widely used single quadrupole mass spectrometer 2 90 ng l operated in sim mode however analysis using this tof mass spectrometer offers two additional advantages over traditional quadrupole ms 1 full scan data which provides additional confidence for target analytes as well as complete mass spectra for unknown analysis and 2 two decimal place mass accuracy which allows additional confidence for target analytes and importantly molecular formula indication for unknowns high resolution accurate mass tof was also used to validate identification of selected compounds this new method was demonstrated on finished drinking waters from three different drinking water plants where target quantification and non target unknown analyses were performed simultaneously during the same run this enabled the quantification of 39 dbps along with the non target identification of many other drinking water contaminants including two additional non target dbps n n dimethylacetamide and n nitrosodibutylamine graphical abstract image 1 keywords dbps disinfection by products drinking water non target analysis quantification 1 introduction water disinfection is used worldwide to protect public health against harmful pathogens that cause waterborne diseases however disinfectants can also react with constituents found in natural waters i e natural and anthropogenic organic matter bromide and iodide to unintentionally form dbps that have been associated with several adverse health effects from long term exposure including bladder and colorectal cancer and adverse birth outcomes bove et al 2007 costet et al 2011 grazuleviciene et al 2013 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 2013 righi et al 2012 savitz et al 2005 smith et al 2016 villanueva et al 2004 2007 waller et al 1998 dbps represent one class of chemical exposure amongst many other chemicals that humans are exposed through water air and their environment richardson and ternes 2018 dai et al 2017 and possibly they are one of the most important exposure chemicals because of the relatively high dbp levels in drinking water while many water contaminants such as pesticides pharmaceuticals per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances pfass brominated flame retardants and uv filters are often present in environmental waters at ng l levels richardson and ternes 2011 2014 2018 richardson and kimura 2016 they are generally not detected in finished drinking water in comparison dbps are always present in disinfected drinking water and usually at Î¼g l levels richardson 2011 richardson et al 2007 although more than 600 dbps have been reported in the literature richardson 2011 more than 50 of the total organic halogen resulting from water chlorination has not been identified weinberg et al 2002 krasner et al 2006 and even less is known for alternative disinfectants like ozone and chloramines as a result the complete picture of dbp exposure the exposome is not yet known measurement of all chloro bromo and iodo dbp species of different dbp chemical classes can be intensive and laborious richardson and kimura 2016 richardson and ternes 2011 2014 2018 because generally they are analyzed with separate analytical methods due to their different physical and chemical properties additionally dbps and other environmental contaminants of concern are limited by the technological advancement of analytical instruments and methods that can detect and quantify them therefore dbps and water contaminants are emerging as research and technology advances in recent years simultaneous target and non target analysis of water contaminants is an increasing trend with liquid chromatography lc ms due to improvements in technology that facilitates this analysis and mass spectrometers that offer high resolution acena et al 2015 krauss et al 2010 leendert et al 2015 pico and barcelo 2015 richardson and kimura 2016 however low level quantification of target compounds is still a common tradeoff to obtaining a well resolved mass spectrum for qualitative identification of non target compounds this is especially true when quantifying small molecules using gc ms most dbp analytical methods focus on one type of analysis richardson 2011 richardson and kimura 2016 richardson and ternes 2011 2014 2018 typically for gc single quadrupole sq mass spectrometers target compounds are monitored in sim mode where only one or two ions are monitored for each analyte at a specific retention time while samples are analyzed for trace levels of target compounds information that pertains to non target compounds is lost samples would require re analysis in full scan mode with the downside of lower sensitivity compared to sim mode additionally non target analysis is a rigorous process that typically involves careful background subtraction library searching with standard or user defined libraries manual interpretation of mass spectra not present in library databases exact mass and molecular formula determination and confirmation of tentative identifications with authentic chemical standards match of mass spectrum and retention time krauss et al 2010 weinberg et al 2002 krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008a b postigo et al 2016 schymanski et al 2014 gong and zhang 2015 pan et al 2016 often dbps are difficult to confirm due to the lack of commercially available standards synthesis of these standards can be time and resource consuming a higher resolved mass spectrum can narrow the list of possible candidate analytes and minimize false positives for dbp analysis a gc mass spectrometer with high resolving power e g 10 000 can provide accurate mass data with low mass error however an increase in resolving power is typically associated with a substantial decrease in sensitivity in this study a simultaneous quantification of 39 target unregulated dbps and non target analysis of other unknown dbps and contaminants was achieved at high sensitivity and increased mass accuracy 600 ppm using a newly developed tof mass spectrometer this mass spectrometer has several new developments compared to other instrumentation significantly faster ion pulse frequency 35 khz to improve the duty cycle full mass spectral profile acquisition not centroided and a redesigned ion source to support the increased pulse frequency and mass profile characteristics quantitative results achieved in full scan were compared to sim analyses carried out using a gc sq mass spectrometer target dbps from six different complete chemical classes including haloacetaldehydes hals halonitromethanes hnms haloacetamides hams haloacetonitriles hans haloketones hks and iodinated trihalomethanes i thms were quantified in one single analytical method these 39 dbps were chosen because most of them are much more cytotoxic or genotoxic than the dbps currently regulated and recent studies have shown that they can be the overall drivers of toxicity in drinking water samples despite their lower concentrations relative to regulated thms and haas plewa et al 2017 krasner et al 2016 this quantitative and qualitative method was used to evaluate finished drinking waters with different source waters and disinfection treatments in which sensitive quantitative results were achieved along with comprehensive identification of non target unknown dbps and other chemical contaminants 2 material and methods 2 1 water samples drinking water and source water samples were collected headspace free in 1 l amber glass bottles that contained 5 mg of ammonium chloride to quench the active disinfectant and were preserved by adjusting the ph to 3 5 4 with 1 5 ml of 1 m h2so4 prior to extraction and gc ms analysis samples were stored at 4 c with holding times between 24 h and 3 days water quality parameters are shown in table 1 samples 1 and 2 were from water treatment plants 40 miles apart that treat the same source water lake michigan both use conventional treatment flocculation sedimentation filtration disinfection with the difference that site 1 uses anthracite filtration followed by free chlorine disinfection and site 2 uses granular activated carbon gac filtration followed by pre formed chloramine as a disinfectant sample 3 was from a city that uses a deep aquifer as their source water and conventional treatment with free chlorine 2 2 reagents and solutions analytical standards for priority dbps were purchased or custom synthesized at the highest purity available from cansyn chem corp toronto ontario sigma aldrich st louis mo aldlab chemicals boston ma and tci america boston ma as shown in table 2 organic solvents were of the highest purity available acetonitrile methyl tert butyl ether mtbe methanol and pure water were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo and fisher scientific pittsburgh pa standards were prepared in anhydrous acetonitrile or methanol five 100 200 ppm sub stock solutions containing a mix of compounds from each dbp group hans hks hals hnms and i thms were prepared in acetonitrile and were found to be stable for 12 months for example a han sub stock solution contained a 100 mg l mixture of chloroacetonitrile bromoacetonitrile dichloroacetonitrile bromochloroacetonitrile dibromoacetonitrile and iodoacetonitrile a 10 mg l master sub stock solution that contained all of the dbps except hams because they were stable up to one month only was prepared daily by mixing aliquots of each of the five sub stocks together ham stock solutions were prepared individually every month from pure standards in methanol and combined into a 10 mg l sub stock solution that only contained hams 2 3 instrumentation two gc mass spectrometers were used to quantify and analyze priority dbps the first system was an agilent 7890b gc agilent technologies santa clara ca coupled to a pegasus bt tof mass spectrometer leco corp saint joseph mi mass accuracy of 600 ppm the second system was an agilent 7890b gc coupled to a 5977a single quadrupole sq mass spectrometer agilent technologies santa clara ca both systems use electron ionization ei a 200 rtx gc column restek state college pa was used for both systems with the same injection and oven temperature program the rtx 200 gc column with a crossbond trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane stationary phase is considered one of the most inert mid polarity columns available with a mid polarity phase many compounds with a wider variety of polarity can be resolved which phenyl cyano or wax phases cannot for example several compounds including haloacetamides and iodo thms had substantially improved resolution using this rtx 200 column due to narrower symmetrical peaks which are normally broad tailing peaks with other gc columns samples were introduced into the gc multi mode inlet mmi as a cold pulsed splitless injection at 40 c and ramped at 360 c min to 170 c then ramped at 720 c min to 250 c and held for 44 min the inlet was pulsed at a pressure of 25 psi for 90 s and purged immediately after the pulse at 30 ml min the oven temperature program was as follows hold for 5 min at 35 c then ramped at 9 c min to 220 c followed by a final ramp of 20 c min to 280 c and hold for 20 min transfer line and ion source temperatures were 250 c and 200 c respectively mass spectrometer methods differed for each system because each instrument has a different design to select and quantify ions the bt gc tof ms was programmed at a 30 khz frequency extraction rate with a scan range of m z 30 645 the agilent gc sq ms was programmed using sim for 2 3 ions that pertained to the quantification and qualifier ions for each target analyte with a dwell time of 100 ms for the quantification ion and 50 75 ms for each qualifier ion table 2 pure water samples spiked with 39 target analytes were extracted and analyzed using these two gc ms methods a specific analyte was quantified using the same ion in both systems with the difference that the agilent gc sq ms has nominal mass resolution and the bt gc tof ms has a slightly higher resolution with mass accuracy to two decimal places 600 ppm high resolution mass spectrometry hrms using a pegasus gc hrt tof mass spectrometer 25 000 resolution 1 ppm mass accuracy leco corp saint joseph mi was used to provide further supporting evidence for the structures of unknown dbps gc parameters and the analytical column were identical to those used for the bt gc tof ms and agilent gc ms instruments the pegasus gc hrt tof ms was programmed at a frequency extraction rate of 1 khz with scan range of m z 30 650 2 4 extraction method water samples 100 ml were extracted using liquid liquid extraction lle with 5 ml of mtbe and 30 g of sodium sulfate salting out to increase the extraction efficiency of dbps samples were shaken with a wrist action shaker burrell pittsburg pa for 15 min and held for 10 min for the two phases to separate the mtbe top layer was recovered and the extraction process was repeated twice a total extract of about 15 ml was dried through an anhydrous sodium sulfate column to remove any remaining water in the extract dried extracts were concentrated under a gentle flow of nitrogen to 200 Î¼l the internal standard 1 2 dibromopropane was added to the extract 8 Î¼l of 30 mg l and the extract was analyzed immediately 2 5 calibration curves and method detection limits water samples used for calibration curves and method detection limits mdls were prepared by spiking 10 mg l master stock solutions and ham sub stock solutions into 100 ml of pure water which were extracted immediately water samples with concentrations of 0 010 0 05 0 10 0 25 0 50 1 0 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 Î¼g l were used for calibration curves which had a linear range of three orders of magnitude with r2 0 99 seven replicates for each concentration level of 0 010 0 050 0 10 0 50 and 1 0 Î¼g l were used to determine mdls the instruments minimum detection limits mdls were calculated from the standard deviation n 7 replicates multiplied by the one sided student s t value mdls are defined as the minimum concentration of an analyte that can be detected with 99 confidence that the concentration is greater than zero harris 2003 wells et al 2011 mdls are obtained with the following equation m d l s x t n 1 1 a 0 99 where t n 1 1 a 0 99 is the one sided student s t value 99 confidence level of n 1 and s x is the standard deviation of the replicates in this study we used the instrument signal area counts so the mean of the instrument signal was multiplied by the analyte concentration level cl and divided by the calibration mean x for each analyte wells et al 2011 m d l s x t n 1 1 a 0 99 c l x 2 6 data processing software water extracts processed with the agilent gc sq ms were analyzed with mass hunter software for quantification of target analytes water extracts processed with the bt gc tof ms were analyzed with chromatof software for target and non target quantification nist 2014 and a user mass spectral library were used for non target analysis the user mass spectral library was built by analyzing pure dbp standards with a leco pegasus gc hrt mass spectrometer 25 000 resolution 3 results and discussion 3 1 method detection limits for target dbps method detection limits for 39 target dbps were determined on both bt and agilent instruments as shown in table 2 the same quantification ion was used for direct comparison results show that the mdls for haloacetaldehydes halonitromethanes haloacetonitriles and haloketones obtained on the bt gc tof ms 3 36 ng l in full scan mode were comparable to the agilent gc sq ms 3 43 ng l in sim mode the mdls for i thms were slightly higher on the agilent gc sq ms 12 90 ng l compared to the bt gc tof ms 3 26 ng l however haloacetamides had slightly higher mdls for the bt gc tof ms system 10 324 ng l compared to the agilent gc sq ms 7 50 ng l which was mainly driven by dibromochloroacetamide mdl of 324 ng l these results show that a tof ms system in full scan mode can have high sensitivity comparable to a sq ms system in sim mode typically there is a trade off between mass accuracy and sensitivity but in this case the bt gc tof ms was able to provide two decimal place mass accuracy while providing parts per trillion level sensitivity for quantification of low molecular weight dbps this is advantageous because of the capacity to simultaneously perform quantification of target analytes and identify non target analytes in complex environmental samples moreover the acquisition of full scan data allows for retroactive analysis of data providing the possibility to identify other compounds at a later time and also re analyze other quantification ions without the need to rerun samples or standards of the 39 target dbps seven were further evaluated post run for an additional quantifying ion because these compounds had an ion with higher signal to noise ratio s n compared to the ion with the highest abundance table 2 including bromochloroacetamide dibromoacetamide bromodichloroacetamide dibromochloroacetamide tribromoacetamide 1 bromo 1 1 dichloropropanone and iodoform quantifying ions were selected based on the highest abundance or on the highest s n while it is preferred that the quantifying ion have both criteria it is not always the case for example most haloacetamides have m z 44 01 as their base peak which is often used as the quantifying ion however m z 44 01 is a common ion that is shared among many compounds which lowers the s n ratio as shown for bromochloroacetamide in fig 1 a even though the abundance for base peak at m z 44 01 was 2 107 a significantly high signal the s n ratio was only 9 1 on the other hand m z 172 91 had a higher s n of 56 with a lower abundance of 1 5 104 when comparing mdls between ions m z 172 91 had a lower mdl of 6 0 ng l than the base peak at m z 44 01 13 0 ng l bromodichloroacetamide dibromochloroacetamide and 1 bromo 1 1 dichloropropanone also had lower mdls 61 19 and 25 ng l respectively using ions with higher s n ratios dibromoacetamide tribromoacetamide and iodoform had lower mdls 10 0 48 0 and 24 0 ng l respectively with the most abundant ions as a result ions that provided the lowest mdls were chosen and used for quantification of drinking water samples final mdls used for the agilent gc sq ms and the bt gc tof ms for quantification of drinking water samples are summarized in table 2 mass resolution also plays a major role in the selection of quantifying ions mass analyzers measure the mass to charge m z ratios of ions based on different principles hoffman and stroobant 2007 a sq mass spectrometer is a scanning analyzer that transmits specific ions consecutively over a period of time at low mass resolution tof ms transmits all ions at once through a flight tube and their m z ratios are determined by the time the ions take to reach the detector the advantage of using a mass accuracy of 0 05 da compared to other instruments with lower mass resolution is illustrated for tribromoacetaldehyde fig 2 a mass accuracy of 0 5 da for the quantifying ion m z 172 8 as shown in fig 2a similar to a sq mass spectrometer captures a wide mass range that can overlap with ions from analytes other than tribromoacetaldehyde significantly higher noise is observed in chromatogram 2a compared to 2b fig 2 the tof mass spectrometer fig 2b has a higher mass accuracy of 172 84 0 05 that is more specific to tribromoacetaldehyde s base peak with a lower mass error of 10 4 ppm calculated exact mass of 172 84179 additionally mass tolerances can also be used as a filtering parameter for target quantification and identification of non target compounds 3 2 target priority dbps in treated drinking waters dbps are composed of many different classes of compounds with different chemical and physical properties which make it difficult to analyze them with a single method however in this study a new analytical method with very low mdls was used to simultaneously quantify six different classes of dbps in chlorinated and chloraminated drinking water samples all quantified dbps grouped by chemical class and individually stacked are shown in fig 3 hals were the most predominant of the dbp classes quantified in all three sites which agrees with a previous dbp nationwide occurrence study that found hals to be the third largest dbp class by weight followed by thms and haas which were the highest in concentration krasner et al 2006 weinberg et al 2002 for example median levels of the sum of the four regulated thms thm4 and the sum of the nine bromo chloro haas haa9 including the five regulated haas were 31 Î¼g l and 34 Î¼g l respectively while the median level of hals was 4 Î¼g l in the nationwide occurrence study krasner et al 2006 hals were 3 0 5 and 3 7 Î¼g l in disinfected waters from sites 1 2 and 3 respectively the two water utilities that use chlorine as the disinfectant site 1 and site 3 produced the highest concentration of total hals 3 0 and 3 7 Î¼g l respectively and total hans 1 9 and 1 8 Î¼g l respectively trichloroacetaldehyde and bromodichloroacetaldehyde were the major contributors to total hal concentrations and dichloroacetonitrile and bromochloroacetonitrile to total han concentrations fig 4 a and b chloraminated waters from site 2 formed 0 49 and 0 21 Î¼g l for total hals and hans respectively hks were the third largest dbp group of the dbp classes measured in this study for site 1 1 4 Î¼g l driven by 1 1 1 trichloropropanone fig 4d sites 2 and 3 had significantly lower hk formation with concentrations of 0 20 and 0 17 Î¼g l respectively in addition to differences in source water and disinfectants another factor in dbp concentrations between the different sites is the use of gac filtration at site 2 whereas site 1 and 3 use sand anthracite filtration it is likely that gac filters at site 2 improved the removal of dbp precursors natural organic matter and therefore dbp levels were lower in fact site 2 had lower concentrations of hals hans and hks than both site 1 and 3 but the use of chloramination likely also played a role a previous study chiu et al 2012 has shown that gac removes dissolved organic carbon carbon based dbp c dbp precursors resulting in lower c dbps which explains lower hals and hks for site 2 although hans are nitrogen containing dbps they are known to have organic carbon precursors kimura et al 2013 that can also be removed by gac site 3 had the highest total hnm 0 29 Î¼g l and i thm 0 49 Î¼g l concentrations by weight as shown in fig 3 hnm formation for site 1 and 2 was 0 21 and 0 09 Î¼g l respectively i thm formation was 0 12 and 0 05 Î¼g l for site 1 and 2 respectively i thms usually form at lower levels in chlorinated waters compared to chloraminated waters postigo et al 2017 richardson et al 2008a b however i thm and hnm formation can increase at higher ph karanfil et al 2011 which may explain the higher concentrations at site 3 ph 8 9 vs the other two sites ph 7 1 7 4 therefore ph might have a significant effect on the formation of both i thms and hnms in finished drinking water hnm and i thm speciation are largely driven by dichloroiodomethane and trichloronitromethane closely followed by dichloronitromethane and bromochloronitromethane fig 4e and f i thm and halonitromethane concentrations were significantly higher in finished water with high ph 8 9 compared to neutral ph 7 3 total hams were detected at similar concentrations 0 15 0 27 Î¼g l in all three sites dichloroacetamide predominantly formed followed by bromochloroacetamide fig 4c and dibromoacetamide despite a somewhat higher total organic carbon toc in the groundwater of site 3 higher levels of hams were found at sites 1 and 2 which treated surface waters 3 3 non target priority dbps in treated drinking waters for non target analysis or unknown compound identification it is important to obtain a clean mass spectrum specific to a compound of interest that can be further interpreted this requires a good chromatographic separation of analytes and software that can deconvolute overlapping mass spectra of coeluting compounds the final mass spectrum of a compound can then be compared to standard e g nist or user defined libraries that rank the compound of interest to possible library matches typically a score of 0 1000 compounds found in samples analyzed with low resolution mass spectrometers are usually tentatively identified using a library match biemann 1962 mclafferty 1966 however a higher mass accuracy provides another level of compound validation by selecting library matches within a specific mass tolerance in this study a second post run data processing method was used for non target analysis the criteria and confidence levels used in this study for non target analyte identification are shown in fig s1 and follow the procedure published by schymanski et al 2014 which assigns confidence levels based on evidence obtained through determination of accurate mass and molecular formula isotopic patterns library database match manual interpretation of ms fragment ions highest confidence levels are when no other structure fits the experimental information level 2 and when structures are confirmed by the match of the mass spectrum and retention time with an authentic standard level 1 results were processed with chromatof software which deconvolutes all the collected data and selects peaks that have a minimum s n of 10 and at least three m z ions to be considered for further compound identification deconvoluted peaks were compared to the nist library and a user mass spectral library database and then filtered by similarity score 700 out of 1000 non target compounds with a similarity score 700 are shown in table s1 a total of 91 compounds were identified as non target analytes from the analysis of three raw and finished water samples by including a mass tolerance of 600 ppm the non target list was reduced to 58 possible candidates table s2 using both library similarity and mass accuracy aids the analyst in choosing potential candidate analytes more accurately candidate analytes were individually inspected with their corresponding library matches compared simultaneously with method blanks and identified in both replicates of each sample potential molecular formulas of candidate analytes from table s2 were supported with accurate mass data from a high resolution 25 000 resolution tof mass spectrometer level 2 confidence candidate analytes were narrowed down based on the molecular ion mass accuracy 2 ppm and similarity 700 as shown in table s3 retention time library match accurate mass data mass error and confidence levels for each sample analyzed by hrms and with the bt gc tof mass spectrometer are shown in tables s4 s8 several candidate analytes initially found using the bt gc tof ms instrument were not observed with the high resolution hr tof ms due to lower sensitivity on the high resolution instrument in one example most ions in the mass spectrum of 1 bromo 1 chloropropan 2 one were observed in the hr tof ms data but because the molecular ion and accompanying isotope pattern had low abundance and was not detected with the hr tof ms the accurate mass of that particular analyte could not be confirmed the exact molecular formulas for twelve non target compounds were obtained with hr tof ms including two thms dibromochloromethane and bromoform a ketone 3 pentanone two aldehydes furfural benzeneacetaldehyde an acetamide n n dimethylacetamide an ester ethylbenzoate a nitrile benzyl nitrile two aromatic compounds benzothiazole quinoline and a nitrosamine n nitrosodibutylamine analytical standards were acquired for the twelve level 2 analytes for further confirmation of retention time five analytes were confirmed at level 1 including dibromochloromethane bromoform n n dimethylacetamide n nitrosodibutylamine and benzothiazole n nitrosodibutylamine ndba is an unregulated dbp that was detected as a non target analyte in finished drinking waters in this study nitrosamines are suspected human carcinogens and are of health concern iarc 1978 ndba has been detected in finished and sources water in china the u k canada and the u s wang et al 2016 wang et al 2011 russell et al 2012 templeton and chen 2010 in a recent study of 54 finished drinking water in 30 cities in china ndba was found in 51 9 of the analyzed samples with concentrations between 0 4 and 25 3 ng l in finished drinking waters and 0 8 48 2 ng l in source waters wang et al 2016 higher levels of ndba in source waters compared to finished waters was also observed in an earlier study by the same authors wang et al 2011 ndba was detected in only five water systems 0 4 of the total monitored water systems in the u s that chlorinated groundwater russell et al 2012 however ndba was detected in 32 water systems in ontario canada 20 of the total monitored water systems several compounds were found in both raw waters and finished drinking waters for example n n dimethylacetamide dma a water soluble compound commonly used as an industrial solvent snyder 1990 and in pharmaceuticals ghayor et al 2017 was identified in lake water raw water for site 2 and for the first time in finished drinking waters dma was previously detected in environmental samples including seawater river water rain water and wastewater effluents in japan kadokami et al 1993 with mean concentrations of 0 052 0 046 0 64 and 0 59 Î¼g l respectively benzothiazole which is used in the production of rubber as an herbicide and fungicide and as a stabilizer in the photo industry bahnmuller et al 2015 engels et al 1993 hartley and kidd 1987 bugby et al 1990 kennedy 1986 wik and dave 2009 was detected in all of the finished drinking water samples and most raw water samples because of its low degradability in wastewater treatment reemtsma et al 2006 it has been found in multiple aquatic environments van leerdam et al 2009 benzothiazole metabolites are of particular concern because they are carcinogens that have been associated with human bladder cancer ginsberg et al 2011 dibromochloromethane and bromoform are regulated dbps are commonly found in finished drinking waters richardson 2011 and were identified in all three disinfected water samples dibromochloromethane was also detected in the raw waters of site 2 identification of unknowns not present in libraries without the use of accurate mass data remains quite a challenging effort with only low resolution mass spectrometry there are numerous molecular formulas possible for unknown dbps typically 10 20 possible formulas for compounds in the 200 500 molecular weight range and each molecular formula can have many structural possibilities high resolution ms provides accurate masses typically 3 or 4 decimal places which significantly narrows the choices of formulas often to a single formula for the molecular ion and it also assists with determining the molecular composition of fragment ions which helps in determining the overall structure of the molecule to assist with unknown identification the bt gc tof ms software contains filters that can be programmed to identify specific isotope patterns and pinpoint halogen containing molecules filters were programmed to identify peaks that contained m z fragment patterns of one two or three bromine and chlorine atoms as shown in tables s9 and s10 using these filters trans 2 3 4 trichloro 2 butenenitrile was tentatively identified from its two and three chlorine isotope patterns m z 133 95 135 95 137 95 and m z 168 91 170 91 172 91 as shown in fig 5 this analyte co eluted with other compounds making it difficult to identify to overcome this all fragment ions were graphed and only those that overlay with each other were identified highlighted in blue in fig 5 and are specific to one analyte in this case trans 2 3 4 trichloro 2 butenenitrile hrms analysis did not detect the molecular ion possibly due to its low intensity and lower sensitivity of the hr ms instrument trans 2 3 4 trichloro 2 butenenitrile has been predicted to be a carcinogen based on a structure activity relationship model woo et al 2002 this halonitrile has only been reported once in finished chlorinated waters richardson 2011 which used a large volume extraction and a concentration factor of 10 000x however in our study trans 2 3 4 trichloro 2 butenenitrile was detected with a concentration factor of 500x which is 20 times lower than the previous study these results show that the bt gc tof ms is capable of non target analysis and is complementary to hr ms the combined high sensitivity and mass accuracy of 0 05 da of the bt provides a powerful tool for initial non target screening analysis potential analyte lists are narrowed down and resources may be focused on a condensed candidate list for further confirmation and analysis with hrms and analytical standards furthermore filters may be used to search for analytes that have specific isotope patterns of interest and may be used for the identification of unknowns thus reducing the time for interpretation 4 conclusions a new analytical method using a gc tof ms with high sensitivity mass accuracy of 0 05 da and software tools was developed to quantify six different classes of dbps at trace levels and simultaneously performed non target analysis method detection limits of 3 61 ng l were achieved using the gc tof ms these levels were comparable to those of a widely used single quadrupole mass spectrometer 2 90 ng l finished and raw waters from three drinking water utilities were analyzed and chlorinated and chloraminated waters produced different dbp speciation chlorinated waters formed haloacetaldehydes predominantly followed by haloacetonitriles and haloketones chloraminated water also produced primarily haloacetaldehydes but at lower concentrations than chlorinated waters followed by haloacetamides and haloacetonitriles i thm and halonitromethane concentrations were significantly higher in finished water with high ph 8 9 compared to neutral ph 7 3 the nitrosamine n nitrosodibutylamine was detected in all three sampled waters and n n dimethylacetamide was identified for the first time in

19205,disinfected drinking water contains hundreds of disinfection by products dbps that are formed by the reaction of disinfectants with natural and anthropogenic organic matter bromide and iodide understanding what these dbps are is important because millions of people worldwide consume drinking water every day and human epidemiologic studies have reported cancer miscarriage and birth defects from consuming such waters while more than 600 dbps are reported in the literature very few studies quantify complete classes of chlorinated brominated and iodinated dbps also very few studies conduct comprehensive non target analyses of unknown dbps to characterize the complete dbp exposure the exposome we developed a new gas chromatography gc mass spectrometry ms method that simultaneously quantifies 39 priority unregulated dbps from six different chemical classes haloacetaldehydes haloketones haloacetamides haloacetonitriles halonitromethanes and iodinated trihalomethanes and analyzes unknown dbps with mass accuracy 600 ppm under full scan conditions using a new type of time of flight tof mass spectrometer which combines selected ion monitoring sim level sensitivity with mass accuracy of 0 05 da method detection limits of 3 61 ng l were achieved these levels were found to be quite comparable to those of a widely used single quadrupole mass spectrometer 2 90 ng l operated in sim mode however analysis using this tof mass spectrometer offers two additional advantages over traditional quadrupole ms 1 full scan data which provides additional confidence for target analytes as well as complete mass spectra for unknown analysis and 2 two decimal place mass accuracy which allows additional confidence for target analytes and importantly molecular formula indication for unknowns high resolution accurate mass tof was also used to validate identification of selected compounds this new method was demonstrated on finished drinking waters from three different drinking water plants where target quantification and non target unknown analyses were performed simultaneously during the same run this enabled the quantification of 39 dbps along with the non target identification of many other drinking water contaminants including two additional non target dbps n n dimethylacetamide and n nitrosodibutylamine graphical abstract image 1 keywords dbps disinfection by products drinking water non target analysis quantification 1 introduction water disinfection is used worldwide to protect public health against harmful pathogens that cause waterborne diseases however disinfectants can also react with constituents found in natural waters i e natural and anthropogenic organic matter bromide and iodide to unintentionally form dbps that have been associated with several adverse health effects from long term exposure including bladder and colorectal cancer and adverse birth outcomes bove et al 2007 costet et al 2011 grazuleviciene et al 2013 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 2013 righi et al 2012 savitz et al 2005 smith et al 2016 villanueva et al 2004 2007 waller et al 1998 dbps represent one class of chemical exposure amongst many other chemicals that humans are exposed through water air and their environment richardson and ternes 2018 dai et al 2017 and possibly they are one of the most important exposure chemicals because of the relatively high dbp levels in drinking water while many water contaminants such as pesticides pharmaceuticals per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances pfass brominated flame retardants and uv filters are often present in environmental waters at ng l levels richardson and ternes 2011 2014 2018 richardson and kimura 2016 they are generally not detected in finished drinking water in comparison dbps are always present in disinfected drinking water and usually at Î¼g l levels richardson 2011 richardson et al 2007 although more than 600 dbps have been reported in the literature richardson 2011 more than 50 of the total organic halogen resulting from water chlorination has not been identified weinberg et al 2002 krasner et al 2006 and even less is known for alternative disinfectants like ozone and chloramines as a result the complete picture of dbp exposure the exposome is not yet known measurement of all chloro bromo and iodo dbp species of different dbp chemical classes can be intensive and laborious richardson and kimura 2016 richardson and ternes 2011 2014 2018 because generally they are analyzed with separate analytical methods due to their different physical and chemical properties additionally dbps and other environmental contaminants of concern are limited by the technological advancement of analytical instruments and methods that can detect and quantify them therefore dbps and water contaminants are emerging as research and technology advances in recent years simultaneous target and non target analysis of water contaminants is an increasing trend with liquid chromatography lc ms due to improvements in technology that facilitates this analysis and mass spectrometers that offer high resolution acena et al 2015 krauss et al 2010 leendert et al 2015 pico and barcelo 2015 richardson and kimura 2016 however low level quantification of target compounds is still a common tradeoff to obtaining a well resolved mass spectrum for qualitative identification of non target compounds this is especially true when quantifying small molecules using gc ms most dbp analytical methods focus on one type of analysis richardson 2011 richardson and kimura 2016 richardson and ternes 2011 2014 2018 typically for gc single quadrupole sq mass spectrometers target compounds are monitored in sim mode where only one or two ions are monitored for each analyte at a specific retention time while samples are analyzed for trace levels of target compounds information that pertains to non target compounds is lost samples would require re analysis in full scan mode with the downside of lower sensitivity compared to sim mode additionally non target analysis is a rigorous process that typically involves careful background subtraction library searching with standard or user defined libraries manual interpretation of mass spectra not present in library databases exact mass and molecular formula determination and confirmation of tentative identifications with authentic chemical standards match of mass spectrum and retention time krauss et al 2010 weinberg et al 2002 krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008a b postigo et al 2016 schymanski et al 2014 gong and zhang 2015 pan et al 2016 often dbps are difficult to confirm due to the lack of commercially available standards synthesis of these standards can be time and resource consuming a higher resolved mass spectrum can narrow the list of possible candidate analytes and minimize false positives for dbp analysis a gc mass spectrometer with high resolving power e g 10 000 can provide accurate mass data with low mass error however an increase in resolving power is typically associated with a substantial decrease in sensitivity in this study a simultaneous quantification of 39 target unregulated dbps and non target analysis of other unknown dbps and contaminants was achieved at high sensitivity and increased mass accuracy 600 ppm using a newly developed tof mass spectrometer this mass spectrometer has several new developments compared to other instrumentation significantly faster ion pulse frequency 35 khz to improve the duty cycle full mass spectral profile acquisition not centroided and a redesigned ion source to support the increased pulse frequency and mass profile characteristics quantitative results achieved in full scan were compared to sim analyses carried out using a gc sq mass spectrometer target dbps from six different complete chemical classes including haloacetaldehydes hals halonitromethanes hnms haloacetamides hams haloacetonitriles hans haloketones hks and iodinated trihalomethanes i thms were quantified in one single analytical method these 39 dbps were chosen because most of them are much more cytotoxic or genotoxic than the dbps currently regulated and recent studies have shown that they can be the overall drivers of toxicity in drinking water samples despite their lower concentrations relative to regulated thms and haas plewa et al 2017 krasner et al 2016 this quantitative and qualitative method was used to evaluate finished drinking waters with different source waters and disinfection treatments in which sensitive quantitative results were achieved along with comprehensive identification of non target unknown dbps and other chemical contaminants 2 material and methods 2 1 water samples drinking water and source water samples were collected headspace free in 1 l amber glass bottles that contained 5 mg of ammonium chloride to quench the active disinfectant and were preserved by adjusting the ph to 3 5 4 with 1 5 ml of 1 m h2so4 prior to extraction and gc ms analysis samples were stored at 4 c with holding times between 24 h and 3 days water quality parameters are shown in table 1 samples 1 and 2 were from water treatment plants 40 miles apart that treat the same source water lake michigan both use conventional treatment flocculation sedimentation filtration disinfection with the difference that site 1 uses anthracite filtration followed by free chlorine disinfection and site 2 uses granular activated carbon gac filtration followed by pre formed chloramine as a disinfectant sample 3 was from a city that uses a deep aquifer as their source water and conventional treatment with free chlorine 2 2 reagents and solutions analytical standards for priority dbps were purchased or custom synthesized at the highest purity available from cansyn chem corp toronto ontario sigma aldrich st louis mo aldlab chemicals boston ma and tci america boston ma as shown in table 2 organic solvents were of the highest purity available acetonitrile methyl tert butyl ether mtbe methanol and pure water were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo and fisher scientific pittsburgh pa standards were prepared in anhydrous acetonitrile or methanol five 100 200 ppm sub stock solutions containing a mix of compounds from each dbp group hans hks hals hnms and i thms were prepared in acetonitrile and were found to be stable for 12 months for example a han sub stock solution contained a 100 mg l mixture of chloroacetonitrile bromoacetonitrile dichloroacetonitrile bromochloroacetonitrile dibromoacetonitrile and iodoacetonitrile a 10 mg l master sub stock solution that contained all of the dbps except hams because they were stable up to one month only was prepared daily by mixing aliquots of each of the five sub stocks together ham stock solutions were prepared individually every month from pure standards in methanol and combined into a 10 mg l sub stock solution that only contained hams 2 3 instrumentation two gc mass spectrometers were used to quantify and analyze priority dbps the first system was an agilent 7890b gc agilent technologies santa clara ca coupled to a pegasus bt tof mass spectrometer leco corp saint joseph mi mass accuracy of 600 ppm the second system was an agilent 7890b gc coupled to a 5977a single quadrupole sq mass spectrometer agilent technologies santa clara ca both systems use electron ionization ei a 200 rtx gc column restek state college pa was used for both systems with the same injection and oven temperature program the rtx 200 gc column with a crossbond trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane stationary phase is considered one of the most inert mid polarity columns available with a mid polarity phase many compounds with a wider variety of polarity can be resolved which phenyl cyano or wax phases cannot for example several compounds including haloacetamides and iodo thms had substantially improved resolution using this rtx 200 column due to narrower symmetrical peaks which are normally broad tailing peaks with other gc columns samples were introduced into the gc multi mode inlet mmi as a cold pulsed splitless injection at 40 c and ramped at 360 c min to 170 c then ramped at 720 c min to 250 c and held for 44 min the inlet was pulsed at a pressure of 25 psi for 90 s and purged immediately after the pulse at 30 ml min the oven temperature program was as follows hold for 5 min at 35 c then ramped at 9 c min to 220 c followed by a final ramp of 20 c min to 280 c and hold for 20 min transfer line and ion source temperatures were 250 c and 200 c respectively mass spectrometer methods differed for each system because each instrument has a different design to select and quantify ions the bt gc tof ms was programmed at a 30 khz frequency extraction rate with a scan range of m z 30 645 the agilent gc sq ms was programmed using sim for 2 3 ions that pertained to the quantification and qualifier ions for each target analyte with a dwell time of 100 ms for the quantification ion and 50 75 ms for each qualifier ion table 2 pure water samples spiked with 39 target analytes were extracted and analyzed using these two gc ms methods a specific analyte was quantified using the same ion in both systems with the difference that the agilent gc sq ms has nominal mass resolution and the bt gc tof ms has a slightly higher resolution with mass accuracy to two decimal places 600 ppm high resolution mass spectrometry hrms using a pegasus gc hrt tof mass spectrometer 25 000 resolution 1 ppm mass accuracy leco corp saint joseph mi was used to provide further supporting evidence for the structures of unknown dbps gc parameters and the analytical column were identical to those used for the bt gc tof ms and agilent gc ms instruments the pegasus gc hrt tof ms was programmed at a frequency extraction rate of 1 khz with scan range of m z 30 650 2 4 extraction method water samples 100 ml were extracted using liquid liquid extraction lle with 5 ml of mtbe and 30 g of sodium sulfate salting out to increase the extraction efficiency of dbps samples were shaken with a wrist action shaker burrell pittsburg pa for 15 min and held for 10 min for the two phases to separate the mtbe top layer was recovered and the extraction process was repeated twice a total extract of about 15 ml was dried through an anhydrous sodium sulfate column to remove any remaining water in the extract dried extracts were concentrated under a gentle flow of nitrogen to 200 Î¼l the internal standard 1 2 dibromopropane was added to the extract 8 Î¼l of 30 mg l and the extract was analyzed immediately 2 5 calibration curves and method detection limits water samples used for calibration curves and method detection limits mdls were prepared by spiking 10 mg l master stock solutions and ham sub stock solutions into 100 ml of pure water which were extracted immediately water samples with concentrations of 0 010 0 05 0 10 0 25 0 50 1 0 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 Î¼g l were used for calibration curves which had a linear range of three orders of magnitude with r2 0 99 seven replicates for each concentration level of 0 010 0 050 0 10 0 50 and 1 0 Î¼g l were used to determine mdls the instruments minimum detection limits mdls were calculated from the standard deviation n 7 replicates multiplied by the one sided student s t value mdls are defined as the minimum concentration of an analyte that can be detected with 99 confidence that the concentration is greater than zero harris 2003 wells et al 2011 mdls are obtained with the following equation m d l s x t n 1 1 a 0 99 where t n 1 1 a 0 99 is the one sided student s t value 99 confidence level of n 1 and s x is the standard deviation of the replicates in this study we used the instrument signal area counts so the mean of the instrument signal was multiplied by the analyte concentration level cl and divided by the calibration mean x for each analyte wells et al 2011 m d l s x t n 1 1 a 0 99 c l x 2 6 data processing software water extracts processed with the agilent gc sq ms were analyzed with mass hunter software for quantification of target analytes water extracts processed with the bt gc tof ms were analyzed with chromatof software for target and non target quantification nist 2014 and a user mass spectral library were used for non target analysis the user mass spectral library was built by analyzing pure dbp standards with a leco pegasus gc hrt mass spectrometer 25 000 resolution 3 results and discussion 3 1 method detection limits for target dbps method detection limits for 39 target dbps were determined on both bt and agilent instruments as shown in table 2 the same quantification ion was used for direct comparison results show that the mdls for haloacetaldehydes halonitromethanes haloacetonitriles and haloketones obtained on the bt gc tof ms 3 36 ng l in full scan mode were comparable to the agilent gc sq ms 3 43 ng l in sim mode the mdls for i thms were slightly higher on the agilent gc sq ms 12 90 ng l compared to the bt gc tof ms 3 26 ng l however haloacetamides had slightly higher mdls for the bt gc tof ms system 10 324 ng l compared to the agilent gc sq ms 7 50 ng l which was mainly driven by dibromochloroacetamide mdl of 324 ng l these results show that a tof ms system in full scan mode can have high sensitivity comparable to a sq ms system in sim mode typically there is a trade off between mass accuracy and sensitivity but in this case the bt gc tof ms was able to provide two decimal place mass accuracy while providing parts per trillion level sensitivity for quantification of low molecular weight dbps this is advantageous because of the capacity to simultaneously perform quantification of target analytes and identify non target analytes in complex environmental samples moreover the acquisition of full scan data allows for retroactive analysis of data providing the possibility to identify other compounds at a later time and also re analyze other quantification ions without the need to rerun samples or standards of the 39 target dbps seven were further evaluated post run for an additional quantifying ion because these compounds had an ion with higher signal to noise ratio s n compared to the ion with the highest abundance table 2 including bromochloroacetamide dibromoacetamide bromodichloroacetamide dibromochloroacetamide tribromoacetamide 1 bromo 1 1 dichloropropanone and iodoform quantifying ions were selected based on the highest abundance or on the highest s n while it is preferred that the quantifying ion have both criteria it is not always the case for example most haloacetamides have m z 44 01 as their base peak which is often used as the quantifying ion however m z 44 01 is a common ion that is shared among many compounds which lowers the s n ratio as shown for bromochloroacetamide in fig 1 a even though the abundance for base peak at m z 44 01 was 2 107 a significantly high signal the s n ratio was only 9 1 on the other hand m z 172 91 had a higher s n of 56 with a lower abundance of 1 5 104 when comparing mdls between ions m z 172 91 had a lower mdl of 6 0 ng l than the base peak at m z 44 01 13 0 ng l bromodichloroacetamide dibromochloroacetamide and 1 bromo 1 1 dichloropropanone also had lower mdls 61 19 and 25 ng l respectively using ions with higher s n ratios dibromoacetamide tribromoacetamide and iodoform had lower mdls 10 0 48 0 and 24 0 ng l respectively with the most abundant ions as a result ions that provided the lowest mdls were chosen and used for quantification of drinking water samples final mdls used for the agilent gc sq ms and the bt gc tof ms for quantification of drinking water samples are summarized in table 2 mass resolution also plays a major role in the selection of quantifying ions mass analyzers measure the mass to charge m z ratios of ions based on different principles hoffman and stroobant 2007 a sq mass spectrometer is a scanning analyzer that transmits specific ions consecutively over a period of time at low mass resolution tof ms transmits all ions at once through a flight tube and their m z ratios are determined by the time the ions take to reach the detector the advantage of using a mass accuracy of 0 05 da compared to other instruments with lower mass resolution is illustrated for tribromoacetaldehyde fig 2 a mass accuracy of 0 5 da for the quantifying ion m z 172 8 as shown in fig 2a similar to a sq mass spectrometer captures a wide mass range that can overlap with ions from analytes other than tribromoacetaldehyde significantly higher noise is observed in chromatogram 2a compared to 2b fig 2 the tof mass spectrometer fig 2b has a higher mass accuracy of 172 84 0 05 that is more specific to tribromoacetaldehyde s base peak with a lower mass error of 10 4 ppm calculated exact mass of 172 84179 additionally mass tolerances can also be used as a filtering parameter for target quantification and identification of non target compounds 3 2 target priority dbps in treated drinking waters dbps are composed of many different classes of compounds with different chemical and physical properties which make it difficult to analyze them with a single method however in this study a new analytical method with very low mdls was used to simultaneously quantify six different classes of dbps in chlorinated and chloraminated drinking water samples all quantified dbps grouped by chemical class and individually stacked are shown in fig 3 hals were the most predominant of the dbp classes quantified in all three sites which agrees with a previous dbp nationwide occurrence study that found hals to be the third largest dbp class by weight followed by thms and haas which were the highest in concentration krasner et al 2006 weinberg et al 2002 for example median levels of the sum of the four regulated thms thm4 and the sum of the nine bromo chloro haas haa9 including the five regulated haas were 31 Î¼g l and 34 Î¼g l respectively while the median level of hals was 4 Î¼g l in the nationwide occurrence study krasner et al 2006 hals were 3 0 5 and 3 7 Î¼g l in disinfected waters from sites 1 2 and 3 respectively the two water utilities that use chlorine as the disinfectant site 1 and site 3 produced the highest concentration of total hals 3 0 and 3 7 Î¼g l respectively and total hans 1 9 and 1 8 Î¼g l respectively trichloroacetaldehyde and bromodichloroacetaldehyde were the major contributors to total hal concentrations and dichloroacetonitrile and bromochloroacetonitrile to total han concentrations fig 4 a and b chloraminated waters from site 2 formed 0 49 and 0 21 Î¼g l for total hals and hans respectively hks were the third largest dbp group of the dbp classes measured in this study for site 1 1 4 Î¼g l driven by 1 1 1 trichloropropanone fig 4d sites 2 and 3 had significantly lower hk formation with concentrations of 0 20 and 0 17 Î¼g l respectively in addition to differences in source water and disinfectants another factor in dbp concentrations between the different sites is the use of gac filtration at site 2 whereas site 1 and 3 use sand anthracite filtration it is likely that gac filters at site 2 improved the removal of dbp precursors natural organic matter and therefore dbp levels were lower in fact site 2 had lower concentrations of hals hans and hks than both site 1 and 3 but the use of chloramination likely also played a role a previous study chiu et al 2012 has shown that gac removes dissolved organic carbon carbon based dbp c dbp precursors resulting in lower c dbps which explains lower hals and hks for site 2 although hans are nitrogen containing dbps they are known to have organic carbon precursors kimura et al 2013 that can also be removed by gac site 3 had the highest total hnm 0 29 Î¼g l and i thm 0 49 Î¼g l concentrations by weight as shown in fig 3 hnm formation for site 1 and 2 was 0 21 and 0 09 Î¼g l respectively i thm formation was 0 12 and 0 05 Î¼g l for site 1 and 2 respectively i thms usually form at lower levels in chlorinated waters compared to chloraminated waters postigo et al 2017 richardson et al 2008a b however i thm and hnm formation can increase at higher ph karanfil et al 2011 which may explain the higher concentrations at site 3 ph 8 9 vs the other two sites ph 7 1 7 4 therefore ph might have a significant effect on the formation of both i thms and hnms in finished drinking water hnm and i thm speciation are largely driven by dichloroiodomethane and trichloronitromethane closely followed by dichloronitromethane and bromochloronitromethane fig 4e and f i thm and halonitromethane concentrations were significantly higher in finished water with high ph 8 9 compared to neutral ph 7 3 total hams were detected at similar concentrations 0 15 0 27 Î¼g l in all three sites dichloroacetamide predominantly formed followed by bromochloroacetamide fig 4c and dibromoacetamide despite a somewhat higher total organic carbon toc in the groundwater of site 3 higher levels of hams were found at sites 1 and 2 which treated surface waters 3 3 non target priority dbps in treated drinking waters for non target analysis or unknown compound identification it is important to obtain a clean mass spectrum specific to a compound of interest that can be further interpreted this requires a good chromatographic separation of analytes and software that can deconvolute overlapping mass spectra of coeluting compounds the final mass spectrum of a compound can then be compared to standard e g nist or user defined libraries that rank the compound of interest to possible library matches typically a score of 0 1000 compounds found in samples analyzed with low resolution mass spectrometers are usually tentatively identified using a library match biemann 1962 mclafferty 1966 however a higher mass accuracy provides another level of compound validation by selecting library matches within a specific mass tolerance in this study a second post run data processing method was used for non target analysis the criteria and confidence levels used in this study for non target analyte identification are shown in fig s1 and follow the procedure published by schymanski et al 2014 which assigns confidence levels based on evidence obtained through determination of accurate mass and molecular formula isotopic patterns library database match manual interpretation of ms fragment ions highest confidence levels are when no other structure fits the experimental information level 2 and when structures are confirmed by the match of the mass spectrum and retention time with an authentic standard level 1 results were processed with chromatof software which deconvolutes all the collected data and selects peaks that have a minimum s n of 10 and at least three m z ions to be considered for further compound identification deconvoluted peaks were compared to the nist library and a user mass spectral library database and then filtered by similarity score 700 out of 1000 non target compounds with a similarity score 700 are shown in table s1 a total of 91 compounds were identified as non target analytes from the analysis of three raw and finished water samples by including a mass tolerance of 600 ppm the non target list was reduced to 58 possible candidates table s2 using both library similarity and mass accuracy aids the analyst in choosing potential candidate analytes more accurately candidate analytes were individually inspected with their corresponding library matches compared simultaneously with method blanks and identified in both replicates of each sample potential molecular formulas of candidate analytes from table s2 were supported with accurate mass data from a high resolution 25 000 resolution tof mass spectrometer level 2 confidence candidate analytes were narrowed down based on the molecular ion mass accuracy 2 ppm and similarity 700 as shown in table s3 retention time library match accurate mass data mass error and confidence levels for each sample analyzed by hrms and with the bt gc tof mass spectrometer are shown in tables s4 s8 several candidate analytes initially found using the bt gc tof ms instrument were not observed with the high resolution hr tof ms due to lower sensitivity on the high resolution instrument in one example most ions in the mass spectrum of 1 bromo 1 chloropropan 2 one were observed in the hr tof ms data but because the molecular ion and accompanying isotope pattern had low abundance and was not detected with the hr tof ms the accurate mass of that particular analyte could not be confirmed the exact molecular formulas for twelve non target compounds were obtained with hr tof ms including two thms dibromochloromethane and bromoform a ketone 3 pentanone two aldehydes furfural benzeneacetaldehyde an acetamide n n dimethylacetamide an ester ethylbenzoate a nitrile benzyl nitrile two aromatic compounds benzothiazole quinoline and a nitrosamine n nitrosodibutylamine analytical standards were acquired for the twelve level 2 analytes for further confirmation of retention time five analytes were confirmed at level 1 including dibromochloromethane bromoform n n dimethylacetamide n nitrosodibutylamine and benzothiazole n nitrosodibutylamine ndba is an unregulated dbp that was detected as a non target analyte in finished drinking waters in this study nitrosamines are suspected human carcinogens and are of health concern iarc 1978 ndba has been detected in finished and sources water in china the u k canada and the u s wang et al 2016 wang et al 2011 russell et al 2012 templeton and chen 2010 in a recent study of 54 finished drinking water in 30 cities in china ndba was found in 51 9 of the analyzed samples with concentrations between 0 4 and 25 3 ng l in finished drinking waters and 0 8 48 2 ng l in source waters wang et al 2016 higher levels of ndba in source waters compared to finished waters was also observed in an earlier study by the same authors wang et al 2011 ndba was detected in only five water systems 0 4 of the total monitored water systems in the u s that chlorinated groundwater russell et al 2012 however ndba was detected in 32 water systems in ontario canada 20 of the total monitored water systems several compounds were found in both raw waters and finished drinking waters for example n n dimethylacetamide dma a water soluble compound commonly used as an industrial solvent snyder 1990 and in pharmaceuticals ghayor et al 2017 was identified in lake water raw water for site 2 and for the first time in finished drinking waters dma was previously detected in environmental samples including seawater river water rain water and wastewater effluents in japan kadokami et al 1993 with mean concentrations of 0 052 0 046 0 64 and 0 59 Î¼g l respectively benzothiazole which is used in the production of rubber as an herbicide and fungicide and as a stabilizer in the photo industry bahnmuller et al 2015 engels et al 1993 hartley and kidd 1987 bugby et al 1990 kennedy 1986 wik and dave 2009 was detected in all of the finished drinking water samples and most raw water samples because of its low degradability in wastewater treatment reemtsma et al 2006 it has been found in multiple aquatic environments van leerdam et al 2009 benzothiazole metabolites are of particular concern because they are carcinogens that have been associated with human bladder cancer ginsberg et al 2011 dibromochloromethane and bromoform are regulated dbps are commonly found in finished drinking waters richardson 2011 and were identified in all three disinfected water samples dibromochloromethane was also detected in the raw waters of site 2 identification of unknowns not present in libraries without the use of accurate mass data remains quite a challenging effort with only low resolution mass spectrometry there are numerous molecular formulas possible for unknown dbps typically 10 20 possible formulas for compounds in the 200 500 molecular weight range and each molecular formula can have many structural possibilities high resolution ms provides accurate masses typically 3 or 4 decimal places which significantly narrows the choices of formulas often to a single formula for the molecular ion and it also assists with determining the molecular composition of fragment ions which helps in determining the overall structure of the molecule to assist with unknown identification the bt gc tof ms software contains filters that can be programmed to identify specific isotope patterns and pinpoint halogen containing molecules filters were programmed to identify peaks that contained m z fragment patterns of one two or three bromine and chlorine atoms as shown in tables s9 and s10 using these filters trans 2 3 4 trichloro 2 butenenitrile was tentatively identified from its two and three chlorine isotope patterns m z 133 95 135 95 137 95 and m z 168 91 170 91 172 91 as shown in fig 5 this analyte co eluted with other compounds making it difficult to identify to overcome this all fragment ions were graphed and only those that overlay with each other were identified highlighted in blue in fig 5 and are specific to one analyte in this case trans 2 3 4 trichloro 2 butenenitrile hrms analysis did not detect the molecular ion possibly due to its low intensity and lower sensitivity of the hr ms instrument trans 2 3 4 trichloro 2 butenenitrile has been predicted to be a carcinogen based on a structure activity relationship model woo et al 2002 this halonitrile has only been reported once in finished chlorinated waters richardson 2011 which used a large volume extraction and a concentration factor of 10 000x however in our study trans 2 3 4 trichloro 2 butenenitrile was detected with a concentration factor of 500x which is 20 times lower than the previous study these results show that the bt gc tof ms is capable of non target analysis and is complementary to hr ms the combined high sensitivity and mass accuracy of 0 05 da of the bt provides a powerful tool for initial non target screening analysis potential analyte lists are narrowed down and resources may be focused on a condensed candidate list for further confirmation and analysis with hrms and analytical standards furthermore filters may be used to search for analytes that have specific isotope patterns of interest and may be used for the identification of unknowns thus reducing the time for interpretation 4 conclusions a new analytical method using a gc tof ms with high sensitivity mass accuracy of 0 05 da and software tools was developed to quantify six different classes of dbps at trace levels and simultaneously performed non target analysis method detection limits of 3 61 ng l were achieved using the gc tof ms these levels were comparable to those of a widely used single quadrupole mass spectrometer 2 90 ng l finished and raw waters from three drinking water utilities were analyzed and chlorinated

because of its high concentration in ro concentrate eutrophication risk and anti precipitation properties may affect subsequent treatments therefore treatment strategies are needed to eliminate such substances in this study pbtca was degraded by ozonation the results show that pbtca reacted with ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals with second order rate constants of 0 12 0 002 and 7 83 1 51 108 l mol 1 s 1 respectively the phosphorus in pbtca pp was transformed into organic phosphorus except for pbtca po and inorganic phosphorus pi po was further transformed into pi the changes in the concentrations of these phosphorus forms were investigated by model simulation simulation showed that the rate of pp transformation into po was 5 5 times higher than that into pi pbtca was ozonated much faster at alkaline ph than at acidic ph this is ascribed to different amounts of ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals and their different reaction rates with pbtca furthermore anti precipitation property was reduced during ozonation as shown by the amounts and morphology changes of the precipitates pbtca concentration for 50 anti precipitation ap50 did not change during ozonation indicating that the transformation products generated during ozonation did not have anti precipitation effects phosphorus in pbtca was removed by ozonation coagulation treatment total phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus were removed efficiently by using ferric chloride as a coagulant the coagulants tended to bind with inorganic phosphorus to form flocs meanwhile flocs were more easily to aggregate and precipitate as anti precipitation effect was gradually removed thus more phosphorus was removed a combination of ozonation and coagulation removed pbtca effectively and simultaneously reduced its anti precipitation property and phosphorus graphical abstract image 1 keywords antiscalant pbtca ozonation phosphorus transformation anti precipitation property 1 introduction water scarcity is a major issue globally water reclamation provides a portable way of solving this problem the demand for reclaimed water of high quality such as cooling water and boiler water is increasing and reverse osmosis ro is widely used because it can produce superior and stable water quality at low cost istirokhatun et al 2018 however about one fourth of ro influent is converted to ro concentrate roc which is hard to deal with xu et al 2017 sun et al 2014 reported that roc can be pretreated and discharged directly or circulated into biological treatment units in wastewater treatment plants however such treatment cannot eliminate the high salinity of roc and the high risks it poses to reduce the high salinity and high risks of roc it is necessary to determine its components roc contains high concentrations of salts micropollutants and chemical agents such as antiscalants and biocides which are added to ro systems to reduce ro membrane fouling tang et al 2012 xu et al 2017 in roc the concentrations of antiscalants and biocides are higher than those of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds toxicity induced by non oxidizing biocides are also high benner et al 2008 tang et al 2013 it is necessary to stress that anti precipitation effect induced by antiscalants was hazardous for further treatment methods containing a principal of precipitation such as flocculation and precipitation because it can lower the removal efficiencies for heavy metals those unremoved heavy metals will reach a high concentration in water making removal more difficult thus imposing a risk many studies have focused on biocide and micropollutant treatment huang et al 2017 li et al 2016b luo et al 2014 sui et al 2014 less attention has been paid to antiscalants than to biocides and micropollutants and the risks associated with antiscalants have been underestimated organophosphonates which are a type of antiscalant are used widely in ro systems because of their superior performance in reducing scaling of ro membranes zhang et al 2015 this type of antiscalant can pose a high risk if it is not treated appropriately first the concentration of organophosphonates in roc is high and their biodegradation is difficult according to bonnÃ© et al 2000 tang et al 2012 the organophosphonate dosage in ro systems reaches several milligrams per liter therefore their concentration in roc is also several milligrams per liter their biodegradation percentages varied from 5 to 30 in 10 days which is too slow zhang et al 2016 biodegradation is therefore not an efficient method for organophosphonate elimination secondly the mass content of phosphorus element in organophosphonates is 10 30 which is enough to cause the risk of eutrophication considering their dosage in ro systems rott et al 2018 thirdly organophosphonates can chelate with heavy metals and radioactive elements and this assists the transfer of these elements from other phases to aqueous phases which increases their concentration in water rott et al 2018 these heavy metals and radioactive elements can also be stabilized which makes their treatment more difficult therefore the risk of their presence in water is increased finally organophosphonates can prevent precipitate generation by lattice distortion chelating effects and coagulation and dispersion cheng et al 2003 tang et al 2008 this greatly decreases the efficiency of subsequent precipitation which makes removal of heavy metals hardness and salts by chemical precipitation more difficult the risks posed by organophosphonates in roc are therefore high and their treatment is essential little research has been performed on organophosphonates and available treatments for them are limited zhang et al 2016 studied the biodegradation of three organophosphonates by mixed bacteria in natural water and found that their biodegradation rates were low boels et al 2012 used granular ferric hydroxide to adsorb the organophosphonates in roc however the granular ferric hydroxide needed to be changed at regular intervals because of adsorption saturation advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton ozonation and uv cl methods are effective in oxidizing refractory substances du et al 2018 wang et al 2017a 2017b organophosphonates are hard to biodegrade therefore aops are promising methods for their treatment rott et al 2017a huang et al 2018 greenlee et al 2014 and klinger et al 1998 degraded organophosphonates by uv fenton and ozonation methods however most of them did not measure the organophosphonate concentrations precisely and only determined conversion to orthophosphate organophosphonates are generally determined by ion chromatography lv et al 2013 ma et al 2007 schmidt et al 2014 and further studies are needed in this study 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtca an organophosphonate used in ro systems tang et al 2013 was chosen as a representative organophosphonate according to the engineering practices in several full scale ro treatment plants the dosage of pbtca was 3 5 mg l in the influent and 6 20 mg l in ro concentrate meanwhile pbtca has potential risk such as impeding the precipitation of heavy metals in roc and ecological risk from phosphorus content 12 which will be a big obstacle for further treatment of roc basic information is given in table 1 ozonation is widely used in tertiary water treatment because of its high oxidizing capacity and high efficiency therefore ozone was chosen as the oxidant for pbtca degradation the objective of this study was to investigate the kinetics of pbcta ozonation phosphorus transformation during ozonation and the effects of ph on pbtca removal we focused on elimination of risks associated with pbtca such as anti precipitation effects and eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pbtca 50 in water was bought from the tokyo chemical industry co ltd tokyo japan boric acid h3bo3 and sodium borate na2b4o7 10h2o were bought from the beijing modern oriental fine chemistry co ltd beijing china sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 and benzoic acid ba were bought from the aladdin industrial corporation shanghai china sodium hydroxide naoh tert butanol tba and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were purchased from the tianjin guangfu technology development co ltd tianjin china sulfuric acid h2so4 and anhydrous calcium chloride cacl2 were bought from the beijing tongguang fine chemicals company beijing china sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and ferric chloride fecl3 were purchased from xilong scientific guangzhou china all reagents were of analytical grade all experiments were performed with ultrapure water resistivity 18 mÏ cm prepared with a milli q device integral 5 millipore usa all the following experiments were performed at least in duplicate and the standard deviation from one batch was analyzed with a double determination 2 2 batch experiments for pbtca ozonation 2 2 1 rate constant determination for reaction of ozone molecule with pbtca an ozone stock solution of maximum concentration 45 mg l was prepared with an ozone generator cf yg20 shanmeishuimei high technology co ltd beijing china experiments were performed in a 50 ml foil covered beaker with a sealing film at the top and a stirrer speed 400 rpm at the bottom phosphate buffer may affect the chemical equilibrium because of orthophosphate production rott et al 2017a therefore borate buffer was used to maintain the ph greenlee et al 2014 the borate buffer consisted of boric acid 20 mm the ph value was adjusted to a specific value by addition of naoh and h2so4 the solution contained pbtca 15 mg l 56 Î¼m borate buffer of ph 7 and ozone 40 mg l the ozone concentration was lower than that in stock solution because of dilution samples were collected at specific times and the concentrations of pbtca and residual ozone were determined further reaction between residual ozone and pbtca was avoided by adding excess na2s2o3 to quench the residual ozone tba was added as an oh scavenger to determine the rate constant of the ozone molecule pbtca reaction 2 2 2 rate constant determination for reaction of oh radical and pbtca the rate constant of the reaction between oh radical and pbtca was determined by pbtca degradation by uv h2o2 oxidation a low pressure mercury lamp was installed in a quasi collimated beam apparatus to provide uv irradiation the average uv irradiance at the surface of the reactor was 1 45 mw cm2 according to the iodide iodate chemical actinometrical method reported by bolton et al 2011 the initial concentration of pbtca was 15 mg l 56 Î¼m the h2o2 dosage was 1 mm and 20 mm borate buffer was used to maintain ph the procedure was as follows pbtca was oxidized by uv and h2o2 separately to determine their individual rate constants tba was added to avoid oh radical production pbtca was then oxidized by uv h2o2 and ba was added as a competitor the molar concentration of ba was the same as that of pbtca excess na2s2o3 was added during sampling and the time dependent concentrations of pbtca and ba were determined 2 3 semi continuous pbtca ozonation in practical ozonation treatment process ozone was bubbled into the reaction tank continuously ozone dose was important in pbtca ozonation and it had a correlation with time therefore pbtca oxidation under different ozone dosage and time was investigated in semi continuous experiment ozone gas which was produced by an ozone generator 3s a20 tonglin technology co ltd beijing china was introduced through a diffuser into a glass reaction column containing 1 l of pbtca solution which consisted of borate buffer and pbtca 20 mg l 74 Î¼m the ph was changed depending on the conditions by adding naoh and h2so4 the inlet gaseous ozone concentration was 20 mg l and the flow rate was 1 0 l min samples were collected at specific times the pbtca concentration total organic carbon toc total phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus were determined 2 4 assessment of anti precipitation properties anti precipitation was determined by the calcium carbonate precipitation method described in chinese national standard gb t 16632 2008 gb t 16632 2008 in order to evaluate anti precipitation property of each ozonated sample anti precipitation ratio under different dilution factors was observed after dilution the aqueous pbtca concentration should be 20 mg l 10 mg l 5 mg l 2 mg l 1 mg l 0 5 mg l 0 1 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively the diluted samples were then added to bottles containing a solution consisting of cacl2 nahco3 and na2b4o7 10h2o the concentrations of reagents were as follows cacl2 6 mm nahco3 12 mm and na2b4o7 10h2o 0 4 mm after addition then the bottles were kept at 80 c in a water bath for 8 h each solution was filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m membrane and the calcium concentrations in the filtrates were determined anti precipitation ratio was calculated as eq 1 shown 1 anti precipitation ratio ca t ca blank 240 ca t where ca t standed for the calcium ion concentration of the solution adding ozonated samples unit mg l ca blank standed for the calcium ion concentration of the solution adding ultra pure water instead of ozonated samples unit mg l 240 standed for the calcium ion concentration of the solution 6 mm if there was no precipitation unit mg l the filtration membrane was cut into pieces and coated with a 10 nm layer of platinum the morphologies of the precipitates on the membrane were examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem fei quanta 200 feg sem 2 5 coagulation experiments after ozonation for 20 min ferric chloride was added as a coagulant to a pbtca solution 1 l the ferric chloride dosages were 0 10 20 25 30 35 and 40 mg l before adding coagulant ph was 7 because of borate buffer in the solution coagulation was performed as follows the solution was mixed for 0 5 min at 500 rpm the rotation speed was then changed to 150 rpm for 5 min a speed of 50 rpm was used for the next 20 min the solution was then settled for 30 min after that the supernatant was filtered by 0 45 Î¼m membrane and the concentrations of total phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus were measured a pbtca solution without ozonation was directly coagulated as a blank 2 6 analytical methods pbtca concentrations were determined by ic ics2000 thermo scientific usa at a flow rate of 0 80 ml min enref 26as11 hc was used as the ic column and 75 mm potassium hydroxide was used as the eluent the suppressor current was 149 ma and the retention time was 9 5 min the lower detection limit was 1 mg l in this method it is hard to distinguish the cation pbtca complexes and pbtca itself because they cannot be separated by ic column therefore measurement for pbtca should be under no cations which can bind with pbtca in the pbtca ozonation batch experiments the aqueous ozone concentration was determined with an ozone meter pth043 palintest uk on basis of the reaction with n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine dpd to produce dpd which has a strong absorbance at 551 nm gilbert and hoffman glewe 1983 in the semi continuous experiments the concentrations of the inlet and outlet gaseous ozone were detected by two online gaseous ozone concentration detectors ideal 2000 zibo china by uv absorbance detection cj t 322 2010 the detectors had a range of 0 200 mg l and the detection limit was 0 1 mg l the ph value was measured by a ph meter seven2go mettler toledo swiss toc was determined with a toc vcph analyzer shimazu japan the total phosphorus tp and inorganic phosphorus were determined by the phosphomolybdate method zhang et al 2017 the calcium concentration was determined with another ic system aquion thermo scientific usa with a cs12a column the retention time was 13 6 min methanesulfonic acid 20 mm was used as the eluent and the suppressor current was 59 ma 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of pbtca ozonation 3 1 1 rate constant for reaction of ozone molecule with pbtca k o3 pbtca an ozone stock solution containing 40 mg l ozone gave 30 4 pbtca degradation in 8 min as shown in fig 1 the degradation trend fitted pseudo first order kinetics well with r 2 0 98 as shown in fig s1 the obvious rate constant k obs was calculated as 7 61 1 21 10 4 s 1 and the half life t 1 2 of pbtca degradation by ozonation was 15 4 min pbtca can be oxidized by two types of oxidant during ozonation ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals oh the rate equation is shown in eq 2 the reaction rate between ozone molecules and pbtca was determined by adding 10 mm tba to quench all the oh the rate constant of this reaction is 6 108 l mol 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 li et al 2016b pbtca degradation decreased rapidly and reached 4 2 in 8 min 2 d pbtca d t k obs pbtca k o 3 pbtca o 3 pbtca k oh pbtca oh pbtca the concentration ratios of aquatic ozone to pbtca were all higher than 10 as shown in fig s2 a fig s2 b showed that the initial aquatic ozone concentration was 40 mg l and depleted near 25 after 8 min reaction ozone concentration cannot be considered as a constant during the reaction as pbtca was oxidized by ozone stock solution in the presence of tert butanol it only reacted with ozone molecule therefore the rate equation was shown in eq 3 eq 4 was obtained by rearranging and integrating eq 3 3 d pbtca d t k o 3 pbtca o 3 pbtca 4 ln pbtca t ln pbtca 0 k o 3 pbtca 0 t o 3 d t the time integrated ozone concentration 0 t o 3 d t was calculated based on fig s2 b k o3 pbtca was obtained by linearly fitting the ln c c 0 to ozone exposure as shown in fig s3 k o3 pbtca was calculated as 0 12 0 002 l mol 1 s 1with r 2 value 0 98 similar method was used in ding et al 2018 the rate constants for the reactions between other substances in roc and ozone were as follows non oxidizing biocides such as benzoisothiazolinone bit and methylisothiazolone mit had second order rate constants k o3 bit and k o3 mit at ph 7 of 4 17 106 and 1 16 102 l mol 1 s 1 respectively li et al 2016a 2016b the reactions of other organic pollutants in roc such as amoxicillin carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole lee et al 2012 with ozone had second order rate constants at ph 7 of 3 9 106 3 0 105 and 5 5 105 l mol 1 s 1 respectively andreozzi et al 2005 brosÃ©us et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2010 compared with these reactions the reaction between pbtca and ozone was much slower ozone reacts rapidly with compounds containing electron rich moieties e g olefins aromatic rings neutral amines schollÃ©e et al 2018 while it shows much lower reactivity toward compounds without above functional groups such as acids of formate propanedioic acid and pentanedioic acid in comparison with edtmp klinger et al 1998 which contained two electron rich moieties of tertiary amines pbtca did not contain an amine group therefore the ozonation of pbtca was negligible and the ozonation of edtmp was fast greenlee et al 2014 have investigated ozonation of organophosphonates which contained n in their structure in his study phosphonates were all oxidized by ozonated water and changes of their concentrations were not measured 3 1 2 rate constant for reaction of oh radical with pbtca k oh pbtca the rate constant for the reaction of oh with pbtca k oh pbtca was determined by uv h2o2 degradation in the uv h2o2 system pbtca can be degraded by uv photolysis h2o2 oxidation and oxidation of oh produced in the system the results in fig 1 and fig s1 show that pbtca was degraded slightly by uv photolysis and the degradation ratio reached 7 4 in 20 min but it was not oxidized by h2o2 the calculated rate constant k uv pbtca for uv photolysis was 5 81 3 27 10 5 s 1 and the half life t 1 2 for pbtca degradation was 3 9 h this is 12 times slower than that for ozonation the concentration of pbtca during uv h2o2 degradation can be expressed as 5 d pbtca d t k uv pbtca pbtca k oh pbtca oh pbtca it was hard to determine k oh pbtca because the aquatic concentration of oh radicals was unknown ba was therefore added as a competitor to react with oh with a rate constant k oh ba of 4 2 109 l mol 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 this method was used by wang et al 2016 ba underwent little direct photolysis therefore the degradation rate can be expressed by eq 6 assuming that the concentration of oh was constant during degradation it can be calculated from k oh ba and the obvious rate constant for ba degradation the oh concentration in eq 6 was the same as that in eq 5 therefore k oh pbtca was calculated as 7 83 1 51 108 l mol 1 s 1 6 d ba d t k oh ba oh ba the reaction of dodecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride ddbac a non oxidizing biocide found in roc with oh radicals at ph 7 has a second order rate constant k oh ddbac of 1 45 0 16 109 l mol 1 s 1 lee et al 2018 the reactions of other organic pollutants in roc such as carbamazepine ibuprofen and naproxen with oh radicals at ph 7 have second order rate constants of 8 80 1 20 109 5 23 0 01 109 and 8 89 1 42 109 l mol 1 s 1 respectively lian et al 2017 compared with these the reaction of pbtca with oh radicals was much slower the reaction rates of pbtca with both ozone molecules and oh radicals are lower than those of other pollutants in roc and because of its high risk special attention should be paid to it the k obs pbtca k o3 pbtca and aquatic ozone concentration o3 water was used to calculate the contribution of each oxidant the results show that ozone molecule oxidation accounted for 11 0 calculated as k o3 pbtca o3 water k obs pbtca 100 and oh radical oxidation accounted for 89 0 therefore oxidation of oh radicals was dominant in pbtca ozonation thus pbtca degradation could be enhanced by strategies that increase oh radical production 3 2 toc elimination and phosphorus transformation at different ozone dosages 3 2 1 pbtca and toc elimination semi batch ozonation experiments were performed to investigate pbtca degradation in detail pbtca was degraded by ozonation at a dosage of 4 37 0 5 mg lwater min at ambient temperature changes in the pbtca concentration and toc during ozonation are shown in fig s4 a the pbtca degradation ratio reached 68 8 after ozonation for 20 min at an ozone dosage of 87 4 mg lwater pbtca removal was difficult and required high ozone dosages greenlee et al 2014 used ozonation to degrade three types of organophosphonate their results showed that the transformation ratios of inorganic phosphorus were only 6 8 8 4 and 9 4 respectively at an ozone dose of 10 mg l the toc decreased to 62 4 which was lower than the decrease for pbtca this indicates that pbtca mineralization is more difficult than removal 3 2 2 phosphorus transformation previous studies have shown that the phosphorus form changes during organophosphonate oxidation greenlee et al 2014 rott et al 2017a however because of the limitations of methods for organophosphonate detection only two forms of phosphorus inorganic phosphorus and total phosphorus were investigated in this study pbtca detection was possible therefore the phosphorus forms were divided into three types phosphorus in pbtca phosphorus in other organic compounds and inorganic phosphorus their changes during pbtca ozonation are shown in fig s4 b all the phosphorus came from pbtca before ozonation when gaseous ozone was added the phosphorus in pbtca pp was transformed into inorganic phosphorus pi and phosphorus in organic compounds other than pbtca po the transformation ratio of pi was 35 3 in 20 min during pbtca ozonation at 0 4 min pp 0 52 mg l was transformed into po 0 36 mg l and pi 0 16 mg l the po pi transformation ratio was 2 25 1 which shows that the amount of pp transformed into po was twice that transformed into pi from 4 to 8 min pp 0 31 mg l was transformed into po 0 15 mg l and pi 0 16 mg l the po pi transformation ratio was 1 1 07 i e similar amounts of pp were transformed into po and pi however from 16 to 20 min only 0 13 mg l of pp were transformed into po 2 10 3 mg l and pi 0 13 mg l the po pi transformation ratio was 1 65 i e almost all the pp was transformed into pi some po may have been transformed into pi the amount of pp decreased and the po pi transformation ratio changed greatly with increasing ozonation time the transformation rates of the reactions were compared as discussed in the rest of this subsection we assumed that pp was transformed into po and pi with rate constants k 1 and k 2 respectively and po was transformed into pi with a rate constant of k 3 the reactions are shown in eqs 7 9 there is only one phosphorus atom in pbtca therefore simultaneous transformation of pp into po and pi was impossible as noted in section 3 1 k o3 pbtca was nine magnitudes smaller than k oh pbtca although ozone concentration was also several magnitudes higher than oh ozone molecule contributed so little to pbtca oxidation text s1 thus the reaction between ozone molecules and pbtca can be neglected and it can be assumed that only oh reacted with pbtca during ozonation furthermore the concentration of oh remained constant during ozonation elovitz and von gunten 1999 the reactions rates are expressed by eqs 10 12 7 p p k 1 p o 8 p o k 2 p i 9 p p k 3 p i 10 d p p d t k 1 oh p p k 3 oh p p k obs 1 k obs 3 p p 11 d p o d t k 1 oh p p k 2 oh p o k obs 2 p o k obs 1 p p 12 d p i d t k 2 oh p o k 3 oh p p k obs 2 p o k obs 3 p p the oh concentration was constant therefore the obvious rate constant k obs n for each reaction was used to simplify the calculation as shown in eq 13 according to eq 10 the concentration of pp can be obtained from eq 14 13 k obs n k n oh 14 p p t p total e k obs 1 k obs 3 t on the basis of the pp concentrations at different times shown in fig s2 fitting gives k obs 1 k obs 3 9 91 10 4 s 1 with r 2 0 9963 the concentration of po was obtained from eq 15 at the start of ozonation t 0 s no po was produced therefore c was calculated from eq 16 15 p o e k obs 2 t c p total k obs 1 e k obs 2 k obs 1 k obs 3 t k obs 2 k obs 1 k obs 3 16 c p total k obs 1 k obs 2 k obs 1 k obs 3 on the basis of the po concentrations in fig s4 b fitting gave k obs 1 and k obs 2 values of 8 39 10 4 s 1 and 9 02 10 4 s 1 respectively the r 2 value was 0 996 therefore the fitting was acceptable then k obs 3 was calculated as 1 52 10 4 s 1 the concentration changes of each kind of phosphorus and fitting curves were shown in fig 2 it is clear that the simulation can describe the changes of each kind of phosphorus well the ratios of k 1 k 2 and k 3 were calculated as k 1 k 2 k 3 k obs 1 k obs 2 k obs 3 5 5 5 9 1 indicating that the pp to po oxidation rate was 5 5 times higher than that for pp to pi for po the production rate from pp was a little bit lower than consumption rate from po to pi at the beginning the concentration of pp was higher than po so the amount of production from pp was more than that of consumption thus the concentration of po increased however as oxidation time went by the concentration of pp gradually decreased and the concentration of po increased then the production amount of po decreased whereas the consumption amount increased our simulation shows that at an ozonation time of 17 6 min the amount of po produced was the same as the amount consumed indicating that the po concentration reached a maximum this was confirmed by the observation that the measured po concentrations at 16 and 20 min were the same the po concentration would decrease if ozonation was continued and the total phosphorus would mainly transform into pi 3 3 effects of ph on pbtca ozonation the ph value is important in water treatment because it can affect the components in water matrices it is important in ozonation because it affects the ratio of ozone molecules to oh radicals the results for pbtca ozonation at various ph values are shown in fig 3 a the fluctuation range of ph values was below 0 1 during ozonation the results show that pbtca ozonation was faster at alkaline ph the obvious rate constants k obs were determined at different ph values with the assumption that all the reactions were pseudo first order as shown in fig 3 b all the reactions were fitted well with r 2 values greater than 0 95 the k obs values varied considerably the lowest k obs was 7 5 10 5 s 1 at ph 3 and the highest was 1 3 10 2 s 1 at ph 11 i e 173 times higher than that at ph 3 the large variations in k obs are attributed to the different ratios of ozone molecules to oh radicals i e different degrees of ozone conversion to oh radicals at different ph values numerous studies have shown that under alkaline conditions more oh radicals are generated in the presence of ozone than that under acidic conditions buffle et al 2006 elovitz et al 2000 furthermore the reaction of oh radicals with pbtca was much faster than that of ozone molecules with pbtca therefore pbtca was degraded much faster under alkaline conditions than acidic conditions this explanation is in accordance with the observation that k obs increased more rapidly with ph increasing fig 3 these results and conclusions suggest that pbtca removal by ozonation can be enhanced by changing the ph to alkaline values by addition of an alkali or by using ozone based aops such as o3 h2o2 or o3 catalysts to increase oh radical production 3 4 anti precipitation property reduction pbtca in roc causes problems because of its high anti precipitation capacity which makes it harder to remove heavy metals hardness and salts through precipitation although pbtca can be degraded by ozonation its anti precipitation properties need to be addressed the evaluation of anti precipitation properties was divided into two parts the first part was examination of the precipitate morphology fig 4 shows sem images of the precipitates at a proportional scale of 100 and 20 Î¼m at different ozonation times when pbtca was not added blank group large amounts of precipitates of regular shape packed closely together were formed elemental analysis fig s5 showed that the precipitates were all calcium carbonate caco3 the structure was rhombohedral i e the classic morphology of calcite gopi and subramanian 2012 when pbtca was added 0 min the amount size morphology and uniformity of the precipitates changed greatly the precipitates were in pieces indicating that the amount and size had decreased the distance between adjacent precipitates was greater and the irregular shapes showed that pbtca caused crystal distortion the chemical structures of the precipitates were unchanged the amount and size of the precipitates increased with increasing ozonation time the precipitates tended to aggregate and the distance between two pieces decreased the shapes of the precipitates became regular compared with those for the blank this shows that the lattice distortion effect decreased with increasing pbtca ozonation all the results indicate that the scale inhibition properties decreased with increasing ozonation time the chemical composition of the precipitates remained the same for all samples although inorganic phosphorus was produced during ozonation calcium phosphate was not detected because the amount was small compared with that of calcium carbonate the other part of the evaluation of the anti precipitation properties involved assessment of changes in the anti precipitation ratio the anti precipitation ratios at different ozonation times were compared by constructing a specific curve of different pbtca concentration by different dilution ratios and anti precipitation ratios fig 5 a shows that the anti precipitation ratio decreased with decreasing pbtca concentration in the solution a dose response equation was used to simulate the results to clarify the relationship between them the results indicate good simulation with r 2 0 963 the anti precipitation ratios followed the simulated curve as the ozonation time changed and were similar to each other one way analysis of variance was used to confirm that there were no significant differences a dose response curve was simulated for each ozonation time and pbtca concentration for 50 anti precipitation ap50 was identified as shown in fig 5 b the results show that ap50 did not differ with ozonation time from 0 to 25 min and the average value was 1 96 0 12 mg l the anti precipitation properties may be attributed not only to pbtca but also to the transformation products generated during ozonation as discussed in section 3 2 the transformation products produced during ozonation of pbtca contained inorganic phosphorus and organic compounds other than pbtca containing organic phosphorus the results in fig 5 b show that the transformation products did not have scale inhibition properties ozonation is therefore an effective and promising method for dealing with pbtca 3 5 phosphorus removal by ozonation coagulation combination treatment in section 3 2 pbtca degradation by ozonation and transformation of its phosphorus into other forms of phosphorus during ozonation were discussed however tp was not removed during the treatment similar results were reported by saktaywin et al 2005 i e phosphorus was transformed into several forms but tp did not change there is therefore still a risk of eutrophication and subsequent treatment is needed coagulation is an efficient method for removing phosphorus because it is precipitated by the coagulant yang et al 2010 it is easier to remove inorganic phosphorus than organic phosphorus because the organic form can chelate with the coagulant and this decreases the removal efficiency ma et al 2017 the phosphorus in pbtca was ozonated to an inorganic form therefore phosphorus could be removed efficiently by subsequent coagulation phosphorus removal by ozonation followed by coagulation was therefore investigated the results are shown in fig 6 when ferric chloride was used as the coagulant tp in pbtca could not be removed by direct coagulation if the dosage was less than 20 mg l this is because of the chelating effect of ferric ions similar results and the same mechanism were reported by rott et al 2017b as the dosage increased to 25 mg l 1 removal of tp was observed and the tp removal ratio increased with increasing dosage the concentration of free ferric ions in water was much higher than that of chelated ones therefore the free ions began to form flocs and coagulate ferric chloride at a dosage of 40 mg l gave 55 1 phosphorus removal no inorganic phosphorus was detected in pbtca therefore removal of inorganic phosphorus was not focused on however the conditions changed when ozonation was combined with coagulation the removal of tp was achieved at a ferric dosage of 10 mg l and the removal ratio was 4 3 the percentage removal increased with increasing ferric chloride dosage and reached 86 3 at a dosage of 40 mg l use of a combination of ozonation and coagulation increased tp removal by 30 percentage points compared to that achieved with coagulation alone inorganic phosphorus was also removed at dosages above 10 mg l a higher removal ratio was achieved when the coagulant dosage was increased and 95 3 of inorganic phosphorus was removed at a coagulant dosage of 40 mg l this is because ferric ions tend to coagulate with inorganic phosphorus therefore flocs were formed and more phosphorus was removed the change of ph before and after coagulation was shown in fig s6 ph was kept to 7 during ozonation because of borate buffer in pbtca solution after coagulation ph decreased because of addition of fecl3 meanwhile ph decreased more as fecl3 dosage increased compared with direct coagulation ozonation followed by coagulation required lower dosages of coagulant to achieve the same tp removal ratio use of such combination treatments reduces the cost of reagents and iron sludge production is decreased furthermore anti precipitation properties were suppressed the use of combined ozone coagulation treatment for pbtca degradation is recommended 4 conclusion pbtca can be eliminated partially by ozonation at high doses compared with other pollutants in roc pbtca reacted with ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals much more slowly with second order rate constants k o3 pbtca and k oh pbtca of 0 12 0 002 and 7 83 1 51 108 l mol 1 s 1 respectively the elimination of toc by ozonation was harder than degradation of pbtca the phosphorus in pbtca pp was transformed into an inorganic form pi and an organic form other than that in pbtca po and po was further transformed into pi the transformations among different forms were simulated by a first order reaction and the rate of pp transformation into po was 5 5 times higher than that into pi the ph value greatly affected pbtca degradation by ozonation pbtca was removed 173 times faster under alkaline conditions than under acidic condition this is because of differences in the amounts of ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals and their different reaction rates with pbtca anti precipitation properties were also suppressed by pbtca ozonation the precipitate sizes increased and the shapes became more regular during pbtca treatment the distance between adjacent precipitates also decreased the changes in the anti precipitation ratio with pbtca concentration can be fitted well to a dose response curve ap50 did not change during ozonation therefore the transformation products did not have anti precipitation properties to reduce the phosphorus in pbtca coagulation was performed after ozonation the total phosphorus removal ratio was enhanced by 30 percentage points for ozonation combined with coagulation compared with that for direct coagulation this enhancement is attributed to the tendency of the coagulant to precipitate with inorganic phosphorus to form flocs and flocs are more easily to aggregate and precipitate as anti precipitation effect is gradually removed thus leading to removal of more phosphorus ozonation followed by coagulation is recommended for dealing with the phosphorus in pbtca acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key research

because of its high concentration in ro concentrate eutrophication risk and anti precipitation properties may affect subsequent treatments therefore treatment strategies are needed to eliminate such substances in this study pbtca was degraded by ozonation the results show that pbtca reacted with ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals with second order rate constants of 0 12 0 002 and 7 83 1 51 108 l mol 1 s 1 respectively the phosphorus in pbtca pp was transformed into organic phosphorus except for pbtca po and inorganic phosphorus pi po was further transformed into pi the changes in the concentrations of these phosphorus forms were investigated by model simulation simulation showed that the rate of pp transformation into po was 5 5 times higher than that into pi pbtca was ozonated much faster at alkaline ph than at acidic ph this is ascribed to different amounts of ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals and their different reaction rates with pbtca furthermore anti precipitation property was reduced during ozonation as shown by the amounts and morphology changes of the precipitates pbtca concentration for 50 anti precipitation ap50 did not change during ozonation indicating that the transformation products generated during ozonation did not have anti precipitation effects phosphorus in pbtca was removed by ozonation coagulation treatment total phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus were removed efficiently by using ferric chloride as a coagulant the coagulants tended to bind with inorganic phosphorus to form flocs meanwhile flocs were more easily to aggregate and precipitate as anti precipitation effect was gradually removed thus more phosphorus was removed a combination of ozonation and coagulation removed pbtca effectively and simultaneously reduced its anti precipitation property and phosphorus graphical abstract image 1 keywords antiscalant pbtca ozonation phosphorus transformation anti precipitation property 1 introduction water scarcity is a major issue globally water reclamation provides a portable way of solving this problem the demand for reclaimed water of high quality such as cooling water and boiler water is increasing and reverse osmosis ro is widely used because it can produce superior and stable water quality at low cost istirokhatun et al 2018 however about one fourth of ro influent is converted to ro concentrate roc which is hard to deal with xu et al 2017 sun et al 2014 reported that roc can be pretreated and discharged directly or circulated into biological treatment units in wastewater treatment plants however such treatment cannot eliminate the high salinity of roc and the high risks it poses to reduce the high salinity and high risks of roc it is necessary to determine its components roc contains high concentrations of salts micropollutants and chemical agents such as antiscalants and biocides which are added to ro systems to reduce ro membrane fouling tang et al 2012 xu et al 2017 in roc the concentrations of antiscalants and biocides are higher than those of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds toxicity induced by non oxidizing biocides are also high benner et al 2008 tang et al 2013 it is necessary to stress that anti precipitation effect induced by antiscalants was hazardous for further treatment methods containing a principal of precipitation such as flocculation and precipitation because it can lower the removal efficiencies for heavy metals those unremoved heavy metals will reach a high concentration in water making removal more difficult thus imposing a risk many studies have focused on biocide and micropollutant treatment huang et al 2017 li et al 2016b luo et al 2014 sui et al 2014 less attention has been paid to antiscalants than to biocides and micropollutants and the risks associated with antiscalants have been underestimated organophosphonates which are a type of antiscalant are used widely in ro systems because of their superior performance in reducing scaling of ro membranes zhang et al 2015 this type of antiscalant can pose a high risk if it is not treated appropriately first the concentration of organophosphonates in roc is high and their biodegradation is difficult according to bonnÃ© et al 2000 tang et al 2012 the organophosphonate dosage in ro systems reaches several milligrams per liter therefore their concentration in roc is also several milligrams per liter their biodegradation percentages varied from 5 to 30 in 10 days which is too slow zhang et al 2016 biodegradation is therefore not an efficient method for organophosphonate elimination secondly the mass content of phosphorus element in organophosphonates is 10 30 which is enough to cause the risk of eutrophication considering their dosage in ro systems rott et al 2018 thirdly organophosphonates can chelate with heavy metals and radioactive elements and this assists the transfer of these elements from other phases to aqueous phases which increases their concentration in water rott et al 2018 these heavy metals and radioactive elements can also be stabilized which makes their treatment more difficult therefore the risk of their presence in water is increased finally organophosphonates can prevent precipitate generation by lattice distortion chelating effects and coagulation and dispersion cheng et al 2003 tang et al 2008 this greatly decreases the efficiency of subsequent precipitation which makes removal of heavy metals hardness and salts by chemical precipitation more difficult the risks posed by organophosphonates in roc are therefore high and their treatment is essential little research has been performed on organophosphonates and available treatments for them are limited zhang et al 2016 studied the biodegradation of three organophosphonates by mixed bacteria in natural water and found that their biodegradation rates were low boels et al 2012 used granular ferric hydroxide to adsorb the organophosphonates in roc however the granular ferric hydroxide needed to be changed at regular intervals because of adsorption saturation advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton ozonation and uv cl methods are effective in oxidizing refractory substances du et al 2018 wang et al 2017a 2017b organophosphonates are hard to biodegrade therefore aops are promising methods for their treatment rott et al 2017a huang et al 2018 greenlee et al 2014 and klinger et al 1998 degraded organophosphonates by uv fenton and ozonation methods however most of them did not measure the organophosphonate concentrations precisely and only determined conversion to orthophosphate organophosphonates are generally determined by ion chromatography lv et al 2013 ma et al 2007 schmidt et al 2014 and further studies are needed in this study 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtca an organophosphonate used in ro systems tang et al 2013 was chosen as a representative organophosphonate according to the engineering practices in several full scale ro treatment plants the dosage of pbtca was 3 5 mg l in the influent and 6 20 mg l in ro concentrate meanwhile pbtca has potential risk such as impeding the precipitation of heavy metals in roc and ecological risk from phosphorus content 12 which will be a big obstacle for further treatment of roc basic information is given in table 1 ozonation is widely used in tertiary water treatment because of its high oxidizing capacity and high efficiency therefore ozone was chosen as the oxidant for pbtca degradation the objective of this study was to investigate the kinetics of pbcta ozonation phosphorus transformation during ozonation and the effects of ph on pbtca removal we focused on elimination of risks associated with pbtca such as anti precipitation effects and eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pbtca 50 in water was bought from the tokyo chemical industry co ltd tokyo japan boric acid h3bo3 and sodium borate na2b4o7 10h2o were bought from the beijing modern oriental fine chemistry co ltd beijing china sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 and benzoic acid ba were bought from the aladdin industrial corporation shanghai china sodium hydroxide naoh tert butanol tba and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were purchased from the tianjin guangfu technology development co ltd tianjin china sulfuric acid h2so4 and anhydrous calcium chloride cacl2 were bought from the beijing tongguang fine chemicals company beijing china sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and ferric chloride fecl3 were purchased from xilong scientific guangzhou china all reagents were of analytical grade all experiments were performed with ultrapure water resistivity 18 mÏ cm prepared with a milli q device integral 5 millipore usa all the following experiments were performed at least in duplicate and the standard deviation from one batch was analyzed with a double determination 2 2 batch experiments for pbtca ozonation 2 2 1 rate constant determination for reaction of ozone molecule with pbtca an ozone stock solution of maximum concentration 45 mg l was prepared with an ozone generator cf yg20 shanmeishuimei high technology co ltd beijing china experiments were performed in a 50 ml foil covered beaker with a sealing film at the top and a stirrer speed 400 rpm at the bottom phosphate buffer may affect the chemical equilibrium because of orthophosphate production rott et al 2017a therefore borate buffer was used to maintain the ph greenlee et al 2014 the borate buffer consisted of boric acid 20 mm the ph value was adjusted to a specific value by addition of naoh and h2so4 the solution contained pbtca 15 mg l 56 Î¼m borate buffer of ph 7 and ozone 40 mg l the ozone concentration was lower than that in stock solution because of dilution samples were collected at specific times and the concentrations of pbtca and residual ozone were determined further reaction between residual ozone and pbtca was avoided by adding excess na2s2o3 to quench the residual ozone tba was added as an oh scavenger to determine the rate constant of the ozone molecule pbtca reaction 2 2 2 rate constant determination for reaction of oh radical and pbtca the rate constant of the reaction between oh radical and pbtca was determined by pbtca degradation by uv h2o2 oxidation a low pressure mercury lamp was installed in a quasi collimated beam apparatus to provide uv irradiation the average uv irradiance at the surface of the reactor was 1 45 mw cm2 according to the iodide iodate chemical actinometrical method reported by bolton et al 2011 the initial concentration of pbtca was 15 mg l 56 Î¼m the h2o2 dosage was 1 mm and 20 mm borate buffer was used to maintain ph the procedure was as follows pbtca was oxidized by uv and h2o2 separately to determine their individual rate constants tba was added to avoid oh radical production pbtca was then oxidized by uv h2o2 and ba was added as a competitor the molar concentration of ba was the same as that of pbtca excess na2s2o3 was added during sampling and the time dependent concentrations of pbtca and ba were determined 2 3 semi continuous pbtca ozonation in practical ozonation treatment process ozone was bubbled into the reaction tank continuously ozone dose was important in pbtca ozonation and it had a correlation with time therefore pbtca oxidation under different ozone dosage and time was investigated in semi continuous experiment ozone gas which was produced by an ozone generator 3s a20 tonglin technology co ltd beijing china was introduced through a diffuser into a glass reaction column containing 1 l of pbtca solution which consisted of borate buffer and pbtca 20 mg l 74 Î¼m the ph was changed depending on the conditions by adding naoh and h2so4 the inlet gaseous ozone concentration was 20 mg l and the flow rate was 1 0 l min samples were collected at specific times the pbtca concentration total organic carbon toc total phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus were determined 2 4 assessment of anti precipitation properties anti precipitation was determined by the calcium carbonate precipitation method described in chinese national standard gb t 16632 2008 gb t 16632 2008 in order to evaluate anti precipitation property of each ozonated sample anti precipitation ratio under different dilution factors was observed after dilution the aqueous pbtca concentration should be 20 mg l 10 mg l 5 mg l 2 mg l 1 mg l 0 5 mg l 0 1 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively the diluted samples were then added to bottles containing a solution consisting of cacl2 nahco3 and na2b4o7 10h2o the concentrations of reagents were as follows cacl2 6 mm nahco3 12 mm and na2b4o7 10h2o 0 4 mm after addition then the bottles were kept at 80 c in a water bath for 8 h each solution was filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m membrane and the calcium concentrations in the filtrates were determined anti precipitation ratio was calculated as eq 1 shown 1 anti precipitation ratio ca t ca blank 240 ca t where ca t standed for the calcium ion concentration of the solution adding ozonated samples unit mg l ca blank standed for the calcium ion concentration of the solution adding ultra pure water instead of ozonated samples unit mg l 240 standed for the calcium ion concentration of the solution 6 mm if there was no precipitation unit mg l the filtration membrane was cut into pieces and coated with a 10 nm layer of platinum the morphologies of the precipitates on the membrane were examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem fei quanta 200 feg sem 2 5 coagulation experiments after ozonation for 20 min ferric chloride was added as a coagulant to a pbtca solution 1 l the ferric chloride dosages were 0 10 20 25 30 35 and 40 mg l before adding coagulant ph was 7 because of borate buffer in the solution coagulation was performed as follows the solution was mixed for 0 5 min at 500 rpm the rotation speed was then changed to 150 rpm for 5 min a speed of 50 rpm was used for the next 20 min the solution was then settled for 30 min after that the supernatant was filtered by 0 45 Î¼m membrane and the concentrations of total phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus were measured a pbtca solution without ozonation was directly coagulated as a blank 2 6 analytical methods pbtca concentrations were determined by ic ics2000 thermo scientific usa at a flow rate of 0 80 ml min enref 26as11 hc was used as the ic column and 75 mm potassium hydroxide was used as the eluent the suppressor current was 149 ma and the retention time was 9 5 min the lower detection limit was 1 mg l in this method it is hard to distinguish the cation pbtca complexes and pbtca itself because they cannot be separated by ic column therefore measurement for pbtca should be under no cations which can bind with pbtca in the pbtca ozonation batch experiments the aqueous ozone concentration was determined with an ozone meter pth043 palintest uk on basis of the reaction with n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine dpd to produce dpd which has a strong absorbance at 551 nm gilbert and hoffman glewe 1983 in the semi continuous experiments the concentrations of the inlet and outlet gaseous ozone were detected by two online gaseous ozone concentration detectors ideal 2000 zibo china by uv absorbance detection cj t 322 2010 the detectors had a range of 0 200 mg l and the detection limit was 0 1 mg l the ph value was measured by a ph meter seven2go mettler toledo swiss toc was determined with a toc vcph analyzer shimazu japan the total phosphorus tp and inorganic phosphorus were determined by the phosphomolybdate method zhang et al 2017 the calcium concentration was determined with another ic system aquion thermo scientific usa with a cs12a column the retention time was 13 6 min methanesulfonic acid 20 mm was used as the eluent and the suppressor current was 59 ma 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of pbtca ozonation 3 1 1 rate constant for reaction of ozone molecule with pbtca k o3 pbtca an ozone stock solution containing 40 mg l ozone gave 30 4 pbtca degradation in 8 min as shown in fig 1 the degradation trend fitted pseudo first order kinetics well with r 2 0 98 as shown in fig s1 the obvious rate constant k obs was calculated as 7 61 1 21 10 4 s 1 and the half life t 1 2 of pbtca degradation by ozonation was 15 4 min pbtca can be oxidized by two types of oxidant during ozonation ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals oh the rate equation is shown in eq 2 the reaction rate between ozone molecules and pbtca was determined by adding 10 mm tba to quench all the oh the rate constant of this reaction is 6 108 l mol 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 li et al 2016b pbtca degradation decreased rapidly and reached 4 2 in 8 min 2 d pbtca d t k obs pbtca k o 3 pbtca o 3 pbtca k oh pbtca oh pbtca the concentration ratios of aquatic ozone to pbtca were all higher than 10 as shown in fig s2 a fig s2 b showed that the initial aquatic ozone concentration was 40 mg l and depleted near 25 after 8 min reaction ozone concentration cannot be considered as a constant during the reaction as pbtca was oxidized by ozone stock solution in the presence of tert butanol it only reacted with ozone molecule therefore the rate equation was shown in eq 3 eq 4 was obtained by rearranging and integrating eq 3 3 d pbtca d t k o 3 pbtca o 3 pbtca 4 ln pbtca t ln pbtca 0 k o 3 pbtca 0 t o 3 d t the time integrated ozone concentration 0 t o 3 d t was calculated based on fig s2 b k o3 pbtca was obtained by linearly fitting the ln c c 0 to ozone exposure as shown in fig s3 k o3 pbtca was calculated as 0 12 0 002 l mol 1 s 1with r 2 value 0 98 similar method was used in ding et al 2018 the rate constants for the reactions between other substances in roc and ozone were as follows non oxidizing biocides such as benzoisothiazolinone bit and methylisothiazolone mit had second order rate constants k o3 bit and k o3 mit at ph 7 of 4 17 106 and 1 16 102 l mol 1 s 1 respectively li et al 2016a 2016b the reactions of other organic pollutants in roc such as amoxicillin carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole lee et al 2012 with ozone had second order rate constants at ph 7 of 3 9 106 3 0 105 and 5 5 105 l mol 1 s 1 respectively andreozzi et al 2005 brosÃ©us et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2010 compared with these reactions the reaction between pbtca and ozone was much slower ozone reacts rapidly with compounds containing electron rich moieties e g olefins aromatic rings neutral amines schollÃ©e et al 2018 while it shows much lower reactivity toward compounds without above functional groups such as acids of formate propanedioic acid and pentanedioic acid in comparison with edtmp klinger et al 1998 which contained two electron rich moieties of tertiary amines pbtca did not contain an amine group therefore the ozonation of pbtca was negligible and the ozonation of edtmp was fast greenlee et al 2014 have investigated ozonation of organophosphonates which contained n in their structure in his study phosphonates were all oxidized by ozonated water and changes of their concentrations were not measured 3 1 2 rate constant for reaction of oh radical with pbtca k oh pbtca the rate constant for the reaction of oh with pbtca k oh pbtca was determined by uv h2o2 degradation in the uv h2o2 system pbtca can be degraded by uv photolysis h2o2 oxidation and oxidation of oh produced in the system the results in fig 1 and fig s1 show that pbtca was degraded slightly by uv photolysis and the degradation ratio reached 7 4 in 20 min but it was not oxidized by h2o2 the calculated rate constant k uv pbtca for uv photolysis was 5 81 3 27 10 5 s 1 and the half life t 1 2 for pbtca degradation was 3 9 h this is 12 times slower than that for ozonation the concentration of pbtca during uv h2o2 degradation can be expressed as 5 d pbtca d t k uv pbtca pbtca k oh pbtca oh pbtca it was hard to determine k oh pbtca because the aquatic concentration of oh radicals was unknown ba was therefore added as a competitor to react with oh with a rate constant k oh ba of 4 2 109 l mol 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 this method was used by wang et al 2016 ba underwent little direct photolysis therefore the degradation rate can be expressed by eq 6 assuming that the concentration of oh was constant during degradation it can be calculated from k oh ba and the obvious rate constant for ba degradation the oh concentration in eq 6 was the same as that in eq 5 therefore k oh pbtca was calculated as 7 83 1 51 108 l mol 1 s 1 6 d ba d t k oh ba oh ba the reaction of dodecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride ddbac a non oxidizing biocide found in roc with oh radicals at ph 7 has a second order rate constant k oh ddbac of 1 45 0 16 109 l mol 1 s 1 lee et al 2018 the reactions of other organic pollutants in roc such as carbamazepine ibuprofen and naproxen with oh radicals at ph 7 have second order rate constants of 8 80 1 20 109 5 23 0 01 109 and 8 89 1 42 109 l mol 1 s 1 respectively lian et al 2017 compared with these the reaction of pbtca with oh radicals was much slower the reaction rates of pbtca with both ozone molecules and oh radicals are lower than those of other pollutants in roc and because of its high risk special attention should be paid to it the k obs pbtca k o3 pbtca and aquatic ozone concentration o3 water was used to calculate the contribution of each oxidant the results show that ozone molecule oxidation accounted for 11 0 calculated as k o3 pbtca o3 water k obs pbtca 100 and oh radical oxidation accounted for 89 0 therefore oxidation of oh radicals was dominant in pbtca ozonation thus pbtca degradation could be enhanced by strategies that increase oh radical production 3 2 toc elimination and phosphorus transformation at different ozone dosages 3 2 1 pbtca and toc elimination semi batch ozonation experiments were performed to investigate pbtca degradation in detail pbtca was degraded by ozonation at a dosage of 4 37 0 5 mg lwater min at ambient temperature changes in the pbtca concentration and toc during ozonation are shown in fig s4 a the pbtca degradation ratio reached 68 8 after ozonation for 20 min at an ozone dosage of 87 4 mg lwater pbtca removal was difficult and required high ozone dosages greenlee et al 2014 used ozonation to degrade three types of organophosphonate their results showed that the transformation ratios of inorganic phosphorus were only 6 8 8 4 and 9 4 respectively at an ozone dose of 10 mg l the toc decreased to 62 4 which was lower than the decrease for pbtca this indicates that pbtca mineralization is more difficult than removal 3 2 2 phosphorus transformation previous studies have shown that the phosphorus form changes during organophosphonate oxidation greenlee et al 2014 rott et al 2017a however because of the limitations of methods for organophosphonate detection only two forms of phosphorus inorganic phosphorus and total phosphorus were investigated in this study pbtca detection was possible therefore the phosphorus forms were divided into three types phosphorus in pbtca phosphorus in other organic compounds and inorganic phosphorus their changes during pbtca ozonation are shown in fig s4 b all the phosphorus came from pbtca before ozonation when gaseous ozone was added the phosphorus in pbtca pp was transformed into inorganic phosphorus pi and phosphorus in organic compounds other than pbtca po the transformation ratio of pi was 35 3 in 20 min during pbtca ozonation at 0 4 min pp 0 52 mg l was transformed into po 0 36 mg l and pi 0 16 mg l the po pi transformation ratio was 2 25 1 which shows that the amount of pp transformed into po was twice that transformed into pi from 4 to 8 min pp 0 31 mg l was transformed into po 0 15 mg l and pi 0 16 mg l the po pi transformation ratio was 1 1 07 i e similar amounts of pp were transformed into po and pi however from 16 to 20 min only 0 13 mg l of pp were transformed into po 2 10 3 mg l and pi 0 13 mg l the po pi transformation ratio was 1 65 i e almost all the pp was transformed into pi some po may have been transformed into pi the amount of pp decreased and the po pi transformation ratio changed greatly with increasing ozonation time the transformation rates of the reactions were compared as discussed in the rest of this subsection we assumed that pp was transformed into po and pi with rate constants k 1 and k 2 respectively and po was transformed into pi with a rate constant of k 3 the reactions are shown in eqs 7 9 there is only one phosphorus atom in pbtca therefore simultaneous transformation of pp into po and pi was impossible as noted in section 3 1 k o3 pbtca was nine magnitudes smaller than k oh pbtca although ozone concentration was also several magnitudes higher than oh ozone molecule contributed so little to pbtca oxidation text s1 thus the reaction between ozone molecules and pbtca can be neglected and it can be assumed that only oh reacted with pbtca during ozonation furthermore the concentration of oh remained constant during ozonation elovitz and von gunten 1999 the reactions rates are expressed by eqs 10 12 7 p p k 1 p o 8 p o k 2 p i 9 p p k 3 p i 10 d p p d t k 1 oh p p k 3 oh p p k obs 1 k obs 3 p p 11 d p o d t k 1 oh p p k 2 oh p o k obs 2 p o k obs 1 p p 12 d p i d t k 2 oh p o k 3 oh p p k obs 2 p o k obs 3 p p the oh concentration was constant therefore the obvious rate constant k obs n for each reaction was used to simplify the calculation as shown in eq 13 according to eq 10 the concentration of pp can be obtained from eq 14 13 k obs n k n oh 14 p p t p total e k obs 1 k obs 3 t on the basis of the pp concentrations at different times shown in fig s2 fitting gives k obs 1 k obs 3 9 91 10 4 s 1 with r 2 0 9963 the concentration of po was obtained from eq 15 at the start of ozonation t 0 s no po was produced therefore c was calculated from eq 16 15 p o e k obs 2 t c p total k obs 1 e k obs 2 k obs 1 k obs 3 t k obs 2 k obs 1 k obs 3 16 c p total k obs 1 k obs 2 k obs 1 k obs 3 on the basis of the po concentrations in fig s4 b fitting gave k obs 1 and k obs 2 values of 8 39 10 4 s 1 and 9 02 10 4 s 1 respectively the r 2 value was 0 996 therefore the fitting was acceptable then k obs 3 was calculated as 1 52 10 4 s 1 the concentration changes of each kind of phosphorus and fitting curves were shown in fig 2 it is clear that the simulation can describe the changes of each kind of phosphorus well the ratios of k 1 k 2 and k 3 were calculated as k 1 k 2 k 3 k obs 1 k obs 2 k obs 3 5 5 5 9 1 indicating that the pp to po oxidation rate was 5 5 times higher than that for pp to pi for po the production rate from pp was a little bit lower than consumption rate from po to pi at the beginning the concentration of pp was higher than po so the amount of production from pp was more than that of consumption thus the concentration of po increased however as oxidation time went by the concentration of pp gradually decreased and the concentration of po increased then the production amount of po decreased whereas the consumption amount increased our simulation shows that at an ozonation time of 17 6 min the amount of po produced was the same as the amount consumed indicating that the po concentration reached a maximum this was confirmed by the observation that the measured po concentrations at 16 and 20 min were the same the po concentration would decrease if ozonation was continued and the total phosphorus would mainly transform into pi 3 3 effects of ph on pbtca ozonation the ph value is important in water treatment because it can affect the components in water matrices it is important in ozonation because it affects the ratio of ozone molecules to oh radicals the results for pbtca ozonation at various ph values are shown in fig 3 a the fluctuation range of ph values was below 0 1 during ozonation the results show that pbtca ozonation was faster at alkaline ph the obvious rate constants k obs were determined at different ph values with the assumption that all the reactions were pseudo first order as shown in fig 3 b all the reactions were fitted well with r 2 values greater than 0 95 the k obs values varied considerably the lowest k obs was 7 5 10 5 s 1 at ph 3 and the highest was 1 3 10 2 s 1 at ph 11 i e 173 times higher than that at ph 3 the large variations in k obs are attributed to the different ratios of ozone molecules to oh radicals i e different degrees of ozone conversion to oh radicals at different ph values numerous studies have shown that under alkaline conditions more oh radicals are generated in the presence of ozone than that under acidic conditions buffle et al 2006 elovitz et al 2000 furthermore the reaction of oh radicals with pbtca was much faster than that of ozone molecules with pbtca therefore pbtca was degraded much faster under alkaline conditions than acidic conditions this explanation is in accordance with the observation that k obs increased more rapidly with ph increasing fig 3 these results and conclusions suggest that pbtca removal by ozonation can be enhanced by changing the ph to alkaline values by addition of an alkali or by using ozone based aops such as o3 h2o2 or o3 catalysts to increase oh radical production 3 4 anti precipitation property reduction pbtca in roc causes problems because of its high anti precipitation capacity which makes it harder to remove heavy metals hardness and salts through precipitation although pbtca can be degraded by ozonation its anti precipitation properties need to be addressed the evaluation of anti precipitation properties was divided into two parts the first part was examination of the precipitate morphology fig 4 shows sem images of the precipitates at a proportional scale of 100 and 20 Î¼m at different ozonation times when pbtca was not added blank group large amounts of precipitates of regular shape packed closely together were formed elemental analysis fig s5 showed that the precipitates were all calcium carbonate caco3 the structure was rhombohedral i e the classic morphology of calcite gopi and subramanian 2012 when pbtca was added 0 min the amount size morphology and uniformity of the precipitates changed greatly the precipitates were in pieces indicating that the amount and size had decreased the distance between adjacent precipitates was greater and the irregular shapes showed that pbtca caused crystal distortion the chemical structures of the precipitates were unchanged the amount and size of the precipitates increased with increasing ozonation time the precipitates tended to aggregate and the distance between two pieces decreased the shapes of the precipitates became regular compared with those for the blank this shows that the lattice distortion effect decreased with increasing pbtca ozonation all the results indicate that the scale inhibition properties decreased with increasing ozonation time the chemical composition of the precipitates remained the same for all samples although inorganic phosphorus was produced during ozonation calcium phosphate was not detected because the amount was small compared with that of calcium carbonate the other part of the evaluation of the anti precipitation properties involved assessment of changes in the anti precipitation ratio the anti precipitation ratios at different ozonation times were compared by constructing a specific curve of different pbtca concentration by different dilution ratios and anti precipitation ratios fig 5 a shows that the anti precipitation ratio decreased with decreasing pbtca concentration in the solution a dose response equation was used to simulate the results to clarify the relationship between them the results indicate good simulation with r 2 0 963 the anti precipitation ratios followed the simulated curve as the ozonation time changed and were similar to each other one way analysis of variance was used to confirm that there were no significant differences a dose response curve was simulated for each ozonation time and pbtca concentration for 50 anti precipitation ap50 was identified as shown in fig 5 b the results show that ap50 did not differ with ozonation time from 0 to 25 min and the average value was 1 96 0 12 mg l the anti precipitation properties may be attributed not only to pbtca but also to the transformation products generated during ozonation as discussed in section 3 2 the transformation products produced during ozonation of pbtca contained inorganic phosphorus and organic compounds other than pbtca containing organic phosphorus the results in fig 5 b show that the transformation products did not have scale inhibition properties ozonation is therefore an effective and promising method for dealing with pbtca 3 5 phosphorus removal by ozonation coagulation combination treatment in section 3 2 pbtca degradation by ozonation and transformation of its phosphorus into other forms of phosphorus during ozonation were discussed however tp was not removed during the treatment similar results were reported by saktaywin et al 2005 i e phosphorus was transformed into several forms but tp did not change there is therefore still a risk of eutrophication and subsequent treatment is needed coagulation is an efficient method for removing phosphorus because it is precipitated by the coagulant yang et al 2010 it is easier to remove inorganic phosphorus than organic phosphorus because the organic form can chelate with the coagulant and this decreases the removal efficiency ma et al 2017 the phosphorus in pbtca was ozonated to an inorganic form therefore phosphorus could be removed efficiently by subsequent coagulation phosphorus removal by ozonation followed by coagulation was therefore investigated the results are shown in fig 6 when ferric chloride was used as the coagulant tp in pbtca could not be removed by direct coagulation if the dosage was less than 20 mg l this is because of the chelating effect of ferric ions similar results and the same mechanism were reported by rott et al 2017b as the dosage increased to 25 mg l 1 removal of tp was observed and the tp removal ratio increased with increasing dosage the concentration of free ferric ions in water was much higher than that of chelated ones therefore the free ions began to form flocs and coagulate ferric chloride at a dosage of 40 mg l gave 55 1 phosphorus removal no inorganic phosphorus was detected in pbtca therefore removal of inorganic phosphorus was not focused on however the conditions changed when ozonation was combined with coagulation the removal of tp was achieved at a ferric dosage of 10 mg l and the removal ratio was 4 3 the percentage removal increased with increasing ferric chloride dosage and reached 86 3 at a dosage of 40 mg l use of a combination of ozonation and coagulation increased tp removal by 30 percentage points compared to that achieved with coagulation alone inorganic phosphorus was also removed at dosages above 10 mg l a higher removal ratio was achieved when the coagulant dosage was increased and 95 3 of inorganic phosphorus was removed at a coagulant dosage of 40 mg l this is because ferric ions tend to coagulate with inorganic phosphorus therefore flocs were formed and more phosphorus was removed the change of ph before and after coagulation was shown in fig s6 ph was kept to 7 during ozonation because of borate buffer in pbtca solution after coagulation ph decreased because of addition of fecl3 meanwhile ph decreased more as fecl3 dosage increased compared with direct coagulation ozonation followed by coagulation required lower dosages of coagulant to achieve the same tp removal ratio use of such combination treatments reduces the cost of reagents and iron sludge production is decreased furthermore anti precipitation properties were suppressed the use of combined ozone coagulation treatment for pbtca degradation is recommended 4 conclusion pbtca can be eliminated partially by ozonation at high doses compared with other pollutants in roc pbtca reacted with ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals much more slowly with second order rate constants k o3 pbtca and k oh pbtca of 0 12 0 002 and 7 83 1 51 108 l mol 1 s 1 respectively the elimination of toc by ozonation was harder than degradation of pbtca the phosphorus in pbtca pp was transformed into an inorganic form pi and an organic form other than that in pbtca po and po was further transformed into pi the transformations among different forms were simulated by a first order reaction and the rate of pp transformation into po was 5 5 times higher than that into pi the ph value greatly affected pbtca degradation by ozonation pbtca was removed 173 times faster under alkaline conditions than under acidic condition this is because of differences in the amounts of ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals and their different reaction rates with pbtca anti precipitation properties were also suppressed by pbtca ozonation the precipitate sizes increased and the shapes became more regular during pbtca treatment the distance between adjacent precipitates also decreased the changes in the anti precipitation ratio with pbtca concentration can be fitted well to a dose response curve ap50 did not change during ozonation therefore the transformation products did not have anti precipitation properties to reduce the phosphorus in pbtca coagulation was performed after ozonation the total phosphorus removal ratio was enhanced by 30 percentage points for ozonation combined with coagulation compared with that for direct coagulation this enhancement is attributed to the tendency of the coagulant to precipitate with inorganic phosphorus to form flocs and flocs are more easily to aggregate and precipitate as anti precipitation effect is gradually removed thus leading to removal of more phosphorus ozonation followed by coagulation is recommended for dealing with the phosphorus in pbtca acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key research

19207,textile dyeing wastewater is characterized by low biodegradability and high nitrogen strength which is difficult to meet the increasingly stringent discharge requirements therefore the tertiary nutrient and refractory organics removal is considered and aerated biofilter is often adopted however the aerobic condition and carbon source shortage restrict tertiary biological nitrogen removal in this study iron scrap was introduced as the filter medium to enhance the pollutant removal capacity and three aerobic biofilters were constructed biofilter fe ce was filled with iron scrap and ceramisite biofilter fe ac was added with iron scrap and granular activated carbon and biofilter ce only had ceramisite to pad as control system after the biofilters were acclimatized by synthetic wastewater and actual dyeing wastewater the optimal operation parameters based on nitrogen removal were determined as ph 7 gas water ratio 5 1 hydraulic retention time 8 h and c n ratio 8 5 1 the iron scraps improved total nitrogen tn removal significantly with tn removal efficiency of 68 7 and 57 3 in biofilter fe ac and biofilter fe ce comparing with biofilter ce of 29 9 additionally phosphorus and cod had better removal performance as well when iron scrap existed further investigation interpreted the reason for iron s facilitating effect on tertiary nutrient and refractory organics removal the introduction of iron scrap made the habitat conditions such as ph values do concentrations and biomass contents inside the biofilters change towards the direction beneficial for pollutant elimination especially for nitrogen removal in iron containing biofilters the majority of nitrogen phosphorus and organic pollutants were removed in the iron scrap layers and more pollutants types appeared implying that iron triggered pollutants to go through more diverse degradation or transformation pathways moreover the phylum proteoabcteria dominated in samples of ceramisite containing biofilters with abundances more than 40 the iron scrap existence increased the abundances of phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes and triggered higher abundance of denitrification bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerated biofilter iron scrap tertiary treatment dyeing wastewater nitrogen removal 1 introduction the large scale textile industry in china produced a great proportion of wastewater discharge textile dyeing wastewaters are characterized not only by recalcitrant refractory and color inducing by the application of dyestuff auxiliaries and sizing agent but also by high nitrogen strength because of urea and ammonia utilization chang et al 2009 conventional technologies for textile dyeing wastewater treatment have been known as various combinations of biological physical and chemical methods for instance the hybrid methods including coagulation sedimentation anaerobic hydrolysis acidification anaerobic aerobic a o or anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o are widely adopted in current years the outlet water quality of many wastewater treatment plants wwtps cannot achieve the more and more stringent discharge standard moreover the urgent demanding for wastewater reuse in textile industry requests the improvement of the treated wastewater quality therefore the technology faces upgrading and reconstruction and the tertiary treatment unit for further removing organics and nutrients from textile wastewater secondary biological effluent is usually considered aerated biofilter is well known as an attached growth process on media which are stationary during normal operation with aeration it always consists of three phases a solid phase acting as the support media for microbial growth a liquid phase in which the solid material is submerged and a gas phase created by the input of air into the reactor mann et al 1999 the pollutant was biologically degraded by the fixed biofilm with physical filtration in a single reactor rogalla and bourbigot 1990 the biofilm formation on an inert granular media in biofilter allows for a much higher concentration of active biomass than a suspended growth activated sludge system so that the size of reactor can be reduced the suspended solids can be captured physically by the packing material and this eliminates the secondary clarifier chang et al 2009 moreover in the attached growth system aerobic and anaerobic anoxic conditions can exist simultaneously on account of the oxygen gradient within the biofilm and nitrogen removal is achieved via the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd process in a single reactor hwang and weng 2017 aerated biofilter system has been used for treating various wastewaters because of its high efficiency and low cost including industrial wastewater zhang et al 2015 domestic wastewater tao et al 2016 pharmaceutical wastewater priya and philip 2015 and even some refractory wastewater such as textile and oil field wastewater he et al 2013 zhao et al 2006 besides installation of biological filtration process for tertiary treatment is a practical alteration to update the wwtp liu et al 2008 and it is a good choice for dyeing wastewater tertiary treatment for further organic and nutrient removal as well it is easy to add the biofilter to an existing plant whereas little space is demanded and construction does not require any stoppage of or interference with operation of existing reactors ryu et al 2008 when aerated biofilter is used for tertiary nitrogen removal it was reported that the denitrification process was impeded when the feed cod tkn ratio less than 15 ryu et al 2008 for this reason a post denitrification biofilter process using external carbon source was proposed feo 2007 since the biological secondary effluent mainly constitutes of refractory pollutants which are hardly used as the denitrification carbon source for nitrogen removal in our previous study iron scrap has been verified to improve the nitrification efficiency in the aerobic stage and the dissolved ferric ions in the nitrification liquid were beneficial for the subsequent anoxic denitrification process during the advanced nitrogen removal treatment from dyeing wastewater chen et al 2016 moreover the aerobic denitrification process can be successfully initiated in the aerobic nitrification activated sludge system when iron scrap was added chen et al 2018 therefore the iron scrap application can benefit the biological nitrogen removal on the other hand the iron scrap mainly contains zero valent iron zvi 95 and other elements such as carbon chromium copper nickel and manganese the microscale galvanic cells are formed once the iron scrap being submerged in wastewater and the reduction and partial degradation of organic compounds will increase the organic biodegradability ma and zhang 2008 the other feature of iron scrap is the fairly large surface area making it have excellent mechanical and hydraulic characteristics as a filter medium ma and zhang 2008 consequently it can be speculated that iron scrap can be used as a filter medium in biofilter its application can improve the biodegradability of refractory pollutants resulting in an increased nitrogen and organic removal efficiency besides the microbial diversity and community distribution in biofilters affected by nutrient gradient operation condition and packing material will tightly relate to the pollutant removal performance a great diversity of microbes including proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi verrucomicrobia have been detected in biofilm showing a good ability of refractory pollutants removal and microbes such as nitrospirae are relate to nitrogen cycle islam et al 2015 once iron scrap was applied as the packing material along with the iron ions releasing do and proton in the wastewater will be consumed chien et al 2008 saheb et al 2008 which may change the ph value and do concentration inside the biofilters then the microbial structure may be accordingly altered additionally the packing material of iron scrap will attach microbes different from those on mediums of ce or gac and iron scrap itself and its released ions will change the microbial structure as well previous study revealed that iron scrap enhanced the abundance of aerobic denitrifiers such as bacteria genera of thauera thermomonas rhodobacter and hyphomicrobium in activated sludge system stimulating simultaneous nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions chen et al 2018 therefore the variation of microbial structure will make the biofilters have different pollutant removal performance apart from nitrogen removal the probable chemical depositions by iron ions in biofilter will strengthen the phosphorus eliminating from wastewater therefore the iron is expected to simultaneously facilitate the nutrient and refractory organics removal in the aerated biofilter for dyeing wastewater tertiary treatment in this study three various aerobic biofilters were constructed one was filled with iron and ceramisite biofilter fe ce one was added with iron and granular activated carbon biofilter fe ac the last one only used ceramisite to pad as control system biofilter ce the beneficial effect of iron application in biofilter on refractory organics and nutrient removal from real dyeing wastewater was verified firstly then the optimal operation parameters based on nitrogen removal was determined furthermore the reason for iron facilitating the organic and nutrient removal performance was interpreted via iron releasing and distributing pattern the habitat condition changes inside the biofilters and the microbial structure shifts after iron scrap was introduced in the biofilters 2 material and methods 2 1 iron ceramisite and granular activated carbon the iron ceramisite and granular activated carbon gac were used as the filter mediums in this study the iron used in this study was iron scrap for its abundant local supply and relatively low cost which came from the waste of lathe cutting with length of 50 100 mm and shape of spiral bending fig s1 see supporting information si before the experiment the iron scraps were washed and immersed in naoh 0 2 m for 24 h to remove the surface oil the composition of this iron scrap was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkinelmer optima 2100 dv usa after being digested by nitric acid and the result was shown in table s1 see si the ceramisite was supplied by henan boda ceramisite technology co ltd with diameter ranging from 2 to 4 mm the gac were purchased from shandong nanke co ltd with diameters ranging from 2 5 to 3 5 mm the porosity of iron scraps ceramisite and gac were 80 8 41 2 and 42 4 and their surface areas were 0 25 4 2 and 925 m2 g respectively 2 2 biofilters construction and acclimatization three biofilters were designed as exhibited in fig 1 it was constructed as a cylinder with an internal diameter of 100 mm and a height of 1500 mm the supporting layer with pore size of 3 mm and pore distance of 5 mm was set 100 mm away from the bottom of the biofilter the filtration beds of the three biofilters were packed with different filtration mediums on the supporting layer biofilter ce was packed with ceramsite with an initial height of 1000 mm biofilter fe ce was vertically divided into two parts by a middle supporting layer the upper part with height of 500 mm was packed with ceramsite while the other part with the same height was filled with iron scraps biofilter fe ac was stuffed with the gac instead of ceramsite in the upper layer and the lower layer used iron scrap as well for biofilter ce five wastewater sampling valves were placed every 200 mm on the filter column and another one was set at the middle layer at height of 500 mm for biofilters fe ce and fe ac two wastewater sampling valves were placed every 200 mm on iron scrap layer and one sampling valve was set at the middle supporting layer 10 mm below above the middle supporting layer five wastewater sampling valves were uniformly set every 100 mm meanwhile the biomass sampling valves with diameter of 20 mm were set at the opposite of the wastewater sampling valves on these three biofilters raw water and air was infiltrated through the bottom of the filtration bed via peristaltic pump and air compressor and the filtration medium were kept submersing by tuning the opening degree of the outlet valve at the initial stage of biofilter acclimatization the synthetic wastewater was used for biofilm rapid growth the main water quality parameters of the influent were as follows cod using sodium acetate 350 400 mg l nh3 n 25 30 mg l soluble orthophosphorus sop 2 4 mg l the other components of the synthetic wastewater were described in the supporting information si table s2 and the influent ph was adjusted to 7 5 0 2 the synthetic wastewater rich in nutrients was used for biofilm natural growth without sludge seeding the wastewater and the air were pumped at the bottom of the filtration bed and the ratio of gas volume to water volume was set as 10 1 at the beginning small influent flow of 1 l h was continuously supplied at the bottom of the filtration bed which was beneficial for cellular growth and immobilization then the influent flow was increased to 2 l d and was raised by 1 l d every 2 days after the influent flow was 4 l d and the removal of cod and nh3 n achieved stable the biofilm was considered to form successfully subsequently the real secondary effluent of dyeing wastewater which was withdrawn from a dyeing wastewater treatment plant in shaoxing of china was pumped to these biofilters for biofilm acclimatization the characteristics of the influent wastewater were cod 43 120 mg l nh3 n 15 18 mg l tn 16 20 mg l sop 0 8 1 2 mg l and ph 7 7 5 to alleviate the adverse effect of real dyeing wastewater on the biofilm and to accommodate the biofilm to the dyeing wastewater quality the biofilter effluent was turned back as the influent and was circulated for 5 days after three circulating batch runs the cod and nh3 n were both removed more than 80 and a total of 28 days was cost in the whole period of biofilm growth and acclimatization 2 3 experiments of optimal operation conditions determination for nitrogen removal after the first stage of biofilter acclimatization was finished the main parameters affecting the nitrogen removal were optimized at the second stage such as ph value gas water ratio hydraulic retention time hrt and c n ratio when considering the effect of ph value the ph of the influent wastewater was adjusted to 5 6 7 8 and 9 and the other operation conditions were set as gas water ratio 5 1 hrt 8 h and c n 6 the effluent of nh3 n and tn concentrations were detected and the optimal ph value was selected when taking account of the optimal gas water ratio ratios of 0 1 1 3 1 5 1 and 7 1 were chosen the ph value was set as the optimal one and the hrt and c n were fixed as 8 h and 6 respectively similarly the optimal hrt and c n were determined using the similar procedure according to the literature li et al 2016 the hrt was calculated as follows h r t 24 v n q where hrt hydraulic retention time h v volume of the filling medium in the column ml n porosity of the filling medium q water volume feeding into the column in the 24 h ml during this period after changing the value of one parameter the removal efficiency will vary samples were taken every 8 h after at least four hrt cycles being experienced when the removal efficiency of cod tn and tp reached stable the average value of three stable removal rates stands for the performance of biofilter under the condition of specific parameter value then changing to another value and similar procedure was adopted a total of about 100 days will be taken to investigate the optimal operation parameters then the third stage for observing the stable operation performance and mechanism investigation was carried out for another 45 d 2 4 sampling method during the stable operation stage samples of wastewater and biomass from the filling medium at different layer heights of the biofilter were taken before sampling the cod tn and tp in effluent were measured to confirm the system stable operation the iron content in wastewater and in biomass the ph value the do concentration the biomass content and the organics nitrogen phosphorus removal with the layer height were tested when sampling the wastewater as shown in fig 1 the wastewater sampling valve at the bottom of the biofilter was open firstly and the wastewater flew naturally to a conical bottle after collecting wastewater of about 40 ml the sampling valve was immediately closed same procedure was operated from the bottom valve to the top one and wastewater samples at different heights could be collected within 5 min do concentration and ph value of the wastewater were tested immediately when sampling the biomass for measuring iron content in biomass and biomass content the biomass on packing material was taken from biomass sampling valves before sampling the influent of the biofilter was stopped temporarily and the valves were open then the sample spoon was dipped into the biofilter center and extracted the packing material with biomass from the top valve to the bottom one 2 5 analytical methods the dry biomass concentration in biofilter was determined by means of the weight difference of a packing material sample dried at 105 c overnight and calcined at 500 c for 1 h the result was express as mg biomass cm3 the amounts of fe3 and fe2 containing in wastewater samples were directly determined by the phenanthroline spectrophotometric method using a uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 35 the biomass samples were scraped from the filter mediums and were digested using nitric acid before total iron ions detection via inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer icp prodigy leeman usa and the content of iron ion in biomass was expressed as mg g biomass the analysis of the microbial community was conducted by illumina miseq sequencing technique for it can generate a large number of sequences the biomass samples for microbial analysis were grabbed from biofilter ce and the upper layers and lower layers of biofilter fe ce and fe ac the sample sites were depicted in fig s2 in si the obtained five samples were used for dna extraction and microbial analysis the detail procedures were in si the cod nh3 n no3 n no2 n tn mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solid mlvss analyses were conducted according to standard methods apha 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 the biofilm growth and acclimazation of the biofilters firstly the synthetic wastewater was used for biofilm rapid growth the cod and nh3 n removal efficiency were detected every day to assess the biofilm growth state as shown in fig 2 a the cod had low removal efficiency at the beginning which was probably due to the adsorption by filtration medium then the cod removal capacities increased rapidly with acclimatization time at 4 6 days the cod in effluent of biofilters fe ce and fe ac was only about 25 30 mg l which was much lower than that of biofilter ce 80 105 mg l after that the removal efficiency of iron containing biofilters decreased slightly probably due to the saturated adsorption capacity with respect to nh3 n removal as shown in fig 2 c about 40 was removed at the initial stage probably attributing to adsorption by filtration medium when the adsorption achieved saturation the effluent nh3 n concentration became high afterwards and then the effluent nh3 n became less with accumulating time when compared with the cod removal the increasing of nh3 n removal rate was slow than that of cod with time the probable reason was the competition between the low growth rate autotrophic nitrifying bacteria and the heterotrophic bacteria dominated on the biofilm gÃ¡lvez et al 2003 with the influent flow increasing at the end of synthetic wastewater domestication period the effluent cod achieved relatively stable with average removal efficiency of about 80 and the nitrogen efficiency of biofilter fe ac fe ce and ce reached 67 8 65 5 and 57 5 respectively revealing that the biofilm was formed successfully and the iron scraps application was in favor of nitrification process then the real secondary dyeing wastewater with initial nh3 n concentration of 16 mg l was pumped into the biofilters and the nh3 n removal efficiency decreased to nearly 50 at the end of the first batch run fig 2 d the relative low nh3 n removal behavior manifested that the nitrification was inhibited to some extent by the real dyeing wastewater after 3 circulating batch runs all the biofilters had nitrification efficiencies of more than 85 implying that the nitrification was initiated successfully additionally fig 2 c showed that the effluent cod of biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac was 17 9 15 6 and 14 5 mg l respectively since both cod and nh3 n had removal efficiencies more than 80 at the end of the third batch run it could be considered that the biofilm was successfully formed 3 2 operation parameters optimization for nitrogen removal 3 2 1 optimal ph value determination after the biofilters acclimatization was finished main parameters affecting the removal of nutrients and organic matter were optimized using the real secondary effluent of dyeing wastewater such as ph value gas water ratio hrt and c n ratio for the nitrogen removal is difficult and complicated the optimal operation conditions were determined based on the nitrogen removal performance under the conditions of gas water ratio 5 hrt 8 h and c n 6 the effect of initial ph value on nitrogen removal was shown in fig 3 a nitrate was the main nitrogen species in the effluent of all three biofilters and the concentrations of nh3 n and no2 n were very low the tn removal efficiency increased first and then decreased with the initial ph value increasing in all these biofilters the best tn removal efficiency of biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac appearing at ph value of 7 were 20 9 50 1 and 56 8 respectively manifesting that neutral ph value and iron scrap application benefited the nitrogen removal 3 2 2 optimal gas water ratio determination the do concentration of the wastewater determined by gas water ratio in the biofilters is an important factor affecting the performance of nitrogen removal in this study different gas water ratios of 0 1 1 3 1 5 1 and 7 1 were selected when fixing the optimal ph value of 7 the hrt of 8 h and c n of 6 as exhibited in fig 3 b when the gas water ratio was 0 the do concentrations in the biofilters were severely inadequate and the nitrification process was not thoroughly completed the no2 n was the main nitrogen species in the effluent of these biofilters with the gas water ratio increasing from 0 to 7 1 the nitrification efficiency enhanced due to the increasing oxygen supplying and the percentage of no3 n concentration of the effluent raised the tn removal efficiency increased with the gas water ratio rising however further increasing its ratio decreased the tn removal capacity which probably resulted from the excess oxygen breaking the anoxic zone for denitrification with respect to biofilter ce the best tn removal efficiency 25 1 appeared at gas water ratio of 3 1 for biofilter fe ce tn removal efficiency achieved the maximal of 49 1 at gas water ratio of 5 1 when the gas water ratio was in the range of 3 1 to 7 1 the biofilter fe ac had relatively stable tn removal efficiencies of more than 60 the biofliter fe ac could accommodate a wide range of gas water ratio and its nitrogen removal performance was more stable and efficient than that of biofilter ce or fe ce since all the biofilters had comparatively good nitrogen removal efficiency at the gas water ratio of 5 1 it was selected as the optimal ratio 3 2 3 optimal hrt determination the hrt determines the contacting time of wastewater to the microbes and the thickness of biofilm in this study hrts of 1 2 4 6 and 8 h were taken into consideration and the determined optimal ph value of 7 and gas water ratio of 5 were fixed as denoted in fig 3 c when the hrt was short as 1 h the nh3 n removal efficiencies were 71 3 82 4 and 90 6 and the tn removal efficiencies were 5 9 17 3 and 26 7 in biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac respectively in general short hrt means a high hydraulic loading the heterotrophic bacteria with relative high growth rate will out compete the autotrophic nitrifying bacteria with low growth rate in addition short hrt made the bacteria have insufficient reaction time to utilize the nitrogen species via assimilation pathway moreover short hrt along with strong hydraulic shear force may cause the biofilm thinning or detaching resulting in the do permeating to the inner biofilm and ruining the anaerobic habitat of denitrifiers growth consequently the nh3 n and tn removal was relatively low under the condition of short hrt with the hrt increasing the better tn removal efficiency was obtained and the tn removal efficiencies of biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac were 21 5 49 4 and 59 4 at hrt of 8 h it was obvious that iron scrap facilitated the nitrogen removal and using gac as the filter medium could further enhance the removal capacity under the same hrt condition biofilter fe ac always had the best nitrogen removal performance and the tn removal efficiencies followed the order of fe ac fe ce ce the htr of 8 h was selected to obtain better removal efficiency 3 2 4 optimal c n ratio determination based on the above optimal ph value gas water ratio and hrt the effect of c n ratio on nitrogen removal were investigated the initial cod and tn in the secondary effluent used in this experiment were 108 and 17 4 mg l respectively making the c n ratio of 6 2 then certain amounts of ammonium chloride or sodium acetate were added to the influent to make the c n ratios as 4 5 8 5 and 11 5 fig 4 profiled the concentrations of influent cod codi influent tn tni and effluent tn tne in all biofilters at the various c n ratios in biofilter ce the tn removal efficiency enhanced remarkably from 11 2 to 25 1 when c n ratio increased from 4 5 to 6 2 and the removal amount of total nitrogen was 2 6 mg l and 4 3 mg l under the same influent cod concentration 108 mg l suggesting that small part of organics in the secondary effluent of dyeing wastewater can be used as the heterotrophic denitrification carbon source however further enhancing c n ratio to 8 5 or 11 5 could not improve the tn removal efficiency significantly implying that the denitrification capacity in biofilter ce was very limited after iron scrap was applied the tn removal rates in biofilters fe ac and fe ce were much higher than that of biofilter ce at c n ratio of 4 5 or 6 2 indicating that the denitrification capacity became much stronger and more organics in the secondary effluent of dyeing wastewater could be used as the denitrification carbon source the tn removal efficiency increased to 41 9 and 61 6 for biofilter fe ce and fe ac at c n ratio of 6 2 when the carbon source amount was further increased c n of 8 5 the tn removal efficiency kept improving however continuously increasing the c n ratio from 8 5 to 11 5 did not bring significant enhancement and the optimal nitrogen removal was achieved at c n of 8 5 with tn removal efficiencies of 57 3 and 68 7 for biofilter fe ce and fe ac respectively when c n ratio was less than 8 5 carbon source was the limiting factor affecting the tn removal which demonstrated that heterotrophic denitrification process played an important role moreover since the oxygen was pumped to the biofilter system aerobic denitrification might be occurred which was consistent with our previous study that the iron scrap could robustly stimulate simultaneous aerobic nitrification and denitrification process chen et al 2018 as mentioned above the optimal operation conditions for nitrogen removal were determined as ph value 7 gas water ratio 5 1 hrt 8 h and c n 8 5 under the optimal operation conditions the cod removal percentages were 76 0 1 1 81 6 1 5 and 84 5 1 8 and the sop removal efficiencies were 62 7 96 4 and 97 3 for biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac respectively after optimizing the operation conditions the pollutants removal performance was tracked for another 45 d in the third stage and the removal efficiency was consistently stable during this period as shown in fig s3 it was obvious that iron scrap facilitated the removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorus in the biofilters and the application of gac could further enhance the removal capacity 3 3 how does iron scrap facilitate the pollutant removal pollutants cod nitrogen and phosphate showed better removal performance in biofilters of fe ce and fe ac than that in biofilter ce mainly attributing to the iron supplementation although the iron scraps were filled in the lower layer of the biofilter the released iron ions would flow and distribute in the whole filter layer the do and proton in the wastewater will be consumed during iron ion releasing process which will change the ph value and do concentration making the microbial growth habitat condition inside the biofilters different even under the same influent conditions furthermore the released iron ions and the altered microbial growth conditions might impact the microbial structure of the biofilter therefore the iron supplementation might change the pollutant removal behavior and the probable reason as assumed above will be discussed the wastewater samples and biomass samples were taken at different layer height in the third operation stage as mentioned in part 2 4 before sampling for biofilters fe ac fe ce and ce the detected cod removal efficiencies were 86 3 81 5 and 73 4 the tn removal efficiencies were 67 8 58 1 and 27 5 and the sop removal rates were 100 99 4 and 64 5 respectively the pollutants removal kept stable then samples at different site were taken 3 3 1 change of habitat condition inside the biofilter induced by iron scrap the content of iron ions in the wastewater is a dynamic process the zvi in iron scraps released iron ions constantly and the released ions will participate in the reactions such as bacteria utilization hydrolysis and precipitation the iron ion concentrations in the wastewater at different layer height of biofilter fe ce and fe ac were detected as illustrated in fig 5 a in the iron scrap layer the total released ions remarkablly increased with the layer height and only tiny fe2 was tested the highest total iron ions concentrations at layer height of 500 mm in biofilter fe ce and fe ac were 1 9 and 1 7 mg l respectively then the iron ions decreased dramatically espeacially at height of 500 600 mm which might attribute to the ferric irons precipitation and the biofilm retaining effect the efflunt total iron ion concentration was only about 0 8 mg l it can be seen that the free iron ions in wastewater was low througout the whole biofliter layer apart from the free iron ions measured in the wastewater content of the released iron ions which might be precipitated and retained in the biofilms was tested as shown in fig 5 a the iron content increased significantly with the iron scrap layer height and then decreased in the upper layer the highest concentrations reached up to 31 2 and 33 6 mg g biomass at layer height of 500 mm in biofilter fe ce and fe ac respectively the much higher iron content in the biofilm than that in the wastewater suggested that most of the released iron ion was trapped by the biofilm with the biofilter height increasing the iron content in the ce or gac layer decreased sharply showing similar rule as the free iron ions in wastewater additionally the iron ions in wastewater and biofilm of biofilter ce were less than 0 2 mg l and 1 1 mg g biomass respectively data not shown it can be seen that the iron ions were unevenly distributed in the biofilters and the released ions in the biofilter fe ac was littler higer than that in biofilter fe ce along with the iron ions releasing process the proton and oxygen will be consumed chien et al 2008 saheb et al 2008 making the ph values and do concentrations inside the three biofilters vary then correspondingly altering the microbial growth such as biomass content as depicted in fig 5 b the ph values all increased after the wastewater entered the biofilters and iron scrap application made the ph values higher than that in biofilter ce for biofilters containing iron scrap the micro electrolysis reaction will occur in the iron scrap layer under the neutral aerobic condition the reactions as equations 1 3 would happen which made the ph increase to about 8 5 when the wastewater passed through the iron scrap layer as reported in the literature ph value around 8 0 was in favor of the aerobic denitrification process chen et al 2018 ji et al 2015 with respect to do concentration fig 5 c it was gradually increased with the layer height mainly due to that the longer gas water contacting time makes more oxygen be dissolved in the wastewater and the high gas water ratio allows the oxygen dissolving rate over microbes consuming rate when iron scraps exist oxygen will be consumed during the iron releasing process as equations 1 3 which resulted in the do concentration less in iron containing biofilters fe ce and fe ac at the height of 400 mm in biofilter ce the do concentration achieved 1 4 mg l while only 0 9 and 0 7 mg l at the height of 500 mm in biofilters fe ce and fe ac do is one of the major factors responsible for nitrification and denitrification after achieving good nitrification rate increasing do concentration will inhibit the denitrification because of the competition between electron accepters nitrate and oxygen liu et al 2008 therefore the local anaerobic or anoxic zone will form more easily in iron containing biofilters which benefits the anaerobic denitrification as illustrated in fig 5 d the biomass content in biofilter ce declined along with the layer height and the highest biomass content of 1 2 g cm3 appeared at layer height of 200 mm in biofilters fe ce and fe ac the biomass in iron layer decreased slightly with height and the contents were less than that in biofilter ce at the same layer height which might result from the smaller specific surface area of iron scraps than that of ce in the upper layer of biofilter fe ce and fe ac since the larger specific surface for microbial growth was provided the biomass content raised to 0 9 1 g cm3 at layer height of 600 mm the general trend of biomass contents in the upper layers of the three biofilters was reduced with height due to nutrient substances depleting however iron scrap containing biofilters had higher biomass contents which was probably induced by the fact that iron ions existing in the biomass promote the microbial growth zou et al 2014 furthermore the gac layer with larger specific surface area accumulated more biomass as analyzed above the introduction of iron scrap made the habitat condition inside the biofilter towards the direction beneficial for pollutant elimination especially for nitrogen removal 1 fe 2e fe2 2 o2 h2o 4e 4oh 3 4fe2 o2 4h 2h2o 4fe3 3 3 2 removal behavior of nutrient and organics with height the application of iron scrap has been approved to facilitate the pollutants removal capacity especially tn removal however which layer iron scrap layer ce or gac layer made the main contribution to pollutant removal was still ambiguous therefore the removal behavior of nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter was investigated with the biofilter bed height during the third stage of stable operation 3 3 2 1 nitrogen and phosphorus transformation with bed height as depicted in fig 6 a the nh3 n concentration in biofilter ce decreased sharply from 16 2 to 1 35 mg l and no3 n concentration increased rapidly from the biofilter bottom to the height of 400 mm in the biofilter ce the overwhelming majority of nh3 n was transferred to no3 n which meant that the nitrification was happened successfully in this height range from the height of 400 1000 mm the generated no3 n only had little dropping about 29 5 of tn was removed in the whole biofilter ce which might ascribe the removal to the bacteria assimilation and the weak denitrification in the biofilters fe ce and fe ac remarkable tn decreasing was happened in the iron scrap layer as shown in fig 6 b c almost all the nh3 n was removed and the tn concentration declined from 17 6 to 7 9 and 6 7 mg l in the iron scrap layer of biofilter fe ce and fe ac respectively when compared with the biofilter ce the primary difference is that the produced no3 n from nh3 n was much less in the height of 0 500 mm as discussed above the do concentration in iron containing biofilter was lower than that in biofilter ce fig 5 c this made the anaerobic zone exist more easily and the organic matters were consumed more slowly inside the biofilm of fe ce and fe ac than those in biofilter ce which agreed the local anaerobic denitrification to occur moreover it was reported that denitrification process could be promoted by the fe3 chen et al 2016 zou et al 2014 thus the denitrification occurring in these biofilters might be enhanced by the retained iron ions in biofilm previous study found that the iron scrap would even stimulate aerobic denitrification making snd happen under the aerobic condition chen et al 2018 therefore the local anaerobic denitrification and possible aerobic denitrification contributed to the tn declining in the iron scrap layer at the height of 500 1000 mm the tn concentration still had a little declining with the final tn concentrations in effluent of biofilters fe ce and fe ac 7 5 and 5 5 mg l respectively and the corresponding tn removal efficiencies were 57 4 and 68 7 therefore the application of iron scrap brought about significant simultaneous nitrification and denitrification progress and gac can further enhance the nitrogen removal when compared with biofilter fe ce apart from nitrogen removal the sop removal behavior as shown in fig 6 d revealed that the removal efficiency in biofilters containing iron scrap 97 was much higher than that in biofilter ce 62 7 besides the sop removal happened in different zones of the biofilters in biofilter ce the sop was gradually removed with the filter height and the bacteria assimilation might be the main reason for its removal while in biofilter fe ce and fe ac almost all the sop was removed in the iron scrap layer which was mainly attributed to the chemical precipitation by fe3 releasing from the iron scrap in conclusion the nitrogen and phosphorus removal mainly happened in the iron scrap layer in the biofilters fe ce and fe ac and iron scrap application promoted their removal efficiencies 3 3 2 2 organic pollutant removal behavior with bed height the performances of organic pollutants removal by the biofilters were explored as shown in fig 7 the removal rate of cod was high in the height of 0 400 mm in the biofilter ce and became slow in the height of 400 1000 mm for biofilters containing iron scrap fe ce and fe ac the cod decreased as well in the iron scrap layer 0 500 mm but with the removal rate lower than that of biofilter ce the probable reason was that the iron scrap layer had less biomass content and lower do concentration as demonstrated above noteworthy the cod removal rate rose abruptly at the height of 500 600 mm it was speculated that the organic contaminant was broken to the degradable molecule in the iron scrap which was then rapidly decomposed by the microbes attaching on the biofilm in the upper packing layer since zero valent iron as a general reactant could degrade various environmental contaminants from wastewater and groundwater due to its high reductive capacity thus the removal of pollution by single zero valent iron scraps was considered the experiment was set similarly as the iron scrap layer but excluding the microbial effect and the details were described in the supporting information the result showed that about 35 cod was removed by single iron scrap and tn concentration had no obvious decreasing considering that about 60 cod was removed in the iron scrap layer in biofilters fe ce and fe ac microorganism on biofilm made another 25 cod removal therefore both iron chemical reaction and microbial biodegradation responded for organics removal in iron scrap layer however the nitrogen removal mainly related to microbial effect as to biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac the final effluent cod concentrations were 36 0 27 5 and 23 2 mg l respectively indicating that iron scrap utilization could enhance the organic pollutant removal capacity to further reveal the organics removal details in the three biofilters samples from the middle layer at the height of 500 mm named as sample m and the final effluent at the height of 1000 mm named as sample f were taken out to detect via gc ms as depicted in fig 7 b the peaks number and the peaks intensity declined remarkably after the treatment by aerated biofilter the 28 types of pollutants were detected in influent as summarized in table s3 in si after being treated the 24 kinds of pollutants disappeared and could not be detected in sample ms and sample fs of all the three biofilters notably the tetrahydrofuran was found in all the samples and its removal efficiencies via semi quantitative analysis based on peak intensity were summarized in table 1 lin et al 2016 in biofilter ce only 14 2 of tetrahydrofuran was removed in the lower layer 0 500 mm and the total removal rate was 53 9 however its removal capacity was promoted significantly in the iron containing biofilters approximately 90 was eliminated in the lower iron scrap layer 0 500 mm and no obvious removal in the upper filter layer in addition three other pollutants 2 4 5 trimethylbenzaldehyde 2 4 diisocyanato 1 methylbenzene and dibenzyl ether had relative high peak intensity in the influent and their removal rates ranged from 80 5 to 92 1 without dramatical variations in the three biofilters when comparing the sample ms and sample fs with the influent new organics were generated as exhibited in table 1 there were 13 16 and 19 kinds of new pollutants appearing in the biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac respectively mainly consisting of oxygen containing substances with long chains and rings it was observed that iron scrap triggered more new pollutant species produced among these new generated pollutants there were 6 organics species being detected in all the biofilters with dotted box in table 1 which meant that some pollutants might have similar degradation pathway in the different biofilter systems when comparing the composition of new generated pollutant species in sample m and sample f biofilter ce contained 6 kinds of same organic substances in sample m and sample f and the number was only 3 and 5 in biofilter fe ce and fe ac respectively that is to say the proportions of same new generated pollutants number accounting for total emerging organics species were 46 2 18 8 and 26 3 in biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac therefore the iron containing biofilter systems present great diversity of pollutant types which suggested that the introduction of iron triggered more diversity of pollutants degradation or transformation pathways in current years the effluent total organics concentration using cod as the indicator is still the primary concern in the discharge standard and some pollutants with industry characteristics and high toxicity were gradually limited in the effluent discharge although the concentration of effluent cod is low after wastewater treatment the toxic substances with low concentration left in the wastewater or new pollutants generated in the treatment process may still present potential risk to the ecological environment the pollutant toxicity is related to structure and concentration as analysis above in the iron containing biofilters the effluent cod was lower than that of biofilter ce fig 7 a and more new organic species were generated table 1 which meant that the concentration of each pollutant might be much lower therefore the likelihood of environmental risks will reduce when considering the pollutant concentration however the pollutants species increases the potential toxicity to environment after tertiary treatment needs pay attention in future research 3 3 3 microbial structure microorganisms play key roles in the organics and nutrient removal during biological treatment process to further explore the effect of iron on microbial structure and analyze its contribution to the different performances of variation biofilters a comprehensive investigation of the microbial community between biofilter fe ce fe ac and ce was conducted using illumina miseq sequencing technique the biomass samples were taken from the upper and lower layers of biofilters fe ac and fe ce and the layer of biofilter ce as shown in fig s2 which were named as sample a b c d and e the results of shannon index chao value and ace value summarized in table s4 in si showed that the microbial diversity and richness was higher when the iron scraps existed in the biofilters from the venn analysis as illustrated in fig s4 the structure and composition of microbial species changed remarkably and only 69 operational taxonomic units otus or 0 88 of the total out 7857 3 distance were shared by these samples the bacteria abundances on phylum level were exhibited in fig 8 twelve phyla were detected in these samples and their sum accounted for more than 96 of the total reads the detailed abundance information on phylum class order family and genus levels was summarized in table s5 in si from the principle component analysis pca based on phylum abundance data fig 8 b the result unclosed that pc1 and pc2 explained 55 2 and 34 7 of total bacterial community variations respectively indicating that the bacteria compositions on phyla level were significantly altered specifically when the biofilters contained ceramsite samples c d and e had more similarities containing the proteobacteria as the main phylum with abundances of 43 0 47 8 and 54 5 respectively which were much higher than that in biofilter fe ac with abundances of 21 9 and 24 3 in sample a and b while chloroflexi was more abundant in sample a and firmicutes was dominated in sample b in the upper layers of biofilters fe ac and fe ce sample a and sample c the community structures were various which resulted from the different packing materials however the same iron scrap layers in biofilter fe ac and fe ce sample b and sample d also exhibited diverse community components which inferred that the upper layer might have impact on it the iron scraps containing iron carbon and other metals were submerged in the wastewater and microscale galvanic cells were formed this might evoke the accumulation of electrochemically active bacteria involving electron transferring such as firmicutes acidobacteria actinobacteria shown in fig 8 a wang et al 2016 moreover in biofilter fe ac the larger scale galvanic cells between the upper gac layer and the lower iron layer might be formed and the activity of electron transferring might be improved as seen in fig 8 a b the firmicutes became the dominant phylum with abundance of 38 8 in iron scrap layer of biofilter fe ac this may explain the microbial community variation between sample b and d as shown in table 2 the genus belonging to phylum proteobacteria had higher abundance in sample c d and e in sample e u o xanthomonadales belonging to phylum proteobacteria accounted for the most abundance in biofliter ce 13 38 of total reads which are polyaromatic hydrocarbon pah degraders islam et al 2015 additionally the abundances of pseudomonas u f rhodobacteraceae nitrosomonas and hyphomicrobium belonging to phylum proteobacteria accounted for 6 63 4 66 1 93 and 2 06 respectively the genus of pseudomonas was reported to have abilities of pollutants degradation nitrification and denitrification u f rhodobacteraceae is a member of family rhodobacteraceae which was highly collected with hydrocarbon degradation the nitrosomonas is a genus of chemoautotrophic bacteria oxidizing ammonia into nitrite which is important in the nitrogen cycle nakagawa and takahashi 2015 in sample of lower layer in fe ce sample d the genera of ochrobactrum desulfovibrio and hydrogenophaga belonging to phylum proteobacteria were dominated with abundances of 9 39 4 06 and 2 85 bacteria of ochrobactrum genus can be isolated from soil and sewage it can degrade a wide variety of chemical substances and reduce nitrites to atmospheric nitrogen poddbniak and jafra 2009 genus of hydrogenophaga that are frequently detected in textile wastewater treatment plant are nitrate reducing bacteria gan et al 2011 wang et al 2014 in sample c fe ce upper layer bacteria of genera belonging to phylum proteobacteria contained pseudomonas 2 82 hyphomonas 2 60 woodsholea 2 49 hydrogenophaga 2 38 rhodovulum 2 13 lysobacter 1 29 bradyrhizobium 1 09 and piscinibacter 1 09 totally accounting for 15 88 genues hyphomonas as a member of family hyphomonadaceae most species of which are able to reduce nitrate and are believed to play an important role in the mineralization of dissolved organic matter alain et al 2008 abraham et al 1997 pertinent to activated carbon containing biofilter the genus composition had remarkable alteration in sample of lower layer of fe ac the main genera ochrobactrum 5 04 ralstonia 3 80 helicobacter 5 40 and desulfovibrio 1 32 were belonged to proteobacteria aerobic bacteria ralstonia was reported to be related to fe ii oxidizing which implied that the detected fe3 in wastewater or biomass not only came from the abiotic iron releasing induced by oxygen but also ascribed to the effect of biotic bacteria ferrous oxidizing percak dennett et al 2017 as to sample of upper layer of fe ac only pseudomonas phodovulum and woodsholea were the members of proteobacteria with the abundance more than 1 it should be noted that the genus nitrospirae accumulating in samples b d and e responded for nitrification daims et al 2015 its abundance decreased dramatically in sample a and c but with the high nitrification efficiency implying that other related nitrifying bacteria might be responsible for nitrification in iron scrap layer furthermore the phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes other than proteobacteria dominated in iron scrap layers especially in biofilter fe ac with abundances of 20 9 and 38 80 as depicted in fig 8 members of these two phyla are thought to degrade complex organic matters and demonstrated to have denitrification activity tang et al 2009 wang et al 2016 lee et al 2013 the alistipes and rikenalla were the main genera belonging to family rikenellaceae under phylum bacteroidetes in the sample of lower layer of fe ac species of these two genera can ferment carbohydrates to complex organic acids and they were usually found in the human or animal clinical specimens according to previous researches su et al 2014 han et al 2017 however the reason for these genera accumulating in lower layer of biofilter fe ac needs further explanation in lower layer of fe ce u o bacteroidales and sediminibacterium were main genera belonging to phylum bacteroidetes and genus sediiminibacterium is iron oxidizing bacteria and can oxide the ferrous wang et al 2014 as to phylum firmicutes in lower layer of fe ac the u f lachnospiraceae lachnoclostridium and lachnospiraceae nk4a136 group were the main detected genera belonging to family lachnospiraceae and the ruminiclostridium 6 ruminiclostridium 5 and ruminococcaceae ucg 014 belong to family ruminococcaceae the total abundance of these genera accounted for 23 67 however the lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae are two of the most abundant families from the order clostridiales which are found in the mammalian gut environment and have been associated with the maintenance of gut health biddle et al 2013 why did they have a much accumulation in the iron scrap layer and their functions in wastewater treatment needs to explore additionally the phylum of actinobacteria in the iron scrap layer of fe ce had higher abundance 18 24 than that of other biofilters which mainly consisted of genera leucobacter ilumatobacter and candidatus microthrix species of genus leucobacter was reported to own denitrification capacity weon et al 2012 as analyzed above the genera relating to denitrification such as ochrobactrum hydrogenophaga and leucobacter had much higher abundance in ion scrap layers than those in other samples which contributed to the total nitrogen removal in iron scrap layer as well therefore the diverse microbial communities of these three biofilters referred to their different pollutant removal performances 4 conclusion three various aerated biofilters were used for tertiary simultaneous nutrient and refractory organics removal from real dyeing wastewater the introduction of iron scrap as the filter medium was verified to facilitate the pollutant removal efficiency especially the tn removal under the determined optimal operation conditions that is ph 7 gas water ratio 5 1 hydraulic retention time 8 h and c n ratio 8 5 1 the tn removal efficiency achieved 68 7 57 3 and 29 9 in biofilter fe ac biofilter fe ce and biofilter ce respectively the phosphorus and cod had better removal performance as well when iron scrap existed further investigation revealed the reason for iron s facilitating effect the application of iron scrap changed the habitat conditions such as ph values do concentrations and biomass contents inside the biofilters which might be more beneficial for nitrogen removal in iron containing biofilters the majority of nutrient and organic pollutants were removed in the iron scrap layers and more new generated pollutants appeared implying that iron triggered pollutants to experience more diverse degradation pathways additionally filter medium exhibited great effect on the microbial structure the bacteria belonging to phylum proteoabcteria and corresponding genera dominated in samples of ceramisite containing biofilters the iron scrap existence increased the bacteria abundances of phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes and provoked higher abundance of denitrification genera which contributed to the facilitating effect as well acknowledgements this study was financially supported by national natural science

19207,textile dyeing wastewater is characterized by low biodegradability and high nitrogen strength which is difficult to meet the increasingly stringent discharge requirements therefore the tertiary nutrient and refractory organics removal is considered and aerated biofilter is often adopted however the aerobic condition and carbon source shortage restrict tertiary biological nitrogen removal in this study iron scrap was introduced as the filter medium to enhance the pollutant removal capacity and three aerobic biofilters were constructed biofilter fe ce was filled with iron scrap and ceramisite biofilter fe ac was added with iron scrap and granular activated carbon and biofilter ce only had ceramisite to pad as control system after the biofilters were acclimatized by synthetic wastewater and actual dyeing wastewater the optimal operation parameters based on nitrogen removal were determined as ph 7 gas water ratio 5 1 hydraulic retention time 8 h and c n ratio 8 5 1 the iron scraps improved total nitrogen tn removal significantly with tn removal efficiency of 68 7 and 57 3 in biofilter fe ac and biofilter fe ce comparing with biofilter ce of 29 9 additionally phosphorus and cod had better removal performance as well when iron scrap existed further investigation interpreted the reason for iron s facilitating effect on tertiary nutrient and refractory organics removal the introduction of iron scrap made the habitat conditions such as ph values do concentrations and biomass contents inside the biofilters change towards the direction beneficial for pollutant elimination especially for nitrogen removal in iron containing biofilters the majority of nitrogen phosphorus and organic pollutants were removed in the iron scrap layers and more pollutants types appeared implying that iron triggered pollutants to go through more diverse degradation or transformation pathways moreover the phylum proteoabcteria dominated in samples of ceramisite containing biofilters with abundances more than 40 the iron scrap existence increased the abundances of phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes and triggered higher abundance of denitrification bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerated biofilter iron scrap tertiary treatment dyeing wastewater nitrogen removal 1 introduction the large scale textile industry in china produced a great proportion of wastewater discharge textile dyeing wastewaters are characterized not only by recalcitrant refractory and color inducing by the application of dyestuff auxiliaries and sizing agent but also by high nitrogen strength because of urea and ammonia utilization chang et al 2009 conventional technologies for textile dyeing wastewater treatment have been known as various combinations of biological physical and chemical methods for instance the hybrid methods including coagulation sedimentation anaerobic hydrolysis acidification anaerobic aerobic a o or anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o are widely adopted in current years the outlet water quality of many wastewater treatment plants wwtps cannot achieve the more and more stringent discharge standard moreover the urgent demanding for wastewater reuse in textile industry requests the improvement of the treated wastewater quality therefore the technology faces upgrading and reconstruction and the tertiary treatment unit for further removing organics and nutrients from textile wastewater secondary biological effluent is usually considered aerated biofilter is well known as an attached growth process on media which are stationary during normal operation with aeration it always consists of three phases a solid phase acting as the support media for microbial growth a liquid phase in which the solid material is submerged and a gas phase created by the input of air into the reactor mann et al 1999 the pollutant was biologically degraded by the fixed biofilm with physical filtration in a single reactor rogalla and bourbigot 1990 the biofilm formation on an inert granular media in biofilter allows for a much higher concentration of active biomass than a suspended growth activated sludge system so that the size of reactor can be reduced the suspended solids can be captured physically by the packing material and this eliminates the secondary clarifier chang et al 2009 moreover in the attached growth system aerobic and anaerobic anoxic conditions can exist simultaneously on account of the oxygen gradient within the biofilm and nitrogen removal is achieved via the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd process in a single reactor hwang and weng 2017 aerated biofilter system has been used for treating various wastewaters because of its high efficiency and low cost including industrial wastewater zhang et al 2015 domestic wastewater tao et al 2016 pharmaceutical wastewater priya and philip 2015 and even some refractory wastewater such as textile and oil field wastewater he et al 2013 zhao et al 2006 besides installation of biological filtration process for tertiary treatment is a practical alteration to update the wwtp liu et al 2008 and it is a good choice for dyeing wastewater tertiary treatment for further organic and nutrient removal as well it is easy to add the biofilter to an existing plant whereas little space is demanded and construction does not require any stoppage of or interference with operation of existing reactors ryu et al 2008 when aerated biofilter is used for tertiary nitrogen removal it was reported that the denitrification process was impeded when the feed cod tkn ratio less than 15 ryu et al 2008 for this reason a post denitrification biofilter process using external carbon source was proposed feo 2007 since the biological secondary effluent mainly constitutes of refractory pollutants which are hardly used as the denitrification carbon source for nitrogen removal in our previous study iron scrap has been verified to improve the nitrification efficiency in the aerobic stage and the dissolved ferric ions in the nitrification liquid were beneficial for the subsequent anoxic denitrification process during the advanced nitrogen removal treatment from dyeing wastewater chen et al 2016 moreover the aerobic denitrification process can be successfully initiated in the aerobic nitrification activated sludge system when iron scrap was added chen et al 2018 therefore the iron scrap application can benefit the biological nitrogen removal on the other hand the iron scrap mainly contains zero valent iron zvi 95 and other elements such as carbon chromium copper nickel and manganese the microscale galvanic cells are formed once the iron scrap being submerged in wastewater and the reduction and partial degradation of organic compounds will increase the organic biodegradability ma and zhang 2008 the other feature of iron scrap is the fairly large surface area making it have excellent mechanical and hydraulic characteristics as a filter medium ma and zhang 2008 consequently it can be speculated that iron scrap can be used as a filter medium in biofilter its application can improve the biodegradability of refractory pollutants resulting in an increased nitrogen and organic removal efficiency besides the microbial diversity and community distribution in biofilters affected by nutrient gradient operation condition and packing material will tightly relate to the pollutant removal performance a great diversity of microbes including proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi verrucomicrobia have been detected in biofilm showing a good ability of refractory pollutants removal and microbes such as nitrospirae are relate to nitrogen cycle islam et al 2015 once iron scrap was applied as the packing material along with the iron ions releasing do and proton in the wastewater will be consumed chien et al 2008 saheb et al 2008 which may change the ph value and do concentration inside the biofilters then the microbial structure may be accordingly altered additionally the packing material of iron scrap will attach microbes different from those on mediums of ce or gac and iron scrap itself and its released ions will change the microbial structure as well previous study revealed that iron scrap enhanced the abundance of aerobic denitrifiers such as bacteria genera of thauera thermomonas rhodobacter and hyphomicrobium in activated sludge system stimulating simultaneous nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions chen et al 2018 therefore the variation of microbial structure will make the biofilters have different pollutant removal performance apart from nitrogen removal the probable chemical depositions by iron ions in biofilter will strengthen the phosphorus eliminating from wastewater therefore the iron is expected to simultaneously facilitate the nutrient and refractory organics removal in the aerated biofilter for dyeing wastewater tertiary treatment in this study three various aerobic biofilters were constructed one was filled with iron and ceramisite biofilter fe ce one was added with iron and granular activated carbon biofilter fe ac the last one only used ceramisite to pad as control system biofilter ce the beneficial effect of iron application in biofilter on refractory organics and nutrient removal from real dyeing wastewater was verified firstly then the optimal operation parameters based on nitrogen removal was determined furthermore the reason for iron facilitating the organic and nutrient removal performance was interpreted via iron releasing and distributing pattern the habitat condition changes inside the biofilters and the microbial structure shifts after iron scrap was introduced in the biofilters 2 material and methods 2 1 iron ceramisite and granular activated carbon the iron ceramisite and granular activated carbon gac were used as the filter mediums in this study the iron used in this study was iron scrap for its abundant local supply and relatively low cost which came from the waste of lathe cutting with length of 50 100 mm and shape of spiral bending fig s1 see supporting information si before the experiment the iron scraps were washed and immersed in naoh 0 2 m for 24 h to remove the surface oil the composition of this iron scrap was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkinelmer optima 2100 dv usa after being digested by nitric acid and the result was shown in table s1 see si the ceramisite was supplied by henan boda ceramisite technology co ltd with diameter ranging from 2 to 4 mm the gac were purchased from shandong nanke co ltd with diameters ranging from 2 5 to 3 5 mm the porosity of iron scraps ceramisite and gac were 80 8 41 2 and 42 4 and their surface areas were 0 25 4 2 and 925 m2 g respectively 2 2 biofilters construction and acclimatization three biofilters were designed as exhibited in fig 1 it was constructed as a cylinder with an internal diameter of 100 mm and a height of 1500 mm the supporting layer with pore size of 3 mm and pore distance of 5 mm was set 100 mm away from the bottom of the biofilter the filtration beds of the three biofilters were packed with different filtration mediums on the supporting layer biofilter ce was packed with ceramsite with an initial height of 1000 mm biofilter fe ce was vertically divided into two parts by a middle supporting layer the upper part with height of 500 mm was packed with ceramsite while the other part with the same height was filled with iron scraps biofilter fe ac was stuffed with the gac instead of ceramsite in the upper layer and the lower layer used iron scrap as well for biofilter ce five wastewater sampling valves were placed every 200 mm on the filter column and another one was set at the middle layer at height of 500 mm for biofilters fe ce and fe ac two wastewater sampling valves were placed every 200 mm on iron scrap layer and one sampling valve was set at the middle supporting layer 10 mm below above the middle supporting layer five wastewater sampling valves were uniformly set every 100 mm meanwhile the biomass sampling valves with diameter of 20 mm were set at the opposite of the wastewater sampling valves on these three biofilters raw water and air was infiltrated through the bottom of the filtration bed via peristaltic pump and air compressor and the filtration medium were kept submersing by tuning the opening degree of the outlet valve at the initial stage of biofilter acclimatization the synthetic wastewater was used for biofilm rapid growth the main water quality parameters of the influent were as follows cod using sodium acetate 350 400 mg l nh3 n 25 30 mg l soluble orthophosphorus sop 2 4 mg l the other components of the synthetic wastewater were described in the supporting information si table s2 and the influent ph was adjusted to 7 5 0 2 the synthetic wastewater rich in nutrients was used for biofilm natural growth without sludge seeding the wastewater and the air were pumped at the bottom of the filtration bed and the ratio of gas volume to water volume was set as 10 1 at the beginning small influent flow of 1 l h was continuously supplied at the bottom of the filtration bed which was beneficial for cellular growth and immobilization then the influent flow was increased to 2 l d and was raised by 1 l d every 2 days after the influent flow was 4 l d and the removal of cod and nh3 n achieved stable the biofilm was considered to form successfully subsequently the real secondary effluent of dyeing wastewater which was withdrawn from a dyeing wastewater treatment plant in shaoxing of china was pumped to these biofilters for biofilm acclimatization the characteristics of the influent wastewater were cod 43 120 mg l nh3 n 15 18 mg l tn 16 20 mg l sop 0 8 1 2 mg l and ph 7 7 5 to alleviate the adverse effect of real dyeing wastewater on the biofilm and to accommodate the biofilm to the dyeing wastewater quality the biofilter effluent was turned back as the influent and was circulated for 5 days after three circulating batch runs the cod and nh3 n were both removed more than 80 and a total of 28 days was cost in the whole period of biofilm growth and acclimatization 2 3 experiments of optimal operation conditions determination for nitrogen removal after the first stage of biofilter acclimatization was finished the main parameters affecting the nitrogen removal were optimized at the second stage such as ph value gas water ratio hydraulic retention time hrt and c n ratio when considering the effect of ph value the ph of the influent wastewater was adjusted to 5 6 7 8 and 9 and the other operation conditions were set as gas water ratio 5 1 hrt 8 h and c n 6 the effluent of nh3 n and tn concentrations were detected and the optimal ph value was selected when taking account of the optimal gas water ratio ratios of 0 1 1 3 1 5 1 and 7 1 were chosen the ph value was set as the optimal one and the hrt and c n were fixed as 8 h and 6 respectively similarly the optimal hrt and c n were determined using the similar procedure according to the literature li et al 2016 the hrt was calculated as follows h r t 24 v n q where hrt hydraulic retention time h v volume of the filling medium in the column ml n porosity of the filling medium q water volume feeding into the column in the 24 h ml during this period after changing the value of one parameter the removal efficiency will vary samples were taken every 8 h after at least four hrt cycles being experienced when the removal efficiency of cod tn and tp reached stable the average value of three stable removal rates stands for the performance of biofilter under the condition of specific parameter value then changing to another value and similar procedure was adopted a total of about 100 days will be taken to investigate the optimal operation parameters then the third stage for observing the stable operation performance and mechanism investigation was carried out for another 45 d 2 4 sampling method during the stable operation stage samples of wastewater and biomass from the filling medium at different layer heights of the biofilter were taken before sampling the cod tn and tp in effluent were measured to confirm the system stable operation the iron content in wastewater and in biomass the ph value the do concentration the biomass content and the organics nitrogen phosphorus removal with the layer height were tested when sampling the wastewater as shown in fig 1 the wastewater sampling valve at the bottom of the biofilter was open firstly and the wastewater flew naturally to a conical bottle after collecting wastewater of about 40 ml the sampling valve was immediately closed same procedure was operated from the bottom valve to the top one and wastewater samples at different heights could be collected within 5 min do concentration and ph value of the wastewater were tested immediately when sampling the biomass for measuring iron content in biomass and biomass content the biomass on packing material was taken from biomass sampling valves before sampling the influent of the biofilter was stopped temporarily and the valves were open then the sample spoon was dipped into the biofilter center and extracted the packing material with biomass from the top valve to the bottom one 2 5 analytical methods the dry biomass concentration in biofilter was determined by means of the weight difference of a packing material sample dried at 105 c overnight and calcined at 500 c for 1 h the result was express as mg biomass cm3 the amounts of fe3 and fe2 containing in wastewater samples were directly determined by the phenanthroline spectrophotometric method using a uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 35 the biomass samples were scraped from the filter mediums and were digested using nitric acid before total iron ions detection via inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer icp prodigy leeman usa and the content of iron ion in biomass was expressed as mg g biomass the analysis of the microbial community was conducted by illumina miseq sequencing technique for it can generate a large number of sequences the biomass samples for microbial analysis were grabbed from biofilter ce and the upper layers and lower layers of biofilter fe ce and fe ac the sample sites were depicted in fig s2 in si the obtained five samples were used for dna extraction and microbial analysis the detail procedures were in si the cod nh3 n no3 n no2 n tn mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solid mlvss analyses were conducted according to standard methods apha 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 the biofilm growth and acclimazation of the biofilters firstly the synthetic wastewater was used for biofilm rapid growth the cod and nh3 n removal efficiency were detected every day to assess the biofilm growth state as shown in fig 2 a the cod had low removal efficiency at the beginning which was probably due to the adsorption by filtration medium then the cod removal capacities increased rapidly with acclimatization time at 4 6 days the cod in effluent of biofilters fe ce and fe ac was only about 25 30 mg l which was much lower than that of biofilter ce 80 105 mg l after that the removal efficiency of iron containing biofilters decreased slightly probably due to the saturated adsorption capacity with respect to nh3 n removal as shown in fig 2 c about 40 was removed at the initial stage probably attributing to adsorption by filtration medium when the adsorption achieved saturation the effluent nh3 n concentration became high afterwards and then the effluent nh3 n became less with accumulating time when compared with the cod removal the increasing of nh3 n removal rate was slow than that of cod with time the probable reason was the competition between the low growth rate autotrophic nitrifying bacteria and the heterotrophic bacteria dominated on the biofilm gÃ¡lvez et al 2003 with the influent flow increasing at the end of synthetic wastewater domestication period the effluent cod achieved relatively stable with average removal efficiency of about 80 and the nitrogen efficiency of biofilter fe ac fe ce and ce reached 67 8 65 5 and 57 5 respectively revealing that the biofilm was formed successfully and the iron scraps application was in favor of nitrification process then the real secondary dyeing wastewater with initial nh3 n concentration of 16 mg l was pumped into the biofilters and the nh3 n removal efficiency decreased to nearly 50 at the end of the first batch run fig 2 d the relative low nh3 n removal behavior manifested that the nitrification was inhibited to some extent by the real dyeing wastewater after 3 circulating batch runs all the biofilters had nitrification efficiencies of more than 85 implying that the nitrification was initiated successfully additionally fig 2 c showed that the effluent cod of biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac was 17 9 15 6 and 14 5 mg l respectively since both cod and nh3 n had removal efficiencies more than 80 at the end of the third batch run it could be considered that the biofilm was successfully formed 3 2 operation parameters optimization for nitrogen removal 3 2 1 optimal ph value determination after the biofilters acclimatization was finished main parameters affecting the removal of nutrients and organic matter were optimized using the real secondary effluent of dyeing wastewater such as ph value gas water ratio hrt and c n ratio for the nitrogen removal is difficult and complicated the optimal operation conditions were determined based on the nitrogen removal performance under the conditions of gas water ratio 5 hrt 8 h and c n 6 the effect of initial ph value on nitrogen removal was shown in fig 3 a nitrate was the main nitrogen species in the effluent of all three biofilters and the concentrations of nh3 n and no2 n were very low the tn removal efficiency increased first and then decreased with the initial ph value increasing in all these biofilters the best tn removal efficiency of biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac appearing at ph value of 7 were 20 9 50 1 and 56 8 respectively manifesting that neutral ph value and iron scrap application benefited the nitrogen removal 3 2 2 optimal gas water ratio determination the do concentration of the wastewater determined by gas water ratio in the biofilters is an important factor affecting the performance of nitrogen removal in this study different gas water ratios of 0 1 1 3 1 5 1 and 7 1 were selected when fixing the optimal ph value of 7 the hrt of 8 h and c n of 6 as exhibited in fig 3 b when the gas water ratio was 0 the do concentrations in the biofilters were severely inadequate and the nitrification process was not thoroughly completed the no2 n was the main nitrogen species in the effluent of these biofilters with the gas water ratio increasing from 0 to 7 1 the nitrification efficiency enhanced due to the increasing oxygen supplying and the percentage of no3 n concentration of the effluent raised the tn removal efficiency increased with the gas water ratio rising however further increasing its ratio decreased the tn removal capacity which probably resulted from the excess oxygen breaking the anoxic zone for denitrification with respect to biofilter ce the best tn removal efficiency 25 1 appeared at gas water ratio of 3 1 for biofilter fe ce tn removal efficiency achieved the maximal of 49 1 at gas water ratio of 5 1 when the gas water ratio was in the range of 3 1 to 7 1 the biofilter fe ac had relatively stable tn removal efficiencies of more than 60 the biofliter fe ac could accommodate a wide range of gas water ratio and its nitrogen removal performance was more stable and efficient than that of biofilter ce or fe ce since all the biofilters had comparatively good nitrogen removal efficiency at the gas water ratio of 5 1 it was selected as the optimal ratio 3 2 3 optimal hrt determination the hrt determines the contacting time of wastewater to the microbes and the thickness of biofilm in this study hrts of 1 2 4 6 and 8 h were taken into consideration and the determined optimal ph value of 7 and gas water ratio of 5 were fixed as denoted in fig 3 c when the hrt was short as 1 h the nh3 n removal efficiencies were 71 3 82 4 and 90 6 and the tn removal efficiencies were 5 9 17 3 and 26 7 in biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac respectively in general short hrt means a high hydraulic loading the heterotrophic bacteria with relative high growth rate will out compete the autotrophic nitrifying bacteria with low growth rate in addition short hrt made the bacteria have insufficient reaction time to utilize the nitrogen species via assimilation pathway moreover short hrt along with strong hydraulic shear force may cause the biofilm thinning or detaching resulting in the do permeating to the inner biofilm and ruining the anaerobic habitat of denitrifiers growth consequently the nh3 n and tn removal was relatively low under the condition of short hrt with the hrt increasing the better tn removal efficiency was obtained and the tn removal efficiencies of biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac were 21 5 49 4 and 59 4 at hrt of 8 h it was obvious that iron scrap facilitated the nitrogen removal and using gac as the filter medium could further enhance the removal capacity under the same hrt condition biofilter fe ac always had the best nitrogen removal performance and the tn removal efficiencies followed the order of fe ac fe ce ce the htr of 8 h was selected to obtain better removal efficiency 3 2 4 optimal c n ratio determination based on the above optimal ph value gas water ratio and hrt the effect of c n ratio on nitrogen removal were investigated the initial cod and tn in the secondary effluent used in this experiment were 108 and 17 4 mg l respectively making the c n ratio of 6 2 then certain amounts of ammonium chloride or sodium acetate were added to the influent to make the c n ratios as 4 5 8 5 and 11 5 fig 4 profiled the concentrations of influent cod codi influent tn tni and effluent tn tne in all biofilters at the various c n ratios in biofilter ce the tn removal efficiency enhanced remarkably from 11 2 to 25 1 when c n ratio increased from 4 5 to 6 2 and the removal amount of total nitrogen was 2 6 mg l and 4 3 mg l under the same influent cod concentration 108 mg l suggesting that small part of organics in the secondary effluent of dyeing wastewater can be used as the heterotrophic denitrification carbon source however further enhancing c n ratio to 8 5 or 11 5 could not improve the tn removal efficiency significantly implying that the denitrification capacity in biofilter ce was very limited after iron scrap was applied the tn removal rates in biofilters fe ac and fe ce were much higher than that of biofilter ce at c n ratio of 4 5 or 6 2 indicating that the denitrification capacity became much stronger and more organics in the secondary effluent of dyeing wastewater could be used as the denitrification carbon source the tn removal efficiency increased to 41 9 and 61 6 for biofilter fe ce and fe ac at c n ratio of 6 2 when the carbon source amount was further increased c n of 8 5 the tn removal efficiency kept improving however continuously increasing the c n ratio from 8 5 to 11 5 did not bring significant enhancement and the optimal nitrogen removal was achieved at c n of 8 5 with tn removal efficiencies of 57 3 and 68 7 for biofilter fe ce and fe ac respectively when c n ratio was less than 8 5 carbon source was the limiting factor affecting the tn removal which demonstrated that heterotrophic denitrification process played an important role moreover since the oxygen was pumped to the biofilter system aerobic denitrification might be occurred which was consistent with our previous study that the iron scrap could robustly stimulate simultaneous aerobic nitrification and denitrification process chen et al 2018 as mentioned above the optimal operation conditions for nitrogen removal were determined as ph value 7 gas water ratio 5 1 hrt 8 h and c n 8 5 under the optimal operation conditions the cod removal percentages were 76 0 1 1 81 6 1 5 and 84 5 1 8 and the sop removal efficiencies were 62 7 96 4 and 97 3 for biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac respectively after optimizing the operation conditions the pollutants removal performance was tracked for another 45 d in the third stage and the removal efficiency was consistently stable during this period as shown in fig s3 it was obvious that iron scrap facilitated the removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorus in the biofilters and the application of gac could further enhance the removal capacity 3 3 how does iron scrap facilitate the pollutant removal pollutants cod nitrogen and phosphate showed better removal performance in biofilters of fe ce and fe ac than that in biofilter ce mainly attributing to the iron supplementation although the iron scraps were filled in the lower layer of the biofilter the released iron ions would flow and distribute in the whole filter layer the do and proton in the wastewater will be consumed during iron ion releasing process which will change the ph value and do concentration making the microbial growth habitat condition inside the biofilters different even under the same influent conditions furthermore the released iron ions and the altered microbial growth conditions might impact the microbial structure of the biofilter therefore the iron supplementation might change the pollutant removal behavior and the probable reason as assumed above will be discussed the wastewater samples and biomass samples were taken at different layer height in the third operation stage as mentioned in part 2 4 before sampling for biofilters fe ac fe ce and ce the detected cod removal efficiencies were 86 3 81 5 and 73 4 the tn removal efficiencies were 67 8 58 1 and 27 5 and the sop removal rates were 100 99 4 and 64 5 respectively the pollutants removal kept stable then samples at different site were taken 3 3 1 change of habitat condition inside the biofilter induced by iron scrap the content of iron ions in the wastewater is a dynamic process the zvi in iron scraps released iron ions constantly and the released ions will participate in the reactions such as bacteria utilization hydrolysis and precipitation the iron ion concentrations in the wastewater at different layer height of biofilter fe ce and fe ac were detected as illustrated in fig 5 a in the iron scrap layer the total released ions remarkablly increased with the layer height and only tiny fe2 was tested the highest total iron ions concentrations at layer height of 500 mm in biofilter fe ce and fe ac were 1 9 and 1 7 mg l respectively then the iron ions decreased dramatically espeacially at height of 500 600 mm which might attribute to the ferric irons precipitation and the biofilm retaining effect the efflunt total iron ion concentration was only about 0 8 mg l it can be seen that the free iron ions in wastewater was low througout the whole biofliter layer apart from the free iron ions measured in the wastewater content of the released iron ions which might be precipitated and retained in the biofilms was tested as shown in fig 5 a the iron content increased significantly with the iron scrap layer height and then decreased in the upper layer the highest concentrations reached up to 31 2 and 33 6 mg g biomass at layer height of 500 mm in biofilter fe ce and fe ac respectively the much higher iron content in the biofilm than that in the wastewater suggested that most of the released iron ion was trapped by the biofilm with the biofilter height increasing the iron content in the ce or gac layer decreased sharply showing similar rule as the free iron ions in wastewater additionally the iron ions in wastewater and biofilm of biofilter ce were less than 0 2 mg l and 1 1 mg g biomass respectively data not shown it can be seen that the iron ions were unevenly distributed in the biofilters and the released ions in the biofilter fe ac was littler higer than that in biofilter fe ce along with the iron ions releasing process the proton and oxygen will be consumed chien et al 2008 saheb et al 2008 making the ph values and do concentrations inside the three biofilters vary then correspondingly altering the microbial growth such as biomass content as depicted in fig 5 b the ph values all increased after the wastewater entered the biofilters and iron scrap application made the ph values higher than that in biofilter ce for biofilters containing iron scrap the micro electrolysis reaction will occur in the iron scrap layer under the neutral aerobic condition the reactions as equations 1 3 would happen which made the ph increase to about 8 5 when the wastewater passed through the iron scrap layer as reported in the literature ph value around 8 0 was in favor of the aerobic denitrification process chen et al 2018 ji et al 2015 with respect to do concentration fig 5 c it was gradually increased with the layer height mainly due to that the longer gas water contacting time makes more oxygen be dissolved in the wastewater and the high gas water ratio allows the oxygen dissolving rate over microbes consuming rate when iron scraps exist oxygen will be consumed during the iron releasing process as equations 1 3 which resulted in the do concentration less in iron containing biofilters fe ce and fe ac at the height of 400 mm in biofilter ce the do concentration achieved 1 4 mg l while only 0 9 and 0 7 mg l at the height of 500 mm in biofilters fe ce and fe ac do is one of the major factors responsible for nitrification and denitrification after achieving good nitrification rate increasing do concentration will inhibit the denitrification because of the competition between electron accepters nitrate and oxygen liu et al 2008 therefore the local anaerobic or anoxic zone will form more easily in iron containing biofilters which benefits the anaerobic denitrification as illustrated in fig 5 d the biomass content in biofilter ce declined along with the layer height and the highest biomass content of 1 2 g cm3 appeared at layer height of 200 mm in biofilters fe ce and fe ac the biomass in iron layer decreased slightly with height and the contents were less than that in biofilter ce at the same layer height which might result from the smaller specific surface area of iron scraps than that of ce in the upper layer of biofilter fe ce and fe ac since the larger specific surface for microbial growth was provided the biomass content raised to 0 9 1 g cm3 at layer height of 600 mm the general trend of biomass contents in the upper layers of the three biofilters was reduced with height due to nutrient substances depleting however iron scrap containing biofilters had higher biomass contents which was probably induced by the fact that iron ions existing in the biomass promote the microbial growth zou et al 2014 furthermore the gac layer with larger specific surface area accumulated more biomass as analyzed above the introduction of iron scrap made the habitat condition inside the biofilter towards the direction beneficial for pollutant elimination especially for nitrogen removal 1 fe 2e fe2 2 o2 h2o 4e 4oh 3 4fe2 o2 4h 2h2o 4fe3 3 3 2 removal behavior of nutrient and organics with height the application of iron scrap has been approved to facilitate the pollutants removal capacity especially tn removal however which layer iron scrap layer ce or gac layer made the main contribution to pollutant removal was still ambiguous therefore the removal behavior of nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter was investigated with the biofilter bed height during the third stage of stable operation 3 3 2 1 nitrogen and phosphorus transformation with bed height as depicted in fig 6 a the nh3 n concentration in biofilter ce decreased sharply from 16 2 to 1 35 mg l and no3 n concentration increased rapidly from the biofilter bottom to the height of 400 mm in the biofilter ce the overwhelming majority of nh3 n was transferred to no3 n which meant that the nitrification was happened successfully in this height range from the height of 400 1000 mm the generated no3 n only had little dropping about 29 5 of tn was removed in the whole biofilter ce which might ascribe the removal to the bacteria assimilation and the weak denitrification in the biofilters fe ce and fe ac remarkable tn decreasing was happened in the iron scrap layer as shown in fig 6 b c almost all the nh3 n was removed and the tn concentration declined from 17 6 to 7 9 and 6 7 mg l in the iron scrap layer of biofilter fe ce and fe ac respectively when compared with the biofilter ce the primary difference is that the produced no3 n from nh3 n was much less in the height of 0 500 mm as discussed above the do concentration in iron containing biofilter was lower than that in biofilter ce fig 5 c this made the anaerobic zone exist more easily and the organic matters were consumed more slowly inside the biofilm of fe ce and fe ac than those in biofilter ce which agreed the local anaerobic denitrification to occur moreover it was reported that denitrification process could be promoted by the fe3 chen et al 2016 zou et al 2014 thus the denitrification occurring in these biofilters might be enhanced by the retained iron ions in biofilm previous study found that the iron scrap would even stimulate aerobic denitrification making snd happen under the aerobic condition chen et al 2018 therefore the local anaerobic denitrification and possible aerobic denitrification contributed to the tn declining in the iron scrap layer at the height of 500 1000 mm the tn concentration still had a little declining with the final tn concentrations in effluent of biofilters fe ce and fe ac 7 5 and 5 5 mg l respectively and the corresponding tn removal efficiencies were 57 4 and 68 7 therefore the application of iron scrap brought about significant simultaneous nitrification and denitrification progress and gac can further enhance the nitrogen removal when compared with biofilter fe ce apart from nitrogen removal the sop removal behavior as shown in fig 6 d revealed that the removal efficiency in biofilters containing iron scrap 97 was much higher than that in biofilter ce 62 7 besides the sop removal happened in different zones of the biofilters in biofilter ce the sop was gradually removed with the filter height and the bacteria assimilation might be the main reason for its removal while in biofilter fe ce and fe ac almost all the sop was removed in the iron scrap layer which was mainly attributed to the chemical precipitation by fe3 releasing from the iron scrap in conclusion the nitrogen and phosphorus removal mainly happened in the iron scrap layer in the biofilters fe ce and fe ac and iron scrap application promoted their removal efficiencies 3 3 2 2 organic pollutant removal behavior with bed height the performances of organic pollutants removal by the biofilters were explored as shown in fig 7 the removal rate of cod was high in the height of 0 400 mm in the biofilter ce and became slow in the height of 400 1000 mm for biofilters containing iron scrap fe ce and fe ac the cod decreased as well in the iron scrap layer 0 500 mm but with the removal rate lower than that of biofilter ce the probable reason was that the iron scrap layer had less biomass content and lower do concentration as demonstrated above noteworthy the cod removal rate rose abruptly at the height of 500 600 mm it was speculated that the organic contaminant was broken to the degradable molecule in the iron scrap which was then rapidly decomposed by the microbes attaching on the biofilm in the upper packing layer since zero valent iron as a general reactant could degrade various environmental contaminants from wastewater and groundwater due to its high reductive capacity thus the removal of pollution by single zero valent iron scraps was considered the experiment was set similarly as the iron scrap layer but excluding the microbial effect and the details were described in the supporting information the result showed that about 35 cod was removed by single iron scrap and tn concentration had no obvious decreasing considering that about 60 cod was removed in the iron scrap layer in biofilters fe ce and fe ac microorganism on biofilm made another 25 cod removal therefore both iron chemical reaction and microbial biodegradation responded for organics removal in iron scrap layer however the nitrogen removal mainly related to microbial effect as to biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac the final effluent cod concentrations were 36 0 27 5 and 23 2 mg l respectively indicating that iron scrap utilization could enhance the organic pollutant removal capacity to further reveal the organics removal details in the three biofilters samples from the middle layer at the height of 500 mm named as sample m and the final effluent at the height of 1000 mm named as sample f were taken out to detect via gc ms as depicted in fig 7 b the peaks number and the peaks intensity declined remarkably after the treatment by aerated biofilter the 28 types of pollutants were detected in influent as summarized in table s3 in si after being treated the 24 kinds of pollutants disappeared and could not be detected in sample ms and sample fs of all the three biofilters notably the tetrahydrofuran was found in all the samples and its removal efficiencies via semi quantitative analysis based on peak intensity were summarized in table 1 lin et al 2016 in biofilter ce only 14 2 of tetrahydrofuran was removed in the lower layer 0 500 mm and the total removal rate was 53 9 however its removal capacity was promoted significantly in the iron containing biofilters approximately 90 was eliminated in the lower iron scrap layer 0 500 mm and no obvious removal in the upper filter layer in addition three other pollutants 2 4 5 trimethylbenzaldehyde 2 4 diisocyanato 1 methylbenzene and dibenzyl ether had relative high peak intensity in the influent and their removal rates ranged from 80 5 to 92 1 without dramatical variations in the three biofilters when comparing the sample ms and sample fs with the influent new organics were generated as exhibited in table 1 there were 13 16 and 19 kinds of new pollutants appearing in the biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac respectively mainly consisting of oxygen containing substances with long chains and rings it was observed that iron scrap triggered more new pollutant species produced among these new generated pollutants there were 6 organics species being detected in all the biofilters with dotted box in table 1 which meant that some pollutants might have similar degradation pathway in the different biofilter systems when comparing the composition of new generated pollutant species in sample m and sample f biofilter ce contained 6 kinds of same organic substances in sample m and sample f and the number was only 3 and 5 in biofilter fe ce and fe ac respectively that is to say the proportions of same new generated pollutants number accounting for total emerging organics species were 46 2 18 8 and 26 3 in biofilter ce fe ce and fe ac therefore the iron containing biofilter systems present great diversity of pollutant types which suggested that the introduction of iron triggered more diversity of pollutants degradation or transformation pathways in current years the effluent total organics concentration using cod as the indicator is still the primary concern in the discharge standard and some pollutants with industry characteristics and high toxicity were gradually limited in the effluent discharge although the concentration of effluent cod is low after wastewater treatment the toxic substances with low concentration left in the wastewater or new pollutants generated in the treatment process may still present potential risk to the ecological environment the pollutant toxicity is related to structure and concentration as analysis above in the iron containing biofilters the effluent cod was lower than that of biofilter ce fig 7 a and more new organic species were generated table 1 which meant that the concentration of each pollutant might be much lower therefore the likelihood of environmental risks will reduce when considering the pollutant concentration however the pollutants species increases the potential toxicity to environment after tertiary treatment needs pay attention in future research 3 3 3 microbial structure microorganisms play key roles in the organics and nutrient removal during biological treatment process to further explore the effect of iron on microbial structure and analyze its contribution to the different performances of variation biofilters a comprehensive investigation of the microbial community between biofilter fe ce fe ac and ce was conducted using illumina miseq sequencing technique the biomass samples were taken from the upper and lower layers of biofilters fe ac and fe ce and the layer of biofilter ce as shown in fig s2 which were named as sample a b c d and e the results of shannon index chao value and ace value summarized in table s4 in si showed that the microbial diversity and richness was higher when the iron scraps existed in the biofilters from the venn analysis as illustrated in fig s4 the structure and composition of microbial species changed remarkably and only 69 operational taxonomic units otus or 0 88 of the total out 7857 3 distance were shared by these samples the bacteria abundances on phylum level were exhibited in fig 8 twelve phyla were detected in these samples and their sum accounted for more than 96 of the total reads the detailed abundance information on phylum class order family and genus levels was summarized in table s5 in si from the principle component analysis pca based on phylum abundance data fig 8 b the result unclosed that pc1 and pc2 explained 55 2 and 34 7 of total bacterial community variations respectively indicating that the bacteria compositions on phyla level were significantly altered specifically when the biofilters contained ceramsite samples c d and e had more similarities containing the proteobacteria as the main phylum with abundances of 43 0 47 8 and 54 5 respectively which were much higher than that in biofilter fe ac with abundances of 21 9 and 24 3 in sample a and b while chloroflexi was more abundant in sample a and firmicutes was dominated in sample b in the upper layers of biofilters fe ac and fe ce sample a and sample c the community structures were various which resulted from the different packing materials however the same iron scrap layers in biofilter fe ac and fe ce sample b and sample d also exhibited diverse community components which inferred that the upper layer might have impact on it the iron scraps containing iron carbon and other metals were submerged in the wastewater and microscale galvanic cells were formed this might evoke the accumulation of electrochemically active bacteria involving electron transferring such as firmicutes acidobacteria actinobacteria shown in fig 8 a wang et al 2016 moreover in biofilter fe ac the larger scale galvanic cells between the upper gac layer and the lower iron layer might be formed and the activity of electron transferring might be improved as seen in fig 8 a b the firmicutes became the dominant phylum with abundance of 38 8 in iron scrap layer of biofilter fe ac this may explain the microbial community variation between sample b and d as shown in table 2 the genus belonging to phylum proteobacteria had higher abundance in sample c d and e in sample e u o xanthomonadales belonging to phylum proteobacteria accounted for the most abundance in biofliter ce 13 38 of total reads which are polyaromatic hydrocarbon pah degraders islam et al 2015 additionally the abundances of pseudomonas u f rhodobacteraceae nitrosomonas and hyphomicrobium belonging to phylum proteobacteria accounted for 6 63 4 66 1 93 and 2 06 respectively the genus of pseudomonas was reported to have abilities of pollutants degradation nitrification and denitrification u f rhodobacteraceae is a member of family rhodobacteraceae which was highly collected with hydrocarbon degradation the nitrosomonas is a genus of chemoautotrophic bacteria oxidizing ammonia into nitrite which is important in the nitrogen cycle nakagawa and takahashi 2015 in sample of lower layer in fe ce sample d the genera of ochrobactrum desulfovibrio and hydrogenophaga belonging to phylum proteobacteria were dominated with abundances of 9 39 4 06 and 2 85 bacteria of ochrobactrum genus can be isolated from soil and sewage it can degrade a wide variety of chemical substances and reduce nitrites to atmospheric nitrogen poddbniak and jafra 2009 genus of hydrogenophaga that are frequently detected in textile wastewater treatment plant are nitrate reducing bacteria gan et al 2011 wang et al 2014 in sample c fe ce upper layer bacteria of genera belonging to phylum proteobacteria contained pseudomonas 2 82 hyphomonas 2 60 woodsholea 2 49 hydrogenophaga 2 38 rhodovulum 2 13 lysobacter 1 29 bradyrhizobium 1 09 and piscinibacter 1 09 totally accounting for 15 88 genues hyphomonas as a member of family hyphomonadaceae most species of which are able to reduce nitrate and are believed to play an important role in the mineralization of dissolved organic matter alain et al 2008 abraham et al 1997 pertinent to activated carbon containing biofilter the genus composition had remarkable alteration in sample of lower layer of fe ac the main genera ochrobactrum 5 04 ralstonia 3 80 helicobacter 5 40 and desulfovibrio 1 32 were belonged to proteobacteria aerobic bacteria ralstonia was reported to be related to fe ii oxidizing which implied that the detected fe3 in wastewater or biomass not only came from the abiotic iron releasing induced by oxygen but also ascribed to the effect of biotic bacteria ferrous oxidizing percak dennett et al 2017 as to sample of upper layer of fe ac only pseudomonas phodovulum and woodsholea were the members of proteobacteria with the abundance more than 1 it should be noted that the genus nitrospirae accumulating in samples b d and e responded for nitrification daims et al 2015 its abundance decreased dramatically in sample a and c but with the high nitrification efficiency implying that other related nitrifying bacteria might be responsible for nitrification in iron scrap layer furthermore the phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes other than proteobacteria dominated in iron scrap layers especially in biofilter fe ac with abundances of 20 9 and 38 80 as depicted in fig 8 members of these two phyla are thought to degrade complex organic matters and demonstrated to have denitrification activity tang et al 2009 wang et al 2016 lee et al 2013 the alistipes and rikenalla were the main genera belonging to family rikenellaceae under phylum bacteroidetes in the sample of lower layer of fe ac species of these two genera can ferment carbohydrates to complex organic acids and they were usually found in the human or animal clinical specimens according to previous researches su et al 2014 han et al 2017 however the reason for these genera accumulating in lower layer of biofilter fe ac needs further explanation in lower layer of fe ce u o bacteroidales and sediminibacterium were main genera belonging to phylum bacteroidetes and genus sediiminibacterium is iron oxidizing bacteria and can oxide the ferrous wang et al 2014 as to phylum firmicutes in lower layer of fe ac the u f lachnospiraceae lachnoclostridium and lachnospiraceae nk4a136 group were the main detected genera belonging to family lachnospiraceae and the ruminiclostridium 6 ruminiclostridium 5 and ruminococcaceae ucg 014 belong to family ruminococcaceae the total abundance of these genera accounted for 23 67 however the lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae are two of the most abundant families from the order clostridiales which are found in the mammalian gut environment and have been associated with the maintenance of gut health biddle et al 2013 why did they have a much accumulation in the iron scrap layer and their functions in wastewater treatment needs to explore additionally the phylum of actinobacteria in the iron scrap layer of fe ce had higher abundance 18 24 than that of other biofilters which mainly consisted of genera leucobacter ilumatobacter and candidatus microthrix species of genus leucobacter was reported to own denitrification capacity weon et al 2012 as analyzed above the genera relating to denitrification such as ochrobactrum hydrogenophaga and leucobacter had much higher abundance in ion scrap layers than those in other samples which contributed to the total nitrogen removal in iron scrap layer as well therefore the diverse microbial communities of these three biofilters referred to their different pollutant removal performances 4 conclusion three various aerated biofilters were used for tertiary simultaneous nutrient and refractory organics removal from real dyeing wastewater the introduction of iron scrap as the filter medium was verified to facilitate the pollutant removal efficiency especially the tn removal under the determined optimal operation conditions that is ph 7 gas water ratio 5 1 hydraulic retention time 8 h and c n ratio 8 5 1 the tn removal efficiency achieved 68 7 57 3 and 29 9 in biofilter fe ac biofilter fe ce and biofilter ce respectively the phosphorus and cod had better removal performance as well when iron scrap existed further investigation revealed the reason for iron s facilitating effect the application of iron scrap changed the habitat conditions such as ph values do concentrations and biomass contents inside the biofilters which might be more beneficial for nitrogen removal in iron containing biofilters the majority of nutrient and organic pollutants were removed in the iron scrap layers and more new generated pollutants appeared implying that iron triggered pollutants to experience more diverse degradation pathways additionally filter medium exhibited great effect on the microbial structure the bacteria belonging to phylum proteoabcteria and corresponding genera dominated in samples of ceramisite containing biofilters the iron scrap existence increased the bacteria abundances of phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes and provoked higher abundance of denitrification genera which contributed to the facilitating effect as well acknowledgements this study was financially supported by national natural science

19208,mixing should be optimized in anaerobic digestion ad systems to achieve excellent biomaterials production in the sewage sludge ss management in wastewater treatment plant ad depends on the coordinated activity of hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis however the effect of mixing intensity on characteristics of hydrolysis and acidification in ad of ss is still poorly understood this study focused on the mixing intensity 30 60 90 and 120 rpm effect on the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom and the key microorganisms in the hydrolysis and acidification of ss results showed that enhanced hydrolysis and acidification efficiency was obtained at mixing of 90 and 120 rpm p 0 05 while the maximum acetic acid 388 21 mg l was produced at 90 rpm mixing at 90 rpm enhanced the release of protein and polysaccharide as well as humic acid further analyses of dom molecular features revealed that 90 rpm led to the highest molecular diversity and easily biodegradable molecules lipid and proteins amino sugars which contributed to the maximum hydrolysis and acidification efficiency firmicutes and actinobacteria significantly increased with mixing intensity p 0 05 and chloroflexi and fusobacteria were enriched at mixing of 90 rpm which favored the hydrolysis of ss the enrichment of clostridium xi and clostridium sensu stricto contributed to the acidification of dom at 90 and 120 rpm the results of this study can advance our knowledge about mixing intensity effects on the ad systems of ss this research also showed how increasing mixing intensity to a relatively high speed can enhance the hydrolysis and acidification efficiency of ss graphical abstract image 1 keywords mixing intensity dissolved organic matter fluorescent component molecular characteristic bacterial community dynamics 1 introduction large amount of sewage sludge ss is generated all over the world and its management has become a significant issue in wastewater treatment plants wwtps because of economic and environmental concerns anaerobic digestion ad the most efficient and best known process for treating ss can recover useful biomaterials or energy and is fast becoming a preferred strategy for the carbon neutral operation of wwtps xu et al 2017 de vrieze and verstraete 2016 prior to biomaterials or energy recovery hydrolysis and acidification of ss are necessary steps in the hydrolysis and acidification stage of ad complex organic matter is hydrolyzed to dissolved organics matter dom and the dom is further fermented to volatile fatty acids vfas appels et al 2008 the unsatisfactory performance hinders the use of ad in ss treatment and hydrolysis is generally considered as the rate limiting step mixing one of the most important components in a high efficiency ad system is known to greatly affect many processes involved in digesters such as mass and heat transfer contact between bacteria and substrates vfas and biogas yield kariyama et al 2018 lebranchu et al 2017 wu 2012 mixing can account for about 29 54 of the total electricity input of the ad process lindmark et al 2014b for this reason most investigations have focused on the mixing effect on the characteristics of the methanogenesis stage to optimize biogas production generally these studies point out that low mixing intensity is beneficial to an ad process based on the optimized methanogens community and the decrease of energy demand kariyama et al 2018 kim et al 2017 lindmark et al 2014b hoffmann et al 2008 notably the ad performance depends on the coordinated activity of hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis and the effect of ad operating parameters on hydrolysis acidification stage and methanogenesis stage often exhibit significant difference due to the essential difference between bacteria and archaea however our understanding of the effect of mixing on the characteristics of hydrolysis and acidification is still limited especially when compared to methanogenesis in ad yang et al 2017 found that the impact of shearing was mostly on hydrolysis and acidification rather than methanogenesis recent studies have reported that increased mixing intensity can enhance the hydrolysis and acidification of ss and lignocellulosic biomass zhao et al 2017 lindmark et al 2014a yuan et al 2011 these studies mainly used total organics especially volatile solids removal and vfas production to characterize the effect of mixing on hydrolysis acidification performance the impact of mixing on ad performance could not be explained satisfactorily by total volatile solids vs removal and total vfas lindmark et al 2014b detailed information about the variations of dom characteristics and how the dom is transformed in hydrolysis and acidification stage with different mixing intensities are necessary but have been up unavailable up until now complex dom will be generated in the hydrolysis stage dom characteristics and their changes largely affect the final use of dom products wang et al 2016 dom is the major substrate for fermentative bacteria producing vfas many studies have proved that vfas and biogas production are related to the changes in dom characteristics dai et al 2017 xu et al 2017 identification of dom characteristics in hydrolysis and acidification stage is significantly useful for understanding the transformation of sludge components in ad systems chen et al 2017 increasing glucose yields by 35 and decreasing sugar yields by 29 can be achieved by controlling the mixing strategy in the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose chakraborty et al 2017 the degree of contact between microbial consortia and substrate are significantly influenced by mixing trad et al 2016 vavilin et al 2002 therefore mixing intensity may affect the characteristics of doms in hydrolysis acidification stage analyzing the shifts of dom characteristics in responding to different mixing intensity are essential to develop efficient treatment strategies for ad processes chen et al 2017 wei et al 2011 nevertheless little is known about mixing intensity effects on dom characteristics in hydrolysis and acidification stage three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem was previously used to characterize the fluorescent dom features in ad systems xu et al 2017 wei et al 2011 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms can offer precisely molecular understanding of dom and elemental molecular formulas for each measured mass peak i e cnhnonnnsn in samples hu et al 2018 valle et al 2018 osborne et al 2013 using this method can provide insights into the molecular composition of dom and advance our knowledge about mixing intensity effects on hydrolysis and acidification of sludge the stability and efficiency of hydrolysis and acidification significantly rely on the optimally functional microbial community including hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria moreover diverse bacteria are involved in the hydrolysis and acidification stage such as bacteroidetes firmicutes chloroflexi and actinobacteria liu et al 2016 vanwonterghem et al 2014 cirne et al 2007 mcmahon et al 2001 to a great extent the assembly of bacterial community is driven by process parameters peces et al 2018 however very few studies have investigated the effect of mixing on the hydrolytic and fermentative bacterial community in ad of ss shearing for recuperative thickening can affect the relative abundance of bacteroidetes and firmicutes during the ad of ss yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 found that mixing greatly influenced the abundance of i e chloroflexi proteobacteria and actinobacteria in the ad of lignocellulosic biomass many microorganisms can perform a variety of functional roles which adds to their complexity and makes it difficult to determine which microorganism is the most influential for hydrolysis and acidification under different mixing intensities grey relational analysis gra has been widely used to assess quantitative and qualitative relationships between factors and variables in biological systems arce et al 2015 xu et al 2011 this research used gra to analyze the relationship between the bacterial community and the function of hydrolysis acidification the objective of authors was to help identify key functional microorganisms and provide novel information about the relationship between the bacterial community and hydrolysis acidification performance this paper revealed the effect of mixing intensity on hydrolysis and acidification of ss with the purpose of optimizing ad performance the molecular characteristics of dom and bacterial community dynamics as well as the gra between the bacterial community and hydrolysis acidification performance were performed to get a better insight into the impact of mixing intensity on hydrolysis and acidification of ss 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge characteristics and anaerobic reactor operation ss was collected from the secondary clarifier in dachang municipal wwtp nanjing china and stored at 4 c maximum two weeks rotational flow desiting basin was used to remove grit in the wwtp and raw ss was filtered through a 2 mm sieve to remove debris in lab inoculum sludge was obtained from a single phase lab scale anaerobic digester effective volume 6 l srt 30 d olr 0 49 g vs l d which was fed by excess sludge from the dachang or jiangxinzhou municipal wwtp nanjing china and operated at 37 1 c for 7 months the characteristics of both ss and seeding sludge are listed in table 1 to better understand the impact of mixing intensity on hydrolysis and acidification of ss a two phase ad system was used hydrolysis and acidification phase hap reactors were fed with raw ss and methanogenic phase mp reactors were fed with the discharged sludge from hap eight 1 l stirred digesters with a 600 ml working volume were divided into four groups and operated at 37 1 c by supplying heated water to the jacketed reactors the proportion of volatile solids vs of inoculum and raw sludge was 3 2 the reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 2 min after feeding substrates were added the four groups were referred to as 1 hap1 and mp1 2 hap2 and mp2 3 hap3 and mp3 4 hap4 and mp4 continuously stirred tank reactor is the configuration used in 90 of the newly erected digesters in recent years weiland 2006 therefore continuous mixing was selected as a primary focus area in this study the mixing intensity of hap1 hap2 hap3 and hap4 was 30 60 90 and 120 rpm zhao et al 2017 lindmark et al 2014b and the mixing intensity of the four mp reactors was 120 rpm mechanical stirring was realized by eight central agitators equipped with oblique impeller 2 blades diameter 40 mm thickness 2 mm height 12 mm angle 30 the distance between the impeller and the reactors bottom was 14 mm solids retention time srt in hap was 2 d olr 7 96 g vs l d and srt in mp was 20 d olr 0 796 g vs l d using a sterile 50 ml syringe digestate was drawn from the reactors via a silicon tube and fresh feedstock was added to the reactors via the same silicon tube with a 50 ml syringe biogas production was measured by displacement of water 2 2 analytical techniques total solids ts vs total chemical oxygen demand tcod and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 2005 vfas concentration and composition were measured by the agilent gc7890a gas chromatograph agilent technologies santa clara ca usa protein pn was determined by bca protein assay kit thermo scientific pierce polysaccharide ps was measured using the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard cod of pn ps and vfas was calculated based on the method of chen et al 2017 the samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min to separate the solids from the solution and the supernatant was then collected and filtrated through 0 45 Î¼m filter membrane the activity of dehydrogenase dh based on the reaction rate of ttc acetate kinase ak butyrate kinase bk phosphotransacetylase pta and phosphotransbutyrylase ptb were measured according to hao et al 2017a protease activity was measured using the method of yu et al 2008 enzymatic activity per gram of vs u g vs was defined as enzymatic activities methane content in the biogas was measured by a gas chromatograph gc agilent technologies 7890a usa according to the method of latif et al 2017 the reactors were operated for 120 days 60 srt scod and vfas were detected every 5 days the samples 3 were collected and analyzed for pn ps and key enzymes every 5 days for 30 days after all the reactors reached stable state 2 3 dom characteristics measurement for fluorescent components analysis the scanning field was set at emissions em from 250 to 550 nm and excitation ex from 200 to 450 nm with 5 nm sampling intervals for both em and ex modes using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescent spectrophotometer hitachi inc japan 20 eem samples were subjected to the parallel factor analysis parafac details of eem and the parafac analysis can be found in hu et al 2018 for molecular characteristics analysis the liquid sample was filtrated through a 0 45 Î¼m filter membrane and then acidified to ph 2 dom was extracted by 1 g 6 ml solid phase extraction spe cartridges functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin supelco spe extracted dom was analyzed using a 9 4 t fticr ms bruker germany methodologies for fticr ms mass calibration processing and data analysis can be found in hu et al 2017 compounds share common elemental ratios were distinguished by n c or the modified aromaticity index 2 4 bacterial community structure both phospholipid fatty acid plfa and high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were used to analyze the bacterial community dynamics samples on the 90th and 120th day were used to detect the plfa profile samples collected on the 90th 105th and 120th day were used for 16s rrna

analytic protocol for gra can be found in xu et al 2011 the shannon wiener index h was used to calculate the diversity of the bacterial community 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrolysis and acidification performance of the had reactors the effect of mixing intensity on hydrolysis and acidification efficiency of ss is shown in fig 1 the scod and tvfas concentration increased gradually with time the amount of scod and tvfas generated at reactor hap3 2134 58 mg l and 1311 22 mg l and hap4 2030 39 mg l and 1281 21 mg l was significantly higher than those at reactor hap1 1346 32 mg l and 730 43 mg l and hap2 1693 62 mg l and 1144 32 mg l p 0 05 t test this finding is consistent with previous studies implying that a suitable increase in mixing aids the mass transfer of nutrient and accelerated solid waste digestion lindmark et al 2014a vavilin et al 2002 zhao et al 2017 reported that tvfas 2022 mg l when mixed for 5 min twice daily at 20 rpm had a higher concentration than those 1695 mg l mixed for 10 min five times daily at 70 rpm in ad of fresh maize stover recently yang et al 2017 found that medium shearing 300 rpm resulted in an improved digestion performance while too high shearing 600 rpm was adverse to the hydrolyzer and acidogens during ad of sludge with recuperative thickening the effect of mixing on ad is not clear and seems to be substrate dependent lindmark et al 2014b in the experimental stage floating layers were found in reactor hap1 and hap2 with volumes about 200 260 ml and 70 110 ml respectively the floating part that was over the effective volume of 600 ml were defined as floating layers tian et al 2015 at the feeding stage the floating layers were discharged from hap1 and hap2 and 300 ml sludge was retained with the purpose of maintaining equal olr and srt of the four hap reactors it is well known that floating layer wound lead to poor transfer of heat and mass and further low digestion tian et al 2015 moreover this phenomenon was also confirmed by the vs removal ratio fig s1 the vs removal ratios were also higher in reactors hap3 9 75 1 33 and hap4 9 12 0 51 the vs removal efficiencies of the four mp reactors were similar 11 37 1 04 11 64 0 61 the low total vs removal ratios were because the ss was not pretreated and had a low vs ts hao et al 2017a the ch4 production fig s1 in hap1 and hap2 were higher than reactor hap3 and hap4 which may contribute to the lower vfas in hap1 and hap2 the above results showed that mixing at 90 or 120 rpm favored the hydrolysis and acidification of ss the low mass transfer karim et al 2005 generation of a floating layer tian et al 2015 and the higher ch4 production chen et al 2017 were adverse to dom and vfas yield which may also account for the bad hydrolysis and acidification of ss at low mixing intensity the amount of soluble pn and ps generated at hap3 and hap4 was significantly higher than those at reactor hap1 and hap2 p 0 05 t test and the content of pn was more than twice that of ps fig 1c this finding agrees with the observation that pn was the major component of ss and the content of pn was several times higher than the ps in hap of ss chen et al 2017 unknown scod accounted for 13 6 25 3 of total scod and had a similar or higher amount than pn in the four hap reactors besides pn and ps ss are also composed of 7 7 28 6 humic substances and 3 5 dna gonzalez et al 2018 this phenomenon will be further explored by eem parafac acetic acid and propionic acid were the dominant vfas in the four reactors fig 1d reactor hap3 had the highest acetic acid concentration 388 21 mg l among the reactors the ratio of acetic acid and propionic acid decreased from 2 20 to 0 73 with the increase of mixing intensity tian et al 2013 found that propionic acid increased from 0 3 g l to 0 8 g l when increased the mixing intensities from 0 to 100 rpm while acetic acid increased from 0 9 to 1 2 g l yuan et al 2011 also found that the ratio of acetic acid and propionic acid decreased from 2 37 to 1 46 when no mixing changed to mixing at 50 rpm the tvfas concentration as scod of hap3 and hap4 was similar but more valeric acid and iso valeric acid were observed in hap4 fig 1d the proportion of acetic acid in hap3 42 71 was lower than that in hap1 60 07 and hap2 46 68 ch4 production in mp3 was the highest among the methanogenic reactors fig s1c this phenomenon indicated that acetogenesis and methanogenesis was not inhibited and the highest scod and tvfa in hap3 was beneficial to methanogenesis similarity schievano et al 2012 found that the propionic acid and butyric acid concentration were 318 140 mg l and 958 270 mg l in acidogenic stage and the methanogenic phase was not inhibited therefore this study demonstrated that mixing at 90 rpm maybe beneficial to the hydrolysis and acidification of ss this phenomenon will be further analyzed in following sections 3 2 dom characteristics of the hap reactors with different mixing intensities 3 2 1 fluorescent components fluorescent components of dom from the hap reactors with different mixing intensities were conducted by eem parafac four different eem parafac components were identified in this study fig s2 and table 2 one protein like component c1 and three humic like components c2 c3 and c4 the fluorescence intensity of the eem parafac c1 c2 c3 and c4 in hap3 and hap4 was higher than that in hap1 and hap2 fig 2 this also illustrated that higher sludge hydrolysis was achieved at mixing of 90 and 120 rpm the fluorescence intensity of humic like substances mainly c2 and c3 was higher than that of protein like substances c1 this finding coincides well with the phenomenon that humic like substances can account for a high percent of fluorescence response in hydrolysis of excess sludge wei et al 2011 dom is generally derived from eps while tyrosine like substances c1 are easily biodegradable organics and the major substrate for acidogenesis on the other hand humic like substances c2 c3 and c4 are hard biodegradable material the easily biodegradable organics are fermented to vfas and the hard biodegradable materials are accumulated wei et al 2011 moreover hu et al 2018 found that humic like substances in the influent of dachang wwtp were more prevalent than protein like substances therefore humic like substances were the major component of unknown scod in this study it is illustrated that mixing at 90 rpm not only enhanced the hydrolysis of easily biodegradable organic matter but also significantly increased the solubility of hard biodegradable material which further increased the vfas production 3 2 2 molecular characteristics understanding the generation characteristics of dom at a molecular level can provide significant insight into the effect of mixing on hydrolysis and acidification of ss the molecular characteristics of the dom in the four reactors were detected by fticr ms the entire formulas were analyzed by van krevelen diagrams using the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon h c ratio and the molar ratio of oxygen to carbon o c ratio kim et al 2003 major biogeochemical organic matter has its own specific h c or o c ratios therefore each class of organics locates in a specific area on the diagram hu et al 2018 the number of assigned formulas of hap1 hap2 hap3 and hap4 were 204 268 277 and 254 the low diversity of assigned formulas might be due to the low vs removal and the degradation of dom by fermentative microorganisms shakeri yekta et al 2012 the low molecular weight dom always accounted for a small fraction of dom in hydrolysate of ss xu et al 2017 furthermore dom can be adsorbed on particulate material especially when ss contains a high proportion of grit dai et al 2017 as is known ss always has a high proportion of grit 14 56 8 with an average of about 35 in china the dom formulas in the four reactors were mainly located at the h c of 0 7 2 2 and the o c of 0 0 6 these constraints are typical for lipid like proteins amino sugars like unsaturated hydrocarbons like and lignin like compounds this agrees with previous studies that the majority of dom had h c of 0 7 1 9 and o c of 0 1 0 7 in ad process of ss shakeri yekta et al 2012 a small fraction of dom molecules was found in carbohydrates like regions which indicated a low molecular diversity of ps in the reactors this phenomenon might be attributed to the relatively low ps concentration in all the reactors clear differences in molecular compositions of the dom among the reactors can be seen in fig 3 the number of assigned formulas of hap1 was the lowest and the number of assigned formulas was similar among other reactors for hap3 and hap4 more dom molecules appeared in lipid like and proteins amino sugars like regions while in hap2 more dom molecules were found in unsaturated hydrocarbons like and lignin like regions lipid like dom consists of a wide range of organics such as fatty acid esters sterols aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols lignin like substances are comprised of polyphenolic oligomers or the degradation products of carboxylic and alicyclic compounds shakeri yekta et al 2012 lignin like substances are hard biodegradable material and the potential aromatic nature of these compounds likely limits their microbial degradation tang et al 2018 hao et al 2017a lipid like and proteins amino sugars like dom form the major substrates for vfas generation by fermentative bacteria the microorganisms in hap3 and hap4 possessed more easily biodegradable dom hence more vfas can be generated at mixing of 90 and 120 rpm both higher molecular diversity and a larger number of molecules appeared at lipid like and proteins amino sugars like regions accounting for the enhanced hydrolysis and acidification of ss at high mixing intensity 90 and 120 rpm 3 3 effect of mixing intensity on particle size and key enzymes for raw ss hap1 hap2 hap3 and hap4 the d50 was 50 3 Î¼m 46 2 Î¼m 44 4 Î¼m 41 6 Î¼m and 39 Î¼m respectively increased mixing intensity resulted in a decreasing particle size kim et al 2017 a small d50 can lead to large specific surface area which can enhance the contact between the substrate and anaerobic bacteria thereby increasing ad efficiency xu et al 2017 it has been reported that microbial catabolic activities are significantly related to the ability of harvesting energy yield and rate gonzÃ¡lez cabaleiro et al 2015 the key enzymes relevant to hydrolysis and acidification of ss were also detected table 3 the activities of ttc dh protease ak and pta were the highest in hap3 reactor this indicated that the catabolic activities of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria were the highest in hap3 this agreed with the highest vs removal and acetate production in hap3 the above results suggested that mixing at 90 rpm led to a lower particle size and higher activities of enzymes which contributed to the hydrolysis and acidification of ss 3 4 dynamics of key functional microbes induced by different mixing intensity the overall distinctions of the microbial community in the four hap reactors were first investigated by plfa profiles table s1 the h in hap2 2 90 and hap3 2 91 was higher than that in hap1 2 79 and hap4 2 60 plfa profiles were further analyzed by pca to assess overall differences in the microbial community of the four hap reactors fig s3 pc1 and pc2 explained 70 2 and 13 5 of total data variability respectively the mixing effect on plfa profiles can be definitely distinguished plfa samples derived from same reactor were clustered together and samples with higher mixing intensity showed higher positive relationship with pc1 clustered on the positive pc1 areas the results suggested that mixing induced clear differences in the hap microbial community the detailed differences of the microbial community were further analyzed by the illumina miseq platform the bacterial community of the hap reactors were dominantly composed of firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria chloroflexi nitrospira and actinobacteria fig 4 a the relative abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in the hap3 reactor 26 19 8 68 was slightly lower than those of the other three reactors 28 52 30 79 11 45 13 68 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are important microbes involved in hydrolysis and acidification of ss chen et al 2017 the scod and tvfas concentrations were the highest in hap3 although the abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes was the least these results illustrated that the hydrolysis and acidification of sludge mixing at 90 rpm may rely on other bacteria chloroflexi and fusobacteria were more abundant in hap3 reactor 8 28 and 2 86 respectively particularly firmicutes and actinobacteria increased with the increase of mixing intensity p 0 05 the enrichment of firmicutes at higher mixing intensity was similar to the study conducted by yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 also found that abundance of clostridiales belonging to firmicutes increased from 57 83 to 70 05 as the mixing intensity increased from 20 to 70 rpm chloroflexi and actinobacteria were found to be dominant hydrolytic population in ad of ss peces et al 2018 cirne et al 2007 this paper indicates that mixing at 90 rpm mainly increased the relative abundance of chloroflexi firmicutes and actinobacteria which favored the hydrolysis and acidification of ss at the order and genus level clostridiales clostridium xi and clostridium sensu stricto were more abundant in hap3 and hap4 than other reactors similarly in the ad of sludge with recuperative thickening yang et al 2017 found that clostridiales was the highest when shearing was decreased from excessive to a high level clostridiales are well known for their role in acidification and are capable of degrading proteins lipids and polymeric carbohydrates cetobacterium 2 85 0 32 is known to be positively associated with protein digestion hao et al 2017b and was more abundant in the hap3 reactor and significantly related to hac p 0 05 relative abundance of ilumatobacter increased with the increase of mixing intensity ilumatobacter was found to be predominant in sediment of lake sayram and the lake water kept active material exchangeing by hydrological parameters fang et al 2015 ilumatobacter potentially represent improtant decomposers of organic matter fang et al 2015 vÄtrovskÃ½ and baldrian 2015 rhodocyclales was the least in the hap3 reactor which can perform heterotrophic denitrification by using fatty acids de almeida fernandes et al 2018 similarity decreasing the utilization of fatty acids can lead to the accumulation of scod and vfas in hydrolysis and acidification stage chen et al 2017 yang et al 2017 reported that abundance of rhodocyclales was higher at shearing of 300 rpm than shearing at 0 and 600 rpm clostridium cetobacterium and ilumatobacter were found to be the key functional microorganisms in the reactor when mixing was set at 90 rpm the increase of those hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria and the decrease of vfas predators likely accounted for the enhanced hydrolysis and acidification efficiency at mixing of 90 rpm pca based on 12 sampled bacterial communities is shown in fig 4c the results were consistent with the findings in plfa profiles showing that the microbial community in different reactors can be clearly identified moreover h of hap3 1 55 was also higher than other reactors 1 48 1 49 the gra method was used to quantitatively evaluate the influential degrees of functional microorganisms on the scod tvfas pn and ps unknown scod hac and hpr concentration in this study fig 5 the principle of gra is to estimate the similarity and degree of the compactness among fators based on the geometric shape a larger grey relational grades Î³ represents a more influential priority xu et al 2011 firmicutes exhibited the highest grey relational grades Î³ 0 839 0 832 0 842 0 776 0 858 for the above indicators except for hac this phenomenon is consistent with the observation that the increase of tvfas was accompanied with the increase of firmicutes chen et al 2017 besides hac the Î³ generally decreased as firmicutes fusobacteria proteobacteria chloroflexi actinobacteria bacteroidetes for hac concentration proteobacteria showed the highest Î³ 0 852 and fusobacteria and chloroflexi also had a relatively high Î³ while firmicutes had a relatively low Î³ 0 754 zhao et al 2017 found that accumulation of bacteroidetes could accelerate the hydrolysis and acidification of lignocellulosic materials this study also demonstrated that bacteroidetes could affect the hap performance however its influence was less significant than the other mentioned phyla in this study this phenomenon agreed with the fingdings that bacteroidetes showed an opposite trend to firmicutes in acidogenic phases zhao et al 2017 at the genus level cetobacterium exhibited the highest Î³ for scod tvfas and hac steroidobacter showed the highest Î³ for pn and ps unknown scod and hpr steroidobacter belongs to gammaproteobacterium can dehydrogenate and initiate degradation of steroidal hormones fahrbach et al 2010 ignavibacterium ilumatobacter rhodocyclales gp16 aeromonas and clostridium sensu stricto also had a higher Î³ than the other genera for hap performance these microorganisms are well known for their role in hydrolysis and acidification firmicutes were found to be the key microorganisms influencing the hydrolysis and acidification performance of ss in this study 3 5 correlation between hap performance and bacterial community structure fig 6 shows the rda plot of the bacterial community related to hydrolysis and acidification indicators rda1 and rda2 makes up 57 2 and 17 1 of the total variance respectively mixing intensity significantly related to scod tvfas pn and ps unknown scod and hpr p 0 05 moreover a cluster microorganisms i e firmicutes actinobacteria ilumatobacter and clostridium xi were closely related to the above five indicators which is consisted with previous studies chen et al 2017 peces et al 2018 firmicutes exhibited significantly positive correlation with the mentioned five indicators p 0 05 however proteobacteria p 0 05 and bacteroidetes p 0 05 negatively related to the hydrolysis and acidification of ss except for hac the reason for this negative response has to do with the lowest abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes coupled with the best hydrolysis and acidification performance in hap3 and mixing slightly influenced the abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes another possible influence points the high abundance of proteobacteria reacting to poorly available substrates which decreased its hydrolytic and fermentative efficiency in hap1 and hap2 gonzÃ¡lez cabaleiro et al 2015 these findings also confirmed the key role of firmicutes on the hydrolysis and acidification of ss no significant correlation between mixing and hac was found p 0 05 fusobacteria cetobacterium and chloroflexi exhibited significantly positive correlation with hac concentration p 0 05 4 conclusions this paper focused on the effect of mixing intensity on molecular and fluorescent characteristics of dom and the key functional microorganisms in the hap of ss results showed that enhanced scod tvfas and hac generation can be achieved and more dissolved pn ps and humic acid were released at mixing of 90 rpm higher molecular diversity and more molecules appeared at lipid like and proteins amino sugars like regions were found in hap3 and hap4 reactors mixing at 90 rpm also led to lower particle size and higher activities of enzymes firmicutes and actinobacteria increased with elevated mixing intensity and fusobacteria and chloroflexi were enriched in hap3 favoring the hydrolysis and acidification of ss p 0 05 the influential priorities of these microorganisms on hap performance except for hac were firmicutes fusobacteria proteobacteria chloroflexi actinobacteria bacteroidetes proteobacteria exhibited the highest Î³ 0 8519 for hac thus it can be concluded that mixing at 90 rpm is recommended for favoring the hap of ss operating digesters at low mixing intensity as is favored to enhance ch4 production and to reduce energy demand may deteriorate the hydrolysis and acidification of ss to further understand the effect of mixing on the ad process more comprehensive studies are required which should take into consideration maximizing both ch4 production and hydrolysis as well as acidification performance acknowledgements this work was supported

19208,mixing should be optimized in anaerobic digestion ad systems to achieve excellent biomaterials production in the sewage sludge ss management in wastewater treatment plant ad depends on the coordinated activity of hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis however the effect of mixing intensity on characteristics of hydrolysis and acidification in ad of ss is still poorly understood this study focused on the mixing intensity 30 60 90 and 120 rpm effect on the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom and the key microorganisms in the hydrolysis and acidification of ss results showed that enhanced hydrolysis and acidification efficiency was obtained at mixing of 90 and 120 rpm p 0 05 while the maximum acetic acid 388 21 mg l was produced at 90 rpm mixing at 90 rpm enhanced the release of protein and polysaccharide as well as humic acid further analyses of dom molecular features revealed that 90 rpm led to the highest molecular diversity and easily biodegradable molecules lipid and proteins amino sugars which contributed to the maximum hydrolysis and acidification efficiency firmicutes and actinobacteria significantly increased with mixing intensity p 0 05 and chloroflexi and fusobacteria were enriched at mixing of 90 rpm which favored the hydrolysis of ss the enrichment of clostridium xi and clostridium sensu stricto contributed to the acidification of dom at 90 and 120 rpm the results of this study can advance our knowledge about mixing intensity effects on the ad systems of ss this research also showed how increasing mixing intensity to a relatively high speed can enhance the hydrolysis and acidification efficiency of ss graphical abstract image 1 keywords mixing intensity dissolved organic matter fluorescent component molecular characteristic bacterial community dynamics 1 introduction large amount of sewage sludge ss is generated all over the world and its management has become a significant issue in wastewater treatment plants wwtps because of economic and environmental concerns anaerobic digestion ad the most efficient and best known process for treating ss can recover useful biomaterials or energy and is fast becoming a preferred strategy for the carbon neutral operation of wwtps xu et al 2017 de vrieze and verstraete 2016 prior to biomaterials or energy recovery hydrolysis and acidification of ss are necessary steps in the hydrolysis and acidification stage of ad complex organic matter is hydrolyzed to dissolved organics matter dom and the dom is further fermented to volatile fatty acids vfas appels et al 2008 the unsatisfactory performance hinders the use of ad in ss treatment and hydrolysis is generally considered as the rate limiting step mixing one of the most important components in a high efficiency ad system is known to greatly affect many processes involved in digesters such as mass and heat transfer contact between bacteria and substrates vfas and biogas yield kariyama et al 2018 lebranchu et al 2017 wu 2012 mixing can account for about 29 54 of the total electricity input of the ad process lindmark et al 2014b for this reason most investigations have focused on the mixing effect on the characteristics of the methanogenesis stage to optimize biogas production generally these studies point out that low mixing intensity is beneficial to an ad process based on the optimized methanogens community and the decrease of energy demand kariyama et al 2018 kim et al 2017 lindmark et al 2014b hoffmann et al 2008 notably the ad performance depends on the coordinated activity of hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis and the effect of ad operating parameters on hydrolysis acidification stage and methanogenesis stage often exhibit significant difference due to the essential difference between bacteria and archaea however our understanding of the effect of mixing on the characteristics of hydrolysis and acidification is still limited especially when compared to methanogenesis in ad yang et al 2017 found that the impact of shearing was mostly on hydrolysis and acidification rather than methanogenesis recent studies have reported that increased mixing intensity can enhance the hydrolysis and acidification of ss and lignocellulosic biomass zhao et al 2017 lindmark et al 2014a yuan et al 2011 these studies mainly used total organics especially volatile solids removal and vfas production to characterize the effect of mixing on hydrolysis acidification performance the impact of mixing on ad performance could not be explained satisfactorily by total volatile solids vs removal and total vfas lindmark et al 2014b detailed information about the variations of dom characteristics and how the dom is transformed in hydrolysis and acidification stage with different mixing intensities are necessary but have been up unavailable up until now complex dom will be generated in the hydrolysis stage dom characteristics and their changes largely affect the final use of dom products wang et al 2016 dom is the major substrate for fermentative bacteria producing vfas many studies have proved that vfas and biogas production are related to the changes in dom characteristics dai et al 2017 xu et al 2017 identification of dom characteristics in hydrolysis and acidification stage is significantly useful for understanding the transformation of sludge components in ad systems chen et al 2017 increasing glucose yields by 35 and decreasing sugar yields by 29 can be achieved by controlling the mixing strategy in the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose chakraborty et al 2017 the degree of contact between microbial consortia and substrate are significantly influenced by mixing trad et al 2016 vavilin et al 2002 therefore mixing intensity may affect the characteristics of doms in hydrolysis acidification stage analyzing the shifts of dom characteristics in responding to different mixing intensity are essential to develop efficient treatment strategies for ad processes chen et al 2017 wei et al 2011 nevertheless little is known about mixing intensity effects on dom characteristics in hydrolysis and acidification stage three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem was previously used to characterize the fluorescent dom features in ad systems xu et al 2017 wei et al 2011 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms can offer precisely molecular understanding of dom and elemental molecular formulas for each measured mass peak i e cnhnonnnsn in samples hu et al 2018 valle et al 2018 osborne et al 2013 using this method can provide insights into the molecular composition of dom and advance our knowledge about mixing intensity effects on hydrolysis and acidification of sludge the stability and efficiency of hydrolysis and acidification significantly rely on the optimally functional microbial community including hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria moreover diverse bacteria are involved in the hydrolysis and acidification stage such as bacteroidetes firmicutes chloroflexi and actinobacteria liu et al 2016 vanwonterghem et al 2014 cirne et al 2007 mcmahon et al 2001 to a great extent the assembly of bacterial community is driven by process parameters peces et al 2018 however very few studies have investigated the effect of mixing on the hydrolytic and fermentative bacterial community in ad of ss shearing for recuperative thickening can affect the relative abundance of bacteroidetes and firmicutes during the ad of ss yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 found that mixing greatly influenced the abundance of i e chloroflexi proteobacteria and actinobacteria in the ad of lignocellulosic biomass many microorganisms can perform a variety of functional roles which adds to their complexity and makes it difficult to determine which microorganism is the most influential for hydrolysis and acidification under different mixing intensities grey relational analysis gra has been widely used to assess quantitative and qualitative relationships between factors and variables in biological systems arce et al 2015 xu et al 2011 this research used gra to analyze the relationship between the bacterial community and the function of hydrolysis acidification the objective of authors was to help identify key functional microorganisms and provide novel information about the relationship between the bacterial community and hydrolysis acidification performance this paper revealed the effect of mixing intensity on hydrolysis and acidification of ss with the purpose of optimizing ad performance the molecular characteristics of dom and bacterial community dynamics as well as the gra between the bacterial community and hydrolysis acidification performance were performed to get a better insight into the impact of mixing intensity on hydrolysis and acidification of ss 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge characteristics and anaerobic reactor operation ss was collected from the secondary clarifier in dachang municipal wwtp nanjing china and stored at 4 c maximum two weeks rotational flow desiting basin was used to remove grit in the wwtp and raw ss was filtered through a 2 mm sieve to remove debris in lab inoculum sludge was obtained from a single phase lab scale anaerobic digester effective volume 6 l srt 30 d olr 0 49 g vs l d which was fed by excess sludge from the dachang or jiangxinzhou municipal wwtp nanjing china and operated at 37 1 c for 7 months the characteristics of both ss and seeding sludge are listed in table 1 to better understand the impact of mixing intensity on hydrolysis and acidification of ss a two phase ad system was used hydrolysis and acidification phase hap reactors were fed with raw ss and methanogenic phase mp reactors were fed with the discharged sludge from hap eight 1 l stirred digesters with a 600 ml working volume were divided into four groups and operated at 37 1 c by supplying heated water to the jacketed reactors the proportion of volatile solids vs of inoculum and raw sludge was 3 2 the reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 2 min after feeding substrates were added the four groups were referred to as 1 hap1 and mp1 2 hap2 and mp2 3 hap3 and mp3 4 hap4 and mp4 continuously stirred tank reactor is the configuration used in 90 of the newly erected digesters in recent years weiland 2006 therefore continuous mixing was selected as a primary focus area in this study the mixing intensity of hap1 hap2 hap3 and hap4 was 30 60 90 and 120 rpm zhao et al 2017 lindmark et al 2014b and the mixing intensity of the four mp reactors was 120 rpm mechanical stirring was realized by eight central agitators equipped with oblique impeller 2 blades diameter 40 mm thickness 2 mm

sterile 50 ml syringe digestate was drawn from the reactors via a silicon tube and fresh feedstock was added to the reactors via the same silicon tube with a 50 ml syringe biogas production was measured by displacement of water 2 2 analytical techniques total solids ts vs total chemical oxygen demand tcod and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were analyzed according to the standard methods

scientific pierce polysaccharide ps was measured using the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard cod of pn ps and vfas was calculated based on the method of chen et al 2017 the samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min to separate the solids from the solution and the supernatant was then collected and filtrated through 0 45 Î¼m filter membrane the activity of dehydrogenase dh based on the reaction rate of ttc acetate kinase ak butyrate kinase bk phosphotransacetylase pta and phosphotransbutyrylase ptb were measured according to hao et al 2017a protease activity was measured using the method of yu et al 2008 enzymatic activity per gram of vs u g vs was defined as enzymatic activities methane content in the biogas was measured by a gas chromatograph gc agilent technologies 7890a usa according to the method of latif et al 2017 the reactors were operated for 120 days 60 srt scod and vfas were detected every 5 days the samples 3 were collected and analyzed for pn ps and key enzymes every 5 days for 30 days after all the reactors reached stable state 2 3 dom characteristics measurement for fluorescent components analysis the scanning field was set at emissions em from 250 to 550 nm and excitation ex from 200 to 450 nm with 5 nm sampling intervals for both em and ex modes using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescent spectrophotometer hitachi inc japan 20 eem samples were subjected to the parallel factor analysis parafac details of eem and the parafac analysis can be found in hu et al 2018 for molecular characteristics analysis the liquid sample was filtrated through a 0 45 Î¼m filter membrane and then acidified to ph 2 dom was extracted by 1 g 6 ml solid phase extraction spe cartridges functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin supelco spe extracted dom was analyzed using a 9 4 t fticr ms bruker germany methodologies for fticr ms mass calibration processing and data analysis can be found in hu et al 2017 compounds share common elemental ratios were distinguished by n c or the modified aromaticity index 2 4 bacterial community structure both phospholipid fatty acid plfa and high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were used to analyze the bacterial community dynamics samples on the 90th and 120th day were used to detect the plfa profile samples collected on the 90th 105th and 120th day were used for 16s rrna

significant correlations using spearman correlations p and conduct the significant differences using the student s t test t test redundancy analysis rda and principal component analysis pca was performed by canoco 4 5 software grey relational analysis gra was used to quantitatively evaluate the influential priorities of the key microorganisms on hydrolysis and acidification features detailed analytic protocol for gra can be found in xu et al 2011 the shannon wiener index h was used to calculate the diversity of the bacterial community 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrolysis and acidification performance of the had reactors the effect of mixing intensity on hydrolysis and acidification efficiency of ss is shown in fig 1 the scod and tvfas concentration increased gradually with time the amount of scod and tvfas generated at reactor hap3 2134 58 mg l and 1311 22 mg l and hap4 2030 39 mg l and 1281 21 mg l was significantly higher than those at reactor hap1 1346 32 mg l and 730 43 mg l and hap2 1693 62 mg l and 1144 32 mg l p 0 05 t test this finding is consistent with previous studies implying that a suitable increase in mixing aids the mass transfer of nutrient and accelerated solid waste digestion lindmark et al 2014a vavilin et al 2002 zhao et al 2017 reported that tvfas 2022 mg l when mixed for 5 min twice daily at 20 rpm had a higher concentration than those 1695 mg l mixed for 10 min five times daily at 70 rpm in ad of fresh maize stover recently yang et al 2017 found that medium shearing 300 rpm resulted in an improved digestion performance while too high shearing 600 rpm was adverse to the hydrolyzer and acidogens during ad of sludge with recuperative thickening the effect of mixing on ad is not clear and seems to be substrate dependent lindmark et al 2014b in the experimental stage floating layers were found in reactor hap1 and hap2 with volumes about 200 260 ml and 70 110 ml respectively the floating part that was over the effective volume of 600 ml were defined as floating layers tian et al 2015 at the feeding stage the floating layers were discharged from hap1 and hap2 and 300 ml sludge was retained with the purpose of maintaining equal olr and srt of the four hap reactors it is well known that floating layer wound lead to poor transfer of heat and mass and further low digestion tian et al 2015 moreover this phenomenon was also confirmed by the vs removal ratio fig s1 the vs removal ratios were also higher in reactors hap3 9 75 1 33 and hap4 9 12 0 51 the vs removal efficiencies of the four mp reactors were similar 11 37 1 04 11 64 0 61 the low total vs removal ratios were because the ss was not pretreated and had a low vs ts hao et al 2017a the ch4 production fig s1 in hap1 and hap2 were higher than reactor hap3 and hap4 which may contribute to the lower vfas in hap1 and hap2 the above results showed that mixing at 90 or 120 rpm favored the hydrolysis and acidification of ss the low mass transfer karim et al 2005 generation of a floating layer tian et al 2015 and the higher ch4 production chen et al 2017 were adverse to dom and vfas yield which may also account for the bad hydrolysis and acidification of ss at low mixing intensity the amount of soluble pn and ps generated at hap3 and hap4 was significantly higher than those at reactor hap1 and hap2 p 0 05 t test and the content of pn was more than twice that of ps fig 1c this finding agrees with the observation that pn was the major component of ss and the content of pn was several times higher than the ps in hap of ss chen et al 2017 unknown scod accounted for 13 6 25 3 of total scod and had a similar or higher amount than pn in the four hap reactors besides pn and ps ss are also composed of 7 7 28 6 humic substances and 3 5 dna gonzalez et al 2018 this phenomenon will be further explored by eem parafac acetic acid and propionic acid were the dominant vfas in the four reactors fig 1d reactor hap3 had the highest acetic acid concentration 388 21 mg l among the reactors the ratio of acetic acid and propionic acid decreased from 2 20 to 0 73 with the increase of mixing intensity tian et al 2013 found that propionic acid increased from 0 3 g l to 0 8 g l when increased the mixing intensities from 0 to 100 rpm while acetic acid increased from 0 9 to 1 2 g l yuan et al 2011 also found that the ratio of acetic acid and propionic acid decreased from 2 37 to 1 46 when no mixing changed to mixing at 50 rpm the tvfas concentration as scod of hap3 and hap4 was similar but more valeric acid and iso valeric acid were observed in hap4 fig 1d the proportion of acetic acid in hap3 42 71 was lower than that in hap1 60 07 and hap2 46 68 ch4 production in mp3 was the highest among the methanogenic reactors fig s1c this phenomenon indicated that acetogenesis and methanogenesis was not inhibited and the highest scod and tvfa in hap3 was beneficial to methanogenesis similarity schievano et al 2012 found that the propionic acid and butyric acid concentration were 318 140 mg l and 958 270 mg l in acidogenic stage and the methanogenic phase was not inhibited therefore this study demonstrated that mixing at 90 rpm maybe beneficial to the hydrolysis and acidification of ss this phenomenon will be further analyzed in following sections 3 2 dom characteristics of the hap reactors with different mixing intensities 3 2 1 fluorescent components fluorescent components of dom from the hap reactors with different mixing intensities were conducted by eem parafac four different eem parafac components were identified in this study fig s2 and table 2 one protein like component c1 and three humic like components c2 c3 and c4 the fluorescence intensity of the eem parafac c1 c2 c3 and c4 in hap3 and hap4 was higher than that in hap1 and hap2 fig 2 this also illustrated that higher sludge hydrolysis was achieved at mixing of 90 and 120 rpm the fluorescence intensity of humic like substances mainly c2 and c3 was higher than that of protein like substances c1 this finding coincides well with the phenomenon that humic like substances can account for a high percent of fluorescence response in hydrolysis of excess sludge wei et al 2011 dom is generally derived from eps while tyrosine like substances c1 are easily biodegradable organics and the major substrate for acidogenesis on the other hand humic like substances c2 c3 and c4 are hard biodegradable material the easily biodegradable organics are fermented to vfas and the hard biodegradable materials are accumulated wei et al 2011 moreover hu et al 2018 found that humic like substances in the influent of dachang wwtp were more prevalent than protein like substances therefore humic like substances were the major component of unknown scod in this study it is illustrated that mixing at 90 rpm not only enhanced the hydrolysis of easily biodegradable organic matter but also significantly increased the solubility of hard biodegradable material which further increased the vfas production 3 2 2 molecular characteristics understanding the generation characteristics of dom at a molecular level can provide significant insight into the effect of mixing on hydrolysis and acidification of ss the molecular characteristics of the dom in the four reactors were detected by fticr ms the entire formulas were analyzed by van krevelen diagrams using the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon h c ratio and the molar ratio of oxygen to carbon o c ratio kim et al 2003 major biogeochemical organic matter has its own specific h c or o c ratios therefore each class of organics locates in a specific area on the diagram hu et al 2018 the number of assigned formulas of hap1 hap2 hap3 and hap4 were 204 268 277 and 254 the low diversity of assigned formulas might be due to the low vs removal and the degradation of dom by fermentative microorganisms shakeri yekta et al 2012 the low molecular weight dom always accounted for a small fraction of dom in hydrolysate of ss xu et al 2017 furthermore dom can be adsorbed on particulate material especially when ss contains a high proportion of grit dai et al 2017 as is known ss always has a high proportion of grit 14 56 8 with an average of about 35 in china the dom formulas in the four reactors were mainly located at the h c of 0 7 2 2 and the o c of 0 0 6 these constraints are typical for lipid like proteins amino sugars like unsaturated hydrocarbons like and lignin like compounds this agrees with previous studies that the majority of dom had h c of 0 7 1 9 and o c of 0 1 0 7 in ad process of ss shakeri yekta et al 2012 a small fraction of dom molecules was found in carbohydrates like regions which indicated a low molecular diversity of ps in the reactors this phenomenon might be attributed to the relatively low ps concentration in all the reactors clear differences in molecular compositions of the dom among the reactors can be seen in fig 3 the number of assigned formulas of hap1 was the lowest and the number of assigned formulas was similar among other reactors for hap3 and hap4 more dom molecules appeared in lipid like and proteins amino sugars like regions while in hap2 more dom molecules were found in unsaturated hydrocarbons like and lignin like regions lipid like dom consists of a wide range of organics such as fatty acid esters sterols aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols lignin like substances are comprised of polyphenolic oligomers or the degradation products of carboxylic and alicyclic compounds shakeri yekta et al 2012 lignin like substances are hard biodegradable material and the potential aromatic nature of these compounds likely limits their microbial degradation tang et al 2018 hao et al 2017a lipid like and proteins amino sugars like dom form the major substrates for vfas generation by fermentative bacteria the microorganisms in hap3 and hap4 possessed more easily biodegradable dom hence more vfas can be generated at mixing of 90 and 120 rpm both higher molecular diversity and a larger number of molecules appeared at lipid like and proteins amino sugars like regions accounting for the enhanced hydrolysis and acidification of ss at high mixing intensity 90 and 120 rpm 3 3 effect of mixing intensity on particle size and key enzymes for raw ss hap1 hap2 hap3 and hap4 the d50 was 50 3 Î¼m 46 2 Î¼m 44 4 Î¼m 41 6 Î¼m and 39 Î¼m respectively increased mixing intensity resulted in a decreasing particle size kim et al 2017 a small d50 can lead to large specific surface area which can enhance the contact between the substrate and anaerobic bacteria thereby increasing ad efficiency xu et al 2017 it has been reported that microbial catabolic activities are significantly related to the ability of harvesting energy yield and rate gonzÃ¡lez cabaleiro et al 2015 the key enzymes relevant to hydrolysis and acidification of ss were also detected table 3 the activities of ttc dh protease ak and pta were the highest in hap3 reactor this indicated that the catabolic activities of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria were the highest in hap3 this agreed with the highest vs removal and acetate production in hap3 the above results suggested that mixing at 90 rpm led to a lower particle size and higher activities of enzymes which contributed to the hydrolysis and acidification of ss 3 4 dynamics of key functional microbes induced by different mixing intensity the overall distinctions of the microbial community in the four hap reactors were first investigated by plfa profiles table s1 the h in hap2 2 90 and hap3 2 91 was higher than that in hap1 2 79 and hap4 2 60 plfa profiles were further analyzed by pca to assess overall differences in the microbial community of the four hap reactors fig s3 pc1 and pc2 explained 70 2 and 13 5 of total data variability respectively the mixing effect on plfa profiles can be definitely distinguished plfa samples derived from same reactor were clustered together and samples with higher mixing intensity showed higher positive relationship with pc1 clustered on the positive pc1 areas the results suggested that mixing induced clear differences in the hap microbial community the detailed differences of the microbial community were further analyzed by the illumina miseq platform the bacterial community of the hap reactors were dominantly composed of firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria chloroflexi nitrospira and actinobacteria fig 4 a the relative abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in the hap3 reactor 26 19 8 68 was slightly lower than those of the other three reactors 28 52 30 79 11 45 13 68 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are important microbes involved in hydrolysis and acidification of ss chen et al 2017 the scod and tvfas concentrations were the highest in hap3 although the abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes was the least these results illustrated that the hydrolysis and acidification of sludge mixing at 90 rpm may rely on other bacteria chloroflexi and fusobacteria were more abundant in hap3 reactor 8 28 and 2 86 respectively particularly firmicutes and actinobacteria increased with the increase of mixing intensity p 0 05 the enrichment of firmicutes at higher mixing intensity was similar to the study conducted by yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 also found that abundance of clostridiales belonging to firmicutes increased from 57 83 to 70 05 as the mixing intensity increased from 20 to 70 rpm chloroflexi and actinobacteria were found to be dominant hydrolytic population in ad of ss peces et al 2018 cirne et al 2007 this paper indicates that mixing at 90 rpm mainly increased the relative abundance of chloroflexi firmicutes and actinobacteria which favored the hydrolysis and acidification of ss at the order and genus level clostridiales clostridium xi and clostridium sensu stricto were more abundant in hap3 and hap4 than other reactors similarly in the ad of sludge with recuperative thickening yang et al 2017 found that clostridiales was the highest when shearing was decreased from excessive to a high level clostridiales are well known for their role in acidification and are capable of degrading proteins lipids and polymeric carbohydrates cetobacterium 2 85 0 32 is known to be positively associated with protein digestion hao et al 2017b and was more abundant in the hap3 reactor and significantly related to hac p 0 05 relative abundance of ilumatobacter increased with the increase of mixing intensity ilumatobacter was found to be predominant in sediment of lake sayram and the lake water kept active material exchangeing by hydrological parameters fang et al 2015 ilumatobacter potentially represent improtant decomposers of organic matter fang et al 2015 vÄtrovskÃ½ and baldrian 2015 rhodocyclales was the least in the hap3 reactor which can perform heterotrophic denitrification by using fatty acids de almeida fernandes et al 2018 similarity decreasing the utilization of fatty acids can lead to the accumulation of scod and vfas in hydrolysis and acidification stage chen et al 2017 yang et al 2017 reported that abundance of rhodocyclales was higher at shearing of 300 rpm than shearing at 0 and 600 rpm clostridium cetobacterium and ilumatobacter were found to be the key functional microorganisms in the reactor when mixing was set at 90 rpm the increase of those hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria and the decrease of vfas predators likely accounted for the enhanced hydrolysis and acidification efficiency at mixing of 90 rpm pca based on 12 sampled bacterial communities is shown in fig 4c the results were consistent with the findings in plfa profiles showing that the microbial community in different reactors can be clearly identified moreover h of hap3 1 55 was also higher than other reactors 1 48 1 49 the gra method was used to quantitatively evaluate the influential degrees of functional microorganisms on the scod tvfas pn and ps unknown scod hac and hpr concentration in this study fig 5 the principle of gra is to estimate the similarity and degree of the compactness among fators based on the geometric shape a larger grey relational grades Î³ represents a more influential priority xu et al 2011 firmicutes exhibited the highest grey relational grades Î³ 0 839 0 832 0 842 0 776 0 858 for the above indicators except for hac this phenomenon is consistent with the observation that the increase of tvfas was accompanied with the increase of firmicutes chen et al 2017 besides hac the Î³ generally decreased as firmicutes fusobacteria proteobacteria chloroflexi actinobacteria bacteroidetes for hac concentration proteobacteria showed the highest Î³ 0 852 and fusobacteria and chloroflexi also had a relatively high Î³ while firmicutes had a relatively low Î³ 0 754 zhao et al 2017 found that accumulation of bacteroidetes could accelerate the hydrolysis and acidification of lignocellulosic materials this study also demonstrated that bacteroidetes could affect the hap performance however its influence was less significant than the other mentioned phyla in this study this phenomenon agreed with the fingdings that bacteroidetes showed an opposite trend to firmicutes in acidogenic phases zhao et al 2017 at the genus level cetobacterium exhibited the highest Î³ for scod tvfas and hac steroidobacter showed the highest Î³ for pn and ps unknown scod and hpr steroidobacter belongs to gammaproteobacterium can dehydrogenate and initiate degradation of steroidal hormones fahrbach et al 2010 ignavibacterium ilumatobacter rhodocyclales gp16 aeromonas and clostridium sensu stricto also had a higher Î³ than the other genera for hap performance these microorganisms are well known for their role in hydrolysis and acidification firmicutes were found to be the key microorganisms influencing the hydrolysis and acidification performance of ss in this study 3 5 correlation between hap performance and bacterial community structure fig 6 shows the rda plot of the bacterial community related to hydrolysis and acidification indicators rda1 and rda2 makes up 57 2 and 17 1 of the total variance respectively mixing intensity significantly related to scod tvfas pn and ps unknown scod and hpr p 0 05 moreover a cluster microorganisms i e firmicutes actinobacteria ilumatobacter and clostridium xi were closely related to the above five indicators which is consisted with previous studies chen et al 2017 peces et al 2018 firmicutes exhibited significantly positive correlation with the mentioned five indicators p 0 05 however proteobacteria p 0 05 and bacteroidetes p 0 05 negatively related to the hydrolysis and acidification of ss except for hac the reason for this negative response has to do with the lowest abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes coupled with the best hydrolysis and acidification performance in hap3 and mixing slightly influenced the abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes another possible influence points the high abundance of proteobacteria reacting to poorly available substrates which decreased its hydrolytic and fermentative efficiency in hap1 and hap2 gonzÃ¡lez cabaleiro et al 2015 these findings also confirmed the key role of firmicutes on the hydrolysis and acidification of ss no significant correlation between mixing and hac was found p 0 05 fusobacteria cetobacterium and chloroflexi exhibited significantly positive correlation with hac concentration p 0 05 4 conclusions this paper focused on the effect of mixing intensity on molecular and fluorescent characteristics of dom and the key functional microorganisms in the hap of ss results showed that enhanced scod tvfas and hac generation can be achieved and more dissolved pn ps and humic acid were released at mixing of 90 rpm higher molecular diversity and more molecules appeared at lipid like and proteins amino sugars like regions were found in hap3 and hap4 reactors mixing at 90 rpm also led to lower particle size and higher activities of enzymes firmicutes and actinobacteria increased with elevated mixing intensity and fusobacteria and chloroflexi were enriched in hap3 favoring the hydrolysis and acidification of ss p 0 05 the influential priorities of these microorganisms on hap performance except for hac were firmicutes fusobacteria proteobacteria chloroflexi actinobacteria bacteroidetes proteobacteria exhibited the highest Î³ 0 8519 for hac thus it can be concluded that mixing at 90 rpm is recommended for favoring the hap of ss operating digesters at low mixing intensity as is favored to enhance ch4 production and to reduce energy demand may deteriorate the hydrolysis and acidification of ss to further understand the effect of mixing on the ad process more comprehensive studies are required which should take into consideration maximizing both ch4 production and hydrolysis as well as acidification performance acknowledgements this work was supported

19209,the work provides a method on the basis of flow cytometry to evaluate the performance of denitrification biofilm during the preservation reactivation and pilot scale operation process the viable cell ratio of denitrification biofilm significantly reduced and further led to the decrease of denitrification capacity after long term preservation for 5 months protein component in tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances tb eps could serve to enhance microbial adhesion and promote denitrification biofilm formation with the significant correlation of viable cell ratio and microbial characteristics 4 c was more appropriate for preserving denitrification biofilm and conducive to maintain the relatively high denitrification capacity a maximum denitrification rate of 5 80 gno3 n m2 d was obtained in pilot scale anoxic oxic ao process and dechloromonas became greater prevalence in denitrification suspended carriers furthermore the enrichment of pseudomonas parcubacteria acidovorax aquabacterium and unclassified flavobacteriaceae enhanced biofilm formation and nutrient conservation the significantly positive correlation between viable cell ratio and the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption was discovered and the indices of chao ace shannon and simpson of denitrification biofilm were positively correlated with viable cell ratio meaning that flow cytometry analysis was reasonable and suitable to evaluate the performances of denitrification biofilm graphical abstract image 1 keywords flow cytometry denitrification biofilm long term preservation tb eps microbial community structure 1 introduction recent concerns on total nitrogen tn removal from wastewater become increasingly compulsory because nitrogen hazard and nitrous oxide emission are wildly investigated in detail law et al 2012 lackner et al 2014 especially when a stringent wastewater discharge standard is newly issued upgrades to wastewater treatment plants wwtps are subsequently established to demonstrate favorable tn removal performance yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 however the construction cost and project cycle of these upgrades are high and extensive respectively a wastewater treatment process that is based on biofilm becomes prevalent because it has a minimal footprint and low sludge production which is facilitated to improve the operational capacity and further decrease the operation cost of wwtps mcquarrie and boltz 2011 hoang et al 2014 moving bed bioreactor mbbr is a flexible biofilm process that mainly relies on buoyant plastic suspended carriers and can avoid clogs and enhance fluidization effectively thereby resulting in favorable nitrification and denitrification capabilities in wwtps su et al 2016 young et al 2017 the lack of carbon source and the deficiency of denitrifiers significantly influence tn removal gao et al 2010 sodium acetate or acetic acid are generally used as the carbon source in wwtps and cultivating denitrification biofilm can accumulate denitrifiers and maintain nitrate reduction capacity effectively shi et al 2015 the mbbr process has been extensively examined for denitrification yuan et al 2015 lima et al 2016 nitrate removal ratio has attained up to 77 4 in autotrophic denitrification su et al 2016 and the maximum nitrogen removal rate has reached 5 1 kgn m3 d when polyethylene glycol gel is used as a carrier isaka et al 2012 the adoption of the mbbr process for denitrification is a cost effective way of upgrading wwtps biofilm formation is a dynamic process of growth and detachment that is generally influenced by substrate concentration hydraulic shear force and extracellular polymeric substance eps adsorption sheng et al 2010 huang et al 2018 xing and islam demonstrated that the shortage in carbon source during the denitrification process can accelerate detachment rate and decrease biofilm thickness xing et al 2000 islam et al 2009 and the relatively low c n ratio can directly affect eps secretion and result in unstable biofilm structure ye et al 2011 fish et al 2017 in addition the growth of denitrifiers in buoyant plastic suspended carriers is remarkably slow that is the start up of mbbr denitrification requires 4 6 weeks aspegren et al 1998 consequently preserving and reactivating denitrification suspended carriers in new wwtps may considerably enhance the tn removal within a short time moreover preserving and reactivating denitrification biofilm offer an effective and stable method for reducing the impact of nitrogen menace and maintaining nitrogen balance the biofilm storage can be achieved under different preservation substrates and temperatures gao et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 however the reactivation process of biofilm is complex and time consuming gao et al 2012 yuan et al 2012 at present detailed research on estimating bioactivity reactivation remains sparse and long term reactivation experiments are commonly required therefore investigating a novel method for evaluating the properties of denitrification biofilm and its pilot scale practical application has become crucial and necessary flow cytometry is introduced in the biomedical domain to characterize and differentiate the cell states and mechanisms of cell death apoptosis and necrosis darzynkiewica et al 1992 currently the microbial activity of bacteria and the process and mechanism of a cell cycle in wastewater and sludge are analyzed on the basis of flow cytometry foladori et al 2007 schmidt et al 2018 an in situ identification of bacteria in sludge samples is designed and the disintegration of numerous cells can even be observed through flow cytometry during sonication to wastewater snaidr et al 1997 foladori et al 2007 because the approach for illuminating the identification and quantification of viable and dead bacteria is promising thus adopting flow cytometry to evaluate the performance and predict the bioactivity of activated sludge and denitrification biofilm is required therefore this study aims to discover a suitable method based on flow cytometry to appraise the characteristics of preserved and reactivated denitrification biofilm this study also aims to ascertain the optimal preservation condition of denitrification biofilm and investigate their performances and microbial community structure in a pilot scale anoxic oxic ao process moreover this study is conducted to offer valuable information for the preservation reactivation and practical application of denitrification biofilm which are beneficial for the tn removal in wwtps under new circumstances 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operation 2 1 1 denitrification suspended carriers and liquidus substrates denitrification suspended carriers were obtained from an anoxic tank in lucun wuxi china wwtp through an anaerobic ao process the denitrification suspended carriers were subsequently transferred to a serum bottle with 400 ml preservation substrates at a volumetric ratio of 50 after removing the residual wastewater components table 1 three storage schemes namely p1 stored at 20 c p2 stored at 4 c and p3 stored at 20 c were designed the stored denitrification suspended carriers were collected from p1 p2 and p3 after five months and were subsequently revived in denitrification bioreactors r1 r2 and r3 under the same operating conditions the preservation and reactivation of substrates used synthetic substrates table 1 and a simplified diagram of a denitrification bioreactor is depicted in fig 1 a the components and their concentrations of preservation and reactivation substrates mg l were listed as naac 240 kno3 80 0 kh2po4 10 0 cacl2 20 0 mgso4 15 0 and nahco3 100 0 the tn removal performances under different temperatures and c n ratios were investigated to evaluate the feasibility of reactivated denitrification biofilm moreover the operation characteristics of denitrification biofilm in a pilot scale ao process fig 1b were finally explored table 1 summarizes the raw influent components and their concentrations 2 1 2 bioreactor set up and operation bioreactors r1 r2 and r3 were inoculated with the denitrification suspended carriers from p1 p2 and p3 correspondingly the reactivation experiment was conducted in a double jacked plexiglass vessel internal diameter of 18 cm and height of 35 cm fig 1a with an effective volume of 8 0 l the reactors were continuously fed by a peristaltic pump from a feed tank and the effluent was discharged at the top of the bioreactor accordingly reaction ph dissolved oxygen do and hydraulic retention time were adjusted to 7 0 7 5 below 0 1 mg l and 3 h respectively after obtaining the optimal preservation and reactivation strategy the feasibility of denitrification suspended carriers under different temperatures and c n ratios was subsequently established using the same operational conditions bioreactors r4 r5 r6 and r7 were operated at 8 c 12 c 15 c and 20 c correspondingly furthermore bioreactors r8 r9 r10 and r11 were operated at the c n ratios of 1 1 2 1 3 1 and 5 1 respectively a pilot scale unit was operated using an ao process to treat real municipal wastewater and the influent was directly introduced to a rotational flow grit chamber with a continuous flow mode of 40 m3 d the pilot scale system was conducted in a stainless steel vessel anoxic tank l w h of 1500 1870 1800 mm oxic tank l w h of 2400 1600 2800 mm and secondary settling tank taper angle of 120 fig 1b with an effective volume of 16 93 m3 the reflux ratio of the sludge mixture was controlled at 80 and 100 using a peristaltic pump the suspended carriers with an average mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of 3000 3500 mg l were obtained from an aerobic tank in lucun wwtp and the filling ratio of denitrification suspended carriers mlvss 1600 1800 mg l in the anoxic tank was 50 2 2 analytical methods chemical oxygen demand cod nitrite nitrate tn mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mlvss were regularly measured in accordance with the standard method apha 1998 the biofilm on the surface of the denitrification biofilm was generally tightly bounded thus a dropper brush was used to scrape the biomass zhang et al 2013 the density Ï and thickness l of biofilms were measured on the basis of the following equations 1 Ï v s s v 1 2 l v s s p where vss g m2 represents the biomass of the suspended carriers and v1 m3 m2 denotes the biofilm volume on the surface area of the carriers alves et al 2002 shi et al 2015 the morphology and structure of biofilms were observed using a scanning electron microscope su1510 hitachi japan the specific denitrification rates were determined in accordance with the modified method described by shi et al 2015 3

content in bioreactor and nitrate produced in pilot scale system respectively do and ph were monitored using a portable multiparameter meter wtw 3430 germany the eps extraction was performed on the basis of the formaldehyde naoh protocol adav et al 2008 and the total polysaccharides ps and total protein pn concentrations of loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were quantified by dubois and lowry methods respectively to evaluate the structure of the denitrification biofilm dubois et al 1956 lowry et al 1951 2 3 flow cytometry a flow cytometry analysis of denitrification biofilm was performed through a flow cytometer facsaria ii bd co ltd usa and the modified measurement was using the procedures by guo et al 2014 and guedes and de souza et al 2018 approximately 10 ml of scraped biomass mixture from denitrification suspended carriers was diluted by using a phosphate buffer ph 7 2 and loaded in a 100 ml volumetric flask then the samples were filtered by using a 10 Î¼m nylon membrane and the filtrate was transferred to the centrifuge tube after the centrifugation at 8000 rpm min for 5 min the supernate was discharged and 0 3 ml 10x annexin v binding buffer was introduced to dilute the residuals in a centrifuge tube subsequently 0 5 Î¼l pi stain and 0 5 Î¼l fitc annexin v stain were added to the control groups and a combined 0 5 Î¼l pi and 0 5 Î¼l fitc annexin v stains were dosed to the experimental groups the mixture was further incubated in a light resistant container for 15 min finally detection was conducted in the flow cytometer the cell distribution of denitrification biofilm based on flow cytometry were complex therefore the correlation analysis with eps was expressed using statistical analysis software called statistical product and service solutions spss 19 0 2 4 microbial community structure biofilm samples from denitrification biofilm were collected through the pilot scale ao process and the dna of the biofilm samples was extracted using a bacterial genomic dna extraction kit abigen china the extracted rdna was subsequently amplified through polymerase chain reaction pcr using universal primers namely 341f Ê¹5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3Ê¹ and 785r Ê¹5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3Ê¹ in a 25 Î¼l pcr mixture the genomic dna and pcr products were analyzed through electrophoresis in 1 agarose gel finally the positive clones were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform at genergy biotechnology shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of denitrification biofilm after preservation 3 1 1 basic characteristics after the long term preservation 5 months the denitrification suspended carriers were extracted from p1 p2 and p3 and the basic characteristics were measured before reactivation the denitrification biofilm notably changed in appearance and physical properties during the preservation process table 2 the denitrification suspended carriers from p1 turned from brown yellow to dark yellow and the denitrification biofilm clearly disintegrated because many biofilm debris were observed thus the corresponding mlvss of denitrification biofilm drastically decreased from 6 27 g m2 to 4 98 g m2 however denitrification biofilms stored in p2 and p3 had no significant variations and turned to brown black and dark brown in addition the mlvss slightly decreased from 6 27 g m2 to 6 03 and 5 80 g m2 the biofilm density of denitrification biofilm remained stable whereas the thickness of the biofilm from p1 distinctly decreased from 202 Î¼m to 171 Î¼m supplementary fig 1a illustrates that the biofilm from p1 is seemingly flaky and friable given its relatively low mlvss and thin layer the appearance of denitrification biofilm from p2 and p3 had minimal changes however additional channels were observed in supplementary fig 1c considering the release of meltwater from the freeze thaw process diak and ormeci 2018 the bioactivity of stored denitrification biofilm was evaluated and had exhibited relatively low denitrification rate nitrate and cod removal performance the reduction in the mlvss mlss table 2 demonstrated that cell hydrolysis and anaerobic fermentation may occur during the preservation process wang et al 2008 and the variation in colour and biofilm thickness implies that the microbial community succession occurred during the preservation process microbial activity can be maintained through endogenous respiration under a long term starvation condition and hydrolysis and endogenous respiration rate have increased with temperature gao et al 2012 therefore the denitrification suspended carriers from p1 presented poor bioactivity after long term preservation furthermore the experimental results indicated that the preservation temperature influences the denitrification biofilm properties whereas the storage at 4 c and 20 c had limited effect on the physical structure of denitrification suspended carriers and were conducive to long term stability storage 3 1 2 flow cytometry characteristics the cell cycle of the denitrification biofilm after the preservation process was expressed through flow cytometry fig 2 the ratio of viable and dead cells from denitrification biofilm in the anoxic tank was up to 85 0 and 0 8 correspondingly thereby demonstrating a high microbial activity however the viable cell ratio of the denitrification biofilms from p1 p2 and p3 decreased considerably and the viable cell ratios were 59 4 65 1 and 43 1 respectively thus implying that the storage temperature of 20 c is unsuitable for preserving denitrification suspended carriers the decline in biomass and the detachment of biofilm from denitrification suspended carriers may result in the augmentation of dead cells petrova and sauer 2016 the relatively high viable cell ratio clearly described that the denitrification biofilm in p2 displayed a remarkable bioactivity based on the denitrification rate and nitrate and cod removal table 2 in addition dead cells sharply increased along with the accumulation of early and late stage apoptotic cells that transformed from viable cells most cells may remain in a cell dormant state during the preservation process and endogenous respiration or severe temperature lead to the increase in dead cells friedrich and takacs 2013 hoang et al 2014 the ratio of the late stage apoptotic to dead cells was 1 2 times higher in p1 than in p2 therefore the storage temperature of 4 c was considered a proper and feasible preservation condition 3 2 characteristics of the denitrification biofilm after reactivation 3 2 1 basic characteristics the characteristics of the denitrification biofilms from r1 r2 and r3 recovered progressively during the month of the reactivation process table 2 a biofilm under different storage temperatures appeared as brown yellow and its biomass and thickness gradually recovered supplementary fig 2 depicts that the nitrate and cod removal of r2 only occurred for 3 days and reached 90 and 60 respectively however 5 6 days was required for the denitrification biofilm from r3 to achieve the same level the nitrate removal in r1 was up to 90 in 6 days but the cod removal remained lower than 60 throughout the reactivation process in addition the denitrification rate of the anoxic biofilm was 4 93 5 60 and 5 32 gno3 n m2 d thus indicating that 4 c is appropriate for preservation and maintaining a relatively high denitrification capacity table 2 3 2 2 variations in eps eps is a complex mixture of polymers that are secreted by microorganisms and constituted mainly by the pn and ps liu et al 2004 sheng et al 2010 these concentrations also play an important role in cell adhesion and biofilm formation the initial eps content of the denitrification biofilm is lower in r1 than in r2 and r3 thus indicating that the protective layer formed by eps during the starvation period preservation phase serves as the energy source to maintain bioactivity ruijssenaars et al 2000 ye et al 2011 furthermore biodegrading eps in r1 has considerably increased at 20 c and has led to biofilm deterioration and loss of biomass retention subsequently the eps content gradually increased and maintained its stability at the end of the reactivation process fig 3 a which is beneficial for biological adhesion and biomass aggregation and further enhanced the nitrate removal fig 3b and c and supplementary fig 3a display that the tb eps content is remarkably higher than the lb eps content therefore the tb eps was considered the major factor in the biofilm formation process the respective pn content from the tb eps decreased to 19 0 26 1 and 24 5 mg g mlss in the first 3 days then the pn content in r1 r2 and r3 increased progressively and corresponding content reached its maximum of up to 35 1 39 7 and 36 0 26 2 mg g mlss however the tendency of ps was not synchronized with the variation in pn the decrease in the ps content in r2 and r3 lasted for 6 consecutive days and then gradually recovered and the ps content in r1 remained at a relatively low content for more than 9 days the pn ps ratio supplementary fig 3b improved accordingly with the prominent increase in the pn content in the tb eps thereby implying that the stabilization of denitrification biofilms are enhanced ruijssenaars et al 2000 chen et al 2013 the pn ps ratio in r2 showed a distinct trend which increased after 15 days and finally maintained the value of 2 7 the saltation of the pn ps ratio was mainly due to the variation in the pn content fig 3a and b thus indicating that the adhesion of cells through a polymeric matrix can be enhanced and promoted wang et al 2017 eps played an important role in microbial adhesion and surface physicochemical characteristics flemming and wingender 2010 sheng et al 2010 therefore a denitrification biofilm with high eps content is conducive to retaining the internal biofilm structure the high protein content of eps will increase the cross linked network between adjacent cells and maintain the internal microstructure of biofilms mcswain et al 2005 tan et al 2014 moreover the protein in the tb eps can promote denitrification biofilm formation and maintain the stabilization of biomass thus suggesting that the protein content of the tb eps under low temperature can maintain a relatively high amount of biomass table 2 after reactivation zhang et al 2015 3 2 3 flow cytometry characteristics in accordance with the biomass denitrification rate and nitrate removal during preservation and reactivation processes 4 c is favorable for storing the denitrification suspended carriers the flow cytometry analysis also showed the viable cell ratio preserved at 4 c is the highest followed by the temperatures of 20 c and 20 c in which the preservation conditions should be established on the basis of flow cytometry the flow cytometry analysis of denitrification biofilm in r2 is illustrated in fig 4 the viable cell ratio increased whereas the dead cell ratio slightly decreased along with the reactivation process thereby indicating that the microbial activity of denitrification biofilms gradually recovered moreover the variation tendency of the viable cell ratio was approximately accompanied by the protein content in the tb eps and eps contents the relatively high ratio of a viable cell may lead to the rapid growth of eps haffele et al 2018 kopycinska et al 2018 which was facilitated to improve microbial adhesion further strengthen the biofilm structure sheng et al 2010 and progressively reduce the dead cell ratio the correlation analysis of viable cell ratio was conducted by using spss to evaluate the performance of denitrification biofilm table 3 displays that the protein content in tb eps pn ps of tb eps and tb eps have a remarkably positive correlation with the viable cell ratio the relatively high content of protein in tb eps signified that the cell adhesion will increase with the hydrophobic groups from protein through a polymeric matrix xu et al 2011 cao et al 2016 the high related pn ps of tb eps demonstrates that the internal structure of denitrification biofilm provides a favorable circumstance gao et al 2012 for viable cells by decreasing the influence of a high shear rate zhao et al 2013 the biomass i e mlvss and thickness l of denitrification biofilm were positively correlated with the viable cell ratio and the increase in biomass and thickness indicated the high secretion of eps fig 3a and b and subsequently prevented the detachment of biofilm and improve nitrate removal table 2 additional time and complex operations were required for the reactivation process of denitrification biofilm therefore flow cytometry analysis was reasonable and suitable for evaluating the performances of denitrification suspended carriers during the preservation and reactivation process which can consume minimal operation and save considerable time in each reactivation process given the remarkable correlation of the viable cell ratio and microbial characteristics 3 2 4 feasibility of denitrification suspended carriers table 4 presents the performance of denitrification suspended carriers under different temperatures and c n ratios the denitrification rates of denitrification biofilm from r4 r5 r6 and r7 were 3 36 4 41 5 07 and 5 70 gno3 n m2 d correspondingly although the denitrification rate remarkably decreased at low temperatures a relatively high nitrate removal welander and mattiasson 2003 which can be attributed to the formation of temperature gradient by eps in denitrification biofilm has been accomplished sheng et al 2010 wang et al 2012 in addition the microbial activity of denitrification biofilm performs well when the c n ratio was low thereby indicating that eps serves as the maintenance energy source for nitrate removal wang et al 2008 with less footprint and high denitrification rate the reactivated denitrification biofilm performed good tn removal capacity under low temperature and low c n ratio are a promising upgrade technology for wwtps 3 3 performances of preserved denitrification biofilm in the pilot scale ao process 3 3 1 denitrification performance and tn removal denitrification suspended carriers preserved at 4 c obtained the optimal denitrification activity during the reactivation process the denitrification biofilm stored at 20 c showed the poorest performance and that at 20 c has an average performance therefore the denitrification suspended carriers from p2 were eventually inoculated with the volumetric ratio of 50 and the performance of tn removal during 40 days of long term operation is displayed in fig 5 the pilot scale ao process obtained a stable operation state after 10 days because the tn removal remained steady and the denitrification rate slightly increased the average effluent tn was 5 7 mg l with a corresponding removal percentage of 83 9 moreover the nitrite content maintained an extreme low level which took little effect to tn removal in pilot scale ao process a sharp increase in the denitrification rate was observed in the slope thereby suggesting the remarkable adaptation of preserved denitrification biofilm the average denitrification rate reached as high as 5 36 gno3 n m2 d which was significantly higher than those of biofilms that used an external carbon source as the electron donor aspegren et al 1998 welander and mattiasson 2003 in addition the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption has increased from 0 18 gno3 n g cod to 0 25 gno3 n g cod the results are close to those of previous studies described by dosing ethanol as an organic carbon source de barbadillo et al 2008 shi et al 2015 the microbial activity of the denitrification biofilm drastically enhanced however the increase factors of denitrification rate and the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption along with the operation of the pilot scale ao process were different at the respective increase factors of 2 29 and 1 33 the possible reason for the disparity was the requirement of carbon source and the relatively low increase factor of the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption might be limited by biofilm growth and phosphorus removal from cod utilization 3 3 2 microbial community structure the initial preserved denitrification biofilm possessed a high microbial diversity where dechloromonas unclassified bacteroidetes and nitrospira were the predominant genus fig 6 a however the microbial community structure of denitrification biofilm significantly shifted the abundance of unclassified bacteroidetes changed from 9 0 to 13 8 11 8 10 5 and 1 9 moreover nitrospira and unclassified rhodospirillaceae nearly went extinct along with the operation of the pilot scale ao process the possible reason is the anoxic condition and the stable domestic sewage quality introduced to the anoxic tank yang et al 2015 thelusmond et al moreover other bacteria presented community succession which was 45 0 in preserved denitrification biofilm and subsequently diminished to as low as 3 8 after 40 days of operation dechloromonas exhibits an important relationship with dramatic nitrogen and phosphorus removal capacity yang et al 2011 shen et al 2013 dechloromonas accounted for only 6 4 of preserved denitrification biofilm which increased prevalently during the operation of the pilot scale ao process and finally enriched to 27 6 in addition dynamic microbial communities were observed in denitrification biofilms given the consistent enrichment of pseudomonas parcubacteria acidovorax aquabacterium and unclassified flavobacteriaceae the notable importance of the bacterial strains is indicated by the biofilm formation favorable adaptation to anoxic condition and nutrient conservation lv et al 2014 nelson and stegen 2015 zhang et al 2016 dutta et al 2018 peng et al 2018 however the remarkable decrease in bacterial strains unclassified alphaproteobacteria ignavibacterium and fusibacter were associated with the increase of denitrification the distance heat map at the genus level fig 6b suggested that the microbial community sampled from day 10 was remarkably different from the denitrification suspended carriers that were collected from day 0 20 30 and 40 the denitrification biofilm day 20 revealed a relatively high similarity with the denitrification biofilm obtained from day 30 and 40 given the high denitrification performance and formation of dominant species wan et al 2015 in the pilot scale ao process after 20 days 3 3 3 flow cytometry characteristics the viable cell ratio increased by a factor of 1 3 in accordance with the flow cytometry analysis of the denitrification biofilm thereby implying that a comparatively high pn content in eps could be obtained through microbial synthesis which was conducive to biomass adhesion and structure stabilization table 3 therefore the preserved denitrification suspended carriers presented remarkable tn removal and high bioactivity in the pilot scale ao process and the remarkable positive correlation between viable cell ratio and the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption was discovered table 5 in addition the chao ace shannon and simpson indices in terms of denitrification biofilm were positively correlated with the viable cell ratio these indices presented a correlation coefficient of 0 789 0 760 0 851 and 0 790 respectively the enrichment of denitrifiers and the stable structure of microbial community was beneficial to performing the tn removal independently and further maintaining the steady operation of the pilot scale ao process the flow cytometry analysis based on the viable cell ratio could be associated with the microbial characteristics and community structure during the preservation reactivation and pilot scale operation process which could be a promising method for evaluating the performance of denitrification biofilm 4 conclusions with the slight decrease of biomass and denitrification rate and the constant biofilm density and thickness the cells of denitrification suspended carriers entered hibernate according to flow cytometry analysis in accordance with the protein content in tb eps biomass denitrification rate and nitrate removal during preservation and reactivation process 4 c was in favor of storing the denitrification suspended carriers the average effluent tn was 5 7 mg l and the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption increased from 0 18 to 0 25 gno3 n gcod in pilot scale ao process the significantly positive correlation between viable cell ratio and the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption presented flow cytometry analysis was promising and desirable to evaluate the performances of denitrification biofilm which can further consume less operation and save considerable time from reactivation process acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the

19209,the work provides a method on the basis of flow cytometry to evaluate the performance of denitrification biofilm during the preservation reactivation and pilot scale operation process the viable cell ratio of denitrification biofilm significantly reduced and further led to the decrease of denitrification capacity after long term preservation for 5 months protein component in tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances tb eps could serve to enhance microbial adhesion and promote denitrification biofilm formation with the significant correlation of viable cell ratio and microbial characteristics 4 c was more appropriate for preserving denitrification biofilm and conducive to maintain the relatively high denitrification capacity a maximum denitrification rate of 5 80 gno3 n m2 d was obtained in pilot scale anoxic oxic ao process and dechloromonas became greater prevalence in denitrification suspended carriers furthermore the enrichment of pseudomonas parcubacteria acidovorax aquabacterium and unclassified flavobacteriaceae enhanced biofilm formation and nutrient conservation the significantly positive correlation between viable cell ratio and the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption was discovered and the indices of chao ace shannon and simpson of denitrification biofilm were positively correlated with viable cell ratio meaning that flow cytometry analysis was reasonable and suitable to evaluate the performances of denitrification biofilm graphical abstract image 1 keywords flow cytometry denitrification biofilm long term preservation tb eps microbial community structure 1 introduction recent concerns on total nitrogen tn removal from wastewater become increasingly compulsory because nitrogen hazard and nitrous oxide emission are wildly investigated in detail law et al 2012 lackner et al 2014 especially when a stringent wastewater discharge standard is newly issued upgrades to wastewater treatment plants wwtps are subsequently established to demonstrate favorable tn removal performance yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 however the construction cost and project cycle of these upgrades are high and extensive respectively a wastewater treatment process that is based on biofilm becomes prevalent because it has a minimal footprint and low sludge production which is facilitated to improve the operational capacity and further decrease the operation cost of wwtps mcquarrie and boltz 2011 hoang et al 2014 moving bed bioreactor mbbr is a flexible biofilm process that mainly relies on buoyant plastic suspended carriers and can avoid clogs and enhance fluidization effectively thereby resulting in favorable nitrification and denitrification capabilities in wwtps su et al 2016 young et al 2017 the lack of carbon source and the deficiency of denitrifiers significantly influence tn removal gao et al 2010 sodium acetate or acetic acid are generally used as the carbon source in wwtps and cultivating denitrification biofilm can accumulate denitrifiers and maintain nitrate reduction capacity effectively shi et al 2015 the mbbr process has been extensively examined for denitrification yuan et al 2015 lima et al 2016 nitrate removal ratio has attained up to 77 4 in autotrophic denitrification su et al 2016 and the maximum nitrogen removal rate has reached 5 1 kgn m3 d when polyethylene glycol gel is used as a carrier isaka et al 2012 the adoption of the mbbr process for denitrification is a cost effective way of upgrading wwtps biofilm formation is a dynamic process of growth and detachment that is generally influenced by substrate concentration hydraulic shear force and extracellular polymeric substance eps adsorption sheng et al 2010 huang et al 2018 xing and islam demonstrated that the shortage in carbon source during the denitrification process can accelerate detachment rate and decrease biofilm thickness xing et al 2000 islam et al 2009 and the relatively low c n ratio can directly affect eps secretion and result in unstable biofilm structure ye et al 2011 fish et al 2017 in addition the growth of denitrifiers in buoyant plastic suspended carriers is remarkably slow that is the start up of mbbr denitrification requires 4 6 weeks aspegren et al 1998 consequently preserving and reactivating denitrification suspended carriers in new wwtps may considerably enhance the tn removal within a short time moreover preserving and reactivating denitrification biofilm offer an effective and stable method for reducing the impact of nitrogen menace and maintaining nitrogen balance the biofilm storage can be achieved under different preservation substrates and temperatures gao et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 however the reactivation process of biofilm is complex and time consuming gao et al 2012 yuan et al 2012 at present detailed research on estimating bioactivity reactivation remains sparse and long term reactivation experiments are commonly required therefore investigating a novel method for evaluating the properties of denitrification biofilm and its pilot scale practical application has become crucial and necessary flow cytometry is introduced in the biomedical domain to characterize and differentiate the cell states and mechanisms of cell death apoptosis and necrosis darzynkiewica et al 1992 currently the microbial activity of bacteria and the process and mechanism of a cell cycle in wastewater and sludge are analyzed on the basis of flow cytometry foladori et al 2007 schmidt et al 2018 an in situ identification of bacteria in sludge samples is designed and the disintegration of numerous cells can even be observed through flow cytometry during sonication to wastewater snaidr et al 1997 foladori et al 2007 because the approach for illuminating the identification and quantification of viable and dead bacteria is promising thus adopting flow cytometry to evaluate the performance and predict the bioactivity of activated sludge and denitrification biofilm is required therefore this study aims to discover a suitable method based on flow cytometry to appraise the characteristics of preserved and reactivated denitrification biofilm this study also aims to ascertain the optimal preservation condition of denitrification biofilm and investigate their performances and microbial community structure in a pilot scale anoxic oxic ao process moreover this study is conducted to offer valuable information for the preservation reactivation and practical application of denitrification biofilm which are beneficial for the tn removal in wwtps under new circumstances 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operation 2 1 1 denitrification suspended carriers and liquidus substrates denitrification suspended carriers were obtained from an anoxic tank in lucun wuxi china wwtp through an anaerobic ao process the denitrification suspended carriers were subsequently transferred to a serum bottle with 400 ml preservation substrates at a volumetric ratio of 50 after removing the residual wastewater components table 1 three storage schemes namely p1 stored at 20 c p2 stored at 4 c and p3 stored at 20 c were designed the stored denitrification suspended carriers were collected from p1 p2 and p3 after five months and were subsequently revived in denitrification bioreactors r1 r2 and r3 under the same operating conditions the preservation and reactivation of substrates used synthetic substrates table 1 and a simplified diagram of a denitrification bioreactor is depicted in fig 1 a the components and their concentrations of preservation and reactivation substrates mg l were listed as naac 240 kno3 80 0 kh2po4 10 0 cacl2 20 0 mgso4 15 0 and nahco3 100 0 the tn removal performances under different temperatures and c n ratios were investigated to evaluate the feasibility of reactivated denitrification biofilm moreover the operation characteristics of denitrification biofilm in a pilot scale ao process fig 1b were finally explored table 1 summarizes the raw influent components and their concentrations 2 1 2 bioreactor set up and operation bioreactors r1 r2 and r3 were inoculated with the denitrification suspended carriers from p1 p2 and p3 correspondingly the reactivation experiment was conducted in a double jacked plexiglass vessel internal diameter of 18 cm and height of 35 cm fig 1a with an effective volume of 8 0 l the reactors were continuously fed by a peristaltic pump from a feed tank and the effluent was discharged at the top of the bioreactor accordingly reaction ph dissolved oxygen do and hydraulic retention time were adjusted to 7 0 7 5 below 0 1 mg l and 3 h respectively after obtaining the optimal preservation and reactivation strategy the feasibility of denitrification suspended carriers under different temperatures and c n ratios was subsequently established using the same operational conditions bioreactors r4 r5 r6 and r7 were operated at 8 c 12 c 15 c and 20 c correspondingly furthermore bioreactors r8 r9 r10 and r11 were operated at the c n ratios of 1 1 2 1 3 1 and 5 1 respectively a pilot scale unit was operated using an ao process to treat real municipal wastewater and the influent was directly introduced to a rotational flow grit chamber with a continuous flow mode of 40 m3 d the pilot scale system was conducted in a stainless steel vessel anoxic tank l w h of 1500 1870 1800 mm oxic tank l w h of 2400 1600 2800 mm and secondary settling tank taper angle of 120 fig 1b with an effective volume of 16 93 m3 the reflux ratio of the sludge mixture was controlled at 80 and 100 using a peristaltic pump the suspended carriers with an average mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of 3000 3500 mg l were obtained from an aerobic tank in lucun wwtp and the filling ratio of denitrification suspended carriers mlvss 1600 1800 mg l in the anoxic tank was 50 2 2 analytical methods chemical oxygen demand cod nitrite nitrate tn mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mlvss were regularly measured in accordance with the standard method apha 1998 the biofilm on the surface of the denitrification biofilm was generally tightly bounded thus a dropper brush was used to scrape the biomass zhang et al 2013 the density Ï and thickness l of biofilms were measured on the basis of the following equations 1 Ï v s s v 1 2 l v s s p where vss g m2 represents the biomass of the suspended carriers and v1 m3 m2 denotes the biofilm volume on the surface area of the carriers alves et al 2002 shi et al 2015 the morphology and structure of biofilms were observed using a scanning electron microscope su1510 hitachi japan the specific denitrification rates were determined in accordance with the modified method described by shi et al 2015 3

basis of the formaldehyde naoh protocol adav et al 2008 and the total polysaccharides ps and total protein pn concentrations of loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were quantified by dubois and lowry methods respectively to evaluate the structure of the denitrification biofilm dubois et al 1956 lowry et al 1951 2 3 flow cytometry a flow cytometry analysis of denitrification biofilm was performed through a flow cytometer facsaria ii bd co ltd usa and the modified measurement was using the procedures by guo et al 2014 and guedes and de souza et al 2018 approximately 10 ml of scraped biomass mixture from denitrification suspended carriers was diluted by using a phosphate buffer ph 7 2 and loaded in a 100 ml volumetric flask then the samples were filtered by using a 10 Î¼m nylon membrane and the filtrate was transferred to the centrifuge tube after the centrifugation at 8000 rpm min for 5 min the supernate was discharged and 0 3 ml 10x annexin v binding buffer was introduced to dilute the residuals in a centrifuge tube subsequently 0 5 Î¼l pi stain and 0 5 Î¼l fitc annexin v stain were added to the control groups and a combined 0 5 Î¼l pi and 0 5 Î¼l fitc annexin v stains were dosed to the experimental groups the mixture was further incubated in a light resistant container for 15 min finally detection was conducted in the flow cytometer the cell distribution of denitrification biofilm based on flow cytometry were complex therefore the correlation analysis with eps was expressed using statistical analysis software called statistical product and service solutions spss 19 0 2 4 microbial community structure biofilm samples from denitrification biofilm were collected through the pilot scale ao process and the dna of the biofilm samples was extracted using a bacterial genomic dna extraction kit abigen china the extracted rdna was subsequently amplified through polymerase chain reaction pcr using universal primers namely 341f Ê¹5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3Ê¹ and 785r Ê¹5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3Ê¹ in a 25 Î¼l pcr mixture the genomic dna and pcr products were analyzed through electrophoresis in 1 agarose gel finally the positive clones were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform at genergy biotechnology shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of denitrification biofilm after preservation 3 1 1 basic characteristics after the long term preservation 5 months the denitrification suspended carriers were extracted from p1 p2 and p3 and the basic characteristics were measured before reactivation the denitrification biofilm notably changed in appearance and physical properties during the preservation process table 2 the denitrification suspended carriers from p1 turned from brown yellow to dark yellow and the denitrification biofilm clearly disintegrated because many biofilm debris were observed thus the corresponding mlvss of denitrification biofilm drastically decreased from 6 27 g m2 to 4 98 g m2 however denitrification biofilms stored in p2 and p3 had no significant variations and turned to brown black and dark brown in addition the mlvss slightly decreased from 6 27 g m2 to 6 03 and 5 80 g m2 the biofilm density of denitrification biofilm remained stable whereas the thickness of the biofilm from p1 distinctly decreased from 202 Î¼m to 171 Î¼m supplementary fig 1a illustrates that the biofilm from p1 is seemingly flaky and friable given its relatively low mlvss and thin layer the appearance of denitrification biofilm from p2 and p3 had minimal changes however additional channels were observed in supplementary fig 1c considering the release of meltwater from the freeze thaw process diak and ormeci 2018 the bioactivity of stored denitrification biofilm was evaluated and had exhibited relatively low denitrification rate nitrate and cod removal performance the reduction in the mlvss mlss table 2 demonstrated that cell hydrolysis and anaerobic fermentation may occur during the preservation process wang et al 2008 and the variation in colour and biofilm thickness implies that the microbial community succession occurred during the preservation process microbial activity can be maintained through endogenous respiration under a long term starvation condition and hydrolysis and endogenous respiration rate have increased with temperature gao et al 2012 therefore the denitrification suspended carriers from p1 presented poor bioactivity after long term preservation furthermore the experimental results indicated that the preservation temperature influences the denitrification biofilm properties whereas the storage at 4 c and 20 c had limited effect on the physical structure of denitrification suspended carriers and were conducive to long term stability storage 3 1 2 flow cytometry characteristics the cell cycle of the denitrification biofilm after the preservation process was expressed through flow cytometry fig 2 the ratio of viable and dead cells from denitrification biofilm in the anoxic tank was up to 85 0 and 0 8 correspondingly thereby demonstrating a high microbial activity however the viable cell ratio of the denitrification biofilms from p1 p2 and p3 decreased considerably and the viable cell ratios were 59 4 65 1 and 43 1 respectively thus implying that the storage temperature of 20 c is unsuitable for preserving denitrification suspended carriers the decline in biomass and the detachment of biofilm from denitrification suspended carriers may result in the augmentation of dead cells petrova and sauer 2016 the relatively high viable cell ratio clearly described that the denitrification biofilm in p2 displayed a remarkable bioactivity based on the denitrification rate and nitrate and cod removal table 2 in addition dead cells sharply increased along with the accumulation of early and late stage apoptotic cells that transformed from viable cells most cells may remain in a cell dormant state during the preservation process and endogenous respiration or severe temperature lead to the increase in dead cells friedrich and takacs 2013 hoang et al 2014 the ratio of the late stage apoptotic to dead cells was 1 2 times higher in p1 than in p2 therefore the storage temperature of 4 c was considered a proper and feasible preservation condition 3 2 characteristics of the denitrification biofilm after reactivation 3 2 1 basic characteristics the characteristics of the denitrification biofilms from r1 r2 and r3 recovered progressively during the month of the reactivation process table 2 a biofilm under different storage temperatures appeared as brown yellow and its biomass and thickness gradually recovered supplementary fig 2 depicts that the nitrate and cod removal of r2 only occurred for 3 days and reached 90 and 60 respectively however 5 6 days was required for the denitrification biofilm from r3 to achieve the same level the nitrate removal in r1 was up to 90 in 6 days but the cod removal remained lower than 60 throughout the reactivation process in addition the denitrification rate of the anoxic biofilm was 4 93 5 60 and 5 32 gno3 n m2 d thus indicating that 4 c is appropriate for preservation and maintaining a relatively high denitrification capacity table 2 3 2 2 variations in eps eps is a complex mixture of polymers that are secreted by microorganisms and constituted mainly by the pn and ps liu et al 2004 sheng et al 2010 these concentrations also play an important role in cell adhesion and biofilm formation the initial eps content of the denitrification biofilm is lower in r1 than in r2 and r3 thus indicating that the protective layer formed by eps during the starvation period preservation phase serves as the energy source to maintain bioactivity ruijssenaars et al 2000 ye et al 2011 furthermore biodegrading eps in r1 has considerably increased at 20 c and has led to biofilm deterioration and loss of biomass retention subsequently the eps content gradually increased and maintained its stability at the end of the reactivation process fig 3 a which is beneficial for biological adhesion and biomass aggregation and further enhanced the nitrate removal fig 3b and c and supplementary fig 3a display that the tb eps content is remarkably higher than the lb eps content therefore the tb eps was considered the major factor in the biofilm formation process the respective pn content from the tb eps decreased to 19 0 26 1 and 24 5 mg g mlss in the first 3 days then the pn content in r1 r2 and r3 increased progressively and corresponding content reached its maximum of up to 35 1 39 7 and 36 0 26 2 mg g mlss however the tendency of ps was not synchronized with the variation in pn the decrease in the ps content in r2 and r3 lasted for 6 consecutive days and then gradually recovered and the ps content in r1 remained at a relatively low content for more than 9 days the pn ps ratio supplementary fig 3b improved accordingly with the prominent increase in the pn content in the tb eps thereby implying that the stabilization of denitrification biofilms are enhanced ruijssenaars et al 2000 chen et al 2013 the pn ps ratio in r2 showed a distinct trend which increased after 15 days and finally maintained the value of 2 7 the saltation of the pn ps ratio was mainly due to the variation in the pn content fig 3a and b thus indicating that the adhesion of cells through a polymeric matrix can be enhanced and promoted wang et al 2017 eps played an important role in microbial adhesion and surface physicochemical characteristics flemming and wingender 2010 sheng et al 2010 therefore a denitrification biofilm with high eps content is conducive to retaining the internal biofilm structure the high protein content of eps will increase the cross linked network between adjacent cells and maintain the internal microstructure of biofilms mcswain et al 2005 tan et al 2014 moreover the protein in the tb eps can promote denitrification biofilm formation and maintain the stabilization of biomass thus suggesting that the protein content of the tb eps under low temperature can maintain a relatively high amount of biomass table 2 after reactivation zhang et al 2015 3 2 3 flow cytometry characteristics in accordance with the biomass denitrification rate and nitrate removal during preservation and reactivation processes 4 c is favorable for storing the denitrification suspended carriers the flow cytometry analysis also showed the viable cell ratio preserved at 4 c is the highest followed by the temperatures of 20 c and 20 c in which the preservation conditions should be established on the basis of flow cytometry the flow cytometry analysis of denitrification biofilm in r2 is illustrated in fig 4 the viable cell ratio increased whereas the dead cell ratio slightly decreased along with the reactivation process thereby indicating that the microbial activity of denitrification biofilms gradually recovered moreover the variation tendency of the viable cell ratio was approximately accompanied by the protein content in the tb eps and eps contents the relatively high ratio of a viable cell may lead to the rapid growth of eps haffele et al 2018 kopycinska et al 2018 which was facilitated to improve microbial adhesion further strengthen the biofilm structure sheng et al 2010 and progressively reduce the dead cell ratio the correlation analysis of viable cell ratio was conducted by using spss to evaluate the performance of denitrification biofilm table 3 displays that the protein content in tb eps pn ps of tb eps and tb eps have a remarkably positive correlation with the viable cell ratio the relatively high content of protein in tb eps signified that the cell adhesion will increase with the hydrophobic groups from protein through a polymeric matrix xu et al 2011 cao et al 2016 the high related pn ps of tb eps demonstrates that the internal structure of denitrification biofilm provides a favorable circumstance gao et al 2012 for viable cells by decreasing the influence of a high shear rate zhao et al 2013 the biomass i e mlvss and thickness l of denitrification biofilm were positively correlated with the viable cell ratio and the increase in biomass and thickness indicated the high secretion of eps fig 3a and b and subsequently prevented the detachment of biofilm and improve nitrate removal table 2 additional time and complex operations were required for the reactivation process of denitrification biofilm therefore flow cytometry analysis was reasonable and suitable for evaluating the performances of denitrification suspended carriers during the preservation and reactivation process which can consume minimal operation and save considerable time in each reactivation process given the remarkable correlation of the viable cell ratio and microbial characteristics 3 2 4 feasibility of denitrification suspended carriers table 4 presents the performance of denitrification suspended carriers under different temperatures and c n ratios the denitrification rates of denitrification biofilm from r4 r5 r6 and r7 were 3 36 4 41 5 07 and 5 70 gno3 n m2 d correspondingly although the denitrification rate remarkably decreased at low temperatures a relatively high nitrate removal welander and mattiasson 2003 which can be attributed to the formation of temperature gradient by eps in denitrification biofilm has been accomplished sheng et al 2010 wang et al 2012 in addition the microbial activity of denitrification biofilm performs well when the c n ratio was low thereby indicating that eps serves as the maintenance energy source for nitrate removal wang et al 2008 with less footprint and high denitrification rate the reactivated denitrification biofilm performed good tn removal capacity under low temperature and low c n ratio are a promising upgrade technology for wwtps 3 3 performances of preserved denitrification biofilm in the pilot scale ao process 3 3 1 denitrification performance and tn removal denitrification suspended carriers preserved at 4 c obtained the optimal denitrification activity during the reactivation process the denitrification biofilm stored at 20 c showed the poorest performance and that at 20 c has an average performance therefore the denitrification suspended carriers from p2 were eventually inoculated with the volumetric ratio of 50 and the performance of tn removal during 40 days of long term operation is displayed in fig 5 the pilot scale ao process obtained a stable operation state after 10 days because the tn removal remained steady and the denitrification rate slightly increased the average effluent tn was 5 7 mg l with a corresponding removal percentage of 83 9 moreover the nitrite content maintained an extreme low level which took little effect to tn removal in pilot scale ao process a sharp increase in the denitrification rate was observed in the slope thereby suggesting the remarkable adaptation of preserved denitrification biofilm the average denitrification rate reached as high as 5 36 gno3 n m2 d which was significantly higher than those of biofilms that used an external carbon source as the electron donor aspegren et al 1998 welander and mattiasson 2003 in addition the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption has increased from 0 18 gno3 n g cod to 0 25 gno3 n g cod the results are close to those of previous studies described by dosing ethanol as an organic carbon source de barbadillo et al 2008 shi et al 2015 the microbial activity of the denitrification biofilm drastically enhanced however the increase factors of denitrification rate and the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption along with the operation of the pilot scale ao process were different at the respective increase factors of 2 29 and 1 33 the possible reason for the disparity was the requirement of carbon source and the relatively low increase factor of the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption might be limited by biofilm growth and phosphorus removal from cod utilization 3 3 2 microbial community structure the initial preserved denitrification biofilm possessed a high microbial diversity where dechloromonas unclassified bacteroidetes and nitrospira were the predominant genus fig 6 a however the microbial community structure of denitrification biofilm significantly shifted the abundance of unclassified bacteroidetes changed from 9 0 to 13 8 11 8 10 5 and 1 9 moreover nitrospira and unclassified rhodospirillaceae nearly went extinct along with the operation of the pilot scale ao process the possible reason is the anoxic condition and the stable domestic sewage quality introduced to the anoxic tank yang et al 2015 thelusmond et al moreover other bacteria presented community succession which was 45 0 in preserved denitrification biofilm and subsequently diminished to as low as 3 8 after 40 days of operation dechloromonas exhibits an important relationship with dramatic nitrogen and phosphorus removal capacity yang et al 2011 shen et al 2013 dechloromonas accounted for only 6 4 of preserved denitrification biofilm which increased prevalently during the operation of the pilot scale ao process and finally enriched to 27 6 in addition dynamic microbial communities were observed in denitrification biofilms given the consistent enrichment of pseudomonas parcubacteria acidovorax aquabacterium and unclassified flavobacteriaceae the notable importance of the bacterial strains is indicated by the biofilm formation favorable adaptation to anoxic condition and nutrient conservation lv et al 2014 nelson and stegen 2015 zhang et al 2016 dutta et al 2018 peng et al 2018 however the remarkable decrease in bacterial strains unclassified alphaproteobacteria ignavibacterium and fusibacter were associated with the increase of denitrification the distance heat map at the genus level fig 6b suggested that the microbial community sampled from day 10 was remarkably different from the denitrification suspended carriers that were collected from day 0 20 30 and 40 the denitrification biofilm day 20 revealed a relatively high similarity with the denitrification biofilm obtained from day 30 and 40 given the high denitrification performance and formation of dominant species wan et al 2015 in the pilot scale ao process after 20 days 3 3 3 flow cytometry characteristics the viable cell ratio increased by a factor of 1 3 in accordance with the flow cytometry analysis of the denitrification biofilm thereby implying that a comparatively high pn content in eps could be obtained through microbial synthesis which was conducive to biomass adhesion and structure stabilization table 3 therefore the preserved denitrification suspended carriers presented remarkable tn removal and high bioactivity in the pilot scale ao process and the remarkable positive correlation between viable cell ratio and the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption was discovered table 5 in addition the chao ace shannon and simpson indices in terms of denitrification biofilm were positively correlated with the viable cell ratio these indices presented a correlation coefficient of 0 789 0 760 0 851 and 0 790 respectively the enrichment of denitrifiers and the stable structure of microbial community was beneficial to performing the tn removal independently and further maintaining the steady operation of the pilot scale ao process the flow cytometry analysis based on the viable cell ratio could be associated with the microbial characteristics and community structure during the preservation reactivation and pilot scale operation process which could be a promising method for evaluating the performance of denitrification biofilm 4 conclusions with the slight decrease of biomass and denitrification rate and the constant biofilm density and thickness the cells of denitrification suspended carriers entered hibernate according to flow cytometry analysis in accordance with the protein content in tb eps biomass denitrification rate and nitrate removal during preservation and reactivation process 4 c was in favor of storing the denitrification suspended carriers the average effluent tn was 5 7 mg l and the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption increased from 0 18 to 0 25 gno3 n gcod in pilot scale ao process the significantly positive correlation between viable cell ratio and the ratio of nitrate reduction to cod consumption presented flow cytometry analysis was promising and desirable to evaluate the performances of denitrification biofilm which can further consume less operation and save considerable time from reactivation process acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the
