as zno pzt etc was discovered by jacus and pierre curie in 1880 they found that there is an electrical mechanical coupling in this group of materials which was called piezoelectric materials later nowadays piezoelectric elements are beneficial in different engineering applications especially for vibration control whether as the actuator or sensor numerous studies can be found relating to vibration of piezoelectric plates in the literature sodano et al 2004 dimitriadis et al 1991 tiersten 1963 2013 nanostructures have gotten great attention by many researchers due to their superior properties goushegir and faroughi 2017 islam et al 2014 ghasemi and mohandes 2018 faroughi et al 2017 piezoelectric nanosensors and nanoactuators are widely used in many areas such as aerospace bio engineering marine engineering etc zaghloul and piazza 2013 lao et al 2007 in order to get an efficient design it is important to consider the mechanics of systems at the nanometer scale also long range interatomic and intermolecular cohesive forces have an important role in the accuracy of results at the nanoscale hence conventional continuum models are inappropriate at nanostructures sorop and de jongh 2007 wong et al 1997 modified continuum models which consider size dependent effects include nonlocal elasticity theory eringen and edelen 1972 couple stress theory zhou and li 2001 strain gradient theory fleck and hutchinson 1997 and modified couple stress theory yang et al 2002 in contrast to the conventional continuum stress at a certain point within a body at nonlocal elasticity theory is dependent on strains of the whole domain of body interest in the using of various plate theories has grown tremendously for modeling structure in the past decades an increasing number of studies have done based on classical plate theory kirchoff 1850 in order to model motions of the structure classical plate theory assumes that the normal to midplane before deformations remains straight and normal to mid surface after deformation in fact this theory which ignores transverse shear deformation effects is suitable for thin plates in order to get more accurate results first order shear deformation theory which considers transverse shear deformation effects was proposed mindlin 1951 this theory implies a constant transverse shear deformation stress along the thickness of the structure so it doesn t satisfy free stress conditions on the lower and upper surface of plate and require a shear correction factor additionally there are various higher order computational models which not only satisfy free stress condition but also consider different distributions for transverse shear stress along the thickness of plate soldatos 1992 ghugal and sayyad 2011 sayyad and ghugal 2012 the extent to which fluid can play a role in vibrational behavior of structure continues to be an issue of interest to researchers the existence of fluid around structure changes the kinetic energy of system and influences on natural frequencies and mode shapes khorshidi and bakhsheshy 2015 hence knowing about the dynamic response of structure in contact with the fluid is necessary for various areas of engineering such as submarines shipbuilding nuclear hydrodynamics and ocean engineering obtaining the frequency response of a structure in contact with the fluid is generally known as fluid structure interaction fsi problem widely analysis of fsi problems can be categorized into three methods numerical methods such as boundary element method and fluid finite element method which need a large number of computations can be applied for lots of fsi problems yadykin et al 2003 bathe et al 1995 watanabe et al 1998 analytical techniques which are limited to some special cases zhou and cheung 2000 amabili and kwak 1996 kwak and yang 2013 and a set of studies that focused on experimental methods khorshidi et al 2017 robinson and palmer 1990 askari et al 2013 the past two decades have witnessed burgeoning interest in fsi problems done according to literature khorshidi 2010 jeong et al 2008 cho et al 2015 khorshidi and bakhsheshy 2014 hashemi et al 2010 liang et al 2001 have investigated dynamic response of submerged cantilever plates with kirchoff plate model with add mass approach cho et al 2016 have presented a theoretical model for the vibration analysis of the vertical plates and stiffened panels interacting with finite fluid on one side they employed the added mass approach to obtain natural frequencies of the fluid structure system vibration analysis of bottom and vertical rectangular plates in contact with fluid under the harmonic point excitation based on the mode superposition method is investigated by seung cho et al 2015 in that study the mode reversal phenomenon was observed by changing the depth of fluid in the container kutlu et al 2012 have developed a model for rectangular and circular plates partially in contact with the fluid and resting on arbitrarily pasternak foundation based on mindlin plate theory they employed a mixed type finite element formulation in their model by applying gateaux differential shahbaztabar and ranji 2016 have studied influences of inplane loads on free vibration of laminate mindlin plates in contact with fluid using rayleigh ritz method based on chebyshev polynomials watts et al 2018 have reported vibrational characteristic of skew and trapezoidal plates coupled with fluid based on the semi analytical technique for fully simply supported and clamped supported boundary conditions they have used the element free galerkin method based on moving kriging shape functions to model the structure although our knowledge about fsi has expanded over the last two decades approximately little research has been done dealing with the effects of fluid on the vibrational behavior of nanostructures omiddezyani et al 2018 up to now no studies have been reported to consider the effects of fluid around the structure and capturing the nonlocal effects simultaneously this study is an attempt to fill this existing gap the main aim of this paper is to present an analytical model for vibrating piezoelectric nanoplates in interaction with the fluid nonlocal elasticity theory and various plate theories are used to model the structure also the fluid is assumed to be incompressible irrotational and inviscid governing equations and boundary conditions are derived using hamilton s principle and solved with the galerkin method after validation influences of different variables on wet frequencies are illustrated 2 formulation 2 1 mathematical model a piezoelectric nanoplate which is in contact with the incompressible irrotational inviscid and bounded fluid is considered a b h and ρ p are the length width thickness and density of nanoplate respectively furthermore the fluid is b 1 in depth and c in width a cartesian system is located in the corner of nanoplate to describe motions of structure and fluid as shown in fig 1 2 2 modified shear deformation theories against mindlin plate theory modified shear deformation theories are needless of the shear correction factor these theories which consider various nonlinear distribution into account for transverse shear stress along the thickness of nanoplate are presented in table 1 according to these theories the displacement field can be written in the following form 1 u 1 x y z t u x y t g z h 2 w x y t x f z h 2 ζ x y t u 2 x y z t v x y t g z h 2 w x y t y f z h 2 ψ x y t u 3 x y z t w x y t where u x y t and v x y t are in plane displacement of middle surface along x axis and y axis respectively w x y t denotes the transverse displacement of mid plane surface ζ x y t and ψ x y t are rotation angles due to bending in xoz plane and yoz plane respectively g z and f z are continuous functions which vary based on the theory under consideration according to table 1 it should be noted that two new higher order shear deformation theories i e hsdt1 and hsdt2 are presented in this table for the first time according to the above displacement field i e eq 1 in plane displacements of an arbitrary point u 1 a n d u 2 include two parts the first part which is the same as classical plate theory and the second part which is due to the shear deformation effects under the assumption of small deformations linear strain components are obtained as follows 2 ε x x u x g z 2 w x 2 f z ζ x ε y y v y g z 2 w y 2 f z ψ y ε x y 1 2 u y v x 2 g z 2 w x y f z ψ x ζ y ε x z 1 2 g z z w x ξ f z z w x ε y z 1 2 g z z w y ψ f z z w y g z g z h 2 f z f z h 2 fig 2 shows the distribution of transverse shear stress along the thickness of the structure for various plate theories it can easily be seen that modified shear deformation theories satisfy free stress conditions at the bottom z h and the top z 0 surface of the plate the distribution of electric potential must be such that satisfies maxwell equation for this purpose wang 2002 proposed a cosine distribution for electric potential in the following form 3 ϕ x y z t cos γ z γ h 2 ϕ x y t where ϕ x y t is electric potential in the middle surface of nanoplate and γ π h by using this distribution for electric potential the electric field can be obtained as follows 4 e x ϕ x c o s γ z ϕ x y t x e y ϕ y c o s γ z ϕ x y t y e z ϕ z γ s i n γ z ϕ x y t where for the sake of simplicity z z h 2 2 3 nonlocal elasticity theory nonlocal theory as one of the most applied theories in nanoscale is able to take nonlocal effects and plays a beneficial role in the nanotechnology area based on this theory stresses and electric displacements for a piezoelectric nanoplate at a reference point are expressed as 5 σ j k x α x x τ c i j k l ε k l x e k i j e k x d x 6 d i x α x x τ e i k l ε k l x κ k i j e k x d x in these constitutive equations σ d ε and e denote components of stress electric displacement strain and electric field respectively c i j k l are elastic constants e k i j and κ k i j are piezoelectric and dielectric constants is the whole volume of the nanoplate which approves that the stress at each point depends on the strains of the whole domain α x x τ is kernel function which implies nonlocal effects x x is euclidean distance and τ e 0 a l is a material constant in which e 0 represents a constant related to calibrating the model with experimental results a l denote the internal and external characteristic length respectively for the sake of simplicity eringen 1983 represented nonlocal theory in the equivalent differential form instead of integral form as follows 7 1 μ 2 σ x x c 11 ε x x c 12 ε y y e 31 e z 1 μ 2 σ y y c 12 ε x x c 11 ε y y e 31 e z 1 μ 2 σ x z 2 c 44 ε x z e 15 e x 1 μ 2 σ y z 2

0 a 2 τ l 2 is nonlocal parameter elastic and dielectric constants used in eqs 7 and 8 are given in appendix a 2 4 formulation of fluid generally vibrational modes consist of two parts in fluid structure systems the first part which is due to the vibrational behavior of the structure is bulging modes and the second part which is sloshing modes is caused by the rigid motion of the tank to model motions of fluid following assumptions are applied a the amplitude vibration of fluid is small b the fluid is assumed to be ideal c the fluid oscillation is considered to be harmonic d the sloshing effects have taken into account due to linearity of the considered problem it is possible to decompose the fluid potential velocity φ 0 into two following parts ohayon 2004 9 φ 0 φ b φ s where φ b and φ s are fluid potential velocity relating to bulging modes and sloshing modes respectively by assuming harmonic motion of the fluid fluid potential velocity can be expressed as 10 φ 0 x y z t ϕ 0 x y z t t t t i ω e i ω t where i 1 and ω is angular velocity of fluid fluid potential velocity must satisfy the laplace equation based on the continuity equation 11 2 ϕ 0 2 ϕ 0 x 2 2 ϕ 0 y 2 2 ϕ 0 z 2 2 ϕ b 2 ϕ s 0 2 ϕ b 0 2 ϕ s 0 the boundary conditions related to the fluid can be expressed as 12 a t x 0 ϕ b x ϕ s x 0 a t x a ϕ b x ϕ s x 0 a t y 0 ϕ b y ϕ s y 0 a t z c ϕ b z ϕ s z 0 a t z 0 ϕ s z 0 13 a t y b 1 ϕ b 0 14 a t z 0 ϕ b z w t where boundary conditions 12 are impermeability conditions on the walls of the container and boundary condition 13 is written under the assumption of no bulging modes on the free surface of the liquid moreover boundary condition 14 takes into account the compatibility condition at the interface of fluid and nanoplate z 0 because fluid and nanoplate keep their perfect contact at this surface using equation 11 and boundary conditions 12 13 and 14 general solution for ϕ s and ϕ b can be obtained as follows khorshidi and farhadi 2013 15 φ

necessary terms to get desirable accuracy u is unit step function which limits the domain of fluid furthermore a l 1 k 1 t represents fourier coefficients associated with the bulging modes and can be obtained after using the compatibility conditions 14 16 a l 1 k 1 t c o f f a b 1 0 a 0 b 1 w x y t t cos l 1 π x a cos 2 k 1 1 π y 2 b 1 d y d x s 1 1 e s 1 2 c c o f f 1 i f l 1 k 1 0 2 i f l 1 o r k 1 0 4 i f l 1 a n d k 1 0 i 1 j 1 l 1 and k 1 are nonnegative integers since the fluid is assumed to be ideal the kinetic energies of fluid related to the bulging and sloshing modes can be expressed as 17 t f b 1 2 ρ f 0 a 0 b 1 φ b x y 0 t w x y t t d y d x t f s 1 2 ρ f 0 a 0 b 1 φ s x y 0 t w x y t t d y d x moreover using the assumption of linearized sloshing amabili 2000 at the free surface of fluid leads to 18 ρ f φ b y y b 1 ρ f φ s y y b 1 ρ f ω 2 g φ s y b 1 0 in which g is the acceleration of gravity 2 5 governing equations of fluid structure hamilton s principle is employed to obtain the governing equations and associated boundary conditions of the system as follows 19 0 t δ t p δ t f s δ t f b δ u d t 0 in which δ is variation operator additionally tp and u denote the kinetic and strain energy of the nanoplate respectively and can be expressed as 20 u 1 2 a h 0 σ x x ε x x σ y y ε y y 2 σ x y ε x y 2 σ x z ε x z 2 σ y z ε y z d x e x d y e y d z e z d z d a 21 t p

then integrating by parts and setting the coefficients of δ u δ v δ w δ ψ δ ξ and δ ϕ to zero boundary conditions and governing equations in terms of stress resultants can be derived as follows 22 n x

to be 5 6 in the case of mindlin plate theory otherwise for other eight plate theories ks is assumed to be 1 also following boundary conditions can be written by applying hamilton s principle 29 a t x

of efficacy and reliability of current model using various plate theories is carried out for three different cases including dry frequencies of piezoelectric nanoplate wet frequencies of thin isotropic plate and wet frequencies of thick rectangular plate 3 1 1 dry fundamental frequency of piezoelectric nanoplate the dimensionless fundamental frequency ω ωa ρ p c 11 of simply supported piezoelectric nanoplate pzt4 using several plate theories for different values of the nonlocal parameter and the length to thickness ratio a h 10 40 is tabulated in table 2 moreover in this table a comparison has been provided between present work and the results existing in the literature including ke et al 2015 and liu et al 2013 in all sections of this article the piezoelectric nanoplate is assumed to be made of pzt4 with the following mechanical properties c 11 132 g p a c 12 71 g p a c 13 73 g p a c 33 115 g p a c 44 26 g p a c 66 30 5 g p a ρ p 7500 k g m 3 e 31 4 1 c m 2 e 15 10 5 c m 2 e 33 14 1 c m 2 κ 11 5 841 c v m κ 33 7 124 c v m it can be seen from table 2 that current results are in good agreement with those reported in the literature 3 1 2 wet fundamental frequency of

those performed by khorshidi and bakhsheshy 2015 3 2 results and discussion in this section results and discussion for vibrational characteristics of the piezoelectric nanoplates made of pzt4 are presented the following dimensionless parameters are utilized in this section thickness ratio δ a h aspect ratio η a b fluid depth ratio τ b 1 a fluid width ratio ς c a nonlocal parameter β e 0 a l moreover the ratio of nonlocal to local frequency and the ratio of wet to dry frequency are denoted by fr 1 ω n o n l o c a l ω l o c a l and fr 2 ω w e t ω d r y respectively first nine dry and wet mode shapes of the piezoelectric nanoplate are shown in fig 3 as seen in this figure in contrast to the dry mode shapes wet mode shapes aren t symmetric in fact the interaction of the fluid with piezoelectric nanoplate alters the kinetic energy of the system and causes a distortion in the wet mode shapes rather than the dry mode shapes furthermore it is observed that this distortion becomes more noticeable by increasing the mode number the dimensionless frequencies and mode shapes are calculated for the values of δ 20 η 1 τ ς 0 4 and β 0 the fundamental frequency parameter associated with the square piezoelectric nanoplate in contact with fluid for various values of the nonlocal parameter β 0 1 0 2 a n d 0 3 using different plate theories are listed in table 5 as seen in this table there is a similarity between the results obtained from cpt and modified shear deformation theories for great values of thickness ratio δ 20 in fact classical plate theory overestimates natural frequencies by ignoring rotary inertia and shear deformation effects also it is logical to use cpt for thin plates because these effects are negligible for thin plates besides it is evident in table 5 that frequency ratio fr1 for all plate theories under consideration are nearly equal to each other effects of the nonlocal parameter β on frequency ratio fr1 of the system are graphed in fig 4 according to this figure as the nonlocal parameter increases frequency ratio fr1 reduces because atoms can be considered as the elements which are connected to each other by the elastic springs in the nonlocal elasticity whereas constant of these springs are infinite in local elasticity therefore nonlocal effects cause more flexibility in the structure and decrease stiffness and natural frequencies the numerical results in table 5 and fig 4 have been calculated for the values of τ ς 0 5 the dimensionless fundamental wet frequencies of the piezoelectric nanoplate are given in table 6 for different values of the nonlocal parameter and aspect ratio the data in this table indicates that increasing aspect ratio in a constant length reduces degrees of freedom of the system and consequently overall stiffness and frequencies are improved variation of dimensionless fundamental frequency versus aspect ratio for various values of the nonlocal parameter are shown in fig 5 this figure reveals that nonlocal effects are more noticeable in higher values of aspect ratio which is due to the fact that the width of the nanoplate is decreased by increasing aspect ratio and consequently nonlocal effects become more prominent in smaller values of the dimensions of the nanoplate the data in table 6 and fig 5 is obtained for τ ς 0 5 and δ 10 table 7 illustrates the effects of the fluid depth ratio on the fundamental natural frequency for a piezoelectric nanoplate with a b 50 nm δ 10 ς 0 3 and β 0 1 using different plate theories this table depicts that increasing fluid depth ratio reduces the fundamental frequency with an increase in overall kinetic energy of the system fig 6 displays the variation of frequency ratio fr2 as functions of the fluid depth ratio for different modes as expected other modes reduce by increasing fluid depth as the same as fundamental mode as shown in this figure the rate of this reduction is not the same for various modes so that by increasing the mode number this rate decreases finally in fig 7 the influence of the fluid width ratio on fundamental natural frequency is demonstrated for a piezoelectric nanoplate β 0 1 when τ varies from 0 to 1 it can be observed that raising the value of ς will increase the fundamental frequency of the system this behavior continues as long as fundamental frequency takes a constant value at a particular ς which is denoted by ς i n f i n i t e it can be stated that when the value of ς is higher than ς i n f i n i t e the assumption of infinite fluid width is valid also it is evident that ς i n f i n i t e depends on the depth of fluid and increases by raising τ 4 conclusion in the present study the fluid structure interaction of piezoelectric nanoplate is investigated based on nonlocal elasticity the displacement field is written in a unified formulation so that can be converted to various plate theories such as classical mindlin reddy exponential trigonometric hyperbolic and parabolic theories as well as two new proposed theories with the assumption of the ideal fluid and satisfying the continuity equation fluid velocity potential relating to bulging and sloshing modes of fluid is obtained governing equations and associated boundary conditions of the fluid structure system are derived with hamilton s principle and are solved using the galerkin approach obtained results reveal that modified shear deformation theories have nearly the negligible difference to each other in terms of accuracy which is due to the difference in the distribution of transverse shear stresses along the thickness of the structure also it is observed that two new proposed modified shear deformation theories have acceptable accuracy as the same as other modified shear deformation theories additionally it is demonstrated that nonlocal effects are more noticeable at higher values of aspect ratio and thickness ratio because the size dependent behavior is more prominent at smaller dimensions of the structure as another conclusion the interaction of the fluid with structure creates a distortion in mode shapes so that this distortion is more notable in higher modes numerical results indicate that by increasing fluid depth the kinetic energy of the fluid structure system increases hence natural frequencies reduce so that the rate of this decreasing is smaller at higher modes moreover the evidence shows that by raising fluid width the natural frequencies increase to approach to a constant value acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the funding by arak university under

as zno pzt etc was discovered by jacus and pierre curie in 1880 they found that there is an electrical mechanical coupling in this group of materials which was called piezoelectric materials later nowadays piezoelectric elements are beneficial in different engineering applications especially for vibration control whether as the actuator or sensor numerous studies can be found relating to vibration of piezoelectric plates in the literature sodano et al 2004 dimitriadis et al 1991 tiersten 1963 2013 nanostructures have gotten great attention by many researchers due to their superior properties goushegir and faroughi 2017 islam et al 2014 ghasemi and mohandes 2018 faroughi et al 2017 piezoelectric nanosensors and nanoactuators are widely used in many areas such as aerospace bio engineering marine engineering etc zaghloul and piazza 2013 lao et al 2007 in order to get an efficient design it is important to consider the mechanics of systems at the nanometer scale also long range interatomic and intermolecular cohesive forces have an important role in the accuracy of results at the nanoscale hence conventional continuum models are inappropriate at nanostructures sorop and de jongh 2007 wong et al 1997 modified continuum models which consider size dependent effects include nonlocal elasticity theory eringen and edelen 1972 couple stress theory zhou and li 2001 strain gradient theory fleck and hutchinson 1997 and modified couple stress theory yang et al 2002 in contrast to the conventional continuum stress at a certain point within a body at nonlocal elasticity theory is dependent on strains of the whole domain of body interest in the using of various plate theories has grown tremendously for modeling structure in the past decades an increasing number of studies have done based on classical plate theory kirchoff 1850 in order to model motions of the structure classical plate theory assumes that the normal to midplane before deformations remains straight and normal to mid surface after deformation in fact this theory which ignores transverse shear deformation effects is suitable for thin plates in order to get more accurate results first order shear deformation theory which considers transverse shear deformation effects was proposed mindlin 1951 this theory implies a constant transverse shear deformation stress along the thickness of the structure so it doesn t satisfy free stress conditions on the lower and upper surface of plate and require a shear correction factor additionally there are various higher order computational models which not only satisfy free stress condition but also consider different distributions for transverse shear stress along the thickness of plate soldatos 1992 ghugal and sayyad 2011 sayyad and ghugal 2012 the extent to which fluid can play a role in vibrational behavior of structure continues to be an issue of interest to researchers the existence of fluid around structure changes the kinetic energy of system and influences on natural frequencies and mode shapes khorshidi and bakhsheshy 2015 hence knowing about the dynamic response of structure in contact with the fluid is necessary for various areas of engineering such as submarines shipbuilding nuclear hydrodynamics and ocean engineering obtaining the frequency response of a structure in contact with the fluid is generally known as fluid structure interaction fsi problem widely analysis of fsi problems can be categorized into three methods numerical methods such as boundary element method and fluid finite element method which need a large number of computations can be applied for lots of fsi problems yadykin et al 2003 bathe et al 1995 watanabe et al 1998 analytical techniques which are limited to some special cases zhou and cheung 2000 amabili and kwak 1996 kwak and yang 2013 and a set of studies that focused on experimental methods khorshidi et al 2017 robinson and palmer 1990 askari et al 2013 the past two decades have witnessed burgeoning interest in fsi problems done according to literature khorshidi 2010 jeong et al 2008 cho et al 2015 khorshidi and bakhsheshy 2014 hashemi et al 2010 liang et al 2001 have investigated dynamic response of submerged cantilever plates with kirchoff plate model with add mass approach cho et al 2016 have presented a theoretical model for the vibration analysis of the vertical plates and stiffened panels interacting with finite fluid on one side they employed the added mass approach to obtain natural frequencies of the fluid structure system vibration analysis of bottom and vertical rectangular plates in contact with fluid under the harmonic point excitation based on the mode superposition method is investigated by seung cho et al 2015 in that study the mode reversal phenomenon was observed by changing the depth of fluid in the container kutlu et al 2012 have developed a model for rectangular and circular plates partially in contact with the fluid and resting on arbitrarily pasternak foundation based on mindlin plate theory they employed a mixed type finite element formulation in their model by applying gateaux differential shahbaztabar and ranji 2016 have studied influences of inplane loads on free vibration of laminate mindlin plates in contact with fluid using rayleigh ritz method based on chebyshev polynomials watts et al 2018 have reported vibrational characteristic of skew and trapezoidal plates coupled with fluid based on the semi analytical technique for fully simply supported and clamped supported boundary conditions they have used the element free galerkin method based on moving kriging shape functions to model the structure although our knowledge about fsi has expanded over the last two decades approximately little research has been done dealing with the effects of fluid on the vibrational behavior of nanostructures omiddezyani et al 2018 up to now no studies have been reported to consider the effects of fluid around the structure and capturing the nonlocal effects simultaneously this study is an attempt to fill this existing gap the main aim of this paper is to present an analytical model for vibrating piezoelectric nanoplates in interaction with the fluid nonlocal elasticity theory and various plate theories are used to model the structure also the fluid is assumed to be incompressible irrotational and inviscid governing equations and boundary conditions are derived using hamilton s principle and solved with the galerkin method after validation influences of different variables on wet frequencies are illustrated 2 formulation 2 1 mathematical model a piezoelectric nanoplate which is in contact with the incompressible irrotational inviscid and bounded fluid is considered a b h and ρ p are the length width thickness and density of nanoplate respectively furthermore the fluid is b 1 in depth and c in width a cartesian system is located in the corner of nanoplate to describe motions of structure and fluid as shown in fig 1 2 2 modified shear deformation theories against mindlin plate theory modified shear deformation theories are needless of the shear correction factor these theories which consider various nonlinear distribution into account for transverse shear stress along the thickness of nanoplate are presented in table 1 according to these theories the displacement field can be written in the following form 1 u 1 x y z t u x y t g z h 2 w x y t x f z h 2 ζ x y t u 2 x y z t v x y t g z h 2 w x y t y f z h 2 ψ x y t u 3 x y z t w x y t where u x y t and v x y t are in plane displacement of middle surface along x axis and y axis respectively w x y t denotes the transverse displacement of mid plane surface ζ x y t and ψ x y t are rotation angles due to bending in xoz plane and yoz plane respectively g z and f z are continuous functions which vary based on the theory under consideration according to table 1 it should be noted that two new higher order shear deformation theories i e hsdt1 and hsdt2 are presented in this table for the first time according to the above displacement field i e eq 1 in plane displacements of an arbitrary point u 1 a n d u 2 include two parts the first part which is the same as classical plate theory and the second part which is due to the shear deformation effects under the assumption of small deformations linear strain components are obtained as follows 2 ε x x u x g z 2 w x 2 f z ζ x ε y y v y g z 2 w y 2 f z ψ y ε x y 1 2 u y v x 2 g z 2 w x y f z ψ x ζ y ε x z 1 2 g z z w x ξ f z

seen that modified shear deformation theories satisfy free stress conditions at the bottom z h and the top z 0 surface of the plate the distribution of electric potential must be such that satisfies maxwell equation for this purpose wang 2002 proposed a cosine distribution for electric potential in the following form 3 ϕ x y z t cos γ z γ h 2 ϕ x y t where ϕ x y t is electric potential in the middle surface of nanoplate and γ π h by using this distribution for electric potential the electric field can be obtained as follows 4 e x ϕ x c o s γ z ϕ x y t x e y ϕ y c o s γ z ϕ x y t y e z ϕ z γ s i n γ z ϕ x y t where for the sake of simplicity z z h 2 2 3 nonlocal elasticity theory nonlocal theory as one of the most applied theories in nanoscale is able to take nonlocal effects and plays a beneficial role in the nanotechnology area based on this theory stresses and electric displacements for a piezoelectric nanoplate at a reference point are expressed as 5 σ j k x α x x τ c i j k l ε

structure systems the first part which is due to the vibrational behavior of the structure is bulging modes and the second part which is sloshing modes is caused by the rigid motion of the tank to model motions of fluid following assumptions are applied a the amplitude vibration of fluid is small b the fluid is assumed to be ideal c the fluid oscillation is considered to be harmonic d the sloshing effects have taken into account due to linearity of the considered problem it is possible to decompose the fluid potential velocity φ 0 into two following parts ohayon 2004 9 φ 0 φ b φ s where φ b and φ s are fluid potential velocity relating to bulging modes and sloshing modes respectively by assuming harmonic motion of the fluid fluid potential velocity can be expressed as 10 φ 0 x

of no bulging modes on the free surface of the liquid moreover boundary condition 14 takes into account the compatibility condition at the interface of fluid and nanoplate z 0 because fluid and nanoplate keep their perfect contact at this surface using equation 11 and boundary conditions 12 13 and 14 general solution for ϕ s and ϕ b can be obtained as follows khorshidi and farhadi 2013 15 φ

of efficacy and reliability of current model using various plate theories is carried out for three different cases including dry frequencies of piezoelectric nanoplate wet frequencies of thin isotropic plate and wet frequencies of thick rectangular plate 3 1 1 dry fundamental frequency of piezoelectric nanoplate the dimensionless fundamental frequency ω ωa ρ p c 11 of simply supported piezoelectric nanoplate pzt4 using several plate theories for different values of the nonlocal parameter and the length to thickness ratio a h 10 40 is tabulated in table 2 moreover in this table a comparison has been provided between present work and the results existing in the literature including ke et al 2015 and liu et al 2013 in all sections of this article the piezoelectric nanoplate is assumed to be made of pzt4 with the following mechanical properties c 11 132 g p a c 12 71 g p a c 13 73 g p a c 33 115 g p a c 44 26 g p a c 66 30 5 g p a ρ p 7500 k g m 3 e 31 4 1 c m 2 e 15 10 5 c m 2 e 33 14 1 c m 2 κ 11 5 841 c v m κ 33 7 124 c v m it can be seen from table 2 that current results are in good agreement with those reported in the literature 3 1 2 wet fundamental frequency of isotropic plate as the second comparison studies fundamental frequency parameter ω ω a 2 ρ p h d of the simply supported isotropic plate in contact with water for different values of fluid depth ratio b1 a is listed in table 3 the numerical results in this table are obtained for a b 10 m h 0 15 m c 100 m e 25 gpa ρp 2400 kg m3 and ν 0 15 it is worth mentioning that by vanishing electric potential in the governing equations the piezoelectric plate converts to the isotropic plate and numerical results existing in table 3 can be calculated as seen again the excellent compatibility is observed by comparing the present results and available literature including the ritz solution of omiddezyani et al 2018 and boundary element solution of uğurlu et al 2008 3 1 3 wet fundamental frequency of isotropic plate in this example fundamental frequencies of a thick rectangular plate made from aluminum with e 70 gpa ν 0 3 ρp 2702 kg m3 a b 1 m h 0 1 m and c 0 4 m in interaction with ideal fluid when depth ratio varies from 0 to 0 5 are tabulated in table 4 from this table it can easily be seen that the results of present work especially in modified shear deformation theories agree well with those performed by khorshidi and bakhsheshy 2015 3 2 results and discussion in this section results and discussion for vibrational characteristics of the piezoelectric nanoplates made of pzt4 are presented the following dimensionless parameters are utilized in this section thickness ratio δ a h aspect ratio η a b fluid depth ratio τ b 1 a fluid width ratio ς c a nonlocal parameter β e 0 a l moreover the ratio of nonlocal to local frequency and the ratio of wet to dry frequency are denoted by fr 1 ω n o n l o c a l ω l o c a l and fr 2 ω w e t ω d r y respectively first nine dry and wet mode shapes of the piezoelectric nanoplate are shown in fig 3 as seen in this figure in contrast to the dry mode shapes wet mode shapes aren t symmetric in fact the interaction of the fluid with piezoelectric nanoplate alters the kinetic energy of the system and causes a distortion in the wet mode shapes rather than the dry mode shapes furthermore it is observed that this distortion becomes more noticeable by increasing the mode number the dimensionless frequencies and mode shapes are calculated for the values of δ 20 η 1 τ ς 0 4 and β 0 the fundamental frequency parameter associated with the square piezoelectric nanoplate in contact with fluid for various values of the nonlocal parameter β 0 1 0 2 a n d 0 3 using different plate theories are listed in table 5 as seen in this table there is a similarity between the results obtained from cpt and modified shear deformation theories for great values of thickness ratio δ 20 in fact classical plate theory overestimates natural frequencies by ignoring rotary inertia and shear deformation effects also it is logical to use cpt for thin plates because these effects are negligible for thin plates besides it is evident in table 5 that frequency ratio fr1 for all plate theories under consideration are nearly equal to each other effects of the nonlocal parameter β on frequency ratio fr1 of the system are graphed in fig 4 according to this figure as the nonlocal parameter increases frequency ratio fr1 reduces because atoms can be considered as the elements which are connected to each other by the elastic springs in the nonlocal elasticity whereas constant of these springs are infinite in local elasticity therefore nonlocal effects cause more flexibility in the structure and decrease stiffness and natural frequencies the numerical results in table 5 and fig 4 have been calculated for the values of τ ς 0 5 the dimensionless fundamental wet frequencies of the piezoelectric nanoplate are given in table 6 for different values of the nonlocal parameter and aspect ratio the data in this table indicates that increasing aspect ratio in a constant length reduces degrees of freedom of the system and consequently overall stiffness and frequencies are improved variation of dimensionless fundamental frequency versus aspect ratio for various values of the nonlocal parameter are shown in fig 5 this figure reveals that nonlocal effects are more noticeable in higher values of aspect ratio which is due to the fact that the width of the nanoplate is decreased by increasing aspect ratio and consequently nonlocal effects become more prominent in smaller values of the dimensions of the nanoplate the data in table 6 and fig 5 is obtained for τ ς 0 5 and δ 10 table 7 illustrates the effects of the fluid depth ratio on the fundamental natural frequency for a piezoelectric nanoplate with a b 50 nm δ 10 ς 0 3 and β 0 1 using different plate theories this table depicts that increasing fluid depth ratio reduces the fundamental frequency with an increase in overall kinetic energy of the system fig 6 displays the variation of frequency ratio fr2 as functions of the fluid depth ratio for different modes as expected other modes reduce by increasing fluid depth as the same as fundamental mode as shown in this figure the rate of this reduction is not the same for various modes so that by increasing the mode number this rate decreases finally in fig 7 the influence of the fluid width ratio on fundamental natural frequency is demonstrated for a piezoelectric nanoplate β 0 1 when τ varies from 0 to 1 it can be observed that raising the value of ς will increase the fundamental frequency of the system this behavior continues as long as fundamental frequency takes a constant value at a particular ς which is denoted by ς i n f i n i t e it can be stated that when the value of ς is higher than ς i n f i n i t e the assumption of infinite fluid width is valid also it is evident that ς i n f i n i t e depends on the depth of fluid and increases by raising τ 4 conclusion in the present study the fluid structure interaction of piezoelectric nanoplate is investigated based on nonlocal elasticity the displacement field is written in a unified formulation so that can be converted to various plate theories such as classical mindlin reddy exponential trigonometric hyperbolic and parabolic theories as well as two new proposed theories with the assumption of the ideal fluid and satisfying the continuity equation fluid velocity potential relating to bulging and sloshing modes of fluid is obtained governing equations and associated boundary conditions of the fluid structure system are derived with hamilton s principle and are solved using the galerkin approach obtained results reveal that modified shear deformation theories have nearly the negligible difference to each other in terms of accuracy which is due to the difference in the distribution of transverse shear stresses along the thickness of the structure also it is observed that two new proposed modified shear deformation theories have acceptable accuracy as the same as other modified shear deformation theories additionally it is demonstrated that nonlocal effects are more noticeable at higher values of aspect ratio and thickness ratio because the size dependent behavior is more prominent at smaller dimensions of the structure as another conclusion the interaction of the fluid with structure creates a distortion in mode shapes so that this distortion is more notable in higher modes numerical results indicate that by increasing fluid depth the kinetic energy of the fluid structure system increases hence natural frequencies reduce so that the rate of this decreasing is smaller at higher modes moreover the evidence shows that by raising fluid width the natural frequencies increase to approach to a constant value acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the funding by arak university under

22841,the present study describes the application of the particle image velocimetry piv technique for the reconstruction of hydrodynamic pressures and loads on a ship model from measured velocity fields during towing tank tests as an alternative to conventional pressure and force measurement techniques the method simultaneously pictures the velocity field and captures the dynamic aspect of the flow the presented measurements are conducted in the transom region of a generic hull of a planing vessel which is equipped with an interceptor to create a stagnating flow associated with a high pressure peak the flow close to the hull is captured with an underwater stereoscopic piv system and the pressure peak in front of the interceptor is reconstructed from time averaged velocity fields results show the effect of different interceptor heights on the pressure distribution in the center plane of the model further a 3d flow field is reconstructed from scanning piv measurements to analyze the lift reduction due to the finite span of the interceptor the spatial variation of the measurement uncertainty is analyzed and propagated to the pressure field uncertainty and the potential of the method is further evaluated by comparison with numerical results from steady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations keywords underwater piv pressure reconstruction piv uncertainty interceptor 1 introduction as soon a ship operates at high forward speeds its weight is predominantly supported by hydrodynamic rather than hydrostatic forces small changes in the dynamic pressure distribution on the ship hull can have a significant influence on the ship s running attitude and performance in order to further improve these vessels it is thus important to investigate the flow in the vicinity of the ship hull and to accurately determine global as well local pressure distributions while there has been steady development and improvement of numerical tools to analyze the flow physics and the ship s structural and motion response towing tank experiments are needed for their experimental validation however traditional towing tank tests mainly focus on the assessment of global loads during captive model tests the spatial resolution of such measurements can be improved by usage of segmented models where the ship is divided into several segments which are connected to a rigid backbone via several force balances as shown by keuning 1994 and de jong and keuning 2006 who both performed towing tank tests with a high speed craft model consisting of 7 segments these tests could give additional insights into the distribution of hydrodynamic forces over the length of the ship hull by performing forced oscillation tests added mass and damping coefficients of the segments were determined however local effects could not be captured whenever a more detailed picture of the pressure distribution has to be drawn single pressure sensors can be fitted into the ship hull to measure pressures at discrete points if accumulated to arrays even a discretized representation of the pressure distribution can be assessed however due to their size resolution is limited and a change of the measurement position involves time intensive repositioning of the transducers furthermore a flush installation into the faired hull is desired to minimize the disturbance of the local flow an application for high speed craft is reported by choi 2018 where an array of 63 pressure sensors was used to determine a time averaged pressure distribution in the bow region of a fast displacement ship in aerodynamic applications the usage of pressure sensitive paint psp is a common means to accurately measure the pressure distribution on a surface with a high resolution mclachlan and bell 1995 this cannot be considered as an option for towing tank application where due the incompressibility of the fluid this technique can only detect the oxygen concentration sakaue et al 2009 but not pressure another technique which has been increasingly applied in recent years for pressure measurement on surfaces as well in the entire flow field is the pressure reconstruction derived from particle image velocimetry piv measurements as to the knowledge of the author in towing tank applications the piv technique has been so far only used to study the flow kinematics in this paper its application for pressure reconstruction during towing tank tests will be investigated when applied to the measured velocity field from piv measurements the navier stokes equations can be utilized to derive the pressure in the flow field and on the surface from the flow properties without any disturbance of the flow field in the measurement region the recent development of the piv technique and hardware components nowadays allows for a reconstruction of the 3d volumetric and even time resolved pressure fields using tomographic or stereoscopic scanning piv a detailed review of the main principles of piv based pressure measurement and a discussion of the methods accuracy has been presented by van oudheusden 2013 pressure reconstruction from piv measurements is well studied and widely accepted in numerous aerodynamic and hydrodynamic applications for aerodynamic applications the performance of pressure piv and psp measurements has been compared by tagliabue et al 2017 a good example of a practical application is given by ragni et al 2012 who used multi plane stereo piv measurements to assess the loads of an aircraft propeller in the field of ship hydrodynamics the technique has been successfully applied by nila et al 2013 to estimate slamming loads during the water entry of rigid bodies for the case of hydrodynamic applications it has to be emphasized that due to the reconstruction of the pressure field from measured velocities this method only measures the dynamic pressure component to investigate the possibilities of capturing the dynamic aspect of the flow around ships and loads on the ship hull in the present study the pressure piv technique will be applied to flow measurements in the direct vicinity of a ship model the presented measurements are conducted in the transom region of a generic hull of a planing vessel with a flat bottom aft section the transom of the model is equipped with an interceptor which behaves comparable to a forward facing step when deployed at high speeds the interceptor blade creates a stagnation region on the bottom of the hull in front of the transom which is associated with a high pressure peak typical blade heights are in the order of magnitude of the boundary layer height a schematic drawing of the interceptor and its influence on boundary layer flow and wall pressure distribution is depicted in fig 1 mainly used in static configurations the generated lift is used to influence the trim of a ship by dynamically changing the height of the interceptor it is also used for active ride control of fast ships in waves the flow around interceptors and the resulting hydrodynamic forces are well studied with numerical methods by brizzolara 2003 and villa and brizzolara 2009 with potential and ranse methods molini and brizzolara 2005 also discussed the 3d effects of an interceptor with a finite span however 3d results were obtained without taking the influence of the boundary layer into account a more recent study has been undertaken by pearce and brandner 2014 who compared analytical and potential methods to predict the cavitating flow over a wall mounted fence on the experimental side segmented model tests have been performed by rijkens et al 2013 to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of different interceptor configurations mansoori and fernandes 2015 performed a more fundamental analysis by experimentally and numerically analyzing the performance of an interceptor which was mounted to a flat plate the aim of this study is to correctly capture the flow close to the ship hull and reconstruct the pressure peak in front of the interceptor from time averaged velocity fields the spatial variation of uncertainty is analyzed and propagated to the pressure field uncertainty the 2d pressure field in the center plane of the model is reconstructed from planar stereo piv measurements showing the effect of different interceptor heights the three dimensional effects of the flow on the pressure distribution in front of the interceptor are captured with stereoscopic scanning piv measurements finally the potential of the pressure piv method is further evaluated by comparing experimental with numerical results from steady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations 2 experimental setup the piv experiments are performed at the large towing tank of the ship hydrodynamics laboratory at delft university of technology the tank has a cross section of 4 22 m width and 2 5 m depth over a test section length of 142 m the carriage is able to operate at a maximum speed of 7 m s a model of a generic planning hull with an overall length of 1 8 m is used in this study the same model has already been used by rijkens et al 2013 to experimentally study the hydrodynamic performance of interceptors and transom flaps for the motion control of fast ships during segmented model tests its transom section has a simple box shape with a constant cross section being 0 4 m wide and 0 8 m long to provide optical access to the measurement area for illumination with the laser sheet the bottom of the segment is replaced by an acrylic glass plate the bow segment is designed from developable surfaces with the purpose to smoothly divert the flow to the transom segment at the transom of the model an interceptor of adjustable height is attached manufactured from a simple plate the interceptor covers the whole beam of the model four guiding rails guarantee a smooth and accurate setting of the interceptor intrusion height to accurately position the model within the field of view of the piv system and to set it to its correct running trim and sinkage the model is mounted to the carriage via a symmetrie notus hexapod with its linear travel range of 250 mm it was also used to reposition the model in between runs during the scanning piv tests and makes an extra traversing system for the piv system obsolete for all test runs the model is kept at a constant draft of 50 mm and constant bow up trim of 3 resulting in a wetted length of 1 52 m for the 2d piv measurements in the center plane of the model a test matrix with carriage speeds of 3 4 and 5 m s are performed while the interceptor intrusion height is stepwise increased from 0 mm up to 20 mm with increments of 5 mm the carriage speeds are equivalent to length based froude numbers of 0 71 0 95 and 1 19 reynolds numbers based on the wetted length of the ship range from 5 4e4 to 9 0e5 a volumetric reconstruction from scanning piv measurements is attempted for selected conditions at speeds of 3 and 4 m s with interceptor heights of 10 and 20 mm to capture the three dimensionality of the flow field the model position is shifted in the transverse direction between runs resulting in a total number of 14 measurement positions from the center plane to the side of the model as the three dimensionality of the flow is expected to increase with increasing distance from the center plane the spacing in between measurement planes is reduced from 20 mm in the center plane to 10 mm at the side of the model 2 1 piv setup the flow in the vicinity of the interceptor is investigated with an underwater stereoscopic piv setup to minimize reflections from the bottom of the ship hull and increase the near wall resolution the laser head and optics are placed above the water and the laser sheet is guided through the acrylic glass bottom of the model to the field of view the two cameras are each located in a watertight torpedo shaped housing to get optical access to the region in front of the interceptor the cameras are located approximately 680 mm in front of the transom looking backwards to the field of view with a 60 mirror section a symmetric arrangement with one camera on either side of the light sheet is used to accomplish a high accuracy determination of the out of plane velocity component to prevent any disturbance of the flow in the measurement region the struts which connect the torpedo to the carriage are positioned as far aft as the transom of the ship model and have a streamlined shape the immersion depth of the torpedoes is 490 mm and their horizontal stand off distance is 1000 mm fig 2 shows a schematic drawing of the piv setup indicating the position of the cameras and measurement planes for illumination of the measurement plane a litron bernoulli nd yag laser with 200 mj pulse energy at a wave length of 532 nm is used image acquisition was done with two lavision imager pro sx cameras with a sensor size of 2448 2050 pixels and 12 bit color depth equipped with lenses of 28 mm focal length the field of view was approximately 200 200 mm2 to keep the particles focused over the whole field of view a scheimpflug adapter is mounted in front of each camera with a pixel pitch of 3 45 μm the digital resolution is approximately 10 pixels mm images are recorded at a double frame acquisition rate of 7 hz resulting in 210 image pairs per measurement run at the lowest speed and 120 image pairs at the highest speed calibration of the cameras is done with a two level double sided 3d calibration plate which is carefully aligned in an iterative process with the moving direction of the carriage mounting the calibration plate to the hexapod enables for a highly accurate repositioning of the plate during the calibration process to guarantee a uniform distribution of the 50 μm polymer vestosint particles in the measurement area a retractable seeding rake is mounted in front of the carriage prior to releasing the particles into the towing tank in between measurement runs they are premixed in a high shear flow to prevent clustering while after every measurement run the tank is reseeded a waiting time of 25 min allows the water to settle in between runs 3 piv processing as previously found by jacobi et al 2016 structural vibrations can occur at high towing velocities which significantly affect the quality of the image correlation it was shown that vibrations of the measurement system and thus the fluctuations of disparity increased at high carriage speeds based on the cross correlation of two images taken at the same instant of time wieneke 2005 proposed a method to test for a static misalignment of the recombined stereo piv images using the resulting disparity map the initial calibration can be further refined and calibration coefficients can be corrected for a static misalignment of the calibration plate in most piv applications conducted in a controlled laboratory environment this would be sufficient to completely correct for any misalignment of the laser sheet and the calibration plate however when the measurement system is prone to vibrations disparity will vary in time if cameras and light sheet optics are not rigidly connected while the application of the self calibration procedure proposed by wieneke 2005 successfully removes the mean disparity in the recorded data set a fluctuating disparity is left with an amplitude of approximately 10 pixels at the highest analyzed carriage speed of 5 m s to further reduce the amplitude of the fluctuating residual disparity a two step correction procedure is introduced jacobi et al 2016 in the first step the disparity between all images for every single camera is reduced by correlating significant features of the ship hull after an independent shift correction for both cameras the image sets from both cameras still have a constant offset this is corrected in a second step by performing a second self calibration using the mean disparity vector field of all recordings the method significantly reduces the disparity over the whole tested speed range however the trend of increasing residual disparities with increasing carriage speed is still visible while for carriage speeds of 1 m s the root mean square of the fluctuating disparity could be reduced to 0 7 pixels at 5 m s the residual disparity was reduced to 2 5 pixels considering the recommendation that the displacement between particle pairs in dewarped images should not differ more than half the particle image size 2 3 pixels this was found to be acceptable data acquisition as well as data post processing is done using the commercial software package davis 8 4 0 from lavision before finally calculating the velocity fields a mask is applied to the images to mask out reflections on the acrylic glass plate and to enhance correlation close to the ship hull and interceptor the calculation of the velocity vector field is done in multiple correlation iterations starting with an interrogation window of 64 64 pixels in the initial pass the window size is iteratively decreased to 24 24 pixels the windows are overlapping by 50 and a gaussian weighting function was used fig 3 shows an example of a dewarped raw image and the in plane components from the mean velocity field which was obtained from 200 vector images as seen from the velocity fields the stagnation region in front of the interceptor is well captured as well as the downward acceleration towards the tip of the interceptor the coordinate system is chosen to match the ship coordinate system with the origin located at the transom of the model at 0 trim angle 3 1 pressure reconstruction and force determination having obtained the mean velocity field and its fluctuations from the statistical ensemble of the recorded velocity fields one can describe the pressure gradient of the mean pressure field with reynolds averaged momentum equation the decomposition of the velocity into a time averaged and fluctuating part leads to 1 u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j the pressure field can be either calculated from direct integration of the momentum equation or by solving the pressure poisson equation which is obtained by applying the divergence operator to the momentum equation 2 2 p x i 2 ρ x i u j u i x j ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j under the assumption that the flow is incompressible the divergence free condition holds i e u 0 as a result the viscous term disappears and the pressure poisson equation reduces to 3 2 p x i 2 ρ x i u j u i x j u i u j x j the advantages and disadvantages of both methods have been extensively discussed by van oudheusden 2013 in this case the poisson approach is chosen to reconstruct the pressure field as it has been reported to produce less noisy results albrecht et al 2012 the reynolds stresses are found from variances and covariances of the velocity vectors while in the symmetry plane of the ship model the flow is assumed to be two dimensional all spatial derivatives necessary for calculating the planar pressure field are obtained from a single plane measurement for a calculation of the three dimensional pressure field in front of the interceptor the spatial derivatives of the out of plane direction have to be obtained from the measured fields of adjacent measurement planes obtained from scanning piv measurements along the transverse direction of the ship model for the solution of the poisson equation a neumann boundary condition is obtained from the reynolds averaged momentum equation 1 to prescribe the non homogeneous pressure gradient at the boundary of the measurement area 4 n i p x i ρ n i u j u i x j ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j as only neumann boundary conditions are used a reference pressure is needed to correctly scale the reconstructed pressures as no data from a reference pressure sensor is available it is favorable to choose the reference pressure point to be in a region of undisturbed flow where it can be determined with the bernoulli equation however due to the limited size of the measurement area this was only possible for the smallest interceptor heights where the flow disturbance is small to compare the reconstructed field with results from simulations a reference pressure is taken from the numerical results 180 mm in front of the transom and 180 mm below the ship bottom where the flow is disturbed the least for the solution of the poisson pressure equation the openfoam 5 0 package is employed where the equation is discretized with a finite volume method fig 4 gives an example of the reconstructed pressure field in front of the interceptor and indicates the location p of the reference pressure point the reconstructed pressure field shows an increase of the pressure coefficient towards the transom with a clear pressure peak right in front of the interceptor in the stagnation region as the maximum blade stroke is smaller than the boundary layer height and the flow is decelerated towards the wall in the boundary layer the maximum pressure coefficient is well below 1 the generated lift force from the interceptor will be obtained by numerically integrating the extrapolated pressure distribution over the length of the analyzed longitudinal segment of the model hull 5 l p n d s z i 1 n p i c o s θ d s i here z describes the direction normal to the freestream and θ is the trim angle of the ship model with s being the length of the segment and v c being the carriage velocity the sectional lift coefficient per unit span is calculated as 6 c l 2 l ρ v c 2 s 4 measurement uncertainty assessment and propagation 4 1 measurement uncertainty as the quality of piv measurements is influenced by multiple error sources it is challenging to consider all of these for a reliable estimation of velocity field uncertainty however a number of posteriori uncertainty estimation methods have been developed recently amongst these the quantification of uncertainty based on the correlation statistics by wieneke 2015 has shown to give a reliable estimate of the random uncertainty components looking only at the statistical quantities of the measured velocities the uncertainty is due to the finite sample size typically dominated by random errors and justifies a limitation to this component in the following analysis it has been shown by boomsma et al 2016 that these random errors are well predicted with the correlation statistics uncertainty quantification method to further assess the performance of the correlation statistics method to identify the random uncertainty components of the measured velocity field in towing tank applications additionally a series of uniform flow measurements were performed furthermore these tests are performed to identify any bias introduced by the misalignment of the calibration plate since the laser is guided through the acrylic glass bottom of the model the bottom has to be immersed in the water to minimize the disturbance from the model on the flow it is trimmed to 0 and its draft is changed to a minimum of 0 01 m afterwards the temporal statistics of the freestream flow are analyzed at a single point with a distance of 0 1 m from the ship bottom for carriage speeds from 3 m s to 5 m s in all analyzed cases the laser pulse separation dt was chosen to yield a pixel displacement of approximately 10 pixels for the freestream velocity assuming still water before every measurement run in the case of no obstruction in the flow the disturbance of the flow is assumed to be negligible under the assumption that any measured velocity fluctuations are due to errors in the measurement system and the vector calculation procedure the root mean square rms of the estimated random uncertainties r m s u u should match the standard deviation of the measured velocities σ u boomsma et al 2016 7 r m s u u i 1 n u u i 2 n i 1 n u i u 2 n σ u here u u i describes the standard uncertainty obtained with the correlation statistics method u i describes the instantaneous velocity and u the temporal average of the velocity table 1 shows the uncertainty estimates and calculated errors for 3 m s and 5 m s freestream velocities while the bias for the vertical velocity component is found to be negligible the bias of the x and y velocity components indicate an initial rotation of the calibration target around the vertical axis of approximately 0 2 for all velocity components the rms of the estimated uncertainty is slightly over predicted compared to the standard deviation of the measured velocities an explanation for this over prediction may be found by looking at the uncertainty quantification procedure where next to random errors also small bias errors can be introduced for larger particle image sizes where the piv algorithm does not converge to a fixed value while in both cases the water was considered to be at rest the increasing fluctuations at a higher carriage velocity may be due to an increase of the structural vibrations having reported an estimation of the uncertainty in the undisturbed flow it has to be noted that the uncertainty can vary significantly in space depending on the local characteristics of the flow in the present case it is expected for the uncertainty to significantly increase in the boundary layer region due to the higher velocity gradient as shown by van doorne et al 2004 in areas with no velocity gradient the registration error is zero but increases in regions with high velocity gradients due to the mismatch of the back projected images especially at high speeds this component is considered to be the largest uncertainty component due to the structural vibrations of the carriage furthermore the correlation noise is expected to increase towards the ship hull due to the turbulent flow in the boundary layer fig 5 shows an example of the rms of the velocity field uncertainty contours calculated from 200 images the model speed is 3 m s and the interceptor height is 20 mm a clear difference between the boundary layer region and the outer free stream region can be seen while values in the outer region are in compliance with the initial freestream reference runs the uncertainty increases towards the boundary layer highest values are found in the stagnation region close to the interceptor with uncertainties up to 3 of the freestream velocity component 4 2 uncertainty propagation as the main uncertainty components are of random nature their magnitude scales with the number of samples n when calculating the uncertainty of the time averaged velocity field components following sciacchitano and wieneke 2016 the uncertainty of the mean velocity u u can be calculated as 8 u u σ u n however the velocity standard deviation σ u contains the true velocity fluctuations as well as the measurement errors having quantified the spatial uncertainty distributions for every time step with the correlation statistics method instead of using equation 8 the uncertainties from every time step are propagated towards the uncertainty of the mean velocity u u using the uncertainties of the instantaneous velocities u u i 9 u u i 1 n u u i 2 n using the derived formulas from sciacchitano and wieneke 2016 also the uncertainty of the reynolds stresses can be determined as the uncertainties of the mean velocity field are small compared to the velocity fluctuations the uncertainty of the normal stresses equals the uncertainty of the variance 10 u r u u σ u 2 2 n 1 the uncertainty of the reynolds shear stress can be calculated with the covariance uncertainty equation which under the assumption of a zero correlation coefficient is 11 u r u v σ u σ v n 1 due to the non linearity of the poisson pressure equation 3 according to iso 2009 a monte carlo approach is chosen to propagate the assessed uncertainty components of the mean velocity and reynolds stresses to the time averaged pressure field p compared to the linear uncertainty propagation described according to iso 2008 this method gives a generally improved estimate of the output quantity p as found by azijli et al 2016 a linear uncertainty propagation of the measured components towards the pressure field leads to an underestimation of pressure uncertainty by about 30 compared to results from monte carlo simulations under the assumption of the measured input variables to be gaussian distributed simulations with 10 000 realizations are done to evaluate the uncertainty of the reconstructed pressure field the monte carlo simulations were performed within the openfoam package using the gaussnormal member function of the random class to generate variations of the input variables the final expanded uncertainty u p 95 is then calculated by multiplying the resulting standard uncertainty with a coverage factor of 2 for a confidence interval of 95 as seen in fig 6 the expanded uncertainty in the freestream region is below 0 5 of the maximum pressure and increases towards the boundary layer starting from approximately x h 1 the uncertainty increases significantly to up to 6 5 of the peak pressure right in front of the interceptor knowing the discrete uncertainty distribution of the pressure field on the ship hull the uncertainty of the sectional lift can be estimated as 12 u l i 1 n u p i 2 d s i 2 5 numerical simulations for a comparison of the obtained piv results with numerical results cfd simulations of the performed towing tank tests are made with the open source code openfoam 5 0 the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are solved with the interfoam solver where the volume of fluid vof approach is applied to capture the two phase interface the governing equations are discretized with second order central differencing schemes and a two equation k omega sst model is used for modelling the turbulence as the ship model is symmetric only one half of the ship is meshed to reduce the number of cells the numerical grid is generated with the hexahedral mesher snappyhexmesh which is modified to fit the needs for meshing of marine applications and allow for higher aspect ratio cells in the free surface region after calculating an initial solution with a coarse grid the grid is further refined in the free surface region and in front of the interceptor an example of the final mesh in the free surface region is depicted in fig 7 including the dimensions of the domain while the cross section of the domain was chosen to fit the tu delft towing tank dimensions the outlet position of the domain was chosen according to the ittc guidelines ittc 2011 to prevent wave reflection also depicted in fig 7 is the refined region in front of the interceptor with the prismatic boundary layers inserted on the ship hull the total mesh consisted of approximately 3 5 million cells with a dimensionless wall distance y of 1 on the ship hull to analyze the accuracy of the simulations the lift generated by the interceptor in the aft section of the model is compared the results of segmented model tests performed by rijkens et al 2013 fig 8 shows the comparison of the generated lift force on the aft segment of the ship hull for different speeds and interceptor intrusion heights the lift force generated by the hull without interceptor is subtracted from the results the numerical results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results especially for interceptor heights up to 15 mm the comparison error is below 2 interestingly at interceptor heights of 20 mm the cfd results systematically under predict the measured lift force the maximum comparison error here is approximately 6 6 discussion and comparison of experimental and numerical results 6 1 2d results the flow field in front of the interceptor is recorded in the center plane of the ship model while systematically varying of intruder height and ship speed while the ship hull is considered to be symmetrical the flow in the center plane can be considered to be two dimensional with no out of plane velocity as shown by brizzolara 2003 already small changes in the boundary layer shape can significantly change the pressure distribution in front of the interceptor following from this it has to be made sure that the simulated flow field close to the ship hull is in good agreement with the experimental conditions before comparing simulated and reconstructed pressure fields fig 9 gives an insight into the flow in front of the interceptor close to the ship hull the mean velocity and pressure profiles in the center plane of the model are plotted for different stations in front of the transom results are presented for an interceptor intrusion height of 20 mm measured velocities and reconstructed pressures are compared to results from the performed cfd calculations to judge the quality of the near wall resolution the velocity magnitude is made dimensionless with the free stream velocity wall distance and longitudinal distance from the transom are expressed relative to the interceptor height h affected by the adverse pressure gradient which is generated by the interceptor the flow in the boundary layer is decelerated towards the transom measured and simulated velocity and pressure profiles are in good agreement with each other while jacobi et al 2016 found larger differences in the near wall velocity field a grid refinement in wall normal direction with resulting y 1 could improve the agreement of the simulation results with the velocity profiles found from piv measurements as expected the good agreement of the velocity field in the boundary layer also leads to a good agreement of the reconstructed and simulated pressures contour plots of the reconstructed pressure field in front of the interceptor in the center plane of the model are depicted in fig 10 where they are compared to the simulation results pressure fields are shown for 10 mm and 20 mm interceptor intrusion heights while the contours of the reconstructed fields are affected by noise there is still a good agreement with the simulations largest differences can be found close to the interceptor in the stagnation region where both reconstructed results give a higher maximum pressure compared to the simulations however both simulations and measurements clearly show an increase of the peak pressure in front of the interceptor with increasing blade height to further analyze the dependency of the pressure distribution on the ship hull on interceptor height the pressure distribution on the hull is plotted in fig 11 for interceptor heights increasing from 0 to 20 mm in steps of 5 mm at constant model speed as shown in fig 9 the velocity field and thus the pressure field is well resolved close to the wall this justifies the assumption that the reconstructed pressure in the upper most cells represents the surface pressure on the ship hull under the assumption of a zero pressure gradient in wall normal direction while the lines represent the cfd results the dots represent the reconstructed pressures as the original resolution of the piv vector grid resulted in a total of approximately 135 measurement points over length of the measurement section on the ship hull for the sake of clarity only every fourth measurement point is plotted in all conditions the flow is smoothly separating from the transom leaving the transom dry resulting from this without any interceptor the pressure drops to atmospheric pressure towards the transom due to the presence of the free surface leading to a negative dynamic pressure at the transom due to the stagnation region in front of the interceptor this pressure becomes positive and is increasing with interceptor height also the point of separation shifts further forward resulting in an increasing region of constant pressure right in front of the interceptor both results from measurements and simulation are in good agreement with each other with largest differences in the region of the pressure peak however the difference of the peak pressures still lies within the uncertainty band of the piv results which was estimated to be approximately 6 of the peak pressure value in this region the reconstructed 2d pressure fields in the center plane of the ship hull were integrated to yield the total dynamic lift force component in the aft region of the ship disregarding any 3d effects fig 12 shows the lift force for all analyzed speeds and interceptor heights per unit ship width and compares experimental results and their calculated uncertainty with results from cfd simulations the uncertainties of the integral forces were found from integrating the uncertainties of the single measurement points while for 3 m s experimental results are in good agreement with simulations the integrated values at 4 and 5 m s are slightly over predicted for most analyzed conditions with maximum differences of approximately 8 percent as the laser pulse separation has been initially chosen to yield a constant pixel displacement in the freestream for all tested velocities the actual uncertainty values increase proportionally with carriage velocity this trend is also propagated to the integral forces 6 2 3d results for selected conditions at 3 and 4 m s the measurement planes were shifted stepwise towards the side of the model to reconstruct a volumetric velocity field from a total of 14 measurement planes and analyze the three dimensionality of the flow around the interceptor fig 13 shows contour plots of the three velocity components and reconstructed pressures at 3 transverse positions from a selected run with an interceptor height of 20 mm at a speed of 3 m s at y 0 in the center plane of the ship model the mean flow is purely two dimensional while the out of plane component is close to zero in the whole field of view the in plane components show a deceleration of the flow towards the interceptor in x direction and an acceleration in z direction as seen from the contour plots at y 0 75b 2 and b 2 with b being the ship width the out of plane component steadily increases towards the side of the model while the downward component decreases with the increasing out of plane component towards the side of the interceptor blade the high pressure region in front of the interceptor significantly reduces in size the reconstructed volumetric pressure field has been extrapolated to the ship hull to further analyze the three dimensional effects of the flow on the surface pressure distribution results presented in fig 14 show the reconstructed pressure coefficient on the ship hull for interceptor heights of 10 and 20 mm at 3 m s model speed on an area of 180 190 mm2 further measurement results are compared to pressure distributions which were obtained from cfd simulations as already seen in fig 13 due to the increased transverse flow component in front of the interceptor the pressure reduces towards the side of the interceptor blade while there is a good agreement between results from cfd and piv measurements largest deviations can be found in the peak pressure region as already seen from the two dimensional results the reconstructed peak pressure form the piv measurements is slightly higher compared to the cfd results an integration of the surface pressure along the ships longitudinal direction at different transverse sections quantifies the hydrodynamic lift reduction towards the side of the interceptor due to the three dimensionality of the flow fig 15 shows the sectional lift coefficient and its uncertainty from all 14 measurement planes and compares them to the numerical results results from experiments and simulations both clearly show a reduction of lift towards the side of the interceptor and are in good agreement with each other for all analyzed velocities and interceptor heights due to the over prediction of the pressure peak in the center planes of the ship here the total dynamic lift is also over predicted by the pressure reconstruction from piv results however an integration of the sectional loads over the width of the ship leads to maximum differences of approximately 3 of the hydrodynamic lift between experimental and numerical results general conclusions about the lift reduction due to three dimensional effects and its dependency on interceptor height and speed cannot be drawn from these results as the measurement area was too small and no volumetric field has been reconstructed for runs without interceptor 7 conclusion the present study has been conducted to evaluate an alternative means of measuring the surface pressure distribution on a ship model during towing tank tests while studying the characteristics of the flow around an interceptor for this purpose an underwater stereo piv system has been utilized to measure the mean velocity field close to the ship these results eventually have been used together with the poisson pressure equation to reconstruct the average pressure field in the flow field as well as on the ship model while a broader range of conditions was analyzed with single plane piv measurements in the center plane of the model for selected conditions also a volumetric flow field spanning the whole width of the transom could be reconstructed from multiplane stereo piv measurements when comparing experimental results with those from simulations often the question arises if the experimental conditions have been accurately modelled in the numerical simulations especially in the case of the flow in front of an interceptor the pressure distribution is very sensitive to differences in boundary layer characteristics brizzolara 2003 by comparing the measured velocity field in front of the interceptor with results from simulations it was made sure that the experimental conditions were accurately reproduced within the numerical simulations the following analysis of the dynamic pressure fields for a range of interceptor heights and model speeds showed that the pressure distribution in the flow field as well as the extrapolated pressures on the ship hull are in good agreement with each other with performing multiplane stereo piv measurements an alternative technique is proposed to measure the average dynamic pressure distribution on a whole segment of a ship model in case of the present study the 3d effects of an interceptor with a finite span on the pressure distribution on the ship hull were successfully captured however for a systematic study of the effect of the three dimensionality of the flow more configurations have to be analyzed to judge the accuracy of the reconstructed pressures the correlation statistics method of wieneke 2015 has been applied to quantify the random uncertainty component of the recorded velocity field which was afterwards propagated towards the pressure field with monte carlo simulations the resulting uncertainty maps of velocity and pressure fields showed large local variations with a steep increase of uncertainty values in the boundary layer of the ship model emphasizing the need for such a method and not only rely on freestream measurements however the combination with freestream measurements is advised as a good measure to identify and correct for any systematic errors such as calibration target misalignment the presented technique has proven to be an interesting fully non intrusive alternative to the existing methods which are currently used in towing tank tests especially when only the dynamic pressure distribution is of interest this technique offers several advantages however due to spatial as well as temporal limitations it does not make segmented model test or test with arrays of pressure transducers obsolete while the current study has shown the potential of the method for towing tank applications further effort has to be put into validation of the method and comparisons with pressure gauge arrays have to be made as the focus has been on time averaged measurements only also the limitations and accuracy of performing time resolved pressure piv measurements in towing tanks need to be further investigated 
22841,the present study describes the application of the particle image velocimetry piv technique for the reconstruction of hydrodynamic pressures and loads on a ship model from measured velocity fields during towing tank tests as an alternative to conventional pressure and force measurement techniques the method simultaneously pictures the velocity field and captures the dynamic aspect of the flow the presented measurements are conducted in the transom region of a generic hull of a planing vessel which is equipped with an interceptor to create a stagnating flow associated with a high pressure peak the flow close to the hull is captured with an underwater stereoscopic piv system and the pressure peak in front of the interceptor is reconstructed from time averaged velocity fields results show the effect of different interceptor heights on the pressure distribution in the center plane of the model further a 3d flow field is reconstructed from scanning piv measurements to analyze the lift reduction due to the finite span of the interceptor the spatial variation of the measurement uncertainty is analyzed and propagated to the pressure field uncertainty and the potential of the method is further evaluated by comparison with numerical results from steady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations keywords underwater piv pressure reconstruction piv uncertainty interceptor 1 introduction as soon a ship operates at high forward speeds its weight is predominantly supported by hydrodynamic rather than hydrostatic forces small changes in the dynamic pressure distribution on the ship hull can have a significant influence on the ship s running attitude and performance in order to further improve these vessels it is thus important to investigate the flow in the vicinity of the ship hull and to accurately determine global as well local pressure distributions while there has been steady development and improvement of numerical tools to analyze the flow physics and the ship s structural and motion response towing tank experiments are needed for their experimental validation however traditional towing tank tests mainly focus on the assessment of global loads during captive model tests the spatial resolution of such measurements can be improved by usage of segmented models where the ship is divided into several segments which are connected to a rigid backbone via several force balances as shown by keuning 1994 and de jong and keuning 2006 who both performed towing tank tests with a high speed craft model consisting of 7 segments these tests could give additional insights into the distribution of hydrodynamic forces over the length of the ship hull by performing forced oscillation tests added mass and damping coefficients of the segments were determined however local effects could not be captured whenever a more detailed picture of the pressure distribution has to be drawn single pressure sensors can be fitted into the ship hull to measure pressures at discrete points if accumulated to arrays even a discretized representation of the pressure distribution can be assessed however due to their size resolution is limited and a change of the measurement position involves time intensive repositioning of the transducers furthermore a flush installation into the faired hull is desired to minimize the disturbance of the local flow an application for high speed craft is reported by choi 2018 where an array of 63 pressure sensors was used to determine a time averaged pressure distribution in the bow region of a fast displacement ship in aerodynamic applications the usage of pressure sensitive paint psp is a common means to accurately measure the pressure distribution on a surface with a high resolution mclachlan and bell 1995 this cannot be considered as an option for towing tank application where due the incompressibility of the fluid this technique can only detect the oxygen concentration sakaue et al 2009 but not pressure another technique which has been increasingly applied in recent years for pressure measurement on surfaces as well in the entire flow field is the pressure reconstruction derived from particle image velocimetry piv measurements as to the knowledge of the author in towing tank applications the piv technique has been so far only used to study the flow kinematics in this paper its application for pressure reconstruction during towing tank tests will be investigated when applied to the measured velocity field from piv measurements the navier stokes equations can be utilized to derive the pressure in the flow field and on the surface from the flow properties without any disturbance of the flow field in the measurement region the recent development of the piv technique and hardware components nowadays allows for a reconstruction of the 3d volumetric and even time resolved pressure fields using tomographic or stereoscopic scanning piv a detailed review of the main principles of piv based pressure measurement and a discussion of the methods accuracy has been presented by van oudheusden 2013 pressure reconstruction from piv measurements is well studied and widely accepted in numerous aerodynamic and hydrodynamic applications for aerodynamic applications the performance of pressure piv and psp measurements has been compared by tagliabue et al 2017 a good example of a practical application is given by ragni et al 2012 who used multi plane stereo piv measurements to assess the loads of an aircraft propeller in the field of ship hydrodynamics the technique has been successfully applied by nila et al 2013 to estimate slamming loads during the water entry of rigid bodies for the case of hydrodynamic applications it has to be emphasized that due to the reconstruction of the pressure field from measured velocities this method only measures the dynamic pressure component to investigate the possibilities of capturing the dynamic aspect of the flow around ships and loads on the ship hull in the present study the pressure piv technique will be applied to flow measurements in the direct vicinity of a ship model the presented measurements are conducted in the transom region of a generic hull of a planing vessel with a flat bottom aft section the transom of the model is equipped with an interceptor which behaves comparable to a forward facing step when deployed at high speeds the interceptor blade creates a stagnation region on the bottom of the hull in front of the transom which is associated with a high pressure peak typical blade heights are in the order of magnitude of the boundary layer height a schematic drawing of the interceptor and its influence on boundary layer flow and wall pressure distribution is depicted in fig 1 mainly used in static configurations the generated lift is used to influence the trim of a ship by dynamically changing the height of the interceptor it is also used for active ride control of fast ships in waves the flow around interceptors and the resulting hydrodynamic forces are well studied with numerical methods by brizzolara 2003 and villa and brizzolara 2009 with potential and ranse methods molini and brizzolara 2005 also discussed the 3d effects of an interceptor with a finite span however 3d results were obtained without taking the influence of the boundary layer into account a more recent study has been undertaken by pearce and brandner 2014 who compared analytical and potential methods to predict the cavitating flow over a wall mounted fence on the experimental side segmented model tests have been performed by rijkens et al 2013 to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of different interceptor configurations mansoori and fernandes 2015 performed a more fundamental analysis by experimentally and numerically analyzing the performance of an interceptor which was mounted to a flat plate the aim of this study is to correctly capture the flow close to the ship hull and reconstruct the pressure peak in front of the interceptor from time averaged velocity fields the spatial variation of uncertainty is analyzed and propagated to the pressure field uncertainty the 2d pressure field in the center plane of the model is reconstructed from planar stereo piv measurements showing the effect of different interceptor heights the three dimensional effects of the flow on the pressure distribution in front of the interceptor are captured with stereoscopic scanning piv measurements finally the potential of the pressure piv method is further evaluated by comparing experimental with numerical results from steady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations 2 experimental setup the piv experiments are performed at the large towing tank of the ship hydrodynamics laboratory at delft university of technology the tank has a cross section of 4 22 m width and 2 5 m depth over a test section length of 142 m the carriage is able to operate at a maximum speed of 7 m s a model of a generic planning hull with an overall length of 1 8 m is used in this study the same model has already been used by rijkens et al 2013 to experimentally study the hydrodynamic performance of interceptors and transom flaps for the motion control of fast ships during segmented model tests its transom section has a simple box shape with a constant cross section being 0 4 m wide and 0 8 m long to provide optical access to the measurement area for illumination with the laser sheet the bottom of the segment is replaced by an acrylic glass plate the bow segment is designed from developable surfaces with the purpose to smoothly divert the flow to the transom segment at the transom of the model an interceptor of adjustable height is attached manufactured from a simple plate the interceptor covers the whole beam of the model four guiding rails guarantee a smooth and accurate setting of the interceptor intrusion height to accurately position the model within the field of view of the piv system and to set it to its correct running trim and sinkage the model is mounted to the carriage via a symmetrie notus hexapod with its linear travel range of 250 mm it was also used to reposition the model in between runs during the scanning piv tests and makes an extra traversing system for the piv system obsolete for all test runs the model is kept at a constant draft of 50 mm and constant bow up trim of 3 resulting in a wetted length of 1 52 m for the 2d piv measurements in the center plane of the model a test matrix with carriage speeds of 3 4 and 5 m s are performed while the interceptor intrusion height is stepwise increased from 0 mm up to 20 mm with increments of 5 mm the carriage speeds are equivalent to length based froude numbers of 0 71 0 95 and 1 19 reynolds numbers based on the wetted length of the ship range from 5 4e4 to 9 0e5 a volumetric reconstruction from scanning piv measurements is attempted for selected conditions at speeds of 3 and 4 m s with interceptor heights of 10 and 20 mm to capture the three dimensionality of the flow field the model position is shifted in the transverse direction between runs resulting in a total number of 14 measurement positions from the center plane to the side of the model as the three dimensionality of the flow is expected to increase with increasing distance from the center plane the spacing in between measurement planes is reduced from 20 mm in the center plane to 10 mm at the side of the model 2 1 piv setup the flow in the vicinity of the interceptor is investigated with an underwater stereoscopic piv setup to minimize reflections from the bottom of the ship hull and increase the near wall resolution the laser head and optics are placed above the water and the laser sheet is guided through the acrylic glass bottom of the model to the field of view the two cameras are each located in a watertight torpedo shaped housing to get optical access to the region in front of the interceptor the cameras are located approximately 680 mm in front of the transom looking backwards to the field of view with a 60 mirror section a symmetric arrangement with one camera on either side of the light sheet is used to accomplish a high accuracy determination of the out of plane velocity component to prevent any disturbance of the flow in the measurement region the struts which connect the torpedo to the carriage are positioned as far aft as the transom of the ship model and have a streamlined shape the immersion depth of the torpedoes is 490 mm and their horizontal stand off distance is 1000 mm fig 2 shows a schematic drawing of the piv setup indicating the position of the cameras and measurement planes for illumination of the measurement plane a litron bernoulli nd yag laser with 200 mj pulse energy at a wave length of 532 nm is used image acquisition was done with two lavision imager pro sx cameras with a sensor size of 2448 2050 pixels and 12 bit color depth equipped with lenses of 28 mm focal length the field of view was approximately 200 200 mm2 to keep the particles focused over the whole field of view a scheimpflug adapter is mounted in front of each camera with a pixel pitch of 3 45 μm the digital resolution is approximately 10 pixels mm images are recorded at a double frame acquisition rate of 7 hz resulting in 210 image pairs per measurement run at the lowest speed and 120 image pairs at the highest speed calibration of the cameras is done with a two level double sided 3d calibration plate which is carefully aligned in an iterative process with the moving direction of the carriage mounting the calibration plate to the hexapod enables for a highly accurate repositioning of the plate during the calibration process to guarantee a uniform distribution of the 50 μm polymer vestosint particles in the measurement area a retractable seeding rake is mounted in front of the carriage prior to releasing the particles into the towing tank in between measurement runs they are premixed in a high shear flow to prevent clustering while after every measurement run the tank is reseeded a waiting time of 25 min allows the water to settle in between runs 3 piv processing as previously found by jacobi et al 2016 structural vibrations can occur at high towing velocities which significantly affect the quality of the image correlation it was shown that vibrations of the measurement system and thus the fluctuations of disparity increased at high carriage speeds based on the cross correlation of two images taken at the same instant of time wieneke 2005 proposed a method to test for a static misalignment of the recombined stereo piv images using the resulting disparity map the initial calibration can be further refined and calibration coefficients can be corrected for a static misalignment of the calibration plate in most piv applications conducted in a controlled laboratory environment this would be sufficient to completely correct for any misalignment of the laser sheet and the calibration plate however when the measurement system is prone to vibrations disparity will vary in time if cameras and light sheet optics are not rigidly connected while the application of the self calibration procedure proposed by wieneke 2005 successfully removes the mean disparity in the recorded data set a fluctuating disparity is left with an amplitude of approximately 10 pixels at the highest analyzed carriage speed of 5 m s to further reduce the amplitude of the fluctuating residual disparity a two step correction procedure is introduced jacobi et al 2016 in the first step the disparity between all images for every single camera is reduced by correlating significant features of the ship hull after an independent shift correction for both cameras the image sets from both cameras still have a constant offset this is corrected in a second step by performing a second self calibration using the mean disparity vector field of all recordings the method significantly reduces the disparity over the whole tested speed range however the trend of increasing residual disparities with increasing carriage speed is still visible while for carriage speeds of 1 m s the root mean square of the fluctuating disparity could be reduced to 0 7 pixels at 5 m s the residual disparity was reduced to 2 5 pixels considering the recommendation that the displacement between particle pairs in dewarped images should not differ more than half the particle image size 2 3 pixels this was found to be acceptable data acquisition as well as data post processing is done using the commercial software package davis 8 4 0 from lavision before finally calculating the velocity fields a mask is applied to the images to mask out reflections on the acrylic glass plate and to enhance correlation close to the ship hull and interceptor the calculation of the velocity vector field is done in multiple correlation iterations starting with an interrogation window of 64 64 pixels in the initial pass the window size is iteratively decreased to 24 24 pixels the windows are overlapping by 50 and a gaussian weighting function was used fig 3 shows an example of a dewarped raw image and the in plane components from the mean velocity field which was obtained from 200 vector images as seen from the velocity fields the stagnation region in front of the interceptor is well captured as well as the downward acceleration towards the tip of the interceptor the coordinate system is chosen to match the ship coordinate system with the origin located at the transom of the model at 0 trim angle 3 1 pressure reconstruction and force determination having obtained the mean velocity field and its fluctuations from the statistical ensemble of the recorded velocity fields one can describe the pressure gradient of the mean pressure field with reynolds averaged momentum equation the decomposition of the velocity into a time averaged and fluctuating part leads to 1 u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j the pressure field can be either calculated from direct integration of the momentum equation or by solving the pressure poisson equation which is obtained by applying the divergence operator to the momentum equation 2 2 p x i 2 ρ x i u j u i x j ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j under the assumption that the flow is incompressible the divergence free condition holds i e u 0 as a result the viscous term disappears and the pressure poisson equation reduces to 3 2 p x i 2 ρ x i u j u i x j u i u j x j the advantages and disadvantages of both methods have been extensively discussed by van oudheusden 2013 in this case the poisson approach is chosen to reconstruct the pressure field as it has been reported to produce less noisy results albrecht et al 2012 the reynolds stresses are found from variances and covariances of the velocity vectors while in the symmetry plane of the ship model the flow is assumed to be two dimensional all spatial derivatives necessary for calculating the planar pressure field are obtained from a single plane measurement for a calculation of the three dimensional pressure field in front of the interceptor the spatial derivatives of the out of plane direction have to be obtained from the measured fields of adjacent measurement planes obtained from scanning piv measurements along the transverse direction of the ship model for the solution of the poisson equation a neumann boundary condition is obtained from the reynolds averaged momentum equation 1 to prescribe the non homogeneous pressure gradient at the boundary of the measurement area 4 n i p x i ρ n i u j u i x j ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j as only neumann boundary conditions are used a reference pressure is needed to correctly scale the reconstructed pressures as no data from a reference pressure sensor is available it is favorable to choose the reference pressure point to be in a region of undisturbed flow where it can be determined with the bernoulli equation however due to the limited size of the measurement area this was only possible for the smallest interceptor heights where the flow disturbance is small to compare the reconstructed field with results from simulations a reference pressure is taken from the numerical results 180 mm in front of the transom and 180 mm below the ship bottom where the flow is disturbed the least for the solution of the poisson pressure equation the openfoam 5 0 package is employed where the equation is discretized with a finite volume method fig 4 gives an example of the reconstructed pressure field in front of the interceptor and indicates the location p of the reference pressure point the reconstructed pressure field shows an increase of the pressure coefficient towards the transom with a clear pressure peak right in front of the interceptor in the stagnation region as the maximum blade stroke is smaller than the boundary layer height and the flow is decelerated towards the wall in the boundary layer the maximum pressure coefficient is well below 1 the generated lift force from the interceptor will be obtained by numerically integrating the extrapolated pressure distribution over the length of the analyzed longitudinal segment of the model hull 5 l p n d s z i 1 n p i c o s θ d s i here z describes the direction normal to the freestream and θ is the trim angle of the ship model with s being the length of the segment and v c being the carriage velocity the sectional lift coefficient per unit span is calculated as 6 c l 2 l ρ v c 2 s 4 measurement uncertainty assessment and propagation 4 1 measurement uncertainty as the quality of piv measurements is influenced by multiple error sources it is challenging to consider all of these for a reliable estimation of velocity field uncertainty however a number of posteriori uncertainty estimation methods have been developed recently amongst these the quantification of uncertainty based on the correlation statistics by wieneke 2015 has shown to give a reliable estimate of the random uncertainty components looking only at the statistical quantities of the measured velocities the uncertainty is due to the finite sample size typically dominated by random errors and justifies a limitation to this component in the following analysis it has been shown by boomsma et al 2016 that these random errors are well predicted with the correlation statistics uncertainty quantification method to further assess the performance of the correlation statistics method to identify the random uncertainty components of the measured velocity field in towing tank applications additionally a series of uniform flow measurements were performed furthermore these tests are performed to identify any bias introduced by the misalignment of the calibration plate since the laser is guided through the acrylic glass bottom of the model the bottom has to be immersed in the water to minimize the disturbance from the model on the flow it is trimmed to 0 and its draft is changed to a minimum of 0 01 m afterwards the temporal statistics of the freestream flow are analyzed at a single point with a distance of 0 1 m from the ship bottom for carriage speeds from 3 m s to 5 m s in all analyzed cases the laser pulse separation dt was chosen to yield a pixel displacement of approximately 10 pixels for the freestream velocity assuming still water before every measurement run in the case of no obstruction in the flow the disturbance of the flow is assumed to be negligible under the assumption that any measured velocity fluctuations are due to errors in the measurement system and the vector calculation procedure the root mean square rms of the estimated random uncertainties r m s u u should match the standard deviation of the measured velocities σ u boomsma et al 2016 7 r m s u u i 1 n u u i 2 n i 1 n u i u 2 n σ u here u u i describes the standard uncertainty obtained with the correlation statistics method u i describes the instantaneous velocity and u the temporal average of the velocity table 1 shows the uncertainty estimates and calculated errors for 3 m s and 5 m s freestream velocities while the bias for the vertical velocity component is found to be negligible the bias of the x and y velocity components indicate an initial rotation of the calibration target around the vertical axis of approximately 0 2 for all velocity components the rms of the estimated uncertainty is slightly over predicted compared to the standard deviation of the measured velocities an explanation for this over prediction may be found by looking at the uncertainty quantification procedure where next to random errors also small bias errors can be introduced for larger particle image sizes where the piv algorithm does not converge to a fixed value while in both cases the water was considered to be at rest the increasing fluctuations at a higher carriage velocity may be due to an increase of the structural vibrations having reported an estimation of the uncertainty in the undisturbed flow it has to be noted that the uncertainty can vary significantly in space depending on the local characteristics of the flow in the present case it is expected for the uncertainty to significantly increase in the boundary layer region due to the higher velocity gradient as shown by van doorne et al 2004 in areas with no velocity gradient the registration error is zero but increases in regions with high velocity gradients due to the mismatch of the back projected images especially at high speeds this component is considered to be the largest uncertainty component due to the structural vibrations of the carriage furthermore the correlation noise is expected to increase towards the ship hull due to the turbulent flow in the boundary layer fig 5 shows an example of the rms of the velocity field uncertainty contours calculated from 200 images the model speed is 3 m s and the interceptor height is 20 mm a clear difference between the boundary layer region and the outer free stream region can be seen while values in the outer region are in compliance with the initial freestream reference runs the uncertainty increases towards the boundary layer highest values are found in the stagnation region close to the interceptor with uncertainties up to 3 of the freestream velocity component 4 2 uncertainty propagation as the main uncertainty components are of random nature their magnitude scales with the number of samples n when calculating the uncertainty of the time averaged velocity field components following sciacchitano and wieneke 2016 the uncertainty of the mean velocity u u can be calculated as 8 u u σ u n however the velocity standard deviation σ u contains the true velocity fluctuations as well as the measurement errors having quantified the spatial uncertainty distributions for every time step with the correlation statistics method instead of using equation 8 the uncertainties from every time step are propagated towards the uncertainty of the mean velocity u u using the uncertainties of the instantaneous velocities u u i 9 u u i 1 n u u i 2 n using the derived formulas from sciacchitano and wieneke 2016 also the uncertainty of the reynolds stresses can be determined as the uncertainties of the mean velocity field are small compared to the velocity fluctuations the uncertainty of the normal stresses equals the uncertainty of the variance 10 u r u u σ u 2 2 n 1 the uncertainty of the reynolds shear stress can be calculated with the covariance uncertainty equation which under the assumption of a zero correlation coefficient is 11 u r u v σ u σ v n 1 due to the non linearity of the poisson pressure equation 3 according to iso 2009 a monte carlo approach is chosen to propagate the assessed uncertainty components of the mean velocity and reynolds stresses to the time averaged pressure field p compared to the linear uncertainty propagation described according to iso 2008 this method gives a generally improved estimate of the output quantity p as found by azijli et al 2016 a linear uncertainty propagation of the measured components towards the pressure field leads to an underestimation of pressure uncertainty by about 30 compared to results from monte carlo simulations under the assumption of the measured input variables to be gaussian distributed simulations with 10 000 realizations are done to evaluate the uncertainty of the reconstructed pressure field the monte carlo simulations were performed within the openfoam package using the gaussnormal member function of the random class to generate variations of the input variables the final expanded uncertainty u p 95 is then calculated by multiplying the resulting standard uncertainty with a coverage factor of 2 for a confidence interval of 95 as seen in fig 6 the expanded uncertainty in the freestream region is below 0 5 of the maximum pressure and increases towards the boundary layer starting from approximately x h 1 the uncertainty increases significantly to up to 6 5 of the peak pressure right in front of the interceptor knowing the discrete uncertainty distribution of the pressure field on the ship hull the uncertainty of the sectional lift can be estimated as 12 u l i 1 n u p i 2 d s i 2 5 numerical simulations for a comparison of the obtained piv results with numerical results cfd simulations of the performed towing tank tests are made with the open source code openfoam 5 0 the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are solved with the interfoam solver where the volume of fluid vof approach is applied to capture the two phase interface the governing equations are discretized with second order central differencing schemes and a two equation k omega sst model is used for modelling the turbulence as the ship model is symmetric only one half of the ship is meshed to reduce the number of cells the numerical grid is generated with the hexahedral mesher snappyhexmesh which is modified to fit the needs for meshing of marine applications and allow for higher aspect ratio cells in the free surface region after calculating an initial solution with a coarse grid the grid is further refined in the free surface region and in front of the interceptor an example of the final mesh in the free surface region is depicted in fig 7 including the dimensions of the domain while the cross section of the domain was chosen to fit the tu delft towing tank dimensions the outlet position of the domain was chosen according to the ittc guidelines ittc 2011 to prevent wave reflection also depicted in fig 7 is the refined region in front of the interceptor with the prismatic boundary layers inserted on the ship hull the total mesh consisted of approximately 3 5 million cells with a dimensionless wall distance y of 1 on the ship hull to analyze the accuracy of the simulations the lift generated by the interceptor in the aft section of the model is compared the results of segmented model tests performed by rijkens et al 2013 fig 8 shows the comparison of the generated lift force on the aft segment of the ship hull for different speeds and interceptor intrusion heights the lift force generated by the hull without interceptor is subtracted from the results the numerical results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results especially for interceptor heights up to 15 mm the comparison error is below 2 interestingly at interceptor heights of 20 mm the cfd results systematically under predict the measured lift force the maximum comparison error here is approximately 6 6 discussion and comparison of experimental and numerical results 6 1 2d results the flow field in front of the interceptor is recorded in the center plane of the ship model while systematically varying of intruder height and ship speed while the ship hull is considered to be symmetrical the flow in the center plane can be considered to be two dimensional with no out of plane velocity as shown by brizzolara 2003 already small changes in the boundary layer shape can significantly change the pressure distribution in front of the interceptor following from this it has to be made sure that the simulated flow field close to the ship hull is in good agreement with the experimental conditions before comparing simulated and reconstructed pressure fields fig 9 gives an insight into the flow in front of the interceptor close to the ship hull the mean velocity and pressure profiles in the center plane of the model are plotted for different stations in front of the transom results are presented for an interceptor intrusion height of 20 mm measured velocities and reconstructed pressures are compared to results from the performed cfd calculations to judge the quality of the near wall resolution the velocity magnitude is made dimensionless with the free stream velocity wall distance and longitudinal distance from the transom are expressed relative to the interceptor height h affected by the adverse pressure gradient which is generated by the interceptor the flow in the boundary layer is decelerated towards the transom measured and simulated velocity and pressure profiles are in good agreement with each other while jacobi et al 2016 found larger differences in the near wall velocity field a grid refinement in wall normal direction with resulting y 1 could improve the agreement of the simulation results with the velocity profiles found from piv measurements as expected the good agreement of the velocity field in the boundary layer also leads to a good agreement of the reconstructed and simulated pressures contour plots of the reconstructed pressure field in front of the interceptor in the center plane of the model are depicted in fig 10 where they are compared to the simulation results pressure fields are shown for 10 mm and 20 mm interceptor intrusion heights while the contours of the reconstructed fields are affected by noise there is still a good agreement with the simulations largest differences can be found close to the interceptor in the stagnation region where both reconstructed results give a higher maximum pressure compared to the simulations however both simulations and measurements clearly show an increase of the peak pressure in front of the interceptor with increasing blade height to further analyze the dependency of the pressure distribution on the ship hull on interceptor height the pressure distribution on the hull is plotted in fig 11 for interceptor heights increasing from 0 to 20 mm in steps of 5 mm at constant model speed as shown in fig 9 the velocity field and thus the pressure field is well resolved close to the wall this justifies the assumption that the reconstructed pressure in the upper most cells represents the surface pressure on the ship hull under the assumption of a zero pressure gradient in wall normal direction while the lines represent the cfd results the dots represent the reconstructed pressures as the original resolution of the piv vector grid resulted in a total of approximately 135 measurement points over length of the measurement section on the ship hull for the sake of clarity only every fourth measurement point is plotted in all conditions the flow is smoothly separating from the transom leaving the transom dry resulting from this without any interceptor the pressure drops to atmospheric pressure towards the transom due to the presence of the free surface leading to a negative dynamic pressure at the transom due to the stagnation region in front of the interceptor this pressure becomes positive and is increasing with interceptor height also the point of separation shifts further forward resulting in an increasing region of constant pressure right in front of the interceptor both results from measurements and simulation are in good agreement with each other with largest differences in the region of the pressure peak however the difference of the peak pressures still lies within the uncertainty band of the piv results which was estimated to be approximately 6 of the peak pressure value in this region the reconstructed 2d pressure fields in the center plane of the ship hull were integrated to yield the total dynamic lift force component in the aft region of the ship disregarding any 3d effects fig 12 shows the lift force for all analyzed speeds and interceptor heights per unit ship width and compares experimental results and their calculated uncertainty with results from cfd simulations the uncertainties of the integral forces were found from integrating the uncertainties of the single measurement points while for 3 m s experimental results are in good agreement with simulations the integrated values at 4 and 5 m s are slightly over predicted for most analyzed conditions with maximum differences of approximately 8 percent as the laser pulse separation has been initially chosen to yield a constant pixel displacement in the freestream for all tested velocities the actual uncertainty values increase proportionally with carriage velocity this trend is also propagated to the integral forces 6 2 3d results for selected conditions at 3 and 4 m s the measurement planes were shifted stepwise towards the side of the model to reconstruct a volumetric velocity field from a total of 14 measurement planes and analyze the three dimensionality of the flow around the interceptor fig 13 shows contour plots of the three velocity components and reconstructed pressures at 3 transverse positions from a selected run with an interceptor height of 20 mm at a speed of 3 m s at y 0 in the center plane of the ship model the mean flow is purely two dimensional while the out of plane component is close to zero in the whole field of view the in plane components show a deceleration of the flow towards the interceptor in x direction and an acceleration in z direction as seen from the contour plots at y 0 75b 2 and b 2 with b being the ship width the out of plane component steadily increases towards the side of the model while the downward component decreases with the increasing out of plane component towards the side of the interceptor blade the high pressure region in front of the interceptor significantly reduces in size the reconstructed volumetric pressure field has been extrapolated to the ship hull to further analyze the three dimensional effects of the flow on the surface pressure distribution results presented in fig 14 show the reconstructed pressure coefficient on the ship hull for interceptor heights of 10 and 20 mm at 3 m s model speed on an area of 180 190 mm2 further measurement results are compared to pressure distributions which were obtained from cfd simulations as already seen in fig 13 due to the increased transverse flow component in front of the interceptor the pressure reduces towards the side of the interceptor blade while there is a good agreement between results from cfd and piv measurements largest deviations can be found in the peak pressure region as already seen from the two dimensional results the reconstructed peak pressure form the piv measurements is slightly higher compared to the cfd results an integration of the surface pressure along the ships longitudinal direction at different transverse sections quantifies the hydrodynamic lift reduction towards the side of the interceptor due to the three dimensionality of the flow fig 15 shows the sectional lift coefficient and its uncertainty from all 14 measurement planes and compares them to the numerical results results from experiments and simulations both clearly show a reduction of lift towards the side of the interceptor and are in good agreement with each other for all analyzed velocities and interceptor heights due to the over prediction of the pressure peak in the center planes of the ship here the total dynamic lift is also over predicted by the pressure reconstruction from piv results however an integration of the sectional loads over the width of the ship leads to maximum differences of approximately 3 of the hydrodynamic lift between experimental and numerical results general conclusions about the lift reduction due to three dimensional effects and its dependency on interceptor height and speed cannot be drawn from these results as the measurement area was too small and no volumetric field has been reconstructed for runs without interceptor 7 conclusion the present study has been conducted to evaluate an alternative means of measuring the surface pressure distribution on a ship model during towing tank tests while studying the characteristics of the flow around an interceptor for this purpose an underwater stereo piv system has been utilized to measure the mean velocity field close to the ship these results eventually have been used together with the poisson pressure equation to reconstruct the average pressure field in the flow field as well as on the ship model while a broader range of conditions was analyzed with single plane piv measurements in the center plane of the model for selected conditions also a volumetric flow field spanning the whole width of the transom could be reconstructed from multiplane stereo piv measurements when comparing experimental results with those from simulations often the question arises if the experimental conditions have been accurately modelled in the numerical simulations especially in the case of the flow in front of an interceptor the pressure distribution is very sensitive to differences in boundary layer characteristics brizzolara 2003 by comparing the measured velocity field in front of the interceptor with results from simulations it was made sure that the experimental conditions were accurately reproduced within the numerical simulations the following analysis of the dynamic pressure fields for a range of interceptor heights and model speeds showed that the pressure distribution in the flow field as well as the extrapolated pressures on the ship hull are in good agreement with each other with performing multiplane stereo piv measurements an alternative technique is proposed to measure the average dynamic pressure distribution on a whole segment of a ship model in case of the present study the 3d effects of an interceptor with a finite span on the pressure distribution on the ship hull were successfully captured however for a systematic study of the effect of the three dimensionality of the flow more configurations have to be analyzed to judge the accuracy of the reconstructed pressures the correlation statistics method of wieneke 2015 has been applied to quantify the random uncertainty component of the recorded velocity field which was afterwards propagated towards the pressure field with monte carlo simulations the resulting uncertainty maps of velocity and pressure fields showed large local variations with a steep increase of uncertainty values in the boundary layer of the ship model emphasizing the need for such a method and not only rely on freestream measurements however the combination with freestream measurements is advised as a good measure to identify and correct for any systematic errors such as calibration target misalignment the presented technique has proven to be an interesting fully non intrusive alternative to the existing methods which are currently used in towing tank tests especially when only the dynamic pressure distribution is of interest this technique offers several advantages however due to spatial as well as temporal limitations it does not make segmented model test or test with arrays of pressure transducers obsolete while the current study has shown the potential of the method for towing tank applications further effort has to be put into validation of the method and comparisons with pressure gauge arrays have to be made as the focus has been on time averaged measurements only also the limitations and accuracy of performing time resolved pressure piv measurements in towing tanks need to be further investigated 
22842,how to accurately estimate the permanent deformation of soils due to large number cycles of cyclic loads is essential in many engineering projects such as offshore wind turbine foundation and high speed railway it is still a challenging issue although many works have been carried out in this study a series of cyclic triaxial tests with different levels of initial mean effective stress relative density initial static stress ratio and cyclic stress ratio were performed on saturated toyoura sand test results clearly showed that the vertical permanent strain increased with increasing cyclic stress ratio and initial mean effective stress moreover the shear strain amplitude during the initial loading of the first load cycle was used to describe the intensity of soil particles rearrangement which is the mechanism of permanent deformation a unique relationship between the shear strain amplitude and the vertical permanent strain was established a four parameter model was subsequently proposed for estimating the permanent strain of sand under cyclic loading which inherently considered all the main influencing factors finally the comparison between the estimation and the measurement in laboratory tests convincingly illustrates the adequacy of the proposed model in estimating the permanent deformation of sand under cyclic loading keywords cyclic triaxial test sand permanent deformation shear modulus shear strain amplitude 1 introduction under long term cyclic loading such as wave loads traffic loads and loads from machine foundations it tends to produce excessive permanent deformations of soils around the infrastructure foundations which may require significant costs to maintain and refurbish and even leads to geotechnical engineering accidents

deformation of sand subjected to cyclic loading is therefore of particular concern the cyclic loading has normally been simplified into a cyclic vertical load in cyclic triaxial tests to investigate the deformation of soils under cyclic loading monismith et al 1975 hyde and brown 1976 gidel et al 2001 puppala et al 2009 guo et al 2013 wang et al 2013a 2013b based on the test results from cyclic triaxial tests many empirical models have been established to estimate the permanent deformation monismith et al 1975 lentz and baladi 1981 ullditz 1993 gidel et al 2001 chai and miura 2002 wichtmann et al 2005 wang et al 2013b cai et al 2018 ren et al 2018 at present the existing empirical models for granular materials can be divided into three main types the first type of models is simple in form and it can describe the variation of permanent deformations with the number of loading cycles however it cannot reflect the effect of the applied stresses on the accumulative deformation and thus has significant limitations barksdale 1972 sweere 1990 the second type considers the effect of the applied stresses generally the maximum applied stresses on the accumulative deformation but the effect of the number of cycles is not taken into account hyde 1974 shenton 1978 lekarp and dawson 1998 the third type of models considers the effects of the number of load cycles and the applied stresses but the formulas are very complex and have many empirical fitting parameters pappin 1979 lentz and baladi 1981 marr and chrisitian 1981 gidel et al 2001 wichtmann et al 2005 puppala et al 2009 sun 2015 wang et al 2015 cai et al 2015 table 1 compares the models for estimating the accumulative strain during cyclic loading as seen in table 1 these models are more or less empirical and lack essential analysis of the mechanism of the permanent deformation moreover the model parameters are usually obtained by data fitting and have no specific physical meanings which cannot be easily determined and applied in practical engineering silver and seed 1971 and youd 1972 performed a series of cyclic simple shear tests to investigate the compaction of sand resulting from cyclic shear strains the test results showed that the rate of compaction or volume change increases with shear strain amplitude significantly in addition the test results proved that the shear strain amplitude is the fundamental factor in determining the permanent deformation of granular materials under cyclic loading from the viewpoint of micromechanics the permanent deformation during cyclic loading results from the rearrangements of sand particles and such rearrangement is expected to be proportional to the shear strain amplitude i e disturbance during cyclic loading therefore it is well expected that the permanent deformation of sand depends on the cyclic shear strain and it is obviously practicable to analyze the permanent deformation of sand under cyclic loading from the perspective of cyclic shear strain amplitude the permanent deformation profile of a soil under cyclic loading includes three stages namely primary secondary and tertiary stages korkiala tanttu and dawson 2007 puppala et al 2009 the permanent deformation accumulates rapidly in the primary stage which normally lasts a few hundred cycles and the number of cycles in the secondary stage increases from several thousands to millions while the slope between permanent deformation and loading cycles remains basically constant then the soil structure may be destroyed and the slope changes significantly at the tertiary stage for long term cyclic loading we usually concern the secondary stage in this study the number of cycles is 5000 and hence the permanent deformation data can be extrapolated to estimate the permanent deformation at a large number of cycles puppala et al 1999 in this study an investigation was carried out to study the vertical permanent deformation of the saturated sand subjected to cyclic loading the main objective is to analyze the permanent deformation from the perspective of cyclic shear strain amplitude and establish a unified model for estimating the permanent deformation based on the shear strain amplitude the drained cyclic triaxial tests with different levels of initial mean effective stress p s relative density d r initial static stress ratio η s and cyclic stress ratio η d were performed on saturated toyoura sand the effects of cyclic stress ratio and initial mean effective stress on the permanent strain are discussed subsequently the shear strain amplitude during the initial load stage in the first cycle of loading was used to estimate the vertical permanent deformation an explicit model for estimating the permanent deformation of granular materials under a large number of cycles is established which only has four parameters it inherently considers the effects of initial mean effective stress relative density initial static stress ratio cyclic stress ratio and the number of cycles on the permanent deformation finally the adequacy of the proposed unified explicit model for estimating the permanent deformation under cyclic loading is further verified by the test data in literature 2 experimental program 2 1 test material and specimen preparation the material used in the test was toyoura sand with sub rounded to sub angular particles fig 1 shows the grain size distribution of toyoura sand the basic physical properties are as follows specific gravity s g 2 65 mean diameter d 50 0 16 mm maximum void ratio e max 0 931 minimum void ratio e min 0 611 the specimen is cylindrical with 70 mm in diameter and 140 mm in height it was prepared by dry tamping method first the oven dried sand was pouring into a mold in four equal layers using a funnel without falling height the specimen was compacted to the target height using a tamper for each layer after preparation a confining pressure of 10 kpa was applied to stand the specimen then the specimen was flushed with co2 and then de aired water finally a back pressure of 300 kpa was applied to ensure the saturation generally the pore water pressure coefficient b was greater than 0 98 2 2 loading stress the equipment used in the present study was a cyclic triaxial device manufactured by gds corporation the axial load was applied by an axial actuator and measured by a load transducer mounted on the top of the cell the cell pressure and back pressure controllers are used to independently control the cell pressure and back pressure using de aired water in a triaxial test the mean effective stress p and the deviatoric stress q are calculated as follows 1 p σ 1 2 σ 3 3 2 q σ 1 σ 3 where σ 1 and σ 3 are the axial stress and confining pressure respectively accordingly the initial mean effective stress p s and the initial deviatoric stress q s after consolidation are calculated as 3 p s σ 1 s 2 σ 3 s 3 4 q s σ 1 s σ 3 s where σ 1s and σ 3s are the initial axial stress and confining pressure respectively therefore the initial static stress ratio η s was defined as follows 5 η s q s p s during a cyclic triaxial test the confining pressure remained constant and the deviatoric stress was cyclically applied with an amplitude of q d the applied deviatoric stress q is sinusoidal and can be expressed as 6 q q s q cyc q s q d 1 sin ω t π 2 2 where q cyc was the applied cyclic deviatoric stress q d was the amplitude of the applied cyclic deviatoric stress ω 2π t t 5s and t is the loading time moreover the cyclic stress ratio η d could be calculated as follows 7 η d q d p s 2 3 test program there are many factors that have important effects on the permanent deformation under cyclic loadings such as the confining pressure deviatoric stress relative density soil type and so on the effects of initial mean effective stress p s cyclic stress ratio η d and the number of load cycles n on the permanent deformation were investigated in this study fig 2 shows the stress path in a cyclic triaxial test and table 2 lists the test program in this study as seen in table 2 tests cc1 cc2 and cc3 had identical loading stress except for the cyclic stress ratio η d 0 2 0 3 0 7 in order to consider the impact of cyclic stress ratio on the permanent deformation tests cc4 cc5 and cc6 had identical loading stress except for the initial mean effective stress p s 50 kpa 100 kpa 200 kpa in order to consider the impact of initial mean effective stress on the permanent deformation generally the tested confining pressure was similar to those in cai et al 2015 and sun et al 2017 and covers the field stress range for subsoil in shallow pavements and around the metro tunnels in shanghai e g depth varies from 10 m to 40 m in shanghai furthermore the specimens in cc1 cc2 and cc3 tests are isotropically consolidated η s 0 with a relative density d r 0 45 while the specimens in cc4 cc5 cc6 tests are anisotropically consolidated η s 0 5 with a relative density d r 0 6 after consolidation cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on saturated toyoura sand in drained conditions the frequency of the vertical cyclic loading was 0 2 hz to ensure the drained condition previous studies generally indicated that the effect of loading frequency on the permanent deformation was negligible youd 1972 wichtmann et al 2005 rondón et al 2009 each test was subjected to 5000 cycles of cyclic loading the vertical displacement is measured with an encoder mounted on the actuator motor while the volume change is measured by the gds back pressure controller 3 test results and discussions fig 3 shows the development of vertical permanent strain ε n acc with the number of cycles n in cc1 cc2 and cc3 tests with different cyclic stress ratio η d 0 2 0 3 0 7 it can be seen that the vertical permanent strain increases significantly with cyclic stress ratio for example ε n acc at n 5000 in cc2 and cc3 tests are 0 0829 and 0 154 respectively with an increase of about 86 as η d increases from 0 3 to 0 7 indicating η d has a significant effect on the ε n acc as expected furthermore it is clear that the vertical permanent strain is proportional to the logarithm of the number of load cycles which is consistent with barksdale 1972 and lentz 1979 the relationships between ε n acc and n in cc4 cc5 and cc6 tests with different initial mean effective stress p s 50 kpa 100 kpa 200 kpa are plotted in fig 4 it is obvious that the vertical permanent deformation increases with increasing initial mean effective stress in these tests with identical cyclic stress ratio for example ε n acc are 0 100 and 0 154 at n 5000 in cc4 and cc5 tests respectively with an increase of about 55 as p s increases from 50 kpa to 100 kpa this indicates that more permanent deformation is accumulated at higher p s however ε n acc are 0 154 and 0 164 at n 5000 in cc5 and cc6 tests with an increase of only 7 as p s increases from 100 kpa to 200 kpa the possible explanation is that the cyclic stress ratio remains the same in these tests and therefore larger cyclic deviatoric stress is applied to the specimen at higher initial mean effective stress it is expected that higher permanent deformation occurs at lower confining pressure and higher cyclic deviatoric stress when the rearrangement of soil particles is easier 4 model for permanent deformation estimation the typical stress path of specimens in a drained cyclic triaxial test is plotted in fig 2 point a represents the initial stress state and point b represents the final stress state during a cyclic loading the stress state alternatively varies between point a and point b and the sand is subjected to the cyclic deviatoric stress resulting in a cyclic shear strain the cyclic shear strain will rearrange the sand particles make the soil structure more compacted and generate permanent deformation therefore it is well expected that the permanent deformation of sand under cyclic loading depends on the cyclic shear strain amplitude fig 5 shows the schematic diagram of the soil stress strain curve in the first half cycle of cyclic loading the curve from a to b corresponds to the loading stage and b to c corresponds to the unloading stage each loading and unloading process produces an accumulated shear strain δγ it is reasonable that the greater the cyclic deviatoric stress q d the greater the shear strain amplitude δγ and thus the higher the accumulated shear strain δγ the shear strain γ subjected to a shear stress τ can be approximately calculated in the following form 8 τ g γ where g is the secant shear modulus of the soil note that the secant shear modulus g depends on the shear strain level indicating the nonlinear soil behavior the nonlinear behavior of the soil is usually represented by the modulus reduction curve as follows wichtmann and triantafyllidis 2013 9 g g max 1 1 γ γ r 1 a e γ γ r where g max is the maximum or the initial shear modulus γ r is the reference shear strain at which the shear modulus is about half of g max and a is a parameter controlling the shape of the modulus reduction curve moreover 10 γ r τ max g max where τ max is the shear strength of soil in a drained cyclic triaxial test it can be calculated as follows 11 τ max q ult 2 sin φ p 3 p s q s 3 1 sin φ p where q ult and φ p are the ultimate deviatoric stress and the peak friction angle of soil respectively the parameter a is calculated by 12 a 1 07 ln c u where c u is the coefficient of uniformity of the soil generally the initial shear modulus g max can be measured by resonant column or bender element tests youn et al 2008 yang and gu 2013 gu et al 2013 2015 wichtmann and triantafyllidis 2009 for sand g max in kpa can be also approximately determined as follows wichtmann and triantafyllidis 2009 13 g max 177000 1 d r 17 3 d r 2 p atm p s p atm 0 48 where d r in decimal form is the relative density of soil p atm is the atmospheric pressure i e 100 kpa and p s in kpa is the initial mean effective stress finally according to fig 5 the shear strain amplitude δγ in the loading stage of the first cycle of loading can be approximately calculated by 14 δ γ γ 1 γ s τ 1 g 1 τ s g s where γ s and γ 1 are the shear strain when subjected to the initial shear stress τ s τ s q s 2 and the maximum applied shear stress τ 1 τ 1 1 2 q s q d respectively similarly g s and g 1 are the secant shear moduli when the shear strains are γ s and γ 1 respectively the shear strain amplitude δγ of each test can be calculated by eqs 8 14 and the results in this study as listed in table 3 for toyoura sand the parameters are c u 1 5 φ p 34 5 and 36 0 when d r 0 45 and 0 6 respectively sun et al 2017 also conducted five drained cyclic triaxial tests on saturated toyoura sand with 104 number of cycles and the results calculated by eqs 8 14 are also listed in table 3 note that the initial mean effective stress p s used in eq 13 equals the initial confining pressure σ 3s since the stress strain relationship of soil in fig 5 begins from the isotropic consolidation in the past many models have been established to estimate the permanent deformation of sand under cyclic loading the correlation between the permanent deformation and the number of loading cycles has been investigated for many years barksdale 1972 and lentz 1979 established the same framework to describe the relationship between the vertical permanent deformation and the number of cycles as follows 15 ε n a c c c b ln n where ε n acc is the n th vertical permanent deformation c is the permanent deformation of the first cycle b is the increase rate of the permanent deformation with the number of cycles i e the slope and n is the number of cycles it was found that the vertical permanent strain was proportional to the logarithm of the number of loading cycles in this study although models in double logarithmic coordinates were used to fit the accumulation of vertical permanent strain and the number of load cycles in monismith et al 1975 and sweere 1990 according to eq 15 the correlation between the n th vertical permanent strain ε n acc and the 100th vertical permanent strain ε 100 acc could be easily deduced as follows 16 ε n acc ε 100 acc b ln n 100 fig 6 a shows the relationship between the measured 100th vertical permanent strain ε 100 acc and the calculated shear strain amplitude δγ in this study and in sun et al 2017 it can be seen that the 100th vertical permanent strain increases significantly with the shear strain amplitude furthermore it is interesting to note that there is a nearly linear relationship between ε 100 acc and δγ although small scattering was observed when the shear strain amplitude was very small fig 6b plots the slope b versus the calculated shear strain amplitude δγ obviously the slope b increases with the increase of shear strain amplitude and the relationship between b and δγ is also nearly linear it indicates that the permanent deformation increases faster with the number of cycles when the shear strain amplitude is higher therefore a linear fitting was adopted between ε 100 acc and δγ as well as between b and δγ the fitting coefficients r 2 are both greater than 0 97 as seen in fig 6 moreover it is exciting to find that the data in both studies basically falls on the same line it convincingly illustrated that the shear strain amplitude is a pivotal parameter to manifest the vertical permanent deformation which is consistent with silver and seed 1971 and youd 1972 accordingly a four parameter model is proposed for estimating the permanent deformation based on the shear strain amplitude for toyoura sand the formulation is presented in the following form 17 ε n acc α 1 δ γ α 2 α 3 δ γ α 4 ln n 100 where ε n acc in percentage is the n th vertical accumulative strain n is the number of loading cycles δγ in percentage is the calculated shear strain amplitude and α 1 α 4 are model parameters for toyoura sand α 1 0 818 α 2 0 046 α 3 0 0653 and α 4 0 0049 for verifying the performance of the proposed model the measured vertical permanent strains in sun et al 2017 and in this study and the estimated ones by eq 17 are shown in fig 7 a and fig 7b respectively the estimated permanent strains show a good agreement with the measured data suggesting that the proposed model is capable of estimating the permanent deformation precisely for better illustration the measured and estimated vertical permanent strains at the maximum cycle are listed in table 4 it can be seen that the deviation between the estimation and the measurement is less than 20 it indicated that the proposed model can successfully estimate the permanent deformation of sand in the cyclic triaxial tests with different levels of initial mean effective stress p s relative density d r initial static stress ratio η s and cyclic stress ratio η d for further verification more previous laboratory test data were analyzed by the proposed model lentz 1979 conducted a series of cyclic triaxial tests on highway subgrade sand in drained condition with 104 cycles and the confining pressure ranges from 34 5 to 344 7 kpa since e max and e min of highway subgrade sand were not given in lentz 1979 another formula was used to calculate the maximum shear modulus g max in kpa as follows wichtmann and triantafyllidis 2009 18 g max 1563 3 13 c u 2 98 1 94 exp 0 066 c u e 2 1 e p atm 1 0 4 c u 0 18 p s 0 4 c u 0 18 where e is the void ratio of soil p atm is the atmospheric pressure i e 100 kpa and p s in kpa is the initial mean effective stress as seen in eq 13 and eq 18 the effect of confining pressure on the accumulated deformation can be inherently considered by the proposed model in this study for highway subgrade sand the soil parameters are c u 1 8 φ p 37 3 when e 0 54 based on the tests data in lentz 1979 the relationships between the calculated shear strain amplitude δγ and the measured 100th vertical permanent strain ε 100 acc as well as the slope b are shown in fig 8 a and fig 8b respectively obviously these relationships are linear in general and the fitting coefficient r 2 are 0 997 and 0 987 respectively it convincingly indicated that the shear strain amplitude is an important parameter to reflect the permanent deformation then eq 17 was used to estimate the vertical permanent strain in these tests the ratios of the estimated vertical permanent strains to the measured ones are plotted in fig 9 a the deviation between the estimated value and the measured value is generally within 20 good consistency between the experimental and estimated data could be concluded for most of the tests suggesting that the proposed formulation provided good estimation however the estimated permanent deformation is considerably greater than the measured one for test b3 fig 9b shows the estimation results by the proposed model in lentz 1979 it can be seen that the estimation result for test b3 in lentz 1979 is also much greater than the measured one this may be attributed to the inaccuracy of experimental data in the test b3 by comparing fig 9a and b the estimation of the proposed model in this study is better in the early stage of cyclic loading wang et al 2015 also performed a comprehensive cyclic triaxial test on the permanent deformation of fujian sand with 5000 cycles see table 5 in this study the effects of initial mean effective stress p s relative density d r initial static stress ratio η s and cyclic stress ratio η d have been systematically studied for fujian sand the soil parameter is c u 1 6 and more details can be found in wang 2014 based on the experiment data the constants α 1 1 97 α 2 0 010 α 3 0 0718 and α 4 0 0011 can be obtained for fujian sand as shown in fig 8a and b the estimated results are presented in fig 10 a overall a good correlation is obtained between the estimated and measured vertical permanent strains indicating again that the proposed model could inherently reflect the effects of all these factors p s d r η s η d n on the permanent deformation the estimation model proposed in wang et al 2015 is shown in table 1 the second constant β 2 represents the increase rate of the permanent deformation with the number of cycles which is obtained by averaging a large number of experimental results thus the deviation of the increase rate of each test cannot be reflected moreover lots of tests are needed to determine the first constant β 1 the third constant β 3 and the fourth constant β 4 by data fitting fig 10b shows the estimation by the model in wang et al 2015 comparing fig 10a and b the performance of these two models is basically the same using a hollow cylinder apparatus cai et al 2015 studied the permanent deformation response of nanjing sand under cyclic loading with 104 cycles for nanjing sand the soil parameters are c u 1 72 φ p 36 8 when d r 0 7 based on the test data the fitting parameters are α 1 0 790 α 2 0 0025 α 3 0 368 and α 4 0 023 for nanjing sand as shown in fig 8 for better comparison the performances of the proposed models in cai et al 2015 and in this study are compared in table 6 and fig 11 obviously these models are able to estimate the vertical permanent strains under cyclic loading especially at the higher number of cycles moreover the estimation by the proposed model in this study is somewhat better than that by cai et al 2015 it should be noted that the fitted slope b of nanjing sand is considerably higher than those of other sands which is probably due to the wide range of void ratios e max e min as seen in table 7 obviously further study is necessary to investigate what determines the parameters of the proposed model for a certain soil table 7 lists the model parameters for different kinds of sand in literature each kind of sand has a set of specific formula parameters the formula parameters are influenced by many factors such as mineral composition particle shape and particle size distribution different from most of the existing estimation models the proposed permanent deformation formulation does not need to use a large number of cyclic triaxial test results to fit the corresponding formula parameters theoretically only two sets of tests are required to determine the four model parameters so as to roughly estimate the cumulative deformation of sand under cyclic loading the analyses on the data in previous experimental tests convincingly illustrated the good performance of the proposed model in estimating the accumulative strain of sand during cyclic loading 5 summary and conclusions in this study a series of cyclic triaxial tests were performed on saturated toyoura sand to investigate the accumulative strain under a large number of cyclic loads the effects of initial mean effective stress p s relative density d r initial static stress ratio η s and cyclic stress ratio η d were analyzed bearing in mind the mechanism of cyclic deformation the shear strain amplitude δγ during the initial load stage in the first cycle was calculated and it was related to the vertical permanent deformation a four parameter model for estimating permanent deformation of sand under cyclic loading was proposed the following conclusions could be drawn a the cyclic stress ratio and initial mean effective stress both have an obvious effect on the accumulative permanent deformation the vertical permanent deformation significantly increases with increasing cyclic stress ratio and initial mean effective stress b the 100th vertical permanent deformation is linearly proportional to the shear strain amplitude in the loading stage of the first cycle meanwhile the slope b is also linear with the shear strain amplitude the shear strain

22842,how to accurately estimate the permanent deformation of soils due to large number cycles of cyclic loads is essential in many engineering projects such as offshore wind turbine foundation and high speed railway it is still a challenging issue although many works have been carried out in this study a series of cyclic triaxial tests with different levels of initial mean effective stress relative density initial static stress ratio and cyclic stress ratio were performed on saturated toyoura sand test results clearly showed that the vertical permanent strain increased with increasing cyclic stress ratio and initial mean effective stress moreover the shear strain amplitude during the initial loading of the first load cycle was used to describe the intensity of soil particles rearrangement which is the mechanism of permanent deformation a unique relationship between the shear strain amplitude and the vertical permanent strain was established a four parameter model was subsequently proposed for estimating the permanent strain of sand under cyclic loading which inherently considered all the main influencing factors finally the comparison between the estimation and the measurement in laboratory tests convincingly illustrates the adequacy of the proposed model in estimating the permanent deformation of sand under cyclic loading keywords cyclic triaxial test sand permanent deformation shear modulus shear strain amplitude 1 introduction under long term cyclic loading such as wave loads traffic loads and loads from machine foundations it tends to produce excessive permanent deformations of soils around the infrastructure foundations which may require significant costs to maintain and refurbish and even leads to geotechnical engineering accidents muhanna et al 1998 puppala et al 1999 gu et al 2012 wang et al 2013a 2013b 2017 qian et al 2016 2018 guo et al 2017 sand is the most widely existing granular material and makes the foundations of extensive constructions such as harbors offshore wind turbines airport tracks and high speed railways which are subjected to various kinds of cyclic loading accurate estimation of the permanent deformation of sand subjected to cyclic loading is therefore of particular concern the cyclic loading has normally been simplified into a cyclic vertical load in cyclic triaxial tests to investigate the deformation of soils under cyclic loading monismith et al 1975 hyde and brown 1976 gidel et al 2001 puppala et al 2009 guo et al 2013 wang et al 2013a 2013b based on the test results from cyclic triaxial tests many empirical models have been established to estimate the permanent deformation monismith et al 1975 lentz and baladi 1981 ullditz 1993 gidel et al 2001 chai and miura 2002 wichtmann et al 2005 wang et al 2013b cai et al 2018 ren et al 2018 at present the existing empirical models for granular materials can be divided into three main types the first type of models is simple in form and it can describe the variation of permanent deformations with the number of loading cycles however it cannot reflect the effect of the applied stresses on the accumulative deformation and thus has significant limitations barksdale 1972 sweere 1990 the second type considers the effect of the applied stresses generally the maximum applied stresses on the accumulative deformation but the effect of the number of cycles is not taken into account hyde 1974 shenton 1978 lekarp and dawson 1998 the third type of models considers the effects of the number of load cycles and the applied stresses but the formulas are very complex and have many empirical fitting parameters pappin 1979 lentz and baladi 1981 marr and chrisitian 1981 gidel et al 2001 wichtmann et al 2005 puppala et al 2009 sun 2015 wang et al 2015 cai et al 2015 table 1 compares the models for estimating the accumulative strain during cyclic loading as seen in table 1 these models are more or less empirical and lack essential analysis of the mechanism of the permanent deformation moreover the model parameters are usually obtained by data fitting and have no specific physical meanings which cannot be easily determined and applied in practical engineering silver and seed 1971 and youd 1972 performed a series of cyclic simple shear tests to investigate the compaction of sand resulting from cyclic shear strains the test results showed that the rate of compaction or volume change increases with shear strain amplitude significantly in addition the test results proved that the shear strain amplitude is the fundamental factor in determining the permanent deformation of granular materials under cyclic loading from the viewpoint of micromechanics the permanent deformation during cyclic loading results from the rearrangements of sand particles and such rearrangement is expected to be proportional to the shear strain amplitude i e disturbance during cyclic loading therefore it is well expected that the permanent deformation of sand depends on the cyclic shear strain and it is obviously practicable to analyze the permanent deformation of sand under cyclic loading from the perspective of cyclic shear strain amplitude the permanent deformation profile of a soil under cyclic loading includes three stages namely primary secondary and tertiary stages korkiala tanttu and dawson 2007 puppala et al 2009 the permanent deformation accumulates rapidly in the primary stage which normally lasts a few hundred cycles and the number of cycles in the secondary stage increases from several thousands to millions while the slope between permanent deformation and loading cycles remains basically constant then the soil structure may be destroyed and the slope changes significantly at the tertiary stage for long term cyclic loading we usually concern the secondary stage in this study the number of cycles is 5000 and hence the permanent deformation data can be extrapolated to estimate the permanent deformation at a large number of cycles puppala et al 1999 in this study an investigation was carried out to study the vertical permanent deformation of the saturated sand subjected to cyclic loading the main objective is to analyze the permanent deformation from the perspective of cyclic shear strain amplitude and establish a unified model for estimating the permanent deformation based on the shear strain amplitude the drained cyclic triaxial tests with different levels of initial mean effective stress p s relative density d r initial static stress ratio η s and cyclic stress ratio η d were performed on saturated toyoura sand the effects of cyclic stress ratio and initial mean effective stress on the permanent strain are discussed subsequently the shear strain amplitude during the initial load stage in the first cycle of loading was used to estimate the vertical permanent deformation an explicit model for estimating the permanent deformation of granular materials under a large number of cycles is established which only has four parameters it inherently considers the effects of initial mean effective stress relative density initial static stress ratio cyclic stress ratio and the number of cycles on the permanent deformation finally the adequacy of the proposed unified explicit model for estimating the permanent deformation under cyclic loading is further verified by the test data in literature 2 experimental program 2 1 test material and specimen preparation the material used in the test was toyoura sand with sub rounded to sub angular particles fig 1 shows the grain size distribution of toyoura sand the basic physical properties are as follows specific gravity s g 2 65 mean diameter d 50 0 16 mm maximum void ratio e max 0 931 minimum void ratio e min 0 611 the specimen is cylindrical with 70 mm in diameter and 140 mm in height it was prepared by dry tamping method first the oven dried sand was pouring into a mold in four equal layers using a funnel without falling height the specimen was compacted to the target height using a tamper for each layer after preparation a confining pressure of 10 kpa was applied to stand the specimen then the specimen was flushed with co2 and then de aired water finally a back pressure of 300 kpa was applied to ensure the saturation generally the pore water pressure coefficient b was greater than 0 98 2 2 loading stress the equipment used in the present study was a cyclic triaxial device manufactured by gds corporation the axial load was applied by an axial actuator and measured by a load transducer mounted on the top of the cell the cell pressure and back pressure controllers are used to independently control the cell pressure and back pressure using de aired water in a triaxial test the mean effective stress p and the deviatoric stress q are calculated as follows 1 p σ 1 2 σ 3 3 2 q σ 1 σ 3 where σ 1 and σ 3 are the axial stress and confining pressure respectively accordingly the initial mean effective stress p s and the initial deviatoric stress q s after consolidation are calculated as 3 p s σ 1 s 2 σ 3 s 3 4 q s σ 1 s σ 3 s where σ 1s and σ 3s are the initial axial stress and confining pressure respectively therefore the initial static stress ratio η s was defined as follows 5 η s q s p s during a cyclic triaxial test the confining pressure remained constant and the deviatoric stress was cyclically applied with an amplitude of q d the applied deviatoric stress q is sinusoidal and can be expressed as 6 q q s q cyc q s q d 1 sin ω t π 2 2 where q cyc was the applied cyclic deviatoric stress q d was the amplitude of the applied cyclic deviatoric stress ω 2π t t 5s and t is the loading time moreover the cyclic stress ratio η d could be calculated as follows 7 η d q d p s 2 3 test program there are many factors that have important effects on the permanent deformation under cyclic loadings such as the confining pressure deviatoric stress relative density soil type and so on the effects of initial mean effective stress p s cyclic stress ratio η d and the number of load cycles n on the permanent deformation were investigated in this study fig 2 shows the stress path in a cyclic triaxial test and table 2 lists the test program in this study as seen in table 2 tests cc1 cc2 and cc3 had identical loading stress except for the cyclic stress ratio η d 0 2 0 3 0 7 in order to consider the impact of cyclic stress ratio on the permanent deformation tests cc4 cc5 and cc6 had identical loading stress except for the initial mean effective stress p s 50 kpa 100 kpa 200 kpa in order to consider the impact of initial mean effective stress on the permanent deformation generally the tested confining pressure was similar to those in cai et al 2015 and sun et al 2017 and covers the field stress range for subsoil in shallow pavements and around the metro tunnels in shanghai e g depth varies from 10 m to 40 m in shanghai furthermore the specimens in cc1 cc2 and cc3 tests are isotropically consolidated η s 0 with a relative density d r 0 45 while the specimens in cc4 cc5 cc6 tests are anisotropically consolidated η s 0 5 with a relative density d r 0 6 after consolidation cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on saturated toyoura sand in drained conditions the frequency of the vertical cyclic loading was 0 2 hz to ensure the drained condition previous studies generally indicated that the effect of loading frequency on the permanent deformation was negligible youd 1972 wichtmann et al 2005 rondón et al 2009 each test was subjected to 5000 cycles of cyclic loading the vertical displacement is measured with an encoder mounted on the actuator motor while the volume change is measured by the gds back pressure controller 3 test results and discussions fig 3 shows the development of vertical permanent strain ε n acc with the number of cycles n in cc1 cc2 and cc3 tests with different cyclic stress ratio η d 0 2 0 3 0 7 it can be seen that the vertical permanent strain increases significantly with cyclic stress ratio for example ε n acc at n 5000 in cc2 and cc3 tests are 0 0829 and 0 154 respectively with an increase of about 86 as η d increases from 0 3 to 0 7 indicating η d has a significant effect on the ε n acc as expected furthermore it is clear that the vertical permanent strain is proportional to the logarithm of the number of load cycles which is consistent with barksdale 1972 and lentz 1979 the relationships between ε n acc and n in cc4 cc5 and cc6 tests with different initial mean effective stress p s 50 kpa 100 kpa 200 kpa are plotted in fig 4 it is obvious that the vertical permanent deformation increases with increasing initial mean effective stress in these tests with identical cyclic stress ratio for example ε n acc are 0 100 and 0 154 at n 5000 in cc4 and cc5 tests respectively with an increase of about 55 as p s increases from 50 kpa to 100 kpa this indicates that more permanent deformation is accumulated at higher p s however ε n acc are 0 154 and 0 164 at n 5000 in cc5 and cc6 tests with an increase of only 7 as p s increases from 100 kpa to 200 kpa the possible explanation is that the cyclic stress ratio remains the same in these tests and therefore larger cyclic deviatoric stress is applied to the specimen at higher initial mean effective stress it is expected that higher permanent deformation occurs at lower confining pressure and higher cyclic deviatoric stress when the rearrangement of soil particles is easier 4 model for permanent deformation estimation the typical stress path of specimens in a drained cyclic triaxial test is plotted in fig 2 point a represents the initial stress state and point b represents the final stress state during a cyclic loading the stress state alternatively varies between point a and point b and the sand is subjected to the cyclic deviatoric stress resulting in a cyclic shear strain the cyclic shear strain will rearrange the sand particles make the soil structure more compacted and generate permanent deformation therefore it is well expected that the permanent deformation of sand under cyclic loading depends on the cyclic shear strain amplitude fig 5 shows the schematic diagram of the soil stress strain curve in the first half cycle of cyclic loading the curve from a to b corresponds to the loading stage and b to c corresponds to the unloading stage each loading and unloading process produces an accumulated shear strain δγ it is reasonable that the greater the cyclic deviatoric stress q d the greater the shear strain amplitude δγ and thus the higher the accumulated shear strain δγ the shear strain γ subjected to a shear stress τ can be approximately calculated in the following form 8 τ g γ where g is the secant shear modulus of the soil note that the secant shear modulus g depends on the shear strain level indicating the nonlinear soil behavior the nonlinear behavior of the soil is usually represented by the modulus reduction curve as follows wichtmann and triantafyllidis 2013 9 g g max 1 1 γ γ r 1 a e γ γ r where g max is the maximum or the initial shear modulus γ r is the reference shear strain at which the shear modulus is about half of g max and a is a parameter controlling the shape of the modulus reduction curve moreover 10 γ r τ max g max where τ max is the shear strength of soil in a drained cyclic triaxial test it can be calculated as follows 11 τ max q ult 2 sin φ p 3 p s q s 3 1 sin φ p where q ult and φ p are the ultimate deviatoric stress and the peak friction angle of soil respectively the parameter a is calculated by 12 a 1 07 ln c u where c u is the coefficient of uniformity of the soil generally the initial shear modulus g max can be measured by resonant column or bender element tests youn et al 2008 yang and gu 2013 gu et al 2013 2015 wichtmann and triantafyllidis 2009 for sand g max in kpa can be also approximately determined as follows wichtmann and triantafyllidis 2009 13 g max 177000 1 d r 17 3 d r 2 p atm p s p atm 0 48 where d r in decimal form is the relative density of soil p atm is the atmospheric pressure i e 100 kpa and p s in kpa is the initial mean effective stress finally according to fig 5 the shear strain amplitude δγ in the loading stage of the first cycle of loading can be approximately calculated by 14 δ γ γ 1 γ s τ 1 g 1 τ s g s where γ s and γ 1 are the shear strain when subjected to the initial shear stress τ s τ s q s 2 and the maximum applied shear stress τ 1 τ 1 1 2 q s q d respectively similarly g s and g 1 are the secant shear moduli when the shear strains are γ s and γ 1 respectively the shear strain amplitude δγ of each test can be calculated by eqs 8 14 and the results in this study as listed in table 3 for toyoura sand the parameters are c u 1 5 φ p 34 5 and 36 0 when d r 0 45 and 0 6 respectively sun et al 2017 also conducted five drained cyclic triaxial tests on saturated toyoura sand with 104 number of cycles and the results calculated by eqs 8 14 are also listed in table 3 note that the initial mean effective stress p s used in eq 13 equals the initial confining pressure σ 3s since the stress strain relationship of soil in fig 5 begins from the isotropic consolidation in the past many models have been established to estimate the permanent deformation of sand under cyclic loading the correlation between the permanent deformation and the number of loading cycles has been investigated for many years barksdale 1972 and lentz 1979 established the same framework to describe the relationship between the vertical permanent deformation and the number of cycles as follows 15 ε n a c c c b ln n where ε n acc is the n th vertical permanent deformation c is the permanent deformation of the first cycle b is the increase rate of the permanent deformation with the number of cycles i e the slope and n is the number of cycles it was found that the vertical permanent strain was proportional to the logarithm of the number of loading cycles in this study although models in double logarithmic coordinates were used to fit the accumulation of vertical permanent strain and the number of load cycles in monismith et al 1975 and sweere 1990 according to eq 15 the correlation between the n th vertical permanent strain ε n acc and the 100th vertical permanent strain ε 100 acc could be easily deduced as follows 16 ε n acc ε 100 acc b ln n 100 fig 6 a shows the relationship between the measured 100th vertical permanent strain ε 100 acc and the calculated shear strain amplitude δγ in this study and in sun et al 2017 it can be seen that the 100th vertical permanent strain increases significantly with the shear strain amplitude furthermore it is interesting to note that there is a nearly linear relationship between ε 100 acc and δγ although small scattering was observed when the shear strain amplitude was very small fig 6b plots the slope b versus the calculated shear strain amplitude δγ obviously the slope b increases with the increase of shear strain amplitude and the relationship between b and δγ is also nearly linear it indicates that the permanent deformation increases faster with the number of cycles when the shear strain amplitude is higher therefore a linear fitting was adopted between ε 100 acc and δγ as well as between b and δγ the fitting coefficients r 2 are both greater than 0 97 as seen in fig 6 moreover it is exciting to find that the data in both studies basically falls on the same line it convincingly illustrated that the shear strain amplitude is a pivotal parameter to manifest the vertical permanent deformation which is consistent with silver and seed 1971 and youd 1972 accordingly a four parameter model is proposed for estimating the permanent deformation based on the shear strain amplitude for toyoura sand the formulation is presented in the following form 17 ε n acc α 1 δ γ α 2 α 3 δ γ α 4 ln n 100 where ε n acc in percentage is the n th vertical accumulative strain n is the number of loading cycles δγ in percentage is the calculated shear strain amplitude and α 1 α 4 are model parameters for toyoura sand α 1 0 818 α 2 0 046 α 3 0 0653 and α 4 0 0049 for verifying the performance of the proposed model the measured vertical permanent strains in sun et al 2017 and in this study and the estimated ones by eq 17 are shown in fig 7 a and fig 7b respectively the estimated permanent strains show a good agreement with the measured data suggesting that the proposed model is capable of estimating the permanent deformation precisely for better illustration the measured and estimated vertical permanent strains at the maximum cycle are listed in table 4 it can be seen that the deviation between the estimation and the measurement is less than 20 it indicated that the proposed model can successfully estimate the permanent deformation of sand in the cyclic triaxial tests with different levels of initial mean effective stress p s relative density d r initial static stress ratio η s and cyclic stress ratio η d for further verification more previous laboratory test data were analyzed by the proposed model lentz 1979 conducted a series of cyclic triaxial tests on highway subgrade sand in drained condition with 104 cycles and the confining pressure ranges from 34 5 to 344 7 kpa since e max and e min of highway subgrade sand were not given in lentz 1979 another formula was used to calculate the maximum shear modulus g max in kpa as follows wichtmann and triantafyllidis 2009 18 g max 1563 3 13 c u 2 98 1 94 exp 0 066 c u e 2 1 e p atm 1 0 4 c u 0 18 p s 0 4 c u 0 18 where e is the void ratio of soil p atm is the atmospheric pressure i e 100 kpa and p s in kpa is the initial mean effective stress as seen in eq 13 and eq 18 the effect of confining pressure on the accumulated deformation can be inherently considered by the proposed model in this study for highway subgrade sand the soil parameters are c u 1 8 φ p 37 3 when e 0 54 based on the tests data in lentz 1979 the relationships between the calculated shear strain amplitude δγ and the measured 100th vertical permanent strain ε 100 acc as well as the slope b are shown in fig 8 a and fig 8b respectively obviously these relationships are linear in general and the fitting coefficient r 2 are 0 997 and 0 987 respectively it convincingly indicated that the shear strain amplitude is an important parameter to reflect the permanent deformation then eq 17 was used to estimate the vertical permanent strain in these tests the ratios of the estimated vertical permanent strains to the measured ones are plotted in fig 9 a the deviation between the estimated value and the measured value is generally within 20 good consistency between the experimental and estimated data could be concluded for most of the tests suggesting that the proposed formulation provided good estimation however the estimated permanent deformation is considerably greater than the measured one for test b3 fig 9b shows the estimation results by the proposed model in lentz 1979 it can be seen that the estimation result for test b3 in lentz 1979 is also much greater than the measured one this may be attributed to the inaccuracy of experimental data in the test b3 by comparing fig 9a and b the estimation of the proposed model in this study is better in the early stage of cyclic loading wang et al 2015 also performed a comprehensive cyclic triaxial test on the permanent deformation of fujian sand with 5000 cycles see table 5 in this study the effects of initial mean effective stress p s relative density d r initial static stress ratio η s and cyclic stress ratio η d have been systematically studied for fujian sand the soil parameter is c u 1 6 and more details can be found in wang 2014 based on the experiment data the constants α 1 1 97 α 2 0 010 α 3 0 0718 and α 4 0 0011 can be obtained for fujian sand as shown in fig 8a and b the estimated results are presented in fig 10 a overall a good correlation is obtained between the estimated and measured vertical permanent strains indicating again that the proposed model could inherently reflect the effects of all these factors p s d r η s η d n on the permanent deformation the estimation model proposed in wang et al 2015 is shown in table 1 the second constant β 2 represents the increase rate of the permanent deformation with the number of cycles which is obtained by averaging a large number of experimental results thus the deviation of the increase rate of each test cannot be reflected moreover lots of tests are needed to determine the first constant β 1 the third constant β 3 and the fourth constant β 4 by data fitting fig 10b shows the estimation by the model in wang et al 2015 comparing fig 10a and b the performance of these two models is basically the same using a hollow cylinder apparatus cai et al 2015 studied the permanent deformation response of nanjing sand under cyclic loading with 104 cycles for nanjing sand the soil parameters are c u 1 72 φ p 36 8 when d r 0 7 based on the test data the fitting parameters are α 1 0 790 α 2 0 0025 α 3 0 368 and α 4 0 023 for nanjing sand as shown in fig 8 for better comparison the performances of the proposed models in cai et al 2015 and in this study are compared in table 6 and fig 11 obviously these models are able to estimate the vertical permanent strains under cyclic loading especially at the higher number of cycles moreover the estimation by the proposed model in this study is somewhat better than that by cai et al 2015 it should be noted that the fitted slope b of nanjing sand is considerably higher than those of other sands which is probably due to the wide range of void ratios e max e min as seen in table 7 obviously further study is necessary to investigate what determines the parameters of the proposed model for a certain soil table 7 lists the model parameters for different kinds of sand in literature each kind of sand has a set of specific formula parameters the formula parameters are influenced by many factors such as mineral composition particle shape and particle size distribution different from most of the existing estimation models the proposed permanent deformation formulation does not need to use a large number of cyclic triaxial test results to fit the corresponding formula parameters theoretically only two sets of tests are required to determine the four model parameters so as to roughly estimate the cumulative deformation of sand under cyclic loading the analyses on the data in previous experimental tests convincingly illustrated the good performance of the proposed model in estimating the accumulative strain of sand during cyclic loading 5 summary and conclusions in this study a series of cyclic triaxial tests were performed on saturated toyoura sand to investigate the accumulative strain under a large number of cyclic loads the effects of initial mean effective stress p s relative density d r initial static stress ratio η s and cyclic stress ratio η d were analyzed bearing in mind the mechanism of cyclic deformation the shear strain amplitude δγ during the initial load stage in the first cycle was calculated and it was related to the vertical permanent deformation a four parameter model for estimating permanent deformation of sand under cyclic loading was proposed the following conclusions could be drawn a the cyclic stress ratio and initial mean effective stress both have an obvious effect on the accumulative permanent deformation the vertical permanent deformation significantly increases with increasing cyclic stress ratio and initial mean effective stress b the 100th vertical permanent deformation is linearly proportional to the shear strain amplitude in the loading stage of the first cycle meanwhile the slope b is also linear with the shear strain amplitude the shear strain amplitude is a pivotal parameter to manifest the vertical permanent deformation c a practical model for estimating cyclic permanent deformation of sand is established it reflects the underlying mechanism of cyclic permanent deformation and it only has four constants the model can inherently consider all the main influencing factors including the initial mean effective stress relative density initial static stress ratio cyclic stress ratio and the number of cycles the analyses on the data in previous tests convincingly illustrated that it can successfully estimate the accumulative strain

22843,the fouling is a major problem that occurs to the ship s hull this phenomenon causes severe economic and ecological consequences of shipping activities therefore several robotic solutions were developed to mitigate fouling problem and to robotize hull cleaning process however the existing solutions are either slow remotely operated vehicles or fast but non transportable cleaning station equipped with manipulator s arms in this paper we aim to combine the transportability of the remotely operated vehicle solution and the cleaning efficiency offered by the use of arm manipulators hence we present an innovative design of an underwater ship hull cleaning robot called armrov by attaching two manipulator arms to a remotely operated vehicle however in this new design the robot central part is subject to dynamic stability issues during the cleaning operation that are caused by coupling forces between arms and the central part in order to evaluate perturbations on the center part of the armrov the kinematic and the dynamic model of the manipulator s arms were developed performed using khalil kleifinger and newton euler methods respectively the dynamic stability during the hull cleaning operation was studied and checked using dynamic equivalence approach simulations results proved the efficiency of the stability approach and the feasibility of the proposed solution in conclusion the suggested design represents a promising stable and efficient solution for hull underwater cleaning keywords remotely operated vehicle manipulator arms dynamics robot simulation modeling 1 introduction fouling is the fixing and development of unwanted material on artificial surfaces immersed in seawater the fouling materials can be either living substances such as aquatic organisms algae and animals which are commonly referred to as biofouling or non living substances which are either organic or inorganic this process is causing many problems for human activities related to the marine environment both economically and ecologically schultz et al 2011 this problem has severe economic effects on ships activities indeed the increase of biofouling thickness makes the surface rough and harsh and thus amplifies friction forces during the ship s movement in the water besides biofouling represents an overload that results in an increase in fuel consumption furthermore this phenomenon leads to the acceleration of metallic corrosion and the reduction of the time interval between consecutive dry docking operations thus the ship experiences long periods of unavailability in addition to extra expenses generated by additional dry docking operations of the vessels bohlander and zea land 2009 the main process of fighting hull fouling consists of regular cleanings of submerged surfaces in a dry dock in addition to the application of a toxic paint known as antifouling however this solution remains insufficient since a one centimeter thick layer of fouling can cover a hull in just a month nurioglu et al 2015 hence the research is oriented towards the regular underwater cleaning of the hull without the need for dry docking initially the underwater cleaning operation is performed manually however given its difficulty this operation became more and more automated and robotized several research studies and applications were developed in this framework in 2009 a european funded research project directed by newcastle university united kingdom developed a robot called hismar european researchers and engineers have worked on an automated robotic cleaning system that removes marine growth from the ship s hull this robot possesses 3 degrees of freedom dof which allows the sweeping of the surface of the ship s hull that would be cleaned the hismar robot uses one of the following cleaning techniques brushing or high pressure cleaning the robot uses a magnetic force to stick to the hull surface hence the use of this solution is restricted to ships with iron based structure narewski 2009 in 2012 kyushu institute of technology developed a submarine robot dedicated to the cleaning of ship hulls during the cleaning operation the robot moves alongside the hull using thrusters that are also used to fix the robot structure to the hull this suggested robot uses a brushing technique for cleaning nassiraei et al 2012 in 2015 the office of naval research onr which is an organization within the united states navy that coordinates executes and promotes the science and technology programs of the u s navy and marine corps developed hull bio mimetic underwater grooming bug the robot is dedicated to the cleaning of ship hulls hull bug uses negative pressure to get attached to the hull and has four wheels to move on the hull surface this robot is powered by a battery another new feature of hull bug is its capability to avoid obstacles using onboard sensors borchardt 2010 in 2016 the malaysian technical university developed an underwater cleaning robot ucr that uses propellers to stick to the surface to be cleaned the robot moves along the surface using thrusters however the designed robot used a sucking method technique for fouling removal singh et al 2015 in addition to the portable robot solutions previously cited fixed cleaning stations are also suggested for hull underwater cleaning the family of cleaners with fixed cleaning stations was presented by g mazue et al 2011 their research focused on an automated self service ultrasonic cleaning station for boat hulls the cleaning station used manipulating arms equipped with ultrasonic transducers equally important and in addition to these robots and cleaning systems there are many other elaborated robotic systems for ship hull underwater cleaning for instance we can site hullwiper gulf agency company environhull dubai 2013 magnetic hull crawler cybernetix 2005 underwater robot lee et al 2012 daewon n d keelcrab sail one najdenov n d hidalgo n d m6 sub sea cleaning tool vertidrive n d and roving bat rover for hull inspection and cleaning eca group n d greensea robotic hull cleaner curran et al 2016 this work combines the concept of underwater cleaning robot using propellers for locomotion and the concept of cleaning manipulator arms equipped with pressurized water nozzles this paper is organized as follows a general introduction is given in the first section the second section material and methods present a new design approach for the proposed ship hull underwater cleaning robot called armrov the kinematic and dynamic modeling of the armrov and the stability of the center body of armrov section three was dedicated to highlighting the simulation of the dynamic behavior of the arms manipulators and the stability of the center body of armrov this paper is concluded by discussing the main results of the study and presenting future work 2 material and methods 2 1 design methodology this section is dedicated to present the design methodology of armrov robot the conceptual approach used in this work for the robot design is based on the standardized method afnor x50 150 which is applicable in the design or redesign of a product a service or an activity in order to structure the conceptual approach and to frame it the work to be carried out should be oriented according to the technical specifications hence the following points emerge firstly the main aim of the action and the causes of its triggering the action in this study consists of the design and the realization of an underwater robot allowing the cleaning of the hulls of the vessel afloat in this context several methods of hull cleaning of ships afloat have been proposed in the specialized literature the suggested methods are generally based on submersible mechanical systems ensuring the cleaning of hulls afloat such systems can be classified into two main families transportable robots or fixed stations as presented in the first section however each family has its own drawbacks for instance 1 transportable robots moving on the surface of the hull are quite slow nassiraei et al 2012 2 stations using manipulators arms mounted to the quay are immobile mazue et al 2011 the goal of this study is to create a new design of an automated mobile cleaning system that is equipped with two arms to remedy the cleaning speed issue while keeping mobility feature secondly the problem s data armrov is a remotely operated vehicle type which is powered and controlled from the ship or the quay armrov has two manipulating arms cleaning simultaneously the port and starboard sides of the ship s hull those arms offer better cleaning performance and a possibility to reach in addition to clean of hull appendages with various shapes like propellers shafts and stabilizers see fig 1 the armrov robot should be positioned just under the keel in the center of the area to be cleaned as shown in fig 2 hence it is intended that the robot cleans the hull zone by zone the dimensions of the zones to be cleaned are mainly determined by the workspace of the manipulating arms every arm is equipped with a cleaning pistol that uses pressurized water to eliminate fouling in fact the armrov robot has six thrusters four of them are intended to assure the vertical movement of the robot while the two others assure its horizontal movement a description of the body structure is shown in fig 3 furthermore thrust forces generated by these thrusters guarantee the adhesion to the zone to be cleaned gianluca antonelli 2006 paper et al 2016 initially the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy are considered at the same position as shown in fig 4 a this initial position is located at the heave axis of the armrov during cleaning and in the purpose of improving the attachment of the armrov robot to the hull an inflatable lift bag is added in the center part of the structure as shown in yellow in fig 4 b thereafter the center of buoyancy changes above the center of gravity such that it ensures static stability and prevents the generation of the overturning moment thirdly system constraints the requirement for dynamic stability of the robot central part during armrov cleaning operation must be assured 2 2 kinematic structure of the robot during the cleaning operation the center part is considered fixed to the keel using synergy between the lift bag and thrusters hence the kinematic study of the armrov s structure will be limited to the study of the manipulator s arms kinematic the manipulating arms are composed of arms forearms and manipulating hands hereby the different articulations between these bodies will be detailed these articulations which enable the manipulating arm to ensure the desired service functions are inspired by the biomechanical study of a human arm for this purpose three pivotal articulations will be sufficient to attain any point of the hull a pivotal articulation between the manipulating hand and the forearm a second pivot articulation between the forearm and the upper arm and a third articulation between the upper arm and the main body of the robot at the initial state the whole manipulating arm is considered folded in order to expand it when switching to the cleaning state a pivot articulation along the y0 axis will be added between the arm and the main body of armrov finally a prismatic connection is added between the arm and alongside the center part of the armrov to change the cleaning plan while keeping the center part fixed to the keel the kinematic structure of the system is shown in fig 5 with b standing for the body t standing for the thruster r standing for the right and l standing for the left b5r is the right end effector part of the robot that injects water under pressure to eliminate fouling b4r b3r and b2r are respectively the robot s right hand forearm and arm b1 is the trunk that links the two arms b0 is the central body of the robot here referred to as center part b5r b4r b3r and b2r have consecutively a joint pivot connection between every two of them b1 has a joint pivot following the y0 axis with b2r by symmetry the left arm has the same structure and joint connections as the right arm both arms are connected to body b1 that is itself connected to the center part b0 of the robot with a prismatic joint thereby the robot has in total one prismatic joint and eight revolute joints p8r t1 t2 t3 and t4 are vertical thrusters t5 and t6 are horizontal thrusters besides a lift bag is added to take advantage of its buoyancy force and to minimize the energy of the vertical thrusters when cleaning a particular zone the armrov is attached to the keel and both arms follow the desired paths in each zone the movements of the arms are symmetric and repetitive the movements of the arms as well as the recoil forces generated by the cleaning pressure create disturbances on the central part of the armrov assumed fixed 2 3 modeling of the two manipulator arms hereby the study of the dynamic behavior of the manipulator arms of the armrov robot during cleaning will be carried out for that purpose this section is divided into two parts kinematic modeling and dynamic modeling 2 3 1 kinematic modeling of the two manipulator arms since the chain of the armrov has a tree structure the notation invented by denevit hertenberg and modified by khalil and kleifinger khalil and kleinfinger 1986 should be used besides the studied system is composed of 11 bodies 9 joints and 2 end effectors the bodies the joints the parameters and

cleaning operation was studied an approach based on the concept of dynamic equivalence will be developed in this study it requires the real time determination of thruster forces needed to maintain the stability of the robot 2 4 1 a dynamic equivalence approach the armrov is initially stable fixed to the keel of the ship fixation is ensured by the synergy between the thrusters and the lift bag fig 7 a the movements of the two arms and the recoiled forces generated by the cleaning pressure apply three dimensional perturbations to the central part which becomes in a disequilibrium state fig 7 b to ensure the stability of the disturbed armrov the dynamic equivalence approach gravez and ouezdou 2016 is adopted it consists in determining the required efforts created by the thrusters in order to maintain a dynamic stability in this case the stability is assured when the following components of forces and moments applied on the center of gravity of the armrov s base fx fz mx my and mz are equal to zero and fy is the force of interaction with the hull fig 7 illustrates the dynamic coupling that arises from the transmission of forces and moments between the manipulators and the center part in both stable and disequilibrium state in this figure p and fr represent respectively the pressure of the water jet and the resulting recoil forces the dynamic equivalence consists in maintaining the forces and moments in o 0 the center of gravity of the perturbed system equals to the forces and moments determined in o0 the center of gravity of the stable system in order to apply the dynamic equivalence approach this study suggests the use of newton euler s formalism to determine dynamic equations of the armrov s central part the determined dynamic equations permit to evaluate instantly the thrust forces required to ensure the stability of the armrov 2 4 2 dynamic modeling of the center part using newton euler technique the dynamic equations based on the newton euler formalism are calculated at point o0 of the body b0 the central part of the armrov the mathematical expressions of the dynamic equations are given in the system of equation 8 where f0 and m0 are

determined by solving the equation 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of the dynamic behavior of the two manipulator arms the dynamic behavior of the manipulator arms modeled in the previous section should be simulated in order to validate the model and to analyze disturbances exerted on the center part by the movement of manipulator s arms during the cleaning process the dynamic behavior of the manipulator s arms is simulated using simmechanics this simulation tool is based on a graphical environment using blocks it considers bodies as a rigid structure with perfect bonds the computer aided design cad developed with solidworks is shown in the fig 9 moreover in the table included in appendix b we detailed the major technical and operational parameters of the proposed armrov robot in addition to other underwater hull cleaning robots that were either elaborated or still under development curran et al 2016 the main characteristics of the robot are cited in table 2 the proposed system is dimensioned to clean military ships with v shape hull patrol boat and fast attack craft the robot could be operated to clean ships with maximum waterline beam bwl up to 6 m the prototype was later imported to simmechanics the frame on each body and the geometric parameters were identified according to the khalil kleifinger techniques liebgott 2016 during the dynamic simulation of the armrov the size and the weight of the motors are taken into account the effective buoyancy drag and lift forces on each body were modeled on the center of gravity of each body the numerical values of physical parameters such as moments of inertia hydrodynamic coefficients etc used in this simulation are presented in appendix a besides it is worthy to mention that the density of seawater considered is ρ 1023 39 kg m 3 then the proper movement of each link and the efforts exerted by the back movement of the wash pistol were defined finally a force sensor was added at the center part in order to measure the disturbances forces and moments exerted by the manipulator s arms on its center of gravity o0 during cleaning operation shown in fig 10 during simulation the armrov is considered attached to the ship s keel at the beginning of the cleaning process the movement of the arms from the initial standby position to the desired cleaning position is simulated in fig 11 there are side and front views of the armrov attached to the ship that illustrate arms movements the cleaning operation starts as soon as the arms reach the top point fig 12 shows the different movements of the arms during the cleaning process the lines represent the path of the end effector on the surface to be cleaned the proposed cleaning technology is based on a pressurized water jet a water jet s effectiveness depends on the pressure of water p the jetting angle α and the distance from the surface to be cleaned b these parameters will be adjusted depending on the thickness of the fouling in order to improve cleaning efficiency and to optimize the cleaning time in this context an experimental study consisting of cleaning several test plates is carried out these plates are coated with layers of fouling of different thicknesses the cleaning of these plates allows creating a database of cleaning parameters fig 13 shows two photos of a sample metallic plate with a 5 mm thick layer of fouling before a and after b the cleaning with pressurized water the cleaning parameters chosen during experimentation are presented in table 3 the forces of inertia and gravity generated by the arms movement and the back forces caused by water jet create disturbing forces and moments at the center of gravity o0 of the central part b0 fig 14 presents the variation of forces and moments in the center of gravity o0 according to the three axes x y and z during the cleaning operation fig 14 illustrates respectively the variation of the forces and moments exerted by manipulator s arms on the center gravity of the center part b0 along the x y and z axis during cleaning operation without any compensation the forces and moments components have a common two phase variation characteristic during the first ten seconds the movements of the two arms from their initial standby state to the cleaning position unfolding operation without water jet are reflected in forces and moments components curve by a single peak variation along each of the three axes with various amplitudes starting from the tenth second the forces and moments obtained from the cleaning operations are quasi sinusoidal along the three axes except for fy component which has a positive quasi stationary curve 3 2 simulation of the stability study in order to evaluate the efficiency of the dynamic equivalence approach in the system stability a system simulation was conducted on the simmechanics platform the model of the armrov combines the model of the center part and the model of the manipulator s arms the movement articulators of arms are considered the input of the model in fact those movement articulators represent the joint variables needed to manipulate the arms and execute the cleaning operation joint variables are also transferred to a simulink based model in order to compute the force required from each thruster to compensate the disturbing forces and to ensure system stability the simulation process is depicted in fig 15 as represented the simulation model is divided into two parts the simmechanics model of the armrov and the simulink model after running the simulation for a hundred seconds the instantaneous force magnitude required from each of the six thrusters to ensure mechanical center part stability are presented in fig 16 the study of stabilizing forces magnitudes is necessary for the sizing and the technical description of the adequate thrusters that should be selected for experimental validation and armrov manufacture the forces magnitudes for all thrusters have an important peak in the first ten seconds of the simulation and thus reflects the importance of the forces needed to compensate the significant perturbation caused by the unfolding of the manipulator s arms during cleaning operation that starts just after totally unfolding the armrov arms the required stabilizing forces are quasi sinusoidal with different magnitudes it is worth to mention that the forces of the horizontal thrusters thrusters 5 and 6 have more fluctuating and rough variation compared to the forces required from the vertical thrusters in order to check the stability of the center part after the application of stabilizing forces by each thruster the forces and moments in the center part s center of gravity were calculated the center part is considered mechanically stable if the following forces and moments components fx fz mx my and mz equal to zero and the fy component positive as illustrated in fig 17 these stability criteria were satisfied hence the stability of the center part is ensured and the efficiency of the dynamic equivalence approach was justified as previously discussed the attachment of the center part to the hull is ensured by the synergy between the lift bag and thrusters the contribution of the thrusters in this task is clearly illustrated by the positivity of the y axis component of the force exerted on the center part 4 conclusion and future work in conclusion a new design of ship hull underwater cleaning robot called armrov is developed compared to other robots and stations this robot is transportable faster and more efficient by using two manipulator arms however the major impediment of this proposed solution manifests in the perturbations on the center part of the robot caused by the movement of arms during the cleaning operation this issue was investigated by performing the kinematic and dynamic modeling of the two manipulator arms to alleviate the perturbation issue and to ensure the stability of the center part the dynamic equivalence technique was applied this approach assures its effectiveness in the studied system given that we are dealing with a new design there are some improvements that could be made to it which are detailed below initially the design was sized to allow the cleaning of patrol boats and fast attack crafts with maximum beam water line of six meters in a next stage we are interested to make a new design able to operate on larger vessels and to perform perfect cleaning of hull appendages propellers shafts and stabilizers besides in the new design all these cleaning operations should be conducted while ensuring robot stability secondly with the aim to improve robot stability larger disturbances along the sway axis could be compensated by adding two more thrusters one on each side of the robot moreover a controlled study will be conducted to maintain dynamic stability of the armrov when subjected to acting external forces at the third step a study of the umbilical is highly recommended during the next stage of our work a further development of this work will address the realization of a scaled prototype to check the computational part of the project in this system design the cleaning technology adopted is based on pressurized water jet however this technology could be improved in future studies by using a new water jet cavitation technology that is safer more efficient less expensive and with less draw back forces kalumuck et al 1997 moreover it will be important to exploit this novel system in regular cleaning of military ships or any medium size ship in order to improve their navigation speed and to reduce fuel consumption acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the ministry of defense and the naval academy of tunisia for its support appendix

22843,the fouling is a major problem that occurs to the ship s hull this phenomenon causes severe economic and ecological consequences of shipping activities therefore several robotic solutions were developed to mitigate fouling problem and to robotize hull cleaning process however the existing solutions are either slow remotely operated vehicles or fast but non transportable cleaning station equipped with manipulator s arms in this paper we aim to combine the transportability of the remotely operated vehicle solution and the cleaning efficiency offered by the use of arm manipulators hence we present an innovative design of an underwater ship hull cleaning robot called armrov by attaching two manipulator arms to a remotely operated vehicle however in this new design the robot central part is subject to dynamic stability issues during the cleaning operation that are caused by coupling forces between arms and the central part in order to evaluate perturbations on the center part of the armrov the kinematic and the dynamic model of the manipulator s arms were developed performed using khalil kleifinger and newton euler methods respectively the dynamic stability during the hull cleaning operation was studied and checked using dynamic equivalence approach simulations results proved the efficiency of the stability approach and the feasibility of the proposed solution in conclusion the suggested design represents a promising stable and efficient solution for hull underwater cleaning keywords remotely operated vehicle manipulator arms dynamics robot simulation modeling 1 introduction fouling is the fixing and development of unwanted material on artificial surfaces immersed in seawater the fouling materials can be either living substances such as aquatic organisms algae and animals which are commonly referred to as biofouling or non living substances which are either organic or inorganic this process is causing many problems for human activities related to the marine environment both economically and ecologically schultz et al 2011 this problem has severe economic effects on ships activities indeed the increase of biofouling thickness makes the surface rough and harsh and thus amplifies friction forces during the ship s movement in the water besides biofouling represents an overload that results in an increase in fuel consumption furthermore this phenomenon leads to the acceleration of metallic corrosion and the reduction of the time interval between consecutive dry docking operations thus the ship experiences long periods of unavailability in addition to extra expenses generated by additional dry docking operations of the vessels bohlander and zea land 2009 the main process of fighting hull fouling consists of regular cleanings of submerged surfaces in a dry dock in addition to the application of a toxic paint known as antifouling however this solution remains insufficient since a one centimeter thick layer of fouling can cover a hull in just a month nurioglu et al 2015 hence the research is oriented towards the regular underwater cleaning of the hull without the need for dry docking initially the underwater cleaning operation is performed manually however given its difficulty this operation became more and more automated and robotized several research studies and applications were developed in this framework in 2009 a european funded research project directed by newcastle university united kingdom developed a robot called hismar european researchers and engineers have worked on an automated robotic cleaning system that removes marine growth from the ship s hull this robot possesses 3 degrees of freedom dof which allows the sweeping of the surface of the ship s hull that would be cleaned the hismar robot uses one of the following cleaning techniques brushing or high pressure cleaning the robot uses a magnetic force to stick to the hull surface hence the use of this solution is restricted to ships with iron based structure narewski 2009 in 2012 kyushu institute of technology developed a submarine robot dedicated to the cleaning of ship hulls during the cleaning operation the robot moves alongside the hull using thrusters that are also used to fix the robot structure to the hull this suggested robot uses a brushing technique for cleaning nassiraei et al 2012 in 2015 the office of naval research onr which is an organization within the united states navy that coordinates executes and promotes the science and technology programs of the u s navy and marine corps developed hull bio mimetic underwater grooming bug the robot is dedicated to the cleaning of ship hulls hull bug uses negative pressure to get attached to the hull and has four wheels to move on the hull surface this robot is powered by a battery another new feature of hull bug is its capability to avoid obstacles using onboard sensors borchardt 2010 in 2016 the malaysian technical university developed an underwater cleaning robot ucr that uses propellers to stick to the surface to be cleaned the robot moves along the surface using thrusters however the designed robot used a sucking method technique for fouling removal singh et al 2015 in addition to the portable robot solutions previously cited fixed cleaning stations are also suggested for hull underwater cleaning the family of cleaners with fixed cleaning stations was presented by g mazue et al 2011 their research focused on an automated self service ultrasonic cleaning station for boat hulls the cleaning station used manipulating arms equipped with ultrasonic transducers equally important and in addition to these robots and cleaning systems there are many other elaborated robotic systems for ship hull underwater cleaning for instance we can site hullwiper gulf agency company environhull dubai 2013 magnetic hull crawler cybernetix 2005 underwater robot lee et al 2012 daewon n d keelcrab sail one najdenov n d hidalgo n d m6 sub sea cleaning tool vertidrive n d and roving bat rover for hull inspection and cleaning eca group n d greensea robotic hull cleaner curran et al 2016 this work combines the concept of underwater cleaning robot using propellers for locomotion and the concept of cleaning manipulator arms equipped with pressurized water nozzles this paper is organized as follows a general introduction is given in the first section the second section material and methods present a new design approach for the proposed ship hull underwater cleaning robot called armrov the kinematic and dynamic modeling of the armrov and the stability of the center body of armrov section three was dedicated to highlighting the simulation of the dynamic behavior of the arms manipulators and the stability of the center body of armrov this paper is concluded by discussing the main results of the study and presenting future work 2 material and methods 2 1 design methodology this section is dedicated to present the design methodology of armrov robot the conceptual approach used in this work for the robot design is based on the standardized method afnor x50 150 which is applicable in the design or redesign of a product a service or an activity in order to structure the conceptual approach and to frame it the work to be carried out should be oriented according to the technical specifications hence the following points emerge firstly the main aim of the action and the causes of its triggering the action in this study consists of the design and the realization of an underwater robot allowing the cleaning of the hulls of the vessel afloat in this context several methods of hull cleaning of ships afloat have been proposed in the specialized literature the suggested methods are generally based on submersible mechanical systems ensuring the cleaning of hulls afloat such systems can be classified into two main families transportable robots or fixed stations as presented in the first section however each family has its own drawbacks for instance 1 transportable robots moving on the surface of the hull are quite slow nassiraei et al 2012 2 stations using manipulators arms mounted to the quay are immobile mazue et al 2011 the goal of this study is to create a new design of an automated mobile cleaning system that is equipped with two arms to remedy the cleaning speed issue while keeping mobility feature secondly the problem s data armrov is a remotely operated vehicle type which is powered and controlled from the ship or the quay armrov has two manipulating arms cleaning simultaneously the port and starboard sides of the ship s hull those arms offer better cleaning performance and a possibility to reach in addition to clean of hull appendages with various shapes like propellers shafts and stabilizers see fig 1 the armrov robot should be positioned just under the keel in the center of the area to be cleaned as shown in fig 2 hence it is intended that the robot cleans the hull zone by zone the dimensions of the zones to be cleaned are mainly determined by the workspace of the manipulating arms every arm is equipped with a cleaning pistol that uses pressurized water to eliminate fouling in fact the armrov robot has six thrusters four of them are intended to assure the vertical movement of the robot while the two others assure its horizontal movement a description of the body structure is shown in fig 3 furthermore thrust forces generated by these thrusters guarantee the adhesion to the zone to be cleaned gianluca antonelli 2006 paper et al 2016 initially the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy are considered at the same position as shown in fig 4 a this initial position is located at the heave axis of the armrov during cleaning and in the purpose of improving the attachment of the armrov robot to the hull an inflatable lift bag is added in the center part of the structure as shown in yellow in fig 4 b thereafter the center of buoyancy changes above the center of gravity such that it ensures static stability and prevents the generation of the overturning moment thirdly system constraints the requirement for dynamic stability of the robot central part during armrov cleaning operation must be assured 2 2 kinematic structure of the robot during the cleaning operation the center part is considered fixed to the keel using synergy between the lift bag and thrusters hence the kinematic study of the armrov s structure will be limited to the study of the manipulator s arms kinematic the manipulating arms are composed of arms forearms and manipulating hands hereby the different articulations between these bodies will be detailed these articulations which enable the manipulating arm to ensure the desired service functions are inspired by the biomechanical study of a human arm for this purpose three pivotal articulations will be sufficient to attain any point of the hull a pivotal articulation between the manipulating hand and the forearm a second pivot articulation between the forearm and the upper arm and a third articulation between the upper arm and the main body of the robot at the initial state the whole manipulating arm is considered folded in order to expand it when switching to the cleaning state a pivot articulation along the y0 axis will be added between the arm and the main body of armrov finally a prismatic connection is added between the arm and alongside the center part of the armrov to change the cleaning plan while keeping the center part fixed to the keel the kinematic structure of the system is shown in fig 5 with b standing for the body t standing for the thruster r standing for the right and l standing for the left b5r is the right end effector part of the robot that injects water under pressure to eliminate fouling b4r b3r and b2r are respectively the robot s right hand forearm and arm b1 is the trunk that links the two arms b0 is the central body of the robot here referred to as center part b5r b4r b3r and b2r have consecutively a joint pivot connection between every two of them b1 has a joint pivot following the y0 axis with b2r by symmetry the left arm has the same structure and joint connections as the right arm both arms are connected to body b1 that is itself connected to the center part b0 of the robot with a prismatic joint thereby the robot has in total one prismatic joint and eight revolute joints p8r t1 t2 t3 and t4 are vertical thrusters t5 and t6 are horizontal thrusters besides a lift bag is added to take advantage of its buoyancy force and to minimize the energy of the vertical thrusters when cleaning a particular zone the armrov is attached to the keel and both arms follow the desired paths in each zone the movements of the arms are symmetric and repetitive the movements of the arms as well as the recoil forces generated by the cleaning pressure create disturbances on the central part of the armrov assumed fixed 2 3 modeling of the two manipulator arms hereby the study of the dynamic behavior of the manipulator arms of the armrov robot during cleaning will be carried out for that purpose this section is divided into two parts kinematic modeling and dynamic modeling 2 3 1 kinematic modeling of the two manipulator arms since the chain of the armrov has a tree structure the notation invented by denevit hertenberg and modified by khalil and kleifinger khalil and kleinfinger 1986 should be used besides the studied system is composed of 11 bodies 9 joints and 2 end effectors the bodies the joints the parameters and the frames are presented in fig 6 by applying khalil kleifinger s technique we get the following armrov s parameters table 1 2 3 2 dynamic modeling of the two manipulator arms using newton euler

cleaning operation was studied an approach based on the concept of dynamic equivalence will be developed in this study it requires the real time determination of thruster forces needed to maintain the stability of the robot 2 4 1 a dynamic equivalence approach the armrov is initially stable fixed to the keel of the ship fixation is ensured by the synergy between the thrusters and the lift bag fig 7 a the movements of the two arms and the recoiled forces generated by the cleaning pressure apply three dimensional perturbations to the central part which becomes in a disequilibrium state fig 7 b to ensure the stability of the disturbed armrov the dynamic equivalence approach gravez and ouezdou 2016 is adopted it consists in determining the required efforts created by the thrusters in order to maintain a dynamic stability in this case the stability is assured when the following components of forces and moments applied on the center of gravity of the armrov s base fx fz mx my and mz are equal to zero and fy is the force of interaction with the hull fig 7 illustrates the dynamic coupling that arises from the transmission of forces and moments between the manipulators and the center part in both stable and disequilibrium state in this figure p and fr represent respectively the pressure of the water jet and the resulting recoil forces the dynamic equivalence consists in maintaining the forces and moments in o 0 the center of gravity of the perturbed system equals to the forces and moments determined in o0 the center of gravity of the stable system in order to apply the dynamic equivalence approach this study suggests the use of newton euler s formalism to determine dynamic equations of the armrov s central part the determined dynamic equations permit to evaluate instantly the thrust forces required to ensure the stability of the armrov 2 4 2 dynamic modeling of the center part using newton euler technique the dynamic equations based on the newton euler formalism are calculated at point o0 of the body b0 the central part of the armrov the mathematical expressions of the dynamic equations are given in the system of equation 8 where f0 and m0 are

determined by solving the equation 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of the dynamic behavior of the two manipulator arms the dynamic behavior of the manipulator arms modeled in the previous section should be simulated in order to validate the model and to analyze disturbances exerted on the center part by the movement of manipulator s arms during the cleaning process the dynamic behavior of the manipulator s arms is simulated using simmechanics this simulation tool is based on a graphical environment using blocks it considers bodies as a rigid structure with perfect bonds the computer aided design cad developed with solidworks is shown in the fig 9 moreover in the table included in appendix b we detailed the major technical and operational parameters of the proposed armrov robot in addition to other underwater hull cleaning robots that were either elaborated or still under development curran et al 2016 the main characteristics of the robot are cited in table 2 the proposed system is dimensioned to clean military ships with v shape hull patrol boat and fast attack craft the robot could be operated to clean ships with maximum waterline beam bwl up to 6 m the prototype was later imported to simmechanics the frame on each body and the geometric parameters were identified according to the khalil kleifinger techniques liebgott 2016 during the dynamic simulation of the armrov the size and the weight of the motors are taken into account the effective buoyancy drag and lift forces on each body were modeled on the center of gravity of each body the numerical values of physical parameters such as moments of inertia hydrodynamic coefficients etc used in this simulation are presented in appendix a besides it is worthy to mention that the density of seawater considered is ρ 1023 39 kg m 3 then the proper movement of each link and the efforts exerted by the back movement of the wash pistol were defined finally a force sensor was added at the center part in order to measure the disturbances forces and moments exerted by the manipulator s arms on its center of gravity o0 during cleaning operation shown in fig 10 during simulation the armrov is considered attached to the ship s keel at the beginning of the cleaning process the movement of the arms from the initial standby position to the desired cleaning position is simulated in fig 11 there are side and front views of the armrov attached to the ship that illustrate arms movements the cleaning operation starts as soon as the arms reach the top point fig 12 shows the different movements of the arms during the cleaning process the lines represent the path of the end effector on the surface to be cleaned the proposed cleaning technology is based on a pressurized water jet a water jet s effectiveness depends on the pressure of water p the jetting angle α and the distance from the surface to be cleaned b these parameters will be adjusted depending on the thickness of the fouling in order to improve cleaning efficiency and to optimize the cleaning time in this context an experimental study consisting of cleaning several test plates is carried out these plates are coated with layers of fouling of different thicknesses the cleaning of these plates allows creating a database of cleaning parameters fig 13 shows two photos of a sample metallic plate with a 5 mm thick layer of fouling before a and after b the cleaning with pressurized water the cleaning parameters chosen during experimentation are presented in table 3 the forces of inertia and gravity generated by the arms movement and the back forces caused by water jet create disturbing forces and moments at the center of gravity o0 of the central part b0 fig 14 presents the variation of forces and moments in the center of gravity o0 according to the three axes x y and z during the cleaning operation fig 14 illustrates respectively the variation of the forces and moments exerted by manipulator s arms on the center gravity of the center part b0 along the x y and z axis during cleaning operation without any compensation the forces and moments components have a common two phase variation characteristic during the first ten seconds the movements of the two arms from their initial standby state to the cleaning position unfolding operation without water jet are reflected in forces and moments components curve by a single peak variation along each of the three axes with various amplitudes starting from the tenth second the forces and moments obtained from the cleaning operations are quasi sinusoidal along the three axes except for fy component which has a positive quasi stationary curve 3 2 simulation of the stability study in order to evaluate the efficiency of the dynamic equivalence approach in the system stability a system simulation was conducted on the simmechanics platform the model of the armrov combines the model of the center part and the model of the manipulator s arms the movement articulators of arms are considered the input of the model in fact those movement articulators represent the joint variables needed to manipulate the arms and execute the cleaning operation joint variables are also transferred to a simulink based model in order to compute the force required from each thruster to compensate the disturbing forces and to ensure system stability the simulation process is depicted in fig 15 as represented the simulation model is divided into two parts the simmechanics model of the armrov and the simulink model after running the simulation for a hundred seconds the instantaneous force magnitude required from each of the six thrusters to ensure mechanical center part stability are presented in fig 16 the study of stabilizing forces magnitudes is necessary for the sizing and the technical description of the adequate thrusters that should be selected for experimental validation and armrov manufacture the forces magnitudes for all thrusters have an important peak in the first ten seconds of the simulation and thus reflects the importance of the forces needed to compensate the significant perturbation caused by the unfolding of the manipulator s arms during cleaning operation that starts just after totally unfolding the armrov arms the required stabilizing forces are quasi sinusoidal with different magnitudes it is worth to mention that the forces of the horizontal thrusters thrusters 5 and 6 have more fluctuating and rough variation compared to the forces required from the vertical thrusters in order to check the stability of the center part after the application of stabilizing forces by each thruster the forces and moments in the center part s center of gravity were calculated the center part is considered mechanically stable if the following forces and moments components fx fz mx my and mz equal to zero and the fy component positive as illustrated in fig 17 these stability criteria were satisfied hence the stability of the center part is ensured and the efficiency of the dynamic equivalence approach was justified as previously discussed the attachment of the center part to the hull is ensured by the synergy between the lift bag and thrusters the contribution of the thrusters in this task is clearly illustrated by the positivity of the y axis component of the force exerted on the center part 4 conclusion and future work in conclusion a new design of ship hull underwater cleaning robot called armrov is developed compared to other robots and stations this robot is transportable faster and more efficient by using two manipulator arms however the major impediment of this proposed solution manifests in the perturbations on the center part of the robot caused by the movement of arms during the cleaning operation this issue was investigated by performing the kinematic and dynamic modeling of the two manipulator arms to alleviate the perturbation issue and to ensure the stability of the center part the dynamic equivalence technique was applied this approach assures its effectiveness in the studied system given that we are dealing with a new design there are some improvements that could be made to it which are detailed below initially the design was sized to allow the cleaning of patrol boats and fast attack crafts with maximum beam water line of six meters in a next stage we are interested to make a new design able to operate on larger vessels and to perform perfect cleaning of hull appendages propellers shafts and stabilizers besides in the new design all these cleaning operations should be conducted while ensuring robot stability secondly with the aim to improve robot stability larger disturbances along the sway axis could be compensated by adding two more thrusters one on each side of the robot moreover a controlled study will be conducted to maintain dynamic stability of the armrov when subjected to acting external forces at the third step a study of the umbilical is highly recommended during the next stage of our work a further development of this work will address the realization of a scaled prototype to check the computational part of the project in this system design the cleaning technology adopted is based on pressurized water jet however this technology could be improved in future studies by using a new water jet cavitation technology that is safer more efficient less expensive and with less draw back forces kalumuck et al 1997 moreover it will be important to exploit this novel system in regular cleaning of military ships or any medium size ship in order to improve their navigation speed and to reduce fuel consumption acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the ministry of defense and the naval academy of tunisia for its support appendix

22844,the autonomous underwater vehicle auv will suffer severe impact load during the water entry and its shell structure will undergo elastoplastic deformation even breakage or damage which seriously threatens the safety and reliability of the auv therefore it is necessary to carry out research on the buffering technology of the impact load of the vehicle into the water to ensure that the auv can enter the water safely and reliably in this paper a mitigator is designed to reduce the impact load of the auv entering the water numerical simulations based on the explicit finite element method with an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale solver are carried out to study the mitigation characteristic of the designed mitigator the accuracy of the model was verified by the experimental results of the water entry of the small sphere and the mesh independence was verified to determine the mesh size then the effects of initial conditions such as buffer length buffer material density entry velocity and entry angle on the cushioning effect of the buffer head cap were studied when the vertical water entry velocity is 50 m s the impact load reduction ratio is 42 2 while the water entry angle is 60 and the water entry velocity is 50 m s the axial load reduction ratio is 28 8 and the normal load reduction ratio is 27 8 these conclusions will be useful for the designing of the crashworthy structural and the analysis of underwater weapon impact keywords water entry impact mitigation cushioning properties numerical modeling 1 introduction common underwater vehicles can be launched by submarines and surface ships or by new launch methods such as fixed wing aircraft helicopters and rocket assisted aircraft the vehicle will suffer severe impact load during the water entry usually in milliseconds under which the vehicle will produce dynamic response of the structure causing elastoplastic deformation of the shell structure and even damage and buckling moreover the impact load may change the trajectory of the vehicle which will result in whipping diving and ballistic runaway and other issues xu et al 1992 therefore effectively reducing the impact load to ensure the safe and reliable entry water of the vehicle is essential many scholars have done a lot of research on the load shedding effect of the buffer head cap the earliest buffer caps were integrally cast from foam and the cushioning material was crushed and decomposed during the inflow howard 1959 after a period of development its structure was improved into a composite structure consisting of an outer fairing shell and an internal foam material robert et al 2010 when the aircraft moves in the air the shell can provide a good aerodynamic shape which can be broken during water entry and the foam material can reduce the impact load according to the published works the mk46 torpedo in the united states installed a mk7 2 and mk8 1 head caps in the warhead to protect the torpedo under the water entry impact with velocity 50 m s the deep war warhead is equipped with the mk26 1 solid core cap and its weighs are 6 59 kg and can withstand the impact load during water entry at 260 m s yang et al 2001 xuan 1999 jianmingsong and yan 1999 conducted an experimental study on the disintegration of the head cap in the process of entering the water the research confirmed the rationality of design the buffer shell with composite materials and explained the rupture mechanism of the head cap confirming that the buffer head cap can reduce the water impact load lei et al 2011 studied the reliability of head cap separation and proposed related technical measures in combination with cushion head cap material shell wall thickness and ribs and proved the reliability of the measure by finite element analysis because the water entry problem is complicated it is difficult to solve this problem through theoretical analysis numerical simulation and experiment have become the main means to study the water entry problem especially for the cushioning problem hirt et al 1974 proposed the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method to solve the fluid solid coupling problem with large deformation and moving boundary this method has been widely used in the study of water entry problems and has been integrated into well known dynamic finite element software such as dytran and ls dyna mohammad saeed derakhshanian saeed derakhshanian et al 2018 2018 carried out a serial numerical simulation of water entry problems based on the finite volume method fvm finite difference method fdm and arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method ale respectively and compared with the experimental results to verify the reliability of these three methods it was shown that the ale numerical algorithm can be reliably used to simulate this kind of fluid solid interaction problem and the impact forces and moments are more precisely even in the extreme angles and velocities shan wang wang and soares 2014 2014 studied the variation of slamming pressure when three dimensional elastic hemispheres and cones enter water at a velocity of about 4 m s it is found that the mesh density of the impact domain and the contact stiffness between the coupling nodes are very important to the quality of the simulation results erfanian erfanian et al 2015 2015 used the ale method to study the low speed water entry process of a 26 mm hemispherical head vehicle the numerical results agree well with the experimental results li li et al 2007 2007 designed two new low penetration warheads for domestic 9 mm diameter pistol warheads and carried out numerical simulation for the oblique water problem of the new model compared with different models of the water entry process and then obtained the regular patterns of the velocity decay displacement relative kinetic energy and instantaneous cavity variation yang yang et al 2009 2009 carried out numerical simulation on the penetration of steel projectile into water and analyzed the influence of shape and water entry velocity on projectile penetration performance and gave the law of attenuation of motion velocity in projectile water pan pan and yang 2014 2014 used the finite element method to study the influence of water entry velocity and water entry angle on the impact pressure of the vehicle with a speed of 10 40 m s during the water entry yan yan et al 2018 2018 used fem sph algorithm to simulate the water entry problem of an auv an experimental study on the water entry process of air launched auv was carried out by using high speed photography and sensing technology it shows a high accuracy when comparing the simulation results with experimental results as shown in the published works many researchers and scholars have carried out extensive research on the numerical simulation of the water entry but the analysis of the load reduction performance of the buffer head cap is not perfect in this paper firstly the structural design of the head cap is shown in detail then a finite element model of buffer head cap load reduction performance analysis is established the effects of various factors such as buffer head cap length buffer density water entry velocity and water entry angle on the load reduction performance are analyzed systematically the conclusion can be applied to the design and analysis of crashworthy structure of underwater weapon 2 design of mitigator the mitigator is mainly composed of a nose cap cushion locating structure and connector waugh 1975 as shown in fig 1 a among them the nose cap can not only keep the good aerodynamic characteristic of the vehicle but also can ensure the stability of the overall structure before entering the water the buffer will be ruptured under the impact load during the water entry process and the impact loads will act directly to the buffer this can reduce the impact peak value act on the auv there are 4 connectors in our design are used to fix the buffer head cap to the auv according our research results the configuration of the buffer nose cap was designed in a sphere ogive revolution combination shape this configuration can decrease the impact load on the auv and keep the stability of auv s motion in this paper the thickness of the shell is 3 mm the radius of the small ball head is 6 8 mm the inner diameter of the pointed arch is 162 mm and the length of the joint between the shell and the vehicle is about 43 mm the mitigator is formed into a revolution body according to the internal configuration of the shell and has a length l as shown in fig 1 b the nose cap must have a certain structural strength and at the same time it also can be broken and disintegrated when entering the water the material of the nose cap is composite material that consists of unsaturated polyester resin as matrix and chopped twisting glass fiber as reinforcing base respectively the composite material is difficult to precisely control due to the uniformity of dispersion and orientation of the fibers which leads to the inevitability of discrete performance the brittleness of the structure can cause rupture problem during water entry the buffer consists of a foam buffer and a locating structure the rigid polyurethane foam is selected as the cushioning material this material can absorb a large amount of impact energy during compression to the protected objects the buffer is firmly pressed in the front portion of the head cap inner cavity by the annular positioning member of the homogenous material and the positioning member is firmly bonded to the inner wall of the head cap by the adhesive after the head cap is installed in position the end face of the vehicle fits exactly with the rear region of the mitigator and becomes a supporting surface for combining the vehicle with the head cap the connector consists of a spring clip device and the spring clip of the connecting member is evenly bonded and fixed on the inner wall of the straight portion of the rear end of the head cap housing the generated elastic bonding force provides a friction bond between the head cap and the vehicle when the spring clip is installed the special function of the buffer head cap determines its strict design strength requirements it must be able to withstand the pressure during high speed flight in the air that is the strength has a lower boundary it must also ensure that the buffer can break and disintegrate from the vehicle during the water entry that is the strength has an upper boundary all conditions are complex and the upper and lower boundaries are discrete zones as shown in fig 2 xu et al 2012 3 numerical model 3 1 introduction of ale method the governing equation of the ale algorithm is given by the following conservation equations wang and soares 2014 1 the mass conservation equation 1 ρ t ρ v i x i w i ρ x i 2 the momentum conservation equation 2 ρ v i t σ i j j ρ b i ρ w i v i x j where v represents the velocity of the material and u means the velocity of the mesh and w means the relative velocity which is given by w v u the stress tensor is expressed by the following equation 3 σ i j p δ i j μ v i j v j i the equation can be solved jointly with the initial conditions and boundary conditions below and the initial and boundary conditions are 4 v i u i 0 on γ 1 domain 5 σ ij n j 0 on γ 2 domain where 6 γ 1 γ 2 γ γ 1 γ 2 0 in the above formula γ represents the whole boundary of computational domain the γ 1 and γ 2 represent the partial of γ γ 1 represents the slave surface usually the structure of the domain and the γ 2 represents the master surface usually the fluid the n j represents the unit vector of boundary in outward normal direction δ i j is kronecker δ function assume that the velocity field at time t 0 in the whole computational domain is known as 7 v i x i 0 0 3 the energy conservation equation 8 ρ e t σ i j v i j ρ b i v i ρ w j e x j in ale formulation the governing equations for the fluid and structure can be solved simultaneously for all unknown variables which is known as the monolithic scheme when the structure mesh moves with the structural material the ale formulation for the structure conforms to the lagrangian formulation when the fluid mesh is fixed in space the ale formulation for the fluid conforms to the eulerian formulation the fluid structure interaction is calculated based on the penalty method coupling algorithm the principle of the algorithm is first checks whether each slave node structure penetrates the main surface fluid at each time step and does not perform any processing on the node if there is no penetration if it penetrates a penalty force is introduced between the main surface and the slave node penalty forces are calculated proportionally to the penetration depth and spring stiffness this method behaves likes a spring system between the slave node and the main surface to limit penetration as shown in fig 3 souli and benson 2010 the penalty force is described by 9 f k d where k represents the spring stiffness and d means the penetration depth 3 2 numerical method verification the accuracy of the numerical model and method was verified by aristoff aristoff et al 2010 2010 decelerating sphere experiment data the diameter of the sphere is 25 4 mm the density is 7860 kg m3 and the water entry velocity is 2 17 m s the experimental time starts from 0s t 0 when the sphere touches the water surface figs 4 and 5 shows the comparison between the numerical calculation and the experimental results of the cavity shape at 54 9 ms and 61 9 ms after the water entry respectively the numerical calculation of the depth of the sphere is compared with the experiment results as shown in fig 6 as can be seen from figs 4 and 5 the numerical calculation method used in this paper simulates the process of splashing cavity expansion and necking of the liquid surface during the process of water entry appropriately fig 6 shows that at t 65 5 ms the depth test result of the sphere is 154 6 mm while the numerical simulation result is 149 7 mm the relative error is 3 2 the calculation result of the depth of the sphere into the water is very close to the experiment result at the same time this indicates that the numerical model established in this paper is reliable for carrying out the simulation of the impact water flow field of the vehicle 3 3 grid independence verification the numerical simulation of the vehicle water entry impact process is based on ls dyna software the simulation model includes three parts vehicle air and water after trial and error analysis it is finally determined that the size of the air zone is 3000 500 2400 mm and the size of the water zone is 3000 3000 2400 mm air water and aircraft are modeled by solid164 3d solid elements where the vehicle uses a lagrangian grid water and air are both euler grids we chose multi material ale algorithm in ls dyna and a penalty function algorithm is used between vehicle air and water the numerical simulation uses the mm g ms unit system the mesh size and shape affect the accuracy of the analysis results and the economics of the process in order to determine the optimal mesh size capture the maximum stress gradient change in the flow field and a description of the grid size ratio dimensionless parameters is defined 10 r f l e u l e r l l a g r a n g e where l e u l e r is the euler element grid size l l a g r a n g e is the lagrange element grid size according to the basic principle of the fluid solid coupling algorithm the lagrange element structure mesh size should be smaller than the euler element fluid mesh size in the grid independent verification the appropriate lagrange cell size is first determined according to the size of the structure and then the influence of the grid size ratio on the calculation result is analyzed by changing the fluid grid size in addition to changing the fluid grid size ratio in this process other calculation parameter settings are consistent for the vertical water entry velocity is 50 m s and the model are set as a rigid body considering rf 2 3 4 and 5 to carry out the numerical analysis respectively the dimensionless water entry impact load of the vehicle is defined in the following formula 11 c d 2 f i m p a c t ρ w π r 2 v 2 where f i m p a c t is the water entry impact load ρ w is the density of water r is the maximum diameter of the vehicle v is the initial velocity of the vehicle the calculation results are shown in table 1 as shown in the results the peak impact coefficient and the maximum displacement are dependent on the grid size the relative error of the result obtained when taking rf 2 4 is small while the acceleration peak coefficient and the maximum displacement have large differences when rf 5 indicating that the calculation result is less reliable considering the calculation accuracy and calculation efficiency the fluid and solid mesh are divided with rf 4 the final vehicle is divided into 35 840 units and the fluid domain is divided into 1 800 000 units as shown in fig 7 3 4 simulation model and material properties since the locating structure and connector have little influence on the numerical simulation of the buffer head cap these two components are ignored in the analysis in order to improve the calculation efficiency the final finite element mesh is shown in fig 8 in order to clearly show the spatial structure relationship between the vehicle and the head cap the air and water domains are not shown in the figure the simulation of the crushing process of the mitigator during the water entry is both the key point and the difficulty part of this study the mesh generation strategy material model and structural failure parameters should be considered together in this study the mat plastic kinematic state equations were used to simulate the nose cap and buffer and the failure rule based on maximum effective strain was used to simulate the crushing process of the nose cap and the buffer the material of the shell of the auv is aluminium alloy and its failure strain is 0 24 if the calculated strain of the auv is greater than 0 24 we can consider that the structure of the auv will be failure during the water entry the material parameters used in this paper are shown in tables 2 and 3 the fluid materials used the mat null material model in ls dyna and the parameters are shown in table 4 the water uses the mie gruneisen equation of state 12 p ρ c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ α 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 3 μ 1 3 2 γ 0 α μ e 13 μ 1 v 1 where p is the pressure v is the relative volume and e is the energy per unit volume the air uses the liner poly nomial linear equation of state 14 p c 0 c 1 μ c 2 μ 2 c 3 μ 3 c 4 c 5 μ c 6 μ 2 e the contact between the vehicle and the shell the vehicle and the buffer the buffer and the shell are defined by the contact automatic surface to surface contact keyword in ls dyna 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of length a serial of auv entry water vertically with different lengths 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm and 250 mm mitigator simulations are carried out to study the effect of length on the mitigation performances the vertical water entry velocity is 50 m s fig 9 shows the variation of the maximum equivalent plastic strain of the vehicle shell structure with the different length of the buffer it can be seen that the greater the length of the buffer the smaller the maximum equivalent plastic strain when the buffer length is 100 mm the equivalent plastic strain of the vehicle shell is 0 07 which is much smaller than the strain of the shell without the head cap the strain value is 0 1536 that s to say the smaller the strain the better performance of the buffer fig 10 shows the variation of the peak coefficient of impact acceleration with the length of the buffer a dimensionless parameter ξ is defined to evaluate the mitigation effect 15 ξ c d r i g i d c d b u f f e r c d r i g i d 100 it can be seen from fig 10 that as the length of the buffer increases the acceleration peak coefficient of the aircraft becomes smaller and the corresponding load reduction ratio becomes larger when the buffer length is 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm and 250 mm the acceleration peak coefficient is 1 82 1 47 1 24 and 1 16 respectively while the cd without the buffer is 3 15 and the load reduction ratio is 42 2 53 3 60 and 63 2 respectively however it should be noted that the head cap take time to get out of the vehicle increases with the buffer length which will affect the normal function of the vehicle therefore it needs to be designed according to actual needs figs 11 and 12 are the impact pressure and stress history of the characteristic unit of the buffer cap with different lengths while the slamming pressure and stress history of the vehicle without the buffer head cap are also shown for comparison the pressure is used to describe the impact force acted on the auv while the stress is used to represent the internal structural response under external load it can be seen from the impact pressure time history curve that the impact pressure curve of the vehicle characteristic unit with the buffer head cap has two peaks comparing the secondary peaks of the four length head caps the secondary peak decreases with the buffer length this means that the buffer performance of the head cap improves with the buffer length at the same time it is known that the time of impact pressure reaching the secondary peak increases with the buffer length the pressure peak without the buffer head cap is about 220 mpa and the overall pressure level after the peak is about 100 mpa the maximum pressure peak with the buffer head cap is about 60 mpa which is much smaller than without the head cap the peak pressure indicates that the buffer head cap better reduces the slamming pressure level acted on the vehicle it can be seen from the stress time history curve of the characteristic unit that the stress with the buffer head cap also has two peaks and the first peak appears around 2 ms in this stage the buffer is not separated from the vehicle connection the buffer is continuously crushed and finally detached from the vehicle and then a second peak stress occurs the stress change between the two peaks is gentle which indicates that the buffer has always played a role in buffer unloading during this time the longer the length of the buffer head cap the longer the duration of the corresponding flat section the stress peak without the head cap is about 365 mpa the overall stress level after the peak is maintained at about 160 mpa the maximum stress peak with the buffer head cap is about 250 mpa and the overall stress level after the peak maintained at around 50 mpa both are less than the stress level without the cap from the pressure and the stress results it can be seen that the peak value of the pressure and stress of the auv with buffer is decreased while the corresponding pulse width is increased compared with the results without buffer in other words during the water entry whether the auv is with buffer or not the total energy of the auv is same but the buffer will increase the pulse width of impact and this will result the decrease of peak load fig 13 is the deformation of the vehicle head shell structure with different lengths of buffer the abscissa x is represented the width of the buffer head cap in the symmetry plane and the ordinate y is used to described the deformation of the cap s outline as shown in the figure the longer the buffer length the smaller the shell deformation of the structure when the buffer length is 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm and 250 mm the maximum deformation is 1 54 mm 1 33 mm 1 13 mm and 0 96 mm respectively when the vehicle without a buffer head cap enters water at a speed of 30 m s the maximum deformation is 6 81 mm it can be seen that the buffer head cap can reduce the deformation of the structure of the vehicle shell effectively that is can buffer the impact load acting on the vehicle 4 2 effect of density a serial of auv vertical water entry with different densities 100 kg m3 120 kg m3 140 kg m3 and 160 kg m3 mitigator simulations are carried out to study the effect of density on the mitigation performances the vertical water entry velocity is 50 m s and the buffer length are 100 mm fig 14 shows the variation of the maximum equivalent plastic strain of the vehicle shell structure with different density of the buffer material it can be seen from the figure that the corresponding equivalent plastic strain increases with increase of the density of the buffer material when the density of the buffer material is ranged from 100 kg m3 to 160 kg m3 the maximum equivalent plastic strain of the shell changed from 0 0555 to 0 1446 respectively which is less than the strain of 0 1536 without a cap this shows that the buffering performance of the buffer material with lower density is better than the greater one which is mainly determined by the energy absorption buffering properties of the polyurethane foam the total impact energy absorbed is in the same while the strain rate ratio of the small density material is higher resulting a better cushioning effect fig 15 shows the variation of the peak coefficient of impact acceleration with different density of the buffer material as can be seen from the figure the greater density of the buffer material the larger peak value of the impact acceleration and the smaller the load reduction ratio when the material density is 100 kg m3 and 160 kg m3 the corresponding peak coefficient is 1 61 and 2 18 respectively and the load reduction ratio is 48 9 and 30 8 respectively fig 16 is the impact pressure time history curve of the characteristic unit of a buffer head cap with different buffer material densities it can be seen from the figure that the pressures of the characteristic unit have the same variation pattern at different buffer densities and the time at which the pressure reaches the peak at different densities is basically the same reaching the first peak at about 1 7 ms and reaching the second peak at about 4 6 ms however the value of the second peak is different when the density is 100 kg m3 120 kg m3 140 kg m3 and 160 kg m3 the peak value is 75 mpa 90 mpa 105 mpa and 107 mpa respectively the characteristic unit pressure peak without the buffer head cap vehicle is 220 mpa which is much larger than the pressure peak of vehicle with the head cap fig 17 is a stress history of the characteristic unit of the buffer head cap vehicle with different buffer material densities it can be seen from the figure that the stress variation law of the characteristic unit of different buffer densities vehicles are the same as the variation tendency of the slamming pressure the stress corresponding to different material densities reaches the same time at the two peaks the peak values is different but the difference is slight the first peak is 75 mpa and the second peak is about 240 mpa the peak stress of the vehicle without the buffer head cap is 365 mpa which is much larger than the stress peak of vehicle with the head cap fig 18 is the deformation configuration of the vehicles head region structure at different buffer material densities as can be seen from the figure the smaller the material density the smaller the deformation of the corresponding structure when the density is 100 kg m3 120 kg m3 140 kg m3 and 160 kg m3 the maximum deformation is 1 32 mm 1 54 mm 1 64 mm and 1 87 mm respectively 4 3 effect of water entry velocity a serial of auv vertical water entry with different velocities 40 m s 50 m s 60 m s and 70 m s mitigator simulations are carried out to study the effect of water entry velocity on the mitigation performances the buffer density is 120 kg m3 and the buffer length are 100 mm fig 19 is the broken state of the nose cap at 1 5 ms after entering the water at different velocities it can be seen from the state of rupture of the shell that under the same conditions the rupture range of the nose cap increases with the water entry velocity when the water entry velocity is 40 m s the front end of the nose cap is partially broken when the velocity is 70 m s the front end of the casing is completely cracked and crushed fig 20 shows the variation of the maximum equivalent plastic strain of the vehicle shell with different water entry velocities it can be seen from the figure that the corresponding equivalent plastic strain increases with the increase of the water entry velocity when the water entry velocity is 40 m s 50 m s 60 m s and 70 m s the maximum strain is 0 0231 0 07 0 165 and 0 2116 respectively the maximum strain at a speed of 50 m s without a buffer head cap is 0 1536 the maximum strain at a speed of 70 m s is 0 327 meanwhile the structure of the head shell is failure this shows that the buffer head cap better buffers the impact load of the vehicle fig 21 shows the variation of the peak coefficient of impact acceleration with the water entry velocity it can be seen from the figure that the peak coefficient of the impact acceleration at different velocities is basically a constant when the velocity is 40 m s 50 m s 60 m s and 70 m s the peak coefficient is 1 84 1 82 1 82 and 1 81 respectively the load reduction ratio is 42 5 42 2 40 9 and 40 3 respectively the calculation results show that the buffer performance of the head cap decreases slightly as the water entry velocity increases fig 22 is the impact pressure history of the characteristic unit of a buffer head cap with different water entry velocities and the pressure change of the characteristic unit when the vehicle without the head cap enters the water at a speed of 50 m s is also shown as a comparison the pulse width of the first peak and the time required to reach the secondary peak decreases with the increase of water entry velocities at the same time the peak pressure acted on the vehicle after the buffer is separated from the head of the vehicle is bigger when the velocity is 40 m s 50 m s 60 m s and 70 m s the second peak is 35 mpa 75 mpa 186 mpa and 205 mpa respectively which indicates that the water entry velocity has an important influence on the peak value of the impact pressure compared with the calculation results without the head cap the buffer head cap has better buffering ability at different velocities fig 23 is a stress history of the characteristic unit of the buffer head cap vehicle with different water entry velocities the figure also shows the stress variation of the characteristic unit when the vehicle without the head cap enters the water at a speed of 50 m s the change tendency of stress with water entering velocity is similar to the results of pressure but there are also differences when the vehicle with buffer head cap enters water at 60 m s and 70 m s the second stress peak is greater than that of the vehicle without buffer head cap and the pressure peak of the vehicle with the buffer head cap under the corresponding conditions is smaller than the pressure peak of the vehicle without the buffer head cap the stress reflects the dynamic response of the structure under external force which indicates that the water entry velocity has an important effect on the dynamic response of the structure therefore the buffer performance of the head cap should improve with the water entry velocity fig 24 is the deformation of the vehicle head shell structure at different water entry velocities it can be seen from the figure that the deformation of the vehicle shell structure increases with the water entry velocity when the water entry velocity is 40 m s 50 m s 60 m s and 70 m s the maximum deformation is 0 16 mm 1 54 mm 12 16 mm and 15 88 mm respectively the calculation results show that the deformation of the head shell structure can be neglected at the water entry velocity of 40 m s when the water entry velocity is 60 m s and 70 m s the deformation of the shell is much larger than the speed of 50 m s it indicates that the performance of the same buffer head cap is weaker when the water entry velocity is larger 4 4 effect of water entry angle a serial of auv water entry with different angles 60 70 80 90 mitigator simulations are carried out to study the effect of water entry angle on the mitigation performances the initial water entry velocity is 50 m s the buffer length are 100 mm the buffer density is 120 kg m3 fig 25 is the broken state of the buffer head cap at 1 5 ms after entering the water at different angles it can be seen from the figure that under the same conditions the cracking region of the nose cap decreases while the water entry angle increases that is the less likely to crack and the better buffering performance of the buffer head cap will have at the same time the asymmetry of the rupture range of the nose cap is more obvious at the smaller water entry angle the water entry angle changes the impact contact area of the nose cap so that the buffers at different angles have different buffering effects fig 26 shows the variation of the maximum equivalent plastic strain of the vehicle shell with the buffer head cap vehicle entering the water at different angles it can be seen from the figure that the maximum strain of the nose cap increases while the water entry angle decreases when the water entry angle is 60 70 80 and 90 the maximum strain is 0 1848 0 1218 0 0727 and 0 07 respectively this shows that the cushioning cap has different buffering effects when entering the water at different angles fig 27 is a figure showing the variation of the peak coefficient of the axial and normal impact acceleration when the vehicle with the buffer head cap entering the water at different angles it can be seen from the figure that the loading shedding rate of the axial and normal acceleration peak coefficient increases with the water entry angle when the water entry angle is 60 70 80 and 90 the axial load reduction ratio is 28 8 36 6 40 3 and 42 2 respectively the normal load reduction ratio is 27 8 28 4 29 5 and none respectively fig 28 is the impact pressure history of the characteristic unit of a buffer head cap with different water entry angles and the pressure change of the characteristic unit when the vehicle without the head cap enters the water at an angle of 90 is also shown as a comparison it can be seen from the figure that when the vehicle enters water at different angles the change law of the impact pressure is the same but the peak value of the pressure is slightly different for the second pressure peak when the water entry angle is 60 70 80 and 90 the peak value is 88 mpa 91 mpa 120 mpa and 127 mpa respectively fig 29 is a stress history of the characteristic unit of the buffer head cap vehicle with different water entry angles and the stress variation curve of the vehicle without the head cap when entering the water at an angle of 90 is also shown as a comparison it can be seen from the figure that the change tendency of stress when entering water at different angles is the same as the change of impact pressure but there are big differences between the two stress peaks for the first peak the peak stress increases with the decrease of water entry angles making the head cap shell more susceptible to cracking thus reducing the buffering performance of the head cap but for the secondary peak the corresponding stress peak decreases with the decrease of water entry angles the change characteristics of the stress better reflect the variation of the buffering performance of the head cap with the water entry angle fig 30 is the deformation configuration of the vehicle head shell structure at different water entry angles when the water entry angle is 60 70 80 and 90 the maximum deformation variable is 1 1 mm 1 18 mm 1 33 mm and 1 54 mm respectively at the same time it can be seen that the deformation of the nose cap is symmetrical with respect to the center when entering the water vertically and the deformation of the nose cap is asymmetrical when obliquely entering the water 5 conclusions in this paper a mitigator is designed to reduce the impact load of the auv entering the water this solved the problem of vehicle shell may fail when the impact load of the water impact is huge the buffering performance is numerically investigated by applying an explicit finite element method firstly the numerical calculations used in this paper were compared with the experimental and analytical results and the process of splashing vacuolar expansion and necking of the liquid surface during the process of water entry are simulated perfectly secondly we chose the computational domain and finally determined that the size of the air zone is 3000 500 2400 mm the size of the water zone is 3000 3000 2400 mm a convergence study was carried out to choose the mesh density the effect of the buffer length buffer density water entry velocity and water entry angle on mitigation properties was studied based on the numerical method in section 3 and we can draw the following conclusions 1 the calculation results show that the buffer head cap designed in this paper can better reduce the impact load acting on the vehicle the reason why the buffer head cap can reduce the load acting on the aircraft is mainly because the cushioning material of the buffer generates a large plastic deformation under the pressure and limits the transmitted pressure to the yield pressure of the material 2 the length of the buffer and the density of the buffering material have a great influence on the cushioning effect of the head cap the longer the length the cushioning effect is better but the longer one will need more times to separate from the vehicle therefore it needs to be designed according to actual needs 3 the water entry velocity and the water entry angle can affect the location and moment of the cracking of the buffer head cap which will result in different cushioning performance this conclusion will provide an engineering reference for the design of the high performance buffer head cap acknowledgments the work is financed by national natural science foundation of china grant no 51709229 51879220

22844,the autonomous underwater vehicle auv will suffer severe impact load during the water entry and its shell structure will undergo elastoplastic deformation even breakage or damage which seriously threatens the safety and reliability of the auv therefore it is necessary to carry out research on the buffering technology of the impact load of the vehicle into the water to ensure that the auv can enter the water safely and reliably in this paper a mitigator is designed to reduce the impact load of the auv entering the water numerical simulations based on the explicit finite element method with an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale solver are carried out to study the mitigation characteristic of the designed mitigator the accuracy of the model was verified by the experimental results of the water entry of the small sphere and the mesh independence was verified to determine the mesh size then the effects of initial conditions such as buffer length buffer material density entry velocity and entry angle on the cushioning effect of the buffer head cap were studied when the vertical water entry velocity is 50 m s the impact load reduction ratio is 42 2 while the water entry angle is 60 and the water entry velocity is 50 m s the axial load reduction ratio is 28 8 and the normal load reduction ratio is 27 8 these conclusions will be useful for the designing of the crashworthy structural and the analysis of underwater weapon impact keywords water entry impact mitigation cushioning properties numerical modeling 1 introduction common underwater vehicles can be launched by submarines and surface ships or by new launch methods such as fixed wing aircraft helicopters and rocket assisted aircraft the vehicle will suffer severe impact load during the water entry usually in milliseconds under which the vehicle will produce dynamic response of the structure causing elastoplastic deformation of the shell structure and even damage and buckling moreover the impact load may change the trajectory of the vehicle which will result in whipping diving and ballistic runaway and other issues xu et al 1992 therefore effectively reducing the impact load to ensure the safe and reliable entry water of the vehicle is essential many scholars have done a lot of research on the load shedding effect of the buffer head cap the earliest buffer caps were integrally cast from foam and the cushioning material was crushed and decomposed during the inflow howard 1959 after a period of development its structure was improved into a composite structure consisting of an outer fairing shell and an internal foam material robert et al 2010 when the aircraft moves in the air the shell can provide a good aerodynamic shape which can be broken during water entry and the foam material can reduce the impact load according to the published works the mk46 torpedo in the united states installed a mk7 2 and mk8 1 head caps in the warhead to protect the torpedo under the water entry impact with velocity 50 m s the deep war warhead is equipped with the mk26 1 solid core cap and its weighs are 6 59 kg and can withstand the impact load during water entry at 260 m s yang et al 2001 xuan 1999 jianmingsong and yan 1999 conducted an experimental study on the disintegration of the head cap in the process of entering the water the research confirmed the rationality of design the buffer shell with composite materials and explained the rupture mechanism of the head cap confirming that the buffer head cap can reduce the water impact load lei et al 2011 studied the reliability of head cap separation and proposed related technical measures in combination with cushion head cap material shell wall thickness and ribs and proved the reliability of the measure by finite element analysis because the water entry problem is complicated it is difficult to solve this problem through theoretical analysis numerical simulation and experiment have become the main means to study the water entry problem especially for the cushioning problem hirt et al 1974 proposed the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method to solve the fluid solid coupling problem with large deformation and moving boundary this method has been widely used in the study of water entry problems and has been integrated into well known dynamic finite element software such as dytran and ls dyna mohammad saeed derakhshanian saeed derakhshanian et al 2018 2018 carried out a serial numerical simulation of water entry problems based on the finite volume method fvm finite difference method fdm and arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method ale respectively and compared with the experimental results to verify the reliability of these three methods it was shown that the ale numerical algorithm can be reliably used to simulate this kind of fluid solid interaction problem and the impact forces and moments are more precisely even in the extreme angles and velocities shan wang wang and soares 2014 2014 studied the variation of slamming pressure when three dimensional elastic hemispheres and cones enter water at a velocity of about 4 m s it is found that the mesh density of the impact domain and the contact stiffness between the coupling nodes are very important to the quality of the simulation results erfanian erfanian et al 2015 2015 used the ale method to study the low speed water entry process of a 26 mm hemispherical head vehicle the numerical results agree well with the experimental results li li et al 2007 2007 designed two new low penetration warheads for domestic 9 mm diameter pistol warheads and carried out numerical simulation for the oblique water problem of the new model compared with different models of the water entry process and then obtained the regular patterns of the velocity decay displacement relative kinetic energy and instantaneous cavity variation yang yang et al 2009 2009 carried out numerical simulation on the penetration of steel projectile into water and analyzed the influence of shape and water entry velocity on projectile penetration performance and gave the law of attenuation of motion velocity in projectile water pan pan and yang 2014 2014 used the finite element method to study the influence of water entry velocity and water entry angle on the impact pressure of the vehicle with a speed of 10 40 m s during the water entry yan yan et al 2018 2018 used fem sph algorithm to simulate the water entry problem of an auv an experimental study on the water entry process of air launched auv was carried out by using high speed photography and sensing technology it shows a high accuracy when comparing the simulation results with experimental results as shown in the published works many researchers and scholars have carried out extensive research on the numerical simulation of the water entry but the analysis of the load reduction performance of the buffer head cap is not perfect in this paper firstly the structural design of the head cap is shown in detail then a finite element model of buffer head cap load reduction performance analysis is established the effects of various factors such as buffer head cap length buffer density water entry velocity and water entry angle on the load reduction performance are analyzed systematically the conclusion can be applied to the design and analysis of crashworthy structure of underwater weapon 2 design of mitigator the mitigator is mainly composed of a nose cap cushion locating structure and connector waugh 1975 as shown in fig 1 a among them the nose cap can not only keep the good aerodynamic characteristic of the vehicle but also can ensure the stability of the overall structure before entering the water the buffer will be ruptured under the impact load during the water entry process and the impact loads will act directly to the buffer this can reduce the impact peak value act on the auv there are 4 connectors in our design are used to fix the buffer head cap to the auv according our research results the configuration of the buffer nose cap was designed in a sphere ogive revolution combination shape this configuration can decrease the impact load on the auv and keep the stability of auv s motion in this paper the thickness of the shell is 3 mm the radius of the small ball head is 6 8 mm the inner diameter of the pointed arch is 162 mm and the length of the joint between the shell and the vehicle is about 43 mm the mitigator is formed into a revolution body according to the internal configuration of the shell and has a length l as shown in fig 1 b the nose cap must have a certain structural strength and at the same time it also can be broken and disintegrated when entering the water the material of the nose cap is composite material that consists of unsaturated polyester resin as matrix and chopped twisting glass fiber as reinforcing base respectively the composite material is difficult to precisely control due to the uniformity of dispersion and orientation of the fibers which leads to the inevitability of discrete performance the brittleness of the structure can cause rupture problem during water entry the buffer consists of a foam buffer and a locating structure the rigid polyurethane foam is selected as the cushioning material this material can absorb a large amount of impact energy during compression to the protected objects the buffer is firmly pressed in the front portion of the head cap inner cavity by the annular positioning member of the homogenous material and the positioning member is firmly bonded to the inner wall of the head cap by the adhesive after the head cap is installed in position the end face of the vehicle fits exactly with the rear region of the mitigator and becomes a supporting surface for combining the vehicle with the head cap the connector consists of a spring clip device and the spring clip of the connecting member is evenly bonded and fixed on the inner wall of the straight portion of the rear end of the head cap housing the generated elastic bonding force provides a friction bond between the head cap and the vehicle when the spring clip is installed the special function of the buffer head cap determines its strict design strength requirements it must be able to withstand the pressure during high speed flight in the air that is the strength has a lower boundary it must also ensure that the buffer can break and disintegrate from the vehicle during the water entry that is the strength has an upper boundary all conditions are complex and the upper and lower boundaries are discrete zones as shown in fig 2 xu et al 2012 3 numerical model 3 1 introduction of ale method the governing equation of the ale algorithm is given by the following conservation equations wang and soares 2014 1 the mass conservation equation 1 ρ t ρ v i x i w i ρ x i 2 the momentum conservation equation 2 ρ v i t σ i j j ρ b i ρ w i v i x j where v represents the velocity of the material and u means the velocity of the mesh and w means the relative velocity which is given by w v u the stress tensor is expressed by the following equation 3 σ i j p δ i j μ v i j v j i the equation can be solved jointly with the initial conditions and boundary conditions below and the initial and boundary conditions are 4 v i u i 0 on γ 1 domain 5 σ ij n j 0 on γ 2 domain where 6 γ 1 γ 2 γ γ 1 γ 2 0 in the above formula γ represents the whole boundary of computational domain the γ 1 and γ 2 represent the partial of γ γ 1 represents the slave surface usually the structure of the domain and the γ 2 represents the master surface usually the fluid the n j represents the unit vector of boundary in outward normal direction δ i j is kronecker δ function assume that the velocity field at time t 0 in the whole computational domain is known as 7 v i x i 0 0 3 the energy conservation equation 8 ρ e t σ i j v i j ρ b i v i ρ w j e x j in ale formulation the governing equations for the fluid and structure can be solved simultaneously for all unknown variables which is known as the monolithic scheme when the structure mesh moves with the structural material the ale formulation for the structure conforms to the lagrangian formulation when the fluid mesh is fixed in space the ale formulation for the fluid conforms to the eulerian formulation the fluid structure interaction is calculated based on the penalty method coupling algorithm the principle of the algorithm is first checks whether each slave node structure penetrates the main surface fluid at each time step and does not perform any processing on the node if there is no penetration if it penetrates a penalty force is introduced between the main surface and the slave node penalty forces are calculated proportionally to the penetration depth and spring stiffness this method behaves likes a spring system between the slave node and the main surface to limit penetration as shown in fig 3 souli and benson 2010 the penalty force is described by 9 f k d where k represents the spring stiffness and d means the penetration depth 3 2 numerical method verification the accuracy of the numerical model and method was verified by aristoff aristoff et al 2010 2010 decelerating sphere experiment data the diameter of the sphere is 25 4 mm the density is 7860 kg m3 and the water entry velocity is 2 17 m s the experimental time starts from 0s t 0 when the sphere touches the water surface figs 4 and 5 shows the comparison between the numerical calculation and the experimental results of the cavity shape at 54 9 ms and 61 9 ms after the water entry respectively the numerical calculation of the depth of the sphere is compared with the experiment results as shown in fig 6 as can be seen from figs 4 and 5 the numerical calculation method used in this paper simulates the process of splashing cavity expansion and necking of the liquid surface during the process of water entry appropriately fig 6 shows that at t 65 5 ms the depth test result of the sphere is 154 6 mm while the numerical simulation result is 149 7 mm the relative error is 3 2 the calculation result of the depth of the sphere into the water is very close to the experiment result at the same time this indicates that the numerical model established in this paper is reliable for carrying out the simulation of the impact water flow field of the vehicle 3 3 grid independence verification the numerical simulation of the vehicle water entry impact process is based on ls dyna software the simulation model includes three parts vehicle air and water after trial and error analysis it is finally determined that the size of the air zone is 3000 500 2400 mm and the size of the water zone is 3000 3000 2400 mm air water and aircraft are modeled by solid164 3d solid elements where the vehicle uses a lagrangian grid water and air are both euler grids we chose multi material ale algorithm in ls dyna and a penalty function algorithm is used between vehicle air and water the numerical simulation uses the mm g ms unit system the mesh size and shape affect the accuracy of the analysis results and the economics of the process in order to determine the optimal mesh size capture the maximum stress gradient change in the flow field and a description of the grid size ratio dimensionless parameters is defined 10 r f l e u l e r l l a g r a n g e where l e u l e r is the euler element grid size l l a g r a n g e is the lagrange element grid size according to the basic principle of the fluid solid coupling algorithm the lagrange element structure mesh size should be smaller than the euler element fluid mesh size in the grid independent verification the appropriate lagrange cell size is first determined according to the size of the structure and then the influence of the grid size ratio on the calculation result is analyzed by changing the fluid grid size in addition to changing the fluid grid size ratio in this process other calculation parameter settings are consistent for the vertical water entry velocity is 50 m s and the model are set as a rigid body considering rf 2 3 4 and 5 to carry out the numerical analysis respectively the dimensionless water entry impact load of the vehicle is defined in the following formula 11 c d 2 f i m p a c t ρ w π r 2 v 2 where f i m p a c t is the water entry impact load ρ w is the density of water r is the maximum diameter of the vehicle v is the initial velocity of the vehicle the calculation results are shown in table 1 as shown in the results the peak impact coefficient and the maximum displacement are dependent on the grid size the relative error of the result obtained when taking rf 2 4 is small while the acceleration peak coefficient and the maximum displacement have large differences when rf 5 indicating that the calculation result is less reliable considering the calculation accuracy and calculation efficiency the fluid and solid mesh are divided with rf 4 the final vehicle is divided into 35 840 units and the fluid domain is divided into 1 800 000 units as shown in fig 7 3 4 simulation model and material properties since the locating structure and connector have little influence on the numerical simulation of the buffer head cap these two components are ignored in the analysis in order to improve the calculation efficiency the final finite element mesh is shown in fig 8 in order to clearly show the spatial structure relationship between the vehicle and the head cap the air and water domains are not shown in the figure the simulation of the crushing process of the mitigator during the water entry is both the key point and the difficulty part of this study the mesh generation strategy material model and structural failure parameters should be considered together in this study the mat plastic kinematic state equations were used to simulate the nose cap and buffer and the failure rule based on maximum effective strain was used to simulate the crushing process of the nose cap and the buffer the material of the shell of the auv is aluminium alloy and its failure strain is 0 24 if the calculated strain of the auv is greater than 0 24 we can consider that the structure of the auv will be failure during the water entry the material parameters used in this paper are shown in tables 2 and 3 the fluid materials used the mat null material model in ls dyna and the parameters are shown in table 4 the water uses the mie gruneisen equation of state 12 p ρ c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ α 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 3 μ 1 3 2 γ 0 α μ e 13 μ 1 v 1 where p is the pressure v is the relative volume and e is the energy per unit volume the air uses the liner poly nomial linear equation of state 14 p c 0 c 1 μ c 2 μ 2 c 3 μ 3 c 4 c 5 μ c 6 μ 2 e the contact between the vehicle and the shell the vehicle and the buffer the buffer and the shell are defined by the contact automatic surface to surface contact keyword in ls dyna 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of length a serial of auv entry water vertically with different lengths 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm and 250 mm mitigator simulations are carried out to study the effect of length on the mitigation performances the vertical water entry velocity is 50 m s fig 9 shows the variation of the maximum equivalent plastic strain of the vehicle shell structure with the different length of the buffer it can be seen that the greater the length of the buffer the smaller the maximum equivalent plastic strain when the buffer length is 100 mm the equivalent plastic strain of the vehicle shell is 0 07 which is much smaller than the strain of the shell without the head cap the strain value is 0 1536 that s to say the smaller the strain the better performance of the buffer fig 10 shows the variation of the peak coefficient of impact acceleration with the length of the buffer a dimensionless parameter ξ is defined to evaluate the mitigation effect 15 ξ c d r i g i d c d b u f f e r c d r i g i d 100 it can be seen from fig 10 that as the length of the buffer increases the acceleration peak coefficient of the aircraft becomes smaller and the corresponding load reduction ratio becomes larger when the buffer length is 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm and 250 mm the acceleration peak coefficient is 1 82 1 47 1 24 and 1 16 respectively while the cd without the buffer is 3 15 and the load reduction ratio is 42 2 53 3 60 and 63 2 respectively however it should be noted that the head cap take time to get out of the vehicle increases with the buffer length which will affect the normal function of the vehicle therefore it needs to be designed according to actual needs figs 11 and 12 are the impact pressure and stress history of the characteristic unit of the buffer cap with different lengths while the slamming pressure and stress history of the vehicle without the buffer head cap are also shown for comparison the pressure is used to describe the impact force acted on the auv while the stress is used to represent the internal structural response under external load it can be seen from the impact pressure time history curve that the impact pressure curve of the vehicle characteristic unit with the buffer head cap has two peaks comparing the secondary peaks of the four length head caps the secondary peak decreases with the buffer length this means that the buffer performance of the head cap improves with the buffer length at the same time it is known that the time of impact pressure reaching the secondary peak increases with the buffer length the pressure peak without the buffer head cap is about 220 mpa and the overall pressure level after the peak is about 100 mpa the maximum pressure peak with the buffer head cap is about 60 mpa which is much smaller than without the head cap the peak pressure indicates that the buffer head cap better reduces the slamming pressure level acted on the vehicle it can be seen from the stress time history curve of the characteristic unit that the stress with the buffer head cap also has two peaks and the first peak appears around 2 ms in this stage the buffer is not separated from the vehicle connection the buffer is continuously crushed and finally detached from the vehicle and then a second peak stress occurs the stress change between the two peaks is gentle which indicates that the buffer has always played a role in buffer unloading during this time the longer the length of the buffer head cap the longer the duration of the corresponding flat section the stress peak without the head cap is about 365 mpa the overall stress level after the peak is maintained at about 160 mpa the maximum stress peak with the buffer head cap is about 250 mpa and the overall stress level after the peak maintained at around 50 mpa both are less than the stress level without the cap from the pressure and the stress results it can be seen that the peak value of the pressure and stress of the auv with buffer is decreased while the corresponding pulse width is increased compared with the results without buffer in other words during the water entry whether the auv is with buffer or not the total energy of the auv is same but the buffer will increase the pulse width of impact and this will result the decrease of peak load fig 13 is the deformation of the vehicle head shell structure with different lengths of buffer the abscissa x is represented the width of the buffer head cap in the symmetry plane and the ordinate y is used to described the deformation of the cap s outline as shown in the figure the longer the buffer length the smaller the shell deformation of the structure when the buffer length is 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm and 250 mm the maximum deformation is 1 54 mm 1 33 mm 1 13 mm and 0 96 mm respectively when the vehicle without a buffer head cap enters water at a speed of 30 m s the maximum deformation is 6 81 mm it can be seen that the buffer head cap can reduce the deformation of the structure of the vehicle shell effectively that is can buffer the impact load acting on the vehicle 4 2 effect of density a serial of auv vertical water entry with different densities 100 kg m3 120 kg m3 140 kg m3 and 160 kg m3 mitigator simulations are carried out to study the effect of density on the mitigation performances the vertical water entry velocity is 50 m s and the buffer length are 100 mm fig 14 shows the variation of the maximum equivalent plastic strain of the vehicle shell structure with different density of the buffer material it can be seen from the figure that the corresponding equivalent plastic strain increases with increase of the density of the buffer material when the density of the buffer material is ranged from 100 kg m3 to 160 kg m3 the maximum equivalent plastic strain of the shell changed from 0 0555 to 0 1446 respectively which is less than the strain of 0 1536 without a cap this shows that the buffering performance of the buffer material with lower density is better than the greater one which is mainly determined by the energy absorption buffering properties of the polyurethane foam the total impact energy absorbed is in the same while the strain rate ratio of the small density material is higher resulting a better cushioning effect fig 15 shows the variation of the peak coefficient of impact acceleration with different density of the buffer material as can be seen from the figure the greater density of the buffer material the larger peak value of the impact acceleration and the smaller the load reduction ratio when the material density is 100 kg m3 and 160 kg m3 the corresponding peak coefficient is 1 61 and 2 18 respectively and the load reduction ratio is 48 9 and 30 8 respectively fig 16 is the impact pressure time history curve of the characteristic unit of a buffer head cap with different buffer material densities it can be seen from the figure that the pressures of the characteristic unit have the same variation pattern at different buffer densities and the time at which the pressure reaches the peak at different densities is basically the same reaching the first peak at about 1 7 ms and reaching the second peak at about 4 6 ms however the value of the second peak is different when the density is 100 kg m3 120 kg m3 140 kg m3 and 160 kg m3 the peak value is 75 mpa 90 mpa 105 mpa and 107 mpa respectively the characteristic unit pressure peak without the buffer head cap vehicle is 220 mpa which is much larger than the pressure peak of vehicle with the head cap fig 17 is a stress history of the characteristic unit of the buffer head cap vehicle with different buffer material densities it can be seen from the figure that the stress variation law of the characteristic unit of different buffer densities vehicles are the same as the variation tendency of the slamming pressure the stress corresponding to different material densities reaches the same time at the two peaks the peak values is different but the difference is slight the first peak is 75 mpa and the second peak is about 240 mpa the peak stress of the vehicle without the buffer head cap is 365 mpa which is much larger than the stress peak of vehicle with the head cap fig 18 is the deformation configuration of the vehicles head region structure at different buffer material densities as can be seen from the figure the smaller the material density the smaller the deformation of the corresponding structure when the density is 100 kg m3 120 kg m3 140 kg m3 and 160 kg m3 the maximum deformation is 1 32 mm 1 54 mm 1 64 mm and 1 87 mm respectively 4 3 effect of water entry velocity a serial of auv vertical water entry with different velocities 40 m s 50 m s 60 m s and 70 m s mitigator simulations are carried out to study the effect of water entry velocity on the mitigation performances the buffer density is 120 kg m3 and the buffer length are 100 mm fig 19 is the broken state of the nose cap at 1 5 ms after entering the water at different velocities it can be seen from the state of rupture of the shell that under the same conditions the rupture range of the nose cap increases with the water entry velocity when the water entry velocity is 40 m s the front end of the nose cap is partially broken when the velocity is 70 m s the front end of the casing is completely cracked and crushed fig 20 shows the variation of the maximum equivalent plastic strain of the vehicle shell with different water entry velocities it can be seen from the figure that the corresponding equivalent plastic strain increases with the increase of the water entry velocity when the water entry velocity is 40 m s 50 m s 60 m s and 70 m s the maximum strain is 0 0231 0 07 0 165 and 0 2116 respectively the maximum strain at a speed of 50 m s without a buffer head cap is 0 1536 the maximum strain at a speed of 70 m s is 0 327 meanwhile the structure of the head shell is failure this shows that the buffer head cap better buffers the impact load of the vehicle fig 21 shows the variation of the peak coefficient of impact acceleration with the water entry velocity it can be seen from the figure that the peak coefficient of the impact acceleration at different velocities is basically a constant when the velocity is 40 m s 50 m s 60 m s and 70 m s the peak coefficient is 1 84 1 82 1 82 and 1 81 respectively the load reduction ratio is 42 5 42 2 40 9 and 40 3 respectively the calculation results show that the buffer performance of the head cap decreases slightly as the water entry velocity increases fig 22 is the impact pressure history of the characteristic unit of a buffer head cap with different water entry velocities and the pressure change of the characteristic unit when the vehicle without the head cap enters the water at a speed of 50 m s is also shown as a comparison the pulse width of the first peak and the time required to reach the secondary peak decreases with the increase of water entry velocities at the same time the peak pressure acted on the vehicle after the buffer is separated from the head of the vehicle is bigger when the velocity is 40 m s 50 m s 60 m s and 70 m s the second peak is 35 mpa 75 mpa 186 mpa and 205 mpa respectively which indicates that the water entry velocity has an important influence on the peak value of the impact pressure compared with the calculation results without the head cap the buffer head cap has better buffering ability at different velocities fig 23 is a stress history of the characteristic unit of the buffer head cap vehicle with different water entry velocities the figure also shows the stress variation of the characteristic unit when the vehicle without the head cap enters the water at a speed of 50 m s the change tendency of stress with water entering velocity is similar to the results of pressure but there are also differences when the vehicle with buffer head cap enters water at 60 m s and 70 m s the second stress peak is greater than that of the vehicle without buffer head cap and the pressure peak of the vehicle with the buffer head cap under the corresponding conditions is smaller than the pressure peak of the vehicle without the buffer head cap the stress reflects the dynamic response of the structure under external force which indicates that the water entry velocity has an important effect on the dynamic response of the structure therefore the buffer performance of the head cap should improve with the water entry velocity fig 24 is the deformation of the vehicle head shell structure at different water entry velocities it can be seen from the figure that the deformation of the vehicle shell structure increases with the water entry velocity when the water entry velocity is 40 m s 50 m s 60 m s and 70 m s the maximum deformation is 0 16 mm 1 54 mm 12 16 mm and 15 88 mm respectively the calculation results show that the deformation of the head shell structure can be neglected at the water entry velocity of 40 m s when the water entry velocity is 60 m s and 70 m s the deformation of the shell is much larger than the speed of 50 m s it indicates that the performance of the same buffer head cap is weaker when the water entry velocity is larger 4 4 effect of water entry angle a serial of auv water entry with different angles 60 70 80 90 mitigator simulations are carried out to study the effect of water entry angle on the mitigation performances the initial water entry velocity is 50 m s the buffer length are 100 mm the buffer density is 120 kg m3 fig 25 is the broken state of the buffer head cap at 1 5 ms after entering the water at different angles it can be seen from the figure that under the same conditions the cracking region of the nose cap decreases while the water entry angle increases that is the less likely to crack and the better buffering performance of the buffer head cap will have at the same time the asymmetry of the rupture range of the nose cap is more obvious at the smaller water entry angle the water entry angle changes the impact contact area of the nose cap so that the buffers at different angles have different buffering effects fig 26 shows the variation of the maximum equivalent plastic strain of the vehicle shell with the buffer head cap vehicle entering the water at different angles it can be seen from the figure that the maximum strain of the nose cap increases while the water entry angle decreases when the water entry angle is 60 70 80 and 90 the maximum strain is 0 1848 0 1218 0 0727 and 0 07 respectively this shows that the cushioning cap has different buffering effects when entering the water at different angles fig 27 is a figure showing the variation of the peak coefficient of the axial and normal impact acceleration when the vehicle with the buffer head cap entering the water at different angles it can be seen from the figure that the loading shedding rate of the axial and normal acceleration peak coefficient increases with the water entry angle when the water entry angle is 60 70 80 and 90 the axial load reduction ratio is 28 8 36 6 40 3 and 42 2 respectively the normal load reduction ratio is 27 8 28 4 29 5 and none respectively fig 28 is the impact pressure history of the characteristic unit of a buffer head cap with different water entry angles and the pressure change of the characteristic unit when the vehicle without the head cap enters the water at an angle of 90 is also shown as a comparison it can be seen from the figure that when the vehicle enters water at different angles the change law of the impact pressure is the same but the peak value of the pressure is slightly different for the second pressure peak when the water entry angle is 60 70 80 and 90 the peak value is 88 mpa 91 mpa 120 mpa and 127 mpa respectively fig 29 is a stress history of the characteristic unit of the buffer head cap vehicle with different water entry angles and the stress variation curve of the vehicle without the head cap when entering the water at an angle of 90 is also shown as a comparison it can be seen from the figure that the change tendency of stress when entering water at different angles is the same as the change of impact pressure but there are big differences between the two stress peaks for the first peak the peak stress increases with the decrease of water entry angles making the head cap shell more susceptible to cracking thus reducing the buffering performance of the head cap but for the secondary peak the corresponding stress peak decreases with the decrease of water entry angles the change characteristics of the stress better reflect the variation of the buffering performance of the head cap with the water entry angle fig 30 is the deformation configuration of the vehicle head shell structure at different water entry angles when the water entry angle is 60 70 80 and 90 the maximum deformation variable is 1 1 mm 1 18 mm 1 33 mm and 1 54 mm respectively at the same time it can be seen that the deformation of the nose cap is symmetrical with respect to the center when entering the water vertically and the deformation of the nose cap is asymmetrical when obliquely entering the water 5 conclusions in this paper a mitigator is designed to reduce the impact load of the auv entering the water this solved the problem of vehicle shell may fail when the impact load of the water impact is huge the buffering performance is numerically investigated by applying an explicit finite element method firstly the numerical calculations used in this paper were compared with the experimental and analytical results and the process of splashing vacuolar expansion and necking of the liquid surface during the process of water entry are simulated perfectly secondly we chose the computational domain and finally determined that the size of the air zone is 3000 500 2400 mm the size of the water zone is 3000 3000 2400 mm a convergence study was carried out to choose the mesh density the effect of the buffer length buffer density water entry velocity and water entry angle on mitigation properties was studied based on the numerical method in section 3 and we can draw the following conclusions 1 the calculation results show that the buffer head cap designed in this paper can better reduce the impact load acting on the vehicle the reason why the buffer head cap can reduce the load acting on the aircraft is mainly because the cushioning material of the buffer generates a large plastic deformation under the pressure and limits the transmitted pressure to the yield pressure of the material 2 the length of the buffer and the density of the buffering material have a great influence on the cushioning effect of the head cap the longer the length the cushioning effect is better but the longer one will need more times to separate from the vehicle therefore it needs to be designed according to actual needs 3 the water entry velocity and the water entry angle can affect the location and moment of the cracking of the buffer head cap which will result in different cushioning performance this conclusion will provide an engineering reference for the design of the high performance buffer head cap acknowledgments the work is financed by national natural science foundation of china grant no 51709229 51879220
